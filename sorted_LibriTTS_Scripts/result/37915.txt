7424-98598-0000	train-other-500	To all who love and relish the simple gospel of the grace of God I would earnestly recommend the following Notes on the Book of Genesis They are characterized by a deep toned evangelical spirit
none	none	 Having had the privilege of reading them in MS 
7424-98598-0001	train-other-500	I can speak as one who has found profit therefrom Man s complete ruin in sin and God s perfect remedy in Christ are fully clearly and often strikingly presented especially in the earlier chapters
7424-98598-0002	train-other-500	To Christ s servants in the gospel sound forcible statements as to what sin is and what grace is are deeply valuable in the present time when so much that is merely superficial is abroad
7424-98598-0003	train-other-500	The gospel of Christ as perfectly meeting man s nature condition and character is comparatively little known and less proclaimed Hence the numerous doubts fears and unsettled questions which fill the hearts
7424-98598-0004	train-other-500	and perplex the consciences of many of God s dear children Until the soul is led to see that the entire question of sin and the claims of divine holiness were all and forever settled on the cross
none	none	 sweet quiet rest of conscience will be but little known Nothing can meet the urgent cry of a troubled conscience 
7424-98598-0005	train-other-500	but the one perfect sacrifice of Christ offered to God for us on the cross For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us
7424-98598-0006	train-other-500	There and there alone it will find a perfect answer to its every claim because there it will find through believing all ground of doubt and fear removed the whole question of sin eternally settled
7424-98598-0007	train-other-500	every divine requirement fully met and a solid foundation laid for present settled peace in the presence of divine holiness Christ delivered for our offences and raised again for our justification
7424-98598-0008	train-other-500	settles every thing The moment we believe the gospel we are saved and ought to be divinely happy He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life
none	none	 Rom iv v John iii 
7424-98598-0009	train-other-500	We see the greatness of God s love to the sinner in his judgment of sin in the person of his own dear Son on the cross There God in perfect grace to us
7424-98598-0010	train-other-500	dealt with sin according to his infinite holiness and justice He went down to the depths of our ruin and all our sin measured it
none	none	 judged it and put it forever away root and branch 
7424-98598-0011	train-other-500	by shedding the precious blood of the spotless Victim He condemned sin in the flesh that is he there condemned the evil root of sin which is in our flesh our carnal nature
7424-98598-0012	train-other-500	But he also made an end of sins of the actual sins of every believer Thus between God and Christ alone the entire question of sin was gone into and finally settled on the cross
7424-98598-0013	train-other-500	Simon Peter said unto him Lord whither goest thou Jesus answered him Whither I go thou canst not follow me now
7424-98598-0014	train-other-500	Just as Abraham and Isaac were alone on the top of the mountain in the land of Moriah so were God and Christ alone amidst the solemnities and solitudes of Calvary The only part we had in the cross was
7424-98598-0015	train-other-500	that our sins were there Jesus alone bore the full weight of their judgment
none	none	 Comp Dan ix twenty four Rom viii three two Cor v twenty one Heb ix twenty six twenty eight 
7424-98598-0016	train-other-500	Whenever this blessed truth is learnt from God s own word and maintained in the soul by faith through the power of the Holy Ghost all is peace joy and victory
7424-98598-0017	train-other-500	It takes the believer completely away from himself from his doubts fears and questions And his eye now gazes on ONE who by his finished work has laid the foundation of divine and everlasting righteousness
7424-98598-0018	train-other-500	and who is now at the right hand of the Majesty in the highest as the perfect definition of every true believer With him with him alone the believer s heart is now to be occupied
7424-98598-0019	train-other-500	Faith is fully assured that when God puts away sin it must be put away entirely that when Jesus exclaimed IT IS FINISHED the work was done
7424-98598-0020	train-other-500	God was glorified the sinner saved the whole power of Satan completely destroyed and peace established on the most solid basis Hence we find The God of peace brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus
7424-98598-0021	train-other-500	that great Shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the everlasting covenant He was the God of judgment at the cross He is the God of peace at the opening grave Every enemy has been vanquished
7424-98598-0022	train-other-500	and eternal peace proclaimed through the blood of his cross He was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father He rose in the power of an endless life and associates every believer with himself
7424-98598-0023	train-other-500	in the power of that life in resurrection Having been cleansed by his blood they are accepted in his person

7424-98598-0024	train-other-500	Jesus having thus fully accomplished the work that was given him to do and gone up on high the Holy Ghost came down as a witness to us that redemption was finished the believer perfected forever
7424-98598-0025	train-other-500	and Christ glorified in heaven The apostles then began to publish the glad tidings of salvation to the chief of sinners The subject of their preaching was Jesus and the resurrection
7424-98598-0026	train-other-500	And all who believed on him as risen and glorified were immediately and eternally saved And this is the record that God hath given to us eternal life and this life is in his Son
7424-98598-0027	train-other-500	he that hath the Son hath life and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life

7424-98598-0030	train-other-500	When the eye is kept on this heavenly Christ all is light joy and peace but if it be turned in on self and occupied with what it finds there and what it feels
7424-98598-0031	train-other-500	or with any thing whatever that may come between the heart and Christ all will be darkness uncertainty and unhappiness in the soul Oh how blessedly simple is the gospel of the grace of God

7424-98598-0033	train-other-500	Christ having perfectly satisfied God about sin the only question now between God and your heart is this Are you perfectly satisfied with his Christ as the alone portion of your soul
7424-98598-0034	train-other-500	This is the one grand question of the gospel Christ has settled every other to the glory of God and now the Father is going to make a marriage for his Son to honor exalt and glorify him

refreshment of all those who are on their way to glory C H M Dublin May eighteen sixty one NOTES ON THE BOOK OF GENESIS CHAPTER I There is something peculiarly striking in the manner in which the Holy Ghost opens this sublime book He introduces us at once to God in the essential fulness of his being and the solitariness of his acting All prefatory matter is omitted It is to God we are brought We hear him as it were breaking earth s silence and shining in upon earth s darkness for the purpose of developing a sphere in which he might display his eternal power and Godhead There is nothing here on which idle curiosity may feed nothing on which the poor human mind may speculate There is the sublimity and reality of DIVINE TRUTH in its moral power to act on the heart and on the understanding It could never come within the range of the Spirit of God to gratify idle curiosity by the presentation of curious theories Geologists may explore the bowels of the earth and draw forth from thence materials from which to add to and in some instances to contradict the Divine record They may speculate upon fossil remains but the disciple hangs with sacred delight over the page of inspiration He reads believes and worships In this spirit may we pursue our study of the profound book which now lies open before us May we know what it is to inquire in the temple May our investigations of the precious contents of holy scripture be ever prosecuted in the true spirit of worship In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth The first sentence in the divine canon sets us in the presence of him who is the infinite source of all true blessedness There is no elaborate argument in proof of the existence of God The Holy Ghost could not enter upon any thing of the kind God reveals himself He makes himself known by his works The heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handy work All thy works shall praise thee O Lord Great and marvellous are thy works Lord God Almighty None but an infidel or an atheist would seek an argument in proof of the Being of One who by the word of his mouth called worlds into existence and declared himself the All wise the Almighty and the everlasting God Who but God could create any thing Lift up your eyes on high and behold who hath created these things that bringeth out their host by number he calleth them all by names by the greatness of his might for that he is strong in power not one faileth Is xl twenty six The gods of the heathen are idols but the Lord made the heavens In the Book of Job chap xxxviii xli we have an appeal of the very grandest description on the part of Jehovah himself to the work of creation as an unanswerable argument in proof of his infinite superiority and this appeal while it sets before the understanding the most vivid and convincing demonstration of God s omnipotence touches the heart also by its amazing condescension The majesty and the love the power and the tenderness are all divine And the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep Here was in good truth a scene in which God alone could act Man in the pride of his heart has since proved himself but too ready to interfere with God in other and far higher spheres of action but in the scene before us man had no place until indeed he became like all the rest the subject of creative power God was alone in creation He looked forth from his eternal dwelling place of light upon the wild waste and there beheld the sphere in which his wondrous plans and counsels were yet to be unfolded and brought out where the Second Person of the Eternal Trinity was yet to live and labor and testify and bleed and die in order to display in the view of wondering worlds the glorious perfections of the Godhead All was darkness and chaos but God is the God of light and order God is light and in him is no darkness at all Darkness and confusion cannot live in his presence whether we look at it in a physical moral intellectual or spiritual point of view The Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters He sat brooding over the scene of his future operations A dark scene truly and one in which there was ample room for the God of light and life to act He alone could enlighten the darkness cause life to spring up substitute order for chaos open an expanse between the waters where life might display itself without fear of death These were operations worthy of God God said Let there be light and there was light How simple And yet how Godlike He spake and it was done He commanded and it stood fast Infidelity may ask How where when The answer is By faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear Heb xi three This satisfies the teachable spirit Philosophy may smile contemptuously at this and pronounce it rude ignorance or blind credulity suitable enough for an age of semi barbarism but quite unworthy of men living in an enlightened age of the world s history when the museum and the telescope have put us in possession of facts of which the inspired penman knew nothing What wisdom What learning Yea rather what folly What nonsense What total inability to grasp the scope and design of sacred scripture It assuredly is not God s object to make us astronomers or geologists or to occupy us with details which the microscope or the telescope lays before every school boy His object is to lead us into his presence as worshippers with hearts and understandings taught and duly governed by his Holy Word But this would never do for the so called philosopher who despising what he terms the vulgar and narrow minded prejudices of the devout disciple of the Word boldly seizes his telescope and therewith scans the distant heavens or travels into the deep recesses of earth in search of strata formations and fossils all of which according to his account greatly improve if they do not flatly contradict the inspired narrative With such oppositions of science falsely so called we have nothing to do We believe that all true discoveries whether in the heavens above in the earth beneath or in the waters under the earth will harmonize with that which is written in the word of God and if they do not thus harmonize they are perfectly contemptible in the judgment of every true lover of scripture This gives great rest to the heart in a day like the present so productive of learned speculations and high sounding theories which alas in too many instances savor of rationalism and positive infidelity It is most needful to have the heart thoroughly established as to the fulness the authority the completeness the majesty the plenary inspiration of the sacred volume This will be found to be the only effectual safeguard against the rationalism of Germany and the superstition of Rome Accurate acquaintance with and profound subjection to the Word are the great desiderata of the present moment May the Lord in his great grace abundantly increase in our midst both the one and the other And God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness And God called the light Day and the darkness he called Night Here we have the two great symbols so largely employed throughout the Word The presence of light makes the day the absence thereof makes the night Thus it is in the history of souls There are the sons of light and the sons of darkness This is a most marked and solemn distinction All upon whom the light of Life has shone all who have been effectually visited by the Day spring from on high all who have received the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ all such whoever and wherever they may be belong to the first class are the sons of light and the sons of the day On the other hand all who are still in nature s darkness nature s blindness nature s unbelief all who have not yet received into their hearts by faith the cheering beams of the Sun of righteousness all such are still wrapped in the shades of spiritual night are the sons of darkness the sons of the night Reader pause and ask yourself in the presence of the Searcher of hearts to which of these two classes do you at this moment belong That you belong to either the one or the other is beyond all question You may be poor despised unlettered but if through grace there is a link connecting you with the Son of God the Light of the world then you are in very deed a son of the day and destined ere long to shine in that celestial sphere that region of glory of which the slain Lamb will be the central sun forever This is not your own doing It is the result of the counsel and operation of God himself who has given you light and life joy and peace in Jesus and his accomplished sacrifice But if you are a total stranger to the hallowed action and influence of divine light if your eyes have not been opened to behold any beauty in the Son of God then though you had all the learning of a Newton though you were enriched with all the treasures of human philosophy though you had drunk in with avidity all the streams of human science though your name were adorned with all the learned titles which the schools and universities of this world could bestow yet are you a son of the night a son of darkness and if you die in your present condition you will be involved in the blackness and horror of an eternal night Do not therefore my friend read another page until you have fully satisfied yourself as to whether you belong to the day or the night The next point on which I would dwell is the creation of lights And God said Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth and it was so And God made two great lights the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night he made the stars also The sun is the great centre of light and the centre of our system Round him the lesser orbs revolve From him too they derive their light Hence he may very legitimately be viewed as an apt symbol of Him who is soon to arise with healing in His wings to gladden the hearts of those that fear the Lord The aptness and beauty of the symbol would fully appear to one who having spent the night in watching beholds the rising sun gilding with his bright beams the eastern sky The mists and shades of night are all dispersed and the whole creation seems to hail the returning orb of light Thus will it be by and by when the Sun of righteousness arises The shadows of night shall flee away and the whole creation shall be gladdened by the dawning of a morning without clouds the opening of a bright and never ending day of glory The moon being in herself opaque derives all her light from the sun She always reflects the sun s light save when earth and its influences intervene one No sooner has the sun sunk beneath our horizon than the moon presents herself to receive his beams and reflect them back upon a dark world or should she be visible during the day she always exhibits a pale light the necessary result of appearing in the presence of superior brightness True it is as has been remarked the world sometimes intervenes dark clouds thick mists and chilling vapors too arise from earth s surface and hide from our view her silvery light Now as the sun is a beautiful and an appropriate symbol of Christ so the moon strikingly reminds us of the Church The fountain of her light is hidden from view The world seeth him not but she sees him and she is responsible to reflect his beams upon a benighted world The world has no other way in which to learn any thing of Christ but by the Church Ye says the inspired apostle are our epistle known and read of all men And again Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ two Cor iii two three What a responsible place How earnestly should she watch against every thing that would hinder the reflection of the heavenly light of Christ in all her ways But how is she to reflect this light By allowing it to shine upon her in its undimmed brightness If the Church only walked in the light of Christ she would assuredly reflect his light and this would ever keep her in her proper position The light of the moon is not her own So it is with the Church She is not called to set herself before the world She is a simple debtor to reflect the light which she herself receives She is bound to study with holy diligence the path which he trod while down here and by the energy of the Holy Ghost who dwells in her to follow in that path But alas earth with its mists its clouds and its vapors intervenes and hides the light and blots the epistle The world can see but little of the traits of Christ s character in those who call themselves by his name yea in many instances they exhibit an humbling contrast rather than a resemblance May we study Christ more prayerfully that so we may copy him more faithfully The stars are distant lights They shine in other spheres and have little connection with this system save that their twinkling can be seen One star differeth from another star in glory Thus will it be in the coming kingdom of the Son He will shine forth in living and everlasting lustre His body the Church will faithfully reflect his beams on all around while the saints individually shall shine in those spheres which a righteous Judge shall allot to them as a reward of faithful service during the dark night of his absence This thought should animate us to a more ardent and vigorous pursuit after conformity to our absent Lord See Luke xix twelve nineteen The lower orders of creation are next introduced The sea and the earth are made to teem with life Some may feel warranted in regarding the operations of each successive day as foreshadowing the various dispensations and their great characteristic principles of action I would only remark as to this that there is great need when handling the word in this way to watch with holy jealousy the working of imagination and also to pay strict attention to the general analogy of scripture else we may make sad mistakes I do not feel at liberty to enter upon such a line of interpretation I shall therefore confine myself to what I believe to be the plain sense of the sacred text We shall now consider man s place as set over the works of God s hands All having been set in order one was needed to take the headship And God said Let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth So God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them And God blessed them and God said unto them Be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth My reader will observe the change from him to them We are not presented with the actual fact of the formation of the woman until the next chapter though here we find God blessing them and giving them jointly the place of universal government All the inferior orders of creation were set under their joint dominion Eve received all her blessings in Adam In him too she got her dignity Though not yet called into actual existence she was in the purpose of God looked at as part of the man In thy book were all my members written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them Thus it is with the Church the bride of the Second Man She was viewed from all eternity in Christ her Head and Lord as we read in the first chapter of Ephesians According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love Before a single member of the Church had yet breathed the breath of life all were in God s eternal mind predestinated to be conformed to the image of his Son The counsels of God render the Church necessary to complete the mystic man Hence the Church is called the fulness Greek pleroma of him that filleth all in all This is an amazing title and it develops much of the dignity importance and glory of the Church It is too common to view redemption as bearing merely upon the blessedness and security of individual souls This is entirely too low a view to take of the matter That all which pertains in any way to the individual is in the fullest manner secured is blessed be God most true This is the least part of redemption But that Christ s glory is involved in and connected with the Church s existence is a truth of far more dignity depth and power If I am entitled on the authority of Holy Scripture to regard myself as a constituent part of that which is actually needful to Christ I can no longer entertain a doubt as to whether there is the fullest provision for all my personal necessities And is not the Church thus needful to Christ Yes truly It is not good that the man should be alone I will make him an help meet for him And again For the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man neither was the man created for the woman but the woman for the man Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman neither the woman without the man in the Lord For as the woman is of the man even so is the man also by the woman but all things of God one Cor xi eight twelve Hence it is no longer the mere question whether God can save a poor helpless sinner whether he can blot out his sins and receive him in the power of divine righteousness God has said it is not good that the man should be alone He left not the first man without an help meet neither would he leave the Second As in the case of the former there would have been a blank in the creation without Eve so stupendous thought in the case of the latter there would be a blank in the new creation without the bride the Church Let us now look at the manner in which Eve was brought into being though in so doing we shall have to anticipate part of the contents of the next chapter Throughout all the orders of creation there was not found an help meet for Adam A deep sleep must fall on him and a partner be formed out of himself to share his dominion and his blessedness And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof And the rib which the Lord God had taken from man builded two he a woman and brought her unto the man And Adam said This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called Woman because she was taken out of man Chap ii twenty one twenty three Looking at Adam and Eve as a type of Christ and the Church as scripture fully warrants us to do we see how that the death of Christ needed to be an accomplished fact ere the Church could be set up though in the purpose of God she was looked at and chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world There is however a vast difference between the secret purpose of God and the revelation and accomplishment thereof Before the divine purpose could be actualized in reference to the constituent parts of the Church it was necessary that the Son should be rejected and crucified that he should take his seat on high that he should send down the Holy Ghost to baptize believers into one body It is not that souls were not quickened and saved previous to the death of Christ They assuredly were Adam was saved and thousands of others from age to age in virtue of the sacrifice of Christ though that sacrifice was not yet accomplished But the salvation of individual souls is one thing and the formation of the Church as a distinctive thing by the Holy Ghost is quite another This distinction is not sufficiently attended to and even where it is in theory maintained it is accompanied with but little of those practical results which might naturally be expected to flow from a truth so stupendous The Church s unique place her special relationship to the Second Man the Lord from heaven her distinctive privileges and dignities all these things would if entered into by the power of the Holy Ghost produce the richest the rarest and the most fragrant fruits See Eph v twenty three thirty two When we look at the type before us we may form some idea of the results which ought to follow from the understanding of the Church s position and relationship What affection did not Eve owe to Adam What nearness she enjoyed What intimacy of communion What full participation in all his thoughts In all his dignity and in all his glory she was entirely one He did not rule over but with her He was Lord of the whole creation and she was one with him Yea as has already been remarked she was looked at and blessed in him The man was the object and as to the woman she was needful to him and therefore she was brought into being Nothing can be more profoundly interesting as a type Man first set up and the woman viewed in and then formed out of him all this forms a type of the most striking and instructive character Not that a doctrine can ever be founded upon a type but when we find the doctrine fully and clearly laid down in other parts of the Word we are then prepared to understand appreciate and admire the type The eighth Psalm furnishes a fine view of man set over the work of God s hands when I consider thy heavens the work of thy fingers the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained what is man that thou art mindful of him and the son of man that thou visitest him For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels and hast crowned him with glory and honor Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands thou hast put all things under his feet all sheep and oxen yea and the beasts of the field the fowl of the air and the fish of the sea and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the sea Here man is looked at without any distinctive mention of the woman and this is quite in character for the woman is looked at in the man There is no direct revelation of the mystery of the Church in any part of the Old Testament The apostle expressly says in other ages it was not made known to the sons of men as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets of the New Testament by the Spirit Eph iii one eleven Hence in the Psalm just quoted we have only the man presented to us but we know that the man and the woman are looked at under one head All this will find its full antitype in the ages to come Then shall the True Man the Lord from heaven take his seat on the throne and in companionship with his bride the Church rule over a restored creation This Church is quickened out of the grave of Christ is part of his body of his flesh and of his bones He the Head and she the body making one Man as we read in the fourth chapter of Ephesians Till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ The Church being thus part of Christ will occupy a place in the glory quite unique There was no other creature so near to Adam as Eve because no other creature was part of himself So in reference to the Church she will hold the very nearest place to Christ in his coming glory Nor is it merely what the church will be that commands our admiration but what the Church is She is now the body of which Christ is the Head she is now the temple of which God is the Inhabitant Oh what manner of people ought we to be If such is the present such the future dignity of that of which we through God s grace form a part surely a holy a devoted a separated an elevated walk is what becomes us May the Holy Ghost unfold these things more fully and powerfully to our hearts that so we may have a deeper sense of the conduct and character which are worthy of the high vocation wherewith we are called The eyes of your understanding being enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to usward who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the Church which is his body the fulness of him that filleth all in all Eph i eighteen twenty three FOOTNOTES one It is an interesting fact that the moon as viewed through a powerful telescope presents the appearance of one vast ruin of nature two The Hebrew word which is rendered builded in the margin is Hebrew vayyven which the LXX render by Greek okodomesen A reference to the original of Eph ii twenty twenty two will show the reader that the words rendered built and builded together are inflections of the same verb CHAPTER II This chapter introduces to our notice two prominent subjects namely the seventh day and the river The first of these demands special attention There are few subjects on which so much misunderstanding and contradiction prevails as the doctrine of the Sabbath Not that there is the slightest foundation for either the one or the other for the whole subject is laid down in the Word in the simplest possible manner The distinct commandment to keep holy the Sabbath day will come before us the Lord permitting in our meditations on the book of Exodus In the chapter now before us there is no command given to man whatever but simply the record that God rested on the seventh day Thus the heavens and the earth were finished and all the host of them And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made There is no commandment given to man here We are simply told that God enjoyed his rest because all was done so far as the mere creation was concerned There was nothing more to be done and therefore the One who had during six days been working ceased to work and enjoyed his rest All was complete all was very good all was just as he himself had made it and he rested in it The morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy The work of creation was ended and God was celebrating a sabbath And be it observed that this is the true character of a sabbath This is the only sabbath which God ever celebrated so far as the inspired record instructs us After this we read of God s commanding man to keep the sabbath and man utterly failing so to do but we never read again the words God rested on the contrary the word is My Father worketh hitherto and I work John v seventeen The sabbath in the strict and proper sense of the term could only be celebrated when there really was nothing to be done It could only be celebrated amid an undefiled creation a creation on which no spot of sin could be discerned God can have no rest where there is sin and one has only to look around him in order to learn the total impossibility of God s enjoying a rest in creation now The thorn and the thistle together with the ten thousand other melancholy and humiliating fruits of a groaning creation rise before us and declare that God must be at work and not at rest Could God rest in the midst of thorns and briers Could he rest amid the sighs and tears the groans and sorrows the sickness and death the degradation and guilt of a ruined world Could God sit down as it were and celebrate a sabbath in the midst of such circumstances Whatever answer may be given to these questions the word of God teaches us that God has had no sabbath as yet save the one which the twod of Genesis records The seventh day and none other was the sabbath It showed forth the completeness of creation work but creation work is marred and the seventh day rest interrupted and thus from the fall to the incarnation God was working from the incarnation to the cross God the Son was working and from Pentecost until now God the Holy Ghost has been working Assuredly Christ had no sabbath when he was upon this earth True he finished his work blessedly gloriously finished it but where did he spend the Sabbath day In the tomb Yes my reader the Lord Christ God manifest in the flesh the Lord of the Sabbath the maker and sustainer of heaven and earth spent the seventh day in the dark and silent tomb Has this no voice for us Does it convey no teaching Could the Son of God lie in the grave on the seventh day if that day were to be spent in rest and peace and in the full sense that nothing remained to be done Impossible We want no further proof of the impossibility of celebrating a sabbath than that which is afforded at the grave of Jesus We may stand beside that grave amazed to find it occupied by such an one on the seventh day but oh the reason is obvious Man is a fallen ruined guilty creature His long career of guilt has ended in crucifying the Lord of glory and not only crucifying him but placing a great stone at the mouth of the tomb to prevent if possible his leaving it And what was man doing while the Son of God was in the grave He was observing the Sabbath day What a thought Christ in his grave to repair a broken sabbath and yet man attempting to keep the sabbath as though it were not broken at all It was man s sabbath and not God s It was a sabbath without Christ an empty powerless worthless because Christless and Godless form But some will say the day has been changed while all the principles belonging to it remain the same I do not believe that scripture furnishes any foundation for such an idea Where is the divine warrant for such a statement Surely if there is scripture authority nothing can be easier than to produce it But the fact is there is none on the contrary the distinction is most fully maintained in the New Testament Take one remarkable passage in proof In the end of the Sabbath as it began to dawn towards the first day of the week Matt xxviii one There is evidently no mention here of the seventh day being changed to the first day nor yet of any transfer of the Sabbath from the one to the other The first day of the week is not the Sabbath changed but altogether a new day It is the first day of a new period and not the last day of an old The seventh day stands connected with earth and earthly rest the first day of the week on the contrary introduces us to heaven and heavenly rest This makes a vast difference in the principle and when we look at the matter in a practical point of view the difference is most material If I celebrate the seventh day it marks me as an earthly man inasmuch as that day is clearly the rest of earth creation rest but if I am taught by the Word and Spirit of God to understand the meaning of the first day of the week I shall at once apprehend its immediate connection with that new and heavenly order of things of which the death and resurrection of Christ form the everlasting foundation The seventh day appertained to Israel and to earth The first day of the week appertains to the Church and to heaven Further Israel was commanded to observe the sabbath day the Church is privileged to enjoy the first day of the week The former was the test of Israel s moral condition the latter is the significant proof of the Church s eternal acceptance That made manifest what Israel could do for God this perfectly declares what God has done for us It is quite impossible to over estimate the value and importance of the Lord s day Greek he kyriake hemera as the first day of the week is termed in the first chapter of the Apocalypse Being the day on which Christ rose from the dead it sets forth not the completion of creation but the full and glorious triumph of redemption Nor should we regard the celebration of the first day of the week as a matter of bondage or as a yoke put on the neck of a Christian It is his delight to celebrate that happy day Hence we find that the first day of the week was pre eminently the day on which the early Christians came together to break bread and at that period of the Church s history the distinction between the sabbath and the first day of the week was fully maintained The Jews celebrated the former by assembling in their synagogues to read the law and the prophets the Christians celebrated the latter by assembling to break bread There is not so much as a single passage of scripture in which the first day of the week is called the sabbath day whereas there is the most abundant proof of their entire distinctness Why therefore contend for that which has no foundation in the Word Love honor and celebrate the Lord s day as much as possible seek like the apostle to be in the Spirit thereon let your retirement from secular matters be as profound as ever you can make it but while you do all this call it by its proper name give it its proper place understand its proper principles attach to it its proper characteristics and above all do not bind down the Christian as with an iron rule to observe the seventh day when it is his high and holy privilege to observe the first Do not bring him down from heaven where he can rest to a cursed and bloodstained earth where he cannot Do not ask him to keep a day which his Master spent in the tomb instead of that blessed day on which he left it See carefully Matt xxviii one six Mark xvi one two Luke xxiv one John xx one nineteen twenty six Acts xx seven one Cor xvi two reverend i ten Acts xiii fourteen xvii two colonel ii sixteen But let it not be supposed that we lose sight of the important fact that the sabbath will again be celebrated in the land of Israel and over the whole creation It assuredly will There remaineth a rest Greek sabbatismos for the people of God Heb iv nine When the Son of Abraham Son of David and Son of Man shall assume his position of government over the whole earth there will be a glorious sabbath a rest which sin shall never interrupt But now he is rejected and all who know and love him are called to take their place with him in his rejection they are called to go forth to him without the camp bearing his reproach Heb xiii thirteen If earth could keep a sabbath there would be no reproach but the very fact of the professing church s seeking to make the first day of the week the sabbath reveals a deep principle It is but the effort to get back to an earthly standing and to an earthly code of morals Many may not see this Many true Christians may most conscientiously observe the sabbath day as such and we are bound to honor their consciences though we are perfectly warranted in asking them to furnish a scriptural basis for their conscientious convictions We would not stumble or wound their conscience but we would seek to instruct it However we are not now occupied with conscience or its convictions but only with the principle which lies at the root of what may be termed the sabbath question and I would only put the question to the Christian reader which is more consonant with the entire scope and spirit of the New Testament the celebration of the seventh day or sabbath or the celebration of the first day of the week or the Lord s day three We shall now consider the connection between the sabbath and the river flowing out of Eden There is much interest in this It is the first notice we get of the river of God which is here introduced in connection with God s rest When God was resting in his works the whole world felt the blessing and refreshment thereof It was impossible for God to keep a sabbath and earth not to feel its sacred influence But alas the streams which flowed forth from Eden the scene of earthly rest were speedily interrupted because the rest of creation was marred by sin Yet blessed be God sin did not put a stop to his activities but only gave them a new sphere and wherever he is seen acting the river is seen flowing Thus when we find him with a strong hand and an outstretched arm conducting his ransomed hosts across the sterile sand of the desert there we see the stream flowing forth not from Eden but from the smitten Rock apt and beautiful expression of the ground on which sovereign grace ministers to the need of sinners This was redemption and not merely creation That rock was Christ Christ smitten to meet his people s need The smitten Rock was connected with Jehovah s place in the tabernacle and truly there was moral beauty in the connection God dwelling in curtains and Israel drinking from a smitten rock had a voice for every opened ear and a deep lesson for every circumcised heart Exod xvii six Passing onward in the history of God s ways we find the river flowing in another channel In the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying If any man thirst let him come unto me and drink He that believeth on me as the Scripture hath said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water John vii thirty seven thirty eight Here then we find the river emanating from another source and flowing through another channel though in one sense the source of the river was ever the same being God himself but then it was God known in a new relationship and upon a new principle Thus in the passage just quoted the Lord Jesus was taking his place in spirit outside of the whole existing order of things and presenting himself as the source of the river of living water of which river the person of the believer was to be the channel Eden of old was constituted a debtor to the whole earth to send forth the fertilizing streams And in the desert the rock when smitten became a debtor to Israel s thirsty hosts Just so now every one who believes in Jesus is a debtor to the scene around him to allow the streams of refreshment to flow forth from him The Christian should regard himself as the channel through which the manifold grace of Christ may flow out to a needy world and the more freely he communicates the more freely will he receive for there is that scattereth and yet increaseth and there is that withholdeth more than is meet and it tendeth to poverty This places the believer in a place of sweetest privileges and at the same time of the most solemn responsibility He is called to be the constant witness and exhibiter of the grace of him on whom he believes Now the more he enters into the privilege the more will he answer the responsibility If he is habitually feeding upon Christ he cannot avoid exhibiting him The more the Holy Spirit keeps the Christian s eye fixed on Jesus the more will his heart be occupied with his adorable Person and his life and character bear unequivocal testimony to his grace Faith is at once the power of ministry the power of testimony and the power of worship If we are not living by the faith of the Son of God who loved us and gave himself for us we shall neither be effectual servants faithful witnesses nor true worshippers We may be doing a great deal but it will not be service to Christ We may be saying a great deal but it will not be testimony for Christ We may exhibit a great deal of piety and devotion but it will not be spiritual and true worship Finally we have the river of God presented to us in the last chapter of the Apocalypse four And he showed me a pure river of water of life clear as crystal proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb There is a river the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God the holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High This is the last place in which we find the river Its source can never again be touched its channel never again interrupted The throne of God is expressive of eternal stability and the presence of the Lamb marks it as based upon the immediate ground of accomplished redemption It is not God s throne in creation nor in providence but in redemption When I see the Lamb I know its connection with me as a sinner The throne of God as such would but deter me but when God reveals himself in the Person of the Lamb the heart is attracted and the conscience tranquillized The blood of the Lamb cleanses the conscience from every speck and stain of sin and sets it in perfect freedom in the presence of a holiness which cannot tolerate sin In the cross all the claims of divine holiness were perfectly answered so that the more I understand the latter the more I appreciate the former The higher our estimate of holiness the higher will be our estimate of the work of the cross Grace reigns through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord Hence the Psalmist calls on the saints to give thanks at the remembrance of God s holiness This is a precious fruit of a perfect redemption Before ever a sinner can give thanks at the remembrance of God s holiness he must look at it by faith from the resurrection side of the cross Having thus traced the river from Genesis to Revelation we shall briefly look at Adam s position in Eden We have seen him as a type of Christ but he is not merely to be viewed typically but personally not merely as absolutely shadowing forth the second man the Lord from heaven but also as standing in the place of personal responsibility In the midst of the fair scene of creation the Lord God set up a testimony and this testimony was also a test for the creature It spoke of death in the midst of life In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die Strange solemn sound Yet it was a needed sound Adam s life was suspended upon his strict obedience The link which connected him with the Lord God five was obedience based on implicit confidence in the One who had set him in his position of dignity confidence in his truth confidence in his love He could obey only while he confided We shall see the truth and force of this more fully when we come to examine the next chapter I would here suggest to my reader the remarkable contrast between the testimony set up in Eden and that which is set up now Then when all around was life God spoke of death now on the contrary when all around is death God speaks of life then the word was in the day thou eatest thou shalt die now the word is believe and live And as in Eden the enemy sought to make void God s testimony as to the result of eating the fruit so now he seeks to make void God s testimony as to the result of believing the gospel God had said In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die But the serpent said Ye shall not surely die And now when God s word plainly declares that he that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life John iii thirty six the same serpent seeks to persuade people that they have not everlasting life nor should they presume to think of such a thing until they have first done felt and experienced all manner of things My beloved reader if you have not yet heartily believed the divine record let me beseech you to allow the voice of the Lord to prevail above the hiss of the serpent He that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto life John v twenty four FOOTNOTES three This subject will if the Lord permit come before us again in the twentieth chapter of Exodus but I would here observe that very much of the offence and misunderstanding connected with the important subject of the sabbath may be justly traced to the inconsiderate and injudicious conduct of some who in their zeal for what they termed Christian liberty in reference to the sabbath rather lose sight of the claims of honest consciences and also of the place which the Lord s day occupies in the New Testament Some have been known to enter on their weekly avocations simply to show their liberty and thus they caused much needless offence Such acting could never have been suggested by the Spirit of Christ If I am ever so clear and free in my own mind I should respect the consciences of my brethren and moreover I do not believe that those who so carry themselves really understand the true and precious privileges connected with the Lord s day We should only be too thankful to be rid of all secular occupation and distraction to think of having recourse to them for the purpose of showing our liberty The good providence of our God has so arranged for his people throughout the British Empire that they can without pecuniary loss enjoy the rest of the Lord s day inasmuch as all are obliged to abstain from business This must be regarded by every well regulated mind as a mercy for if it were not thus ordered we know how man s covetous heart would if possible rob the Christian of the sweet privilege of attending the assembly on the Lord s day And who can tell what would be the deadening effect of uninterrupted engagement with this world s traffic Those Christians who from Monday morning to Saturday night breathe the dense atmosphere of the mart the market and the manufactory can form some idea of it It cannot be regarded as a good sign to find men introducing measures for the public profanation of the Lord s day It assuredly marks the progress of infidelity and French influence But there are some who teach that the expression Greek he kyriake hemera which is rightly enough translated the Lord s day refers to the day of the Lord and that the exiled apostle found himself carried forward as it were into the Spirit of the day of the Lord I do not believe the original would bear such an interpretation and besides we have in one Thess v two and two Peter iii ten the exact words the day of the Lord the original of which is quite different from the expression above referred to being not Greek he kyriake hemera but Greek he hemera kyriou This entirely settles the matter so far as the mere criticism is concerned and as to interpretation it is plain that by far the greater portion of the Apocalypse is occupied not with the day of the Lord but with events prior thereto four Compare also Ezekiel xlvii one twelve and Zech xiv eight five My reader will observe the change in the second chapter from the expression God to Lord God There is much importance in the distinction When God is seen acting in relation with man he takes the title Lord God Jehovah Elohim but until man appears on the scene the word Lord is not used I shall just point out three out of many passages in which the distinction is very strikingly presented And they that went in went in male and female of all flesh as God Elohim had commanded him and the Lord Jehovah shut him in general vii sixteen Elohim was going to destroy the world which he had made but Jehovah took care of the man with whom he stood in relation Again that all the earth may know that there is a God Elohim in Israel And all this assembly shall know that the Lord Jehovah saveth c one Sam xvii forty six forty seven All the earth was to recognise the presence of Elohim but Israel was called to recognise the actings of Jehovah with whom they stood in relation Lastly Jehoshaphat cried out and the Lord Jehovah helped him and God Elohim moved them to depart from him two Chron xviii thirty one Jehovah took care of his poor erring servant but Elohim though unknown acted upon the hearts of the uncircumcised Syrians CHAPTER III This section of our book sets before us the breaking up of the whole scene on which we have been dwelling It abounds in very weighty principles and has very justly been in all ages resorted to as a most fruitful theme for those who desired to set forth the truth as to man s ruin and God s remedy The serpent enters with a bold question as to divine revelation terrible model and forerunner of all infidel questions since raised by those who have alas too faithfully served the serpent s cause in the world questions which are only to be met by the supreme authority and divine majesty of Holy Scripture Yea hath God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden This was Satan s crafty inquiry and had the word of God been dwelling richly in Eve s heart her answer might have been direct simple and conclusive The true way in which to meet Satan s questions and suggestions is to treat them as his and repel them by the word To let them near the heart for a moment is to lose the only power by which to answer them The devil did not openly present himself and say I am the devil the enemy of God and I am come to traduce him and ruin you This would not be serpent like and yet he really did all this by raising questions in the mind of the creature To admit the question hath God said when I know that God has spoken is positive infidelity and the very fact of my admitting it proves my total incapacity to meet it Hence in Eve s case the form of her reply evidenced the fact that she had admitted to her heart the serpent s crafty inquiry Instead of adhering strictly to the exact words of God she in her reply actually adds thereto Now either to add to or take from God s word proves very clearly that his word is not dwelling in my heart or governing my conscience If a man is finding his enjoyment in obedience if it is his meat and his drink if he is living by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of Jehovah he will assuredly be acquainted with and fully alive to his word He could not be indifferent to it The Lord Jesus in his conflict with Satan accurately applied the word because he lived upon it and esteemed it more than his necessary food He could not misquote or misapply the word neither could he be indifferent about it Not so Eve She added to what God had said His command was simple enough Thou shalt not eat of it To this Eve adds her own words neither shall ye touch it These were Eve s words and not God s He had said nothing about touching so that whether her misquotation proceeded from ignorance or indifference or a desire to represent God in an arbitrary light or from all three together it is plain that she was entirely off the true ground of simple confidence in and subjection to God s holy word By the words of thy mouth I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer Nothing can possess more commanding interest than the way in which the word is everywhere put forward throughout the sacred canon together with the immense importance of strict obedience thereto Obedience is due from us to God s word simply because it is his word To raise a question when he has spoken is blasphemy We are in the place of the creature He is the Creator He may therefore justly claim obedience from us The infidel may call this blind obedience but the Christian calls it intelligent obedience inasmuch as it is based upon the knowledge that it is God s word to which he is obedient If a man had not God s word he might well be said to be in blindness and darkness for there is not so much as a single ray of divine light within or around us but what emanates from God s pure and eternal word All that we want to know is that God has spoken and then obedience becomes the very highest order of intelligent acting When the soul gets up to God it has reached the very highest source of authority No man nor body of men can claim obedience to their word because it is theirs and hence the claims of the Church of Rome are arrogant and impious In her claiming obedience she usurps the prerogative of God and all who yield it rob God of his right She presumes to place herself between God and the conscience and who can do this with impunity When God speaks man is bound to obey Happy is he if he does so Woe be to him if he does not Infidelity may question if God has spoken superstition may place human authority between my conscience and what God has spoken by both alike I am effectually robbed of the word and as a consequence of the deep blessedness of obedience There is a blessing in every act of obedience but the moment the soul hesitates the enemy has the advantage and he will assuredly use it to thrust the soul farther and farther from God Thus in the chapter before us the question Hath God said was followed by Ye shall not surely die That is to say there was first the question raised as to whether God had spoken and then followed the open contradiction of what God had said This solemn fact is abundantly sufficient to show how dangerous it is to admit near the heart a question as to divine revelation in its fulness and integrity A refined rationalism is very near akin to bold infidelity and the infidelity that dares to judge God s Word is not far from the atheism that denies his existence Eve would never have stood by to hear God contradicted if she had not previously fallen into looseness and indifference as to his word She too had her Phases of Faith or to speak more correctly her phases of infidelity she suffered God to be contradicted by a creature simply because his word had lost its proper authority over her heart her conscience and her understanding This furnishes a most solemn warning to all who are in danger of being ensnared by an unhallowed rationalism There is no true security save in a profound faith in the plenary inspiration and supreme authority of ALL SCRIPTURE The soul that is endowed with this has a triumphant answer to every objector whether he issue from Rome or Germany There is nothing new under the sun The self same evil which is now corrupting the very springs of religious thought and feeling throughout the fairest portion of the continent of Europe was that which laid Eve s heart in ruins in the garden of Eden The first step in her downward course was her hearkening to the question Hath God said And then onward she went from stage to stage until at length she bowed before the serpent and owned him as her god and the fountain of truth Yes my reader the serpent displaced God and the serpent s lie God s truth Thus it was with fallen man and thus it is with fallen man s posterity God s word has no place in the heart of the unregenerated man but the lie of the serpent has Let the formation of man s heart be examined and it will be found that there is a place therein for Satan s lie but none whatever for the truth of God Hence the force of the word to Nicodemus Ye must be born again But it is important to observe the mode in which the serpent sought to shake Eve s confidence in God s truth and thus bring her under the power of infidel reason It was by shaking her confidence in God s love He sought to shake her confidence in what God had said by showing that the testimony was not founded in love For said he God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as gods knowing good and evil Ver five In other words There is positive advantage connected with the eating of that fruit of which God is seeking to deprive you why therefore should you believe God s testimony you cannot place confidence in one who manifestly does not love you for if he loved you why should he prohibit your enjoying a positive privilege Eve s security against the influence of all this reasoning would have been simple repose in the infinite goodness of God She should have said to the serpent I have the fullest confidence in God s goodness and therefore I deem it impossible that he could withhold any real good from me If that fruit were good for me I should surely have it but the fact of its being forbidden by God proves that I would be no better but much worse off by the eating of it I am convinced of God s love and I am convinced of God s truth and I believe too that you are an evil one come to draw my heart away from the fountain of goodness and truth Get thee behind me Satan This would have been a noble reply But it was not given Her confidence in truth and love gave way and all was lost and so we find that there is just as little place in the heart of fallen man for God s love as there is for God s truth The heart of man is a stranger to both the one and the other until renewed by the power of the Holy Ghost Now it is deeply interesting to turn from Satan s lie in reference to the truth and love of God to the mission of the Lord Jesus Christ who came from the bosom of the Father in order to reveal what he really is Grace and truth the very things which man lost in his fall came by Jesus Christ John i seventeen He was the faithful witness of what God was reverend i five Truth reveals God as he is but this truth is connected with the revelation of perfect grace and thus the sinner finds to his unspeakable joy that the revelation of what God is instead of being his destruction becomes the basis of his eternal salvation This is life eternal that they might know thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent John xvii three I cannot know God and not have life The loss of the knowledge of God was death but the knowledge of God is life This necessarily makes life a thing entirely outside of ourselves and dependent upon what God is Let me arrive at what amount of self knowledge I may it is not said that this is life eternal to know themselves though no doubt the knowledge of God and the knowledge of self will go very much together still eternal life is connected with the former and not with the latter To know God as he is is life and all who know not God shall be punished with everlasting destruction from his presence It is of the utmost importance to see that what really stamps man s character and condition is his ignorance or knowledge of God This it is that marks his character here and fixes his destiny hereafter Is he evil in his thoughts evil in his words evil in his actions It is all the result of his being ignorant of God On the other hand is he pure in thought holy in conversation gracious in action It is but the practical result of his knowledge of God So also as to the future To know God is the solid ground of endless bliss everlasting glory To know him not is everlasting destruction Thus the knowledge of God is every thing It quickens the soul purifies the heart tranquillizes the conscience elevates the affections sanctifies the entire character and conduct Need we wonder therefore that Satan s grand design was to rob the creature of the true knowledge of the only true God He misrepresented the blessed God he said he was not kind This was the secret spring of all the mischief It matters not what shape sin has since taken it matters not through what channel it has flowed under what head it has ranged itself or in what garb it has clothed itself it is all to be traced to this one thing namely ignorance of God The most refined and cultivated moralist the most devout religionist the most benevolent philanthropist if ignorant of God is as far from life and true holiness as the publican and the harlot The prodigal was just as much a sinner and as positively away from the Father when he had crossed the threshold as when he was feeding swine in the far country Luke xv thirteen fifteen So in Eve s case The moment she took herself out of the hands of God out of the position of absolute dependence upon and subjection to his word she abandoned herself to the government of sense as used of Satan for her entire overthrow The sixth verse presents three things namely the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life which three as the apostle states comprehend all that is in the world These things necessarily took the lead when God was shut out If I do not abide in the happy assurance of God s love and truth his grace and faithfulness I shall surrender myself to the government of some one or it may be all of the above principles and this is only another name for the government of Satan There is strictly speaking no such thing as man s free will If man be self governed he is really governed by Satan and if not he is governed by God Now the three great agencies by which Satan works are the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life Those were the things presented by Satan to the Lord Jesus in the temptation He began by tempting the Second Man to take himself out of the position of absolute dependence upon God Command these stones that they be made bread He asked him to do this not as in the case of the first man to make himself what he was not but to prove what he was Then followed the offer of the kingdoms of the world with all their glory And finally conducting him to a pinnacle of the temple he tempted him to give himself suddenly and miraculously to the admiration of the assembled people below Comp Matt iv one eleven with Luke iv one thirteen The plain design of each temptation was to induce the Blessed One to step from the position of entire dependence upon God and perfect subjection to his will But all in vain It is written was the unvarying reply of the only dependent self emptied perfect man Others might undertake to manage for themselves none but God should manage for him What an example for the faithful under all their circumstances Jesus kept close to scripture and thus conquered without any other weapon save the sword of the Spirit he stood in the conflict and gained a glorious triumph What a contrast with the first Adam The one had every thing to plead for God the other had every thing to plead against him The garden with all its delights in the one case the wilderness with all its privations in the other confidence in Satan in the one case confidence in God in the other complete defeat in the one case complete victory in the other Blessed forever be the God of all grace who has laid our help on One so mighty to conquer mighty to save Let us now inquire how far Adam and Eve realized the serpent s promised advantage This inquiry will lead us to a deeply important point in connection with the fall of man The Lord God had so ordered it that in and by the fall man should get what previously he had not and that was a conscience a knowledge of both good and evil This man evidently could not have had before He could not have known aught about evil inasmuch as evil was not there to be known He was in a state of innocence which is a state of ignorance of evil Man got a conscience in and by the fall and we find that the very first effect of conscience was to make him a coward Satan had utterly deceived the woman He had said your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as gods knowing good and evil But he had left out a material part of the truth namely that they should know good without the power to do it and that they should know evil without the power to avoid it Their very attempt to elevate themselves in the scale of moral existence involved the loss of true elevation They became degraded powerless Satan enslaved conscience smitten terrified creatures The eyes of them both were opened no doubt but alas to what a sight It was only to discover their own nakedness They opened their eyes upon their own condition which was wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked They knew that they were naked sad fruit of the tree of knowledge It was not any fresh knowledge of divine excellency they had attained no fresh beam of divine light from the pure and eternal fountain thereof alas no the very earliest result of their disobedient effort after knowledge was the discovery that they were naked Now it is well to understand this well too to know how conscience works to see that it can only make cowards of us as being the consciousness of what we are Many are astray as to this they think that conscience will bring us to God Did it operate thus in the case of Adam and Eve Assuredly not Nor will it in the case of any sinner How could it How could the sense of what I am ever bring me to God if not accompanied by the faith of what God is Impossible it will produce shame self reproach remorse anguish It may also give birth to certain efforts on my part to remedy the condition which it discloses but these very efforts so far from drawing us to God rather act as a blind to hide him from our view Thus in the case of Adam and Eve the discovery of their nakedness was followed by an effort of their own to cover it They sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons This is the first record we have of man s attempt to remedy by his own device his condition and the attentive consideration thereof will afford us not a little instruction as to the real character of human religiousness in all ages In the first place we see not only in Adam s case but in every case that man s effort to remedy his condition is based upon the sense of his nakedness He is confessedly naked and all his works are the result of his being so This can never avail I must know that I am clothed before I can do any thing acceptable in the sight of God And this be it observed is the difference between true Christianity and human religiousness The former is founded upon the fact of a man s being clothed the latter upon the fact of his being naked The former has for its starting post what the latter has for its goal All that a true Christian does is because he is clothed perfectly clothed all that a mere religionist does is in order that he may be clothed This makes a vast difference The more we examine the genius of man s religion in all its phases the more we shall see its thorough insufficiency to remedy his state or even to meet his own sense thereof It may do very well for a time It may avail so long as death judgment and the wrath of God are looked at from a distance if looked at at all but when a man comes to look these terrible realities straight in the face he will find in good truth that his religion is a bed too short for him to stretch himself upon and a covering too narrow for him to wrap himself in The moment Adam heard the voice of the Lord God in Eden he was afraid because as he himself confessed I was naked Yes naked although he had his apron on him But it is plain that that covering did not even satisfy his own conscience Had his conscience been divinely satisfied he would not have been afraid If our heart condemn us not then have we confidence toward God one John iii twenty twenty one But if even the human conscience cannot find repose in man s religious efforts how much less can the holiness of God Adam s apron could not screen him from the eye of God and he could not stand in his presence naked therefore he fled to hide himself This is what conscience will do at all times It will cause man to hide himself from God and moreover all that his own religiousness offers him is a hiding place from God This is a miserable provision inasmuch as he must meet God some time or other and if he has naught save the sad conscience of what he is he must be afraid yea he must be wretched Indeed nothing is needed save hell itself to complete the misery of one who feels he has to meet God and knows only his own unfitness to meet him Had Adam known God s perfect love he would not have been afraid There is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment He that feareth is not made perfect in love one John iv seventeen eighteen But Adam knew not this because he had believed the serpent s lie He thought that God was any thing but love and therefore the very last thought of his heart would have been to venture into his presence He could not do it Sin was there and God and sin can never meet so long as there is sin on the conscience there must be the sense of distance from God He is of purer eyes than to behold evil and cannot look upon iniquity Hab i thirteen Holiness and sin cannot dwell together Sin wherever it is found can only be met by the wrath of God But blessed be God there is something beside the conscience of what I am There is the revelation of what he is and this latter the fall of man really brought out God had not revealed himself fully in creation he had shown his eternal power and Godhead six Greek theiotes but he had not told out all the deep secrets of his nature and character Wherefore Satan made a grand mistake in coming to meddle with God s creation He only proved to be the instrument of his own eternal defeat and confusion and his violent dealing shall forever come down upon his own pate His lie only gave occasion for the display of the full truth in reference to God Creation never could have brought out what God was There was infinitely more in him than power and wisdom There was love mercy holiness righteousness goodness tenderness long suffering Where could all these be displayed but in a world of sinners God at the first came down to create and then when the serpent presumed to meddle with creation God came down to save This is brought out in the first words uttered by the Lord God after man s fall And the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him Where art thou This question proved two things It proved that man was lost and that God had come to seek It proved man s sin and God s grace Where art thou Amazing faithfulness Amazing grace Faithfulness to disclose in the very question itself the truth as to man s condition grace to bring out in the very fact of God s asking such a question the truth as to his character and attitude in reference to fallen man Man was lost but God had come down to look for him to bring him out of his hiding place behind the trees of the garden in order that in the happy confidence of faith he might find a hiding place in himself This was grace To create man out of the dust of the ground was power but to seek man in his lost estate was grace But who can utter all that is wrapped up in the idea of God s being a seeker God seeking a sinner What could the Blessed One have seen in man to lead him to seek for him Just what the shepherd saw in the lost sheep or what the woman saw in the lost piece of silver or what the father saw in the lost son The sinner is valuable to God but why he should be so eternity alone will unfold How then did the sinner reply to the faithful and gracious inquiry of the Blessed God Alas the reply only reveals the awful depth of evil into which he had fallen And he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself And he said Who told thee that thou wast naked Hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat And the man said The woman whom thou gavest to be with me she gave me of the tree and I did eat Here we find him actually laying the blame of his shameful fall on the circumstances in which God had placed him and thus indirectly upon God himself This has ever been the way with fallen man Every one and every thing is blamed but self In the case of true conviction the very reverse is exhibited Is it not I that have sinned is the inquiry of a truly humbled soul Had Adam known himself how different would have been his style But he neither knew himself nor God and therefore instead of throwing the blame entirely upon himself he threw it upon God Here then was man s terrible position He had lost all His dominion his dignity his happiness his innocence his purity his peace all was gone from him and what was still worse he accused God of being the cause of it seven There he stood a lost ruined guilty and yet self vindicating and therefore God accusing sinner Now it is perfectly true that no man can believe the gospel except by the power of the Holy Ghost and it is also true that all who so believe the gospel are the happy subjects of God s eternal counsels But does all this set aside man s responsibility to believe a plain testimony set before him in God s Word It most certainly does no such thing But it does reveal the sad evil of man s heart which leads him to reject God s testimony which is plainly revealed and to give as a reason for so doing God s decree which is a profound secret known only to himself However it will not avail for we read in one Thess i eight nine that those who obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ shall be punished with everlasting destruction Men are responsible to believe the gospel and they will be punished for not believing it They are not responsible to know any thing about God s counsels inasmuch as they are not revealed and therefore there can be no guilt attached to ignorance concerning them The apostle could say to the Thessalonians knowing brethren beloved your election of God How did he know it Was it by having access to the page of God s secret and eternal decrees By no means How then Because Greek hoti our gospel came not unto you in word only but also in power one Thess i four five This is the way to know the election of any When the gospel comes in power it is a plain proof of God s election But I doubt not the people who draw a plea from the divine counsels for rejecting the divine testimony only want some flimsy excuse to continue in sin They really do not want God and it would be far more honest in them to say so plainly than to put forward a plea which is not merely flimsy but positively blasphemous Such a plea will not avail them much amid the terrors of the day of judgment now fast approaching But just at this point God began to reveal himself and his purposes of redeeming love and herein lay the true basis of man s peace and blessedness When man has come to the end of himself God can show what he is but not until then The scene must be entirely cleared of man and all his vain pretensions empty boastings and blasphemous reasonings ere God can or will reveal himself Thus it was when man was hidden behind the trees of the garden that God unfolded his wondrous plan of redemption through the instrumentality of the bruised seed of the woman Here we are taught a valuable principle of truth as to what it is which alone will bring a man peacefully and confidingly into the presence of God It has been already remarked that conscience will never effect this Conscience drove Adam behind the trees of the garden revelation brought him forth into the presence of God The consciousness of what he was terrified him the revelation of what God was tranquillized him This is truly consolatory for a poor sin burdened heart The reality of what I am is met by the reality of what God is and this is salvation There is a point where God and man must meet whether in grace or judgment and that point is where both are revealed as they are Happy are they who reach that point in grace Woe be to them who will have to reach it in judgment It is with what we are that God deals and it is as he is that he deals with us In the cross I see God descending in grace to the lowest depths not merely of my negative but my positive condition as a sinner This gives perfect peace If God has met me in my actual condition and himself provided an adequate remedy all is eternally settled But all who do not thus by faith see God in the cross will have to meet him by and by in judgment when he will have to deal according to what he is with what they are The moment a man is brought to know his real state he can find no rest until he has found God in the cross and then he rests in God himself He blessed be his name is the Rest and Hiding place of the believing soul This at once puts human works and human righteousness in their proper place We can say with truth that those who rest in such things cannot possibly have arrived at the true knowledge of themselves It is quite impossible that a divinely quickened conscience can rest in aught save the perfect sacrifice of the Son of God All effort to establish one s own righteousness must proceed from ignorance of the righteousness of God Adam might learn in the light of the divine testimony about the seed of the woman the worthlessness of his fig leaf apron The magnitude of that which had to be done proved the sinner s total inability to do it Sin had to be put away Could man do that Nay it was by him it had come in The serpent s head had to be bruised Could man do that Nay he had become the serpent s slave God s claims had to be met Could man do that Nay he had already trampled them under foot Death had to be abolished Could man do that Nay he had by sin introduced it and imparted to it its terrible sting Thus in whatever way we view the matter we see the sinner s complete impotency and as a consequence the presumptuous folly of all who attempt to assist God in the stupendous work of redemption as all assuredly do who think to be saved in any other way but by grace through faith However though Adam might and through grace did see and feel that he could never accomplish all that had to be done yet God revealed himself as about to achieve every jot and tittle thereof by the seed of the woman In short we see that he graciously took the entire matter into his own hands He made it altogether a question between himself and the serpent for although the man and the woman were called upon individually to reap in various ways the bitter fruits of their sin yet it was to the serpent that the Lord God said Because thou hast done this The serpent was the source of the ruin and the seed of the woman was to be the source of the redemption Adam heard all this and believed it and in the power of that belief he called his wife s name the mother of all living This was a precious fruit of faith in God s revelation Looking at the matter from nature s point of view Eve might be called the mother of all dying But in the judgment of faith she was the mother of all living His mother called him Ben oni the son of my sorrow but his father called him Benjamin the son of my right hand It was through the sustaining energy of faith that Adam was enabled to endure the terrible results of what he had done It was God s wondrous mercy to allow him to hear what he said to the serpent before he was called to listen to what he had to say to himself Had it not been so he must have been plunged in despair It is despair to be called upon to look at myself without being able to look at God as revealed in the cross for my salvation There is no child of fallen Adam who could bear to have his eyes opened to the reality of what he is and what he has done without being plunged in despair unless he could take refuge in the cross Hence in that place to which all who reject Christ must finally be consigned hope cannot come There men s eyes will be opened to the reality of what they are and what they have done but they will not be able to find relief and refuge in God What God is will then involve hopeless perdition as truly as what God is doth now involve eternal salvation The holiness of God will then be eternally against them as it is now that in which all who believe are called to rejoice The more I realize the holiness of God now the more I know my security but in the case of the lost that very holiness will be but the ratification of their eternal doom Solemn unspeakably solemn reflection We shall now briefly glance at the truth presented to us in God s providing coats for Adam and Eve Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins and clothed them We have here in figure the great doctrine of divine righteousness set forth The robe which God provided was an effectual covering because he provided it just as the apron was an ineffectual covering because man had provided it Moreover God s coat was founded upon blood shedding Adam s apron was not So also now God s righteousness is set forth in the cross man s righteousness is set forth in the works the sin stained works of his own hands When Adam stood clothed in the coat of skin he could not say I was naked nor had he any occasion to hide himself The sinner may feel perfectly at rest when by faith he knows that God has clothed him but to feel at rest till then can only be the result of presumption or ignorance To know that the dress I wear and in which I appear before God is of his own providing must set my heart at perfect rest There can be no true permanent rest in aught else The closing verses of this chapter are full of instruction Fallen man in his fallen state must not be allowed to eat of the fruit of the tree of life for that would entail upon him endless wretchedness in this world To take of the tree of life and eat and live forever in our present condition would be unmingled misery The tree of life can only be tasted in resurrection To live forever in a frail tabernacle in a body of sin and death would be intolerable Wherefore the Lord God drove out the man He drove him out into a world which everywhere exhibited the lamentable results of his fall The Cherubim and the flaming sword too forbid fallen man to pluck the fruit of the tree of life while God s revelation pointed him to the death and resurrection of the seed of the woman as that wherein life was to be found beyond the power of death Thus Adam was a happier and a safer man outside the bounds of Paradise than he had been within for this reason that within his life depended upon himself whereas outside it depended upon another even a promised Christ And as he looked up and beheld the Cherubim and the flaming sword he could bless the hand that had set them there to keep the way of the tree of life inasmuch as the same hand had opened a better a safer and a happier way to that tree If the Cherubim and flaming sword stopped up the way to Paradise the Lord Jesus Christ has opened a new and living way into the holiest of all I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the Father but by me Compare John xiv six Heb x twenty In the knowledge of this the believer now moves onward through a world which is under the curse where the traces of sin are visible on all hands He has found his way by faith to the bosom of the Father and while he can secretly repose there he is cheered by the blessed assurance that the one who has conducted him thither is gone to prepare a place in the many mansions of the Father s house and that he will soon come again and receive him unto himself amid the glory of the Father s kingdom Thus in the bosom the house and the kingdom of the Father the believer finds his present portion his future home and reward FOOTNOTES six There is a profoundly interesting thought suggested by comparing the word Greek theiotes Rom i twenty with the word Greek theotes colonel ii nine They are both rendered Godhead but they present a very different thought The heathen might have seen that there was something superhuman something divine in creation but pure essential incomprehensible Deity dwelt in the Adorable Person of the Son seven Man not only accuses God of being the author of his fall but also blames him for his non recovery How often do we hear persons say that they cannot believe unless God give them the power to believe and further that unless they are the subjects of God s eternal decree they cannot be saved CHAPTERS IV V As each section of the Book of Genesis opens before us we are furnished with fresh evidence of the fact that we are travelling over what a recent writer has well termed the seed plot of the whole Bible and not only so but the seed plot of man s entire history Thus in the fourth chapter we have in the persons of Cain and Abel the first examples of a religious man of the world and of a genuine man of faith Born as they were outside of Eden and being the sons of fallen Adam they could have nothing natural to distinguish them one from the other They were both sinners Both had a fallen nature Neither was innocent It is well to be clear in reference to this in order that the reality of divine grace and the integrity of faith may be fully and distinctly seen If the distinction between Cain and Abel were founded in nature then it follows as an inevitable conclusion that they were not the partakers of the fallen nature of their father nor the participators in the circumstances of his fall and hence there could be no room for the display of grace and the exercise of faith Some would teach us that every man is born with qualities and capacities which if rightly used will enable him to work his way back to God This is a plain denial of the fact so clearly set forth in the history now before us Cain and Abel were born not inside but outside of Paradise They were the sons not of innocent but of fallen Adam They came into the world as the partakers of the nature of their father and it mattered not in what phase that nature might display itself it was nature still fallen ruined irremediable nature That which is born of the flesh is not merely fleshly but flesh and that which is born of the Spirit is not merely spiritual but spirit John iii If ever there was a fair opportunity for the distinctive qualities capacities resources and tendencies of nature to manifest themselves the lifetime of Cain and Abel furnished it If there were aught in nature whereby it could recover its lost innocence and establish itself again within the bounds of Eden this was the moment for its display But there was nothing of the kind They were both lost They were flesh They were not innocent Adam lost his innocence and never regained it He can only be looked at as the fallen head of a fallen race who by his disobedience were made sinners Rom v nineteen He became so far as he was personally concerned the corrupt source from whence have emanated the corrupt streams of ruined and guilty humanity the dead trunk from which have shot forth the branches of a dead humanity morally and spiritually dead True as we have already remarked he himself was made a subject of grace and the possessor and exhibitor of a lively faith in a promised Savior but this was not any thing natural but something entirely divine And inasmuch as it was not natural neither was it within the range of nature s capacity to communicate it It was not by any means hereditary Adam could not bequeath nor impart his faith to Cain or Abel His possession thereof was simply the fruit of love divine It was implanted in his soul by divine power and he had not divine power to communicate it to another Whatever was natural Adam could in the way of nature communicate but nothing more And seeing that he as a father was in a condition of ruin his son could only be in the same As is the begetter so are they also that are begotten of him They must of necessity partake of the nature of him from whom they have sprung As is the earthy such are they also that are earthy one Cor xv forty eight Nothing can be more important in its way than a correct understanding of the doctrine of federal headship If my reader will turn for a moment to Rom v twelve twenty one he will find that the inspired apostle looks at the whole human race as comprehended under two heads I do not attempt to dwell on the passage but merely refer to it in connection with the subject in hand The fifteenth chapter of first Corinthians will also furnish instruction of a similar character In the first man we have sin disobedience and death In the Second man we have righteousness obedience and life As we derive a nature from the former so do we also from the latter No doubt each nature will display in each specific case its own peculiar energies it will manifest in each individual possessor thereof its own peculiar powers Still there is the absolute possession of a real abstract positive nature Now as the mode in which we derive a nature from the first man is by birth so the mode in which we derive a nature from the Second man is by new birth Being born we partake of the nature of the former being born again we partake of the nature of the latter A newly born infant though entirely incapable of performing the act which reduced Adam to the condition of a fallen being is nevertheless a partaker of his nature and so also a newly born child of God a newly regenerated soul though having nothing whatever to do with the working out of the perfect obedience of the man Christ Jesus is nevertheless a partaker of his nature True it is that attached to the former nature there is sin and attached to the latter there is righteousness man s sin in the former case God s righteousness in the latter yet all the while there is the actual bona fide participation of a real nature let the adjuncts be what they may The child of Adam partakes of the human nature and its adjuncts the child of God partakes of the divine nature and its adjuncts The former nature is according to the will of man John i the latter is according to the will of God as saint James by the Holy Ghost teaches us of his own will begat he us by the word of truth James i eighteen From all that has been said it follows that Abel was not distinguished from his brother Cain by any thing natural The distinction between them was not grounded upon aught in their nature or circumstances for as to these there was no difference What therefore made the vast difference The answer is as simple as the gospel of the grace of God can make it The difference was not in themselves in their nature or their circumstances it lay entirely in their sacrifices This makes the matter most simple for any truly convicted sinner for any one who truly feels that he not only partakes of a fallen nature but is himself also a sinner The history of Abel opens to such an one the only true ground of his approach to his standing before and his relationship with God It teaches him distinctly that he cannot come to God on the ground of any thing in of or pertaining to nature and he must seek outside himself and in the person and work of another the true and everlasting basis of his connection with the Holy the Just and only True God The eleventh chapter of Hebrews sets the whole subject before us in the most distinct and comprehensive way By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice Greek pleiona thysian than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God bearing witness Greek martyrountos to his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh Here we are taught that it was in nowise a question as to the men but only as to their sacrifice it was not a question as to the offerer but as to his offering Here lay the grand distinction between Cain and Abel My reader cannot be too simple in his apprehension of this point for therein lies involved the truth as to any sinner s standing before God And now let us inquire what the offerings were And in process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto Jehovah And Abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect general iv three five This passage sets the difference clearly before us Cain offered to Jehovah the fruit of a cursed earth and that moreover without any blood to remove the curse He presented an unbloody sacrifice simply because he had no faith Had he possessed that divine principle it would have taught him even at this early moment that without shedding of blood there is no remission Heb ix This is a great cardinal truth The penalty of sin is death Cain was a sinner and as such death stood between him and Jehovah But in his offering there was no recognition whatever of this fact There was no presentation of a sacrificed life to meet the claims of divine holiness or to answer to his own true condition as a sinner He treated Jehovah as though he were altogether such an one as himself who could accept the sin stained fruit of a cursed earth All this and much more lay involved in Cain s unbloody sacrifice He displayed entire ignorance in reference to divine requirements in reference to his own character and condition as a lost and guilty sinner and in reference to the true state of that ground the fruit of which he presumed to offer No doubt reason might say what more acceptable offering could a man present than that which he had produced by the labor of his hands and the sweat of his brow Reason and even man s religious mind may think thus but God thinks quite differently and faith is always sure to agree with God s thoughts God teaches and faith believes that there must be a sacrificed life else there can be no approach to God Thus when we look at the ministry of the Lord Jesus we see at once that had he not died upon the cross all his services would have proved utterly unavailing as regards the establishment of our relationship with God True he went about doing good all his life but it was his death that rent the veil Matt xxvii fifty one Naught but his death could have done so Had he continued to the present moment going about doing good the veil would have remained entire to bar the worshipper s approach into the holiest of all Hence we can see the false ground on which Cain stood as an offerer and a worshipper An unpardoned sinner coming into the presence of Jehovah to present an unbloody sacrifice could only be regarded as guilty of the highest degree of presumption True he had toiled to produce this offering but what of that Could a sinner s toil remove the curse and stain of sin Could it satisfy the claims of an infinitely holy God Could it furnish a proper ground of acceptance for a sinner Could it set aside the penalty which was due to sin Could it rob death of its sting or the grave of its victory Could it do any or all of these things Impossible Without shedding of blood is no remission Cain s unbloody sacrifice like every other unbloody sacrifice was not only worthless but actually abominable in the divine estimation It not only demonstrated his entire ignorance of his own condition but also of the divine character God is not worshipped with men s hands as though he needed any thing And yet Cain thought he could be thus approached And every mere religionist thinks the same Cain has had many millions of followers from age to age Cain worship has abounded all over the world It is the worship of every unconverted soul and is maintained by every false system of religion under the sun Man would fain make God a receiver instead of a giver but this cannot be for it is more blessed to give than to receive and assuredly God must have the more blessed place Without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better Who hath first given to him God can accept the smallest gift from a heart which has learnt the deep truth contained in those words of thine own have we given thee but the moment a man presumes to take the place of the first giver God s reply is if I were hungry I would not tell thee for he is not worshipped with men s hands as though he needed any thing seeing he giveth to all life and breath and all things The great Giver of all things cannot possibly need any thing Praise is all that we can offer to God but this can only be offered in the full and clear intelligence that our sins are all put away and this again can only be known by faith in the virtue of an accomplished atonement My readers may pause here and read prayerfully the following scriptures namely Psalm i Isaiah i eleven eighteen and Acts xvii twenty two thirty four in all of which he will find distinctly laid down the truth as to man s true position before God as also the proper ground of worship Let us now consider Abel s sacrifice And Abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof In other words he entered by faith into the glorious truth that God could be approached by sacrifice that there was such a thing as a sinner s placing the death of another between himself and the consequence of his sin that the claims of God s nature and the attributes of his character could be met by the blood of a spotless victim a victim offered to meet God s demands and the sinner s deep necessities This is in short the doctrine of the cross in which alone the conscience of a sinner can find repose because therein God is fully glorified Every divinely convicted sinner must feel that death and judgment are before him as the due reward of his deeds nor can he by aught that he can accomplish alter that destiny He may toil and labor he may by the sweat of his brow produce an offering he may make vows and resolutions he may alter his way of life he may reform his outward character he may be temperate moral upright and in the human acceptation of the word religious he may though entirely destitute of faith read pray and hear sermons In short he may do any thing or every thing which lies within the range of human competency but notwithstanding all death and judgment are before him He has not been able to disperse those two heavy clouds which have gathered upon the horizon There they stand and so far from being able to remove them by all his doings he can only live in the gloomy anticipation of the moment when they shall burst upon his guilty head It is impossible for a sinner by his own works to place himself in life and triumph at the other side of death and judgment yea his very works are only performed for the purpose of preparing him if possible for those dreaded realities Here however is exactly where the cross comes in In that cross the convicted sinner can behold a divine provision for all his guilt and all his need There too he can see death and judgment entirely removed from the scene and life and glory set in their stead Christ has cleared the prospect of death and judgment so far as the true believer is concerned and filled it with life righteousness and glory He hath abolished death and brought life and incorruptibility to light through the gospel two Tim i ten He has glorified God in the putting away of that which would have separated us forever from his holy and blissful presence He has put away sin and hence it is gone Heb ix twenty six All this is in type set forth in Abel s more excellent sacrifice There was no attempt on Abel s part to set aside the truth as to his own condition and proper place as a guilty sinner no attempt to turn aside the edge of the flaming sword and force his way back to the tree of life no presumptuous offering of an unbloody sacrifice no presentation of the fruit of a cursed earth to Jehovah he took the real ground of a sinner and as such set the death of a victim between him and his sins and between his sins and the holiness of a sin hating God This was most simple Abel deserved death and judgment but he found a substitute Thus is it with every poor helpless self condemned conscience smitten sinner Christ is his substitute his ransom his most excellent sacrifice his ALL Such an one will feel like Abel that the fruit of the ground could never avail for him that were he to present to God the fairest fruits of earth he would still have a sin stained conscience inasmuch as without shedding of blood is no remission The richest fruits and the most fragrant flowers in the greatest profusion could not remove a single stain from the conscience Nothing but the perfect sacrifice of the Son of God can give ease to the heart and conscience All who by faith lay hold of that divine reality will enjoy a peace which the world can neither give nor take away It is faith which puts the soul in present possession of this peace Being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ Rom v one By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain It is not a question of feeling as so many would make it It is entirely a question of faith in an accomplished fact faith wrought in the soul of a sinner by the power of the Holy Ghost This faith is something quite different from a mere feeling of the heart or an assent of the intellect Feeling is not faith Intellectual assent is not faith Some would make faith to be the mere assent of the intellect to a certain proposition This is fearfully false It makes the question of faith human whereas it is really divine It reduces it to the level of man whereas it really comes from God Faith is not a thing of to day or to morrow It is an imperishable principle emanating from an eternal source even God himself it lays hold of God s truth and sets the soul in God s presence Mere feeling and sentimentality can never rise above the source from whence they emanate and that source is self but faith has to do with God and his eternal word and is a living link connecting the heart that possesses it with God who gives it Human feelings however intense human sentiments however refined could not connect the soul with God They are neither divine nor eternal but are human and evanescent They are like Jonah s gourd which sprang up in a night and perished in a night Not so faith That precious principle partakes of all the value all the power and all the reality of the source from whence it emanates and the object with which it has to do It justifies the soul Rom v one it purifies the heart Acts xv nine it works by love Gal v six it overcomes the world one John v four Feeling and sentiment never could accomplish such results they belong to nature and to earth faith belongs to God and to heaven they are occupied with self faith is occupied with Christ they look inward and downward faith looks outward and upward they leave the soul in darkness and doubt faith leads it into light and peace they have to do with one s own fluctuating condition faith has to do with God s immutable truth and Christ s eternally enduring sacrifice No doubt faith will produce feelings and sentiments spiritual feelings and truthful sentiments but the fruits of faith must never be confounded with faith itself I am not justified by feelings nor yet by faith and feelings but simply by faith And why Because faith believes God when he speaks it takes him at his word it apprehends him as he has revealed himself in the person and work of the Lord Jesus Christ This is life righteousness and peace To apprehend God as he is is the sum of all present and eternal blessedness When the soul finds out God it has found out all it can possibly need here or hereafter but he can only be known by his own revelation and by the faith which he himself imparts and which moreover always seeks divine revelation as its proper object Thus then we can in some measure enter into the meaning and power of the statement By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain Cain had no faith and therefore he offered an unbloody sacrifice Abel had faith and therefore he offered both blood and fat which in type set forth the presentation of the life and also the inherent excellency of the Person of Christ The blood set forth the former the fat shadowed forth the latter Both blood and fat were forbidden to be eaten under the Mosaic economy The blood is the life and man under law had no title to life But in the sixth of John we are taught that unless we eat blood we have no life in us Christ is the life There is not a spark of life outside of him All out of Christ is death In him was life and in none else Now he gave up his life on the cross and to that life sin was by imputation attached when the blessed One was nailed to the cursed tree Hence in giving up his life he gave up also the sin attached thereto so that it is effectually put away having been left in his grave from which he rose triumphant in the power of a new life to which righteousness as distinctly attaches itself as did sin to that life which he gave up on the cross This will help us to an understanding of an expression used by our blessed Lord after his resurrection A spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see me have He did not say flesh and blood because in resurrection he had not assumed into his sacred person the blood which he had shed out upon the cross as an atonement for sin The life of the flesh is in the blood and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls for it is the blood which maketh an atonement for the soul Lev xvii eleven Close attention to this point will have the effect of deepening in our souls the sense of the completeness of the putting away of sin by the death of Christ and we know that whatever tends to deepen our sense of that glorious reality must necessarily tend to the fuller establishment of our peace and to the more effectual promotion of the glory of Christ as connected with our testimony and service We have already referred to a point of much interest and value in the history of Cain and Abel and that is the entire identification of each with the offering which he presented My reader cannot possibly bestow too much attention upon this The question in each case was not as to the person of the offerer but entirely as to the character of his offering Hence of Abel we read that God testified of his gifts He did not bear witness to Abel but to Abel s sacrifice and this fixes distinctly the proper ground of a believer s peace and acceptance before God There is a constant tendency in the heart to ground our peace and acceptance upon something in or about ourselves even though we admit that that something is wrought by the Holy Ghost Hence arises the constant looking in when the Holy Ghost would ever have us looking out The question for every believer is not what am I but what is Christ Having come to God in the name of Jesus he is wholly identified with him and accepted in his name and moreover can no more be rejected than the One in whose name he has come Before ever a question can be raised as to the feeblest believer it must be raised as to Christ himself But this latter is clearly impossible and thus the security of the believer is established upon a foundation which nothing can possibly move Being in himself a poor worthless sinner he has come in the name of Christ he is identified with Christ accepted in and as Christ bound up in the same bundle of life with Christ God testifies not of him but of his gift and his gift is Christ All this is most tranquillizing and consolatory It is our happy privilege to be able in the confidence of faith to refer every objection and every objector to Christ and his finished atonement All our springs are in him In him we boast all the day long Our confidence is not in ourselves but in him who hath wrought every thing for us We hang on his name trust in his work gaze on his person and wait for his coming But the carnal mind at once displays its enmity against all this truth which so gladdens and satisfies the heart of a believer Thus it was with Cain He was very wroth and his countenance fell That which filled Abel with peace filled Cain with wrath Cain in unbelief despised the only way in which a sinner could come to God He refused to offer blood without which there can be no remission and then because he was not received in his sins and because Abel was accepted in his gift he was wroth and his countenance fell And yet how else could it be He should either be received with his sins or without them but God could not receive him with them and he would not bring the blood which alone maketh atonement and therefore he was rejected and being rejected he manifests in his ways the fruits of corrupt religion He persecutes and murders the true witness the accepted justified man the man of faith and in so doing he stands as the model and forerunner of all false religionists in every age At all times and in all places men have shown themselves more ready to persecute on religious grounds than on any other This is Cain like Justification full perfect unqualified justification by faith only makes God every thing and man nothing and man does not like this it causes his countenance to fall and draws out his anger Not that he can give any reason for his anger for it is not as we have seen a question of man at all but only of the ground on which he appears before God Had Abel been accepted on the ground of aught in himself then indeed Cain s wrath and his fallen countenance would have had some just foundation but inasmuch as he was accepted exclusively on the ground of his offering and inasmuch as it was not to him but to his gift that Jehovah bore testimony his wrath was entirely without any proper basis This is brought out in Jehovah s word to Cain If thou doest well or as the LXX reads it if thou offer correctly Greek orthos prosenenkes shalt thou not be accepted The well doing had reference to the offering Abel did well by hiding himself behind an acceptable sacrifice Cain did badly by bringing an offering without blood and all his after conduct was but the legitimate result of his false worship And Cain talked with Abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him Thus has it ever been the Cains have persecuted and murdered the Abels At all times man and his religion are the same faith and its religion are the same and wherever they have met there has been conflict However it is well to see that Cain s act of murder was the true consequence the proper fruit of his false worship His foundation was bad and the superstructure erected thereon was also bad Nor did he stop at the act of murder but having heard the judgment of God thereon despairing of forgiveness through ignorance of God he went forth from his blessed presence and built a city and had in his family the cultivators of the useful and ornamental sciences agriculturists musicians and workers in metals Through ignorance of the divine character he pronounced his sin too great to be pardoned eight It was not that he really knew his sin but that he knew not God He fully exhibited the terrible fruit of the fall in the very thought of God to which he gave utterance He did not want pardon because he did not want God He had no true sense of his own condition no aspirations after God no intelligence as to the ground of a sinner s approach to God He was radically corrupt fundamentally wrong and all he wanted was to get out of the presence of God and lose himself in the world and its pursuits He thought he could live very well without God and he therefore set about decorating the world as well as he could for the purpose of making it a respectable place and himself a respectable man therein though in God s view it was under the curse and he was a fugitive and a vagabond Such was the way of Cain in which way millions are at this moment rushing on Such persons are not by any means divested of the religious element in their character They would like to offer something to God to do something for him They deem it right to present to him the results of their own toil They are ignorant of themselves ignorant of God but with all this there is the diligent effort to improve the world to make life agreeable in various ways to deck the scene with the fairest colors God s remedy to cleanse is rejected and man s effort to improve is put in its place This is the way of Cain Jude eleven And my reader you have only to look around you to see how this way prevails at the present moment Though the world is stained with the blood of a greater than Abel even with the blood of Christ yet see what an agreeable place man seeks to make of it As in Cain s day the grateful sounds of the harp and organ no doubt completely drowned to man s ear the cry of Abel s blood so now man s ear is filled with other sounds than those which issue from Calvary and his eye filled with other objects than a crucified Christ The resources of his genius too are put forth to render this world a hot house in which are produced in their rarest form all the fruits for which nature so eagerly longs And not merely are the real wants of man as a creature supplied but the inventive genius of the human mind has been set to work for the purpose of devising things which the moment the eye sees the heart desires and not only desires but imagines that life would be intolerable without them Thus for instance some years ago people were content to devote three or four days to the accomplishing of a journey of one hundred miles but now they can accomplish it in three or four hours and not only so but they will complain sadly if they happen to be five or ten minutes late In fact man must be saved the trouble of living He must travel without fatigue and he must hear news without having to exercise patience for it He will lay iron rails across the earth and electric wires beneath the sea as if to anticipate in his own way that bright and blissful age when there shall be no more sea nine In addition to all this there is abundance of religion so called but alas charity itself is compelled to harbor the apprehension that very much of what passes for religion is but a screw in the vast machine which has been constructed for man s convenience and man s exaltation Man would not be without religion It would not be respectable and therefore he is content to devote one seventh of his time to religion or as he thinks and professes to his eternal interests and then he has six sevenths to devote to his temporal interests but whether he works for time or eternity it is for himself in reality Such is the way of Cain Let my reader ponder it well Let him see where this way begins whither it tends and where it terminates How different the way of the man of faith Abel felt and owned the curse he saw the stain of sin and in the holy energy of faith offered that which met it and met it thoroughly met it divinely He sought and found a refuge in God himself and instead of building a city on the earth he found but a grave in its bosom The earth which on its surface displayed the genius and energy of Cain and his family was stained underneath with the blood of a righteous man Let the man of the world remember this let the man of God remember it let the worldly minded Christian remember it The earth which we tread upon is stained by the blood of the Son of God The very blood which justifies the Church condemns the world The dark shadow of the cross of Jesus may be seen by the eye of faith looming over all the glitter and glare of this evanescent world The fashion of this world passeth away It will soon all be over so far as the present scene is concerned The way of Cain will be followed by the error of Balaam in its consummated form and then will come the gainsaying of Core and what then The pit will open its mouth to receive the wicked and close it again to shut them up in blackness of darkness forever Jude thirteen In full confirmation of the foregoing lines we may run the eye over the contents of Chapter V and find therein the humiliating record of man s weakness and subjection to the rule of death He might live for hundreds of years and beget sons and daughters but at last it must be recorded that he died Death reigned from Adam to Moses And again It is appointed unto men once to die Man cannot get over this He cannot by steam or electricity or any thing else within the range of his genius disarm death of its terrible sting He cannot by his energy set aside the sentence of death although he may produce the comforts and luxuries of life But whence came this strange and dreaded thing death saint Paul gives us the answer By one man sin entered into the world and death by sin Rom v twelve Here we have the origin of death It came by sin Sin snapped asunder the link which bound the creature to the living God and that being done he was handed over to the dominion of death which dominion he had no power whatever to shake off And this be it observed is one of the many proofs of the fact of man s total inability to meet God There can be no fellowship between God and man save in the power of life but man is under the power of death hence on natural grounds there can be no fellowship Life can have no fellowship with death no more than light with darkness or holiness with sin Man must meet God on an entirely new ground and on a new principle even faith and this faith enables him to recognize his own position as sold under sin and therefore subject to death while at the same time it enables him to apprehend God s character as the dispenser of a new life life beyond the power of death a life which can never be touched by the enemy nor forfeited by us This it is which marks the security of the believer s life Christ is his life a risen glorified Christ a Christ victorious over every thing that could be against us Adam s life was founded upon his own obedience and therefore when he disobeyed life was forfeited But Christ having life in himself came down into this world and fully met all the circumstances of man s sin in every possible form and by submitting to death destroyed him who had the power thereof and in resurrection becomes the Life and Righteousness of all who believe in his most excellent name Now it is impossible that Satan can touch this life either in its source its channel its power its sphere or its duration God is its source a risen Christ its channel the Holy Ghost its power heaven its sphere and eternity its duration Hence therefore as might be expected to one possessing this wondrous life the whole scene is changed and while in one sense it must be said in the midst of life we are in death yet in another sense it can be said in the midst of death we are in life There is no death in the sphere into which a risen Christ introduces his people How could there be Has not he abolished it It cannot be an abolished and an existing thing at the same time and to the same people but God s word tells us it is abolished Christ emptied the scene of death and filled it with life and therefore it is not death but glory that lies before the believer Death is behind him and behind him forever As to the future it is all glory cloudless glory True it may be his lot to fall asleep to sleep in Jesus but that is not death but life in earnest The mere matter of departing to be with Christ cannot alter the specific hope of the believer which is to meet Christ in the air to be with him and like him forever Of this we have a very beautiful exemplification in Enoch who forms the only exception to the rule of Chap V The rule is he died the exception is he should not see death By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God Heb xi five Enoch was the seventh from Adam and it is deeply interesting to find that death was not suffered to triumph over the seventh but that in his case God interfered and made him a trophy of his own glorious victory over all the power of death The heart rejoices after reading six times the sad record he died to find that the seventh did not die and when we ask How was this the answer is by faith Enoch lived in the faith of his translation and walked with God three hundred years This separated him practically from all around To walk with God must necessarily put one outside the sphere of this world s thoughts Enoch realized this for in his day the spirit of the world was manifested and then too as now it was opposed to all that was of God The man of faith felt he had naught to do with the world save to be a patient witness therein of the grace of God and of coming judgment The sons of Cain might spend their energies in the vain attempt to improve a cursed world but Enoch found a better world and lived in the power of it ten His faith was not given him to improve the world but to walk with God And oh how much is involved in these three words walked with God What separation and self denial what holiness and moral purity what grace and gentleness what humility and tenderness and yet what zeal and energy What patience and long suffering and yet what faithfulness and uncompromising decision To walk with God comprehends every thing within the range of the divine life whether active or passive It involves the knowledge of God s character as he has revealed it It involves too the intelligence of the relationship in which we stand to him It is not a mere living by rules and regulations nor laying down plans of action nor in resolutions to go hither and thither to do this or that To walk with God is far more than any or all of these things Moreover it will sometimes carry us right athwart the thoughts of men and even of our brethren if they are not themselves walking with God It may sometimes bring against us the charge of doing too much at other times of doing too little but the faith that enables one to walk with God enables him also to attach the proper value to the thoughts of man Thus we have in Abel and Enoch most valuable instruction as to the sacrifice on which faith rests and as to the prospect which hope now anticipates while at the same time the walk with God takes in all the details of actual life which lie between those two points The Lord will give grace and glory and between the grace that has been and the glory that is to be revealed there is the happy assurance that no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly Psalm lxxxiv eleven It has been remarked that the cross and the coming of the Lord form the termini of the Church s existence and these termini are prefigured in the sacrifice of Abel and the translation of Enoch The Church knows her entire justification through the death and resurrection of Christ and she waits for the day when he shall come and receive her to himself She through the Spirit waits for the hope of righteousness by faith Gal v five She does not wait for righteousness inasmuch as she by grace has that already but she waits for the hope which properly belongs to the condition into which she has been introduced My reader should seek to be clear as to this Some expositors of prophetic truth from not seeing the Church s specific place portion and hope have made sad mistakes They have in effect cast so many dark clouds and thick mists around the bright and morning star which is the proper hope of the Church that many saints at the present moment seem unable to rise above the hope of the God fearing remnant of Israel which is to see the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings Mal iv Nor is this all Very many have been deprived of the moral power of the hope of Christ s appearing by being taught to look for various events and circumstances previous to the moment of his manifestation to the Church The restoration of the Jews the development of Nebuchadnezzar s image the revelation of the man of sin all these things it is maintained must take place ere Christ comes That this is not true might be proved from numerous passages of New Testament scripture were this the fitting place to adduce them The Church like Enoch will be taken away from the evil around and the evil to come Enoch was not left to see the world s evil rise to a head and the judgment of God poured forth upon it He saw not the fountains of the great deep broken up nor the windows of heaven opened He was taken away before any of these things occurred and he stands before the eye of faith as a beautiful figure of those who shall not all sleep but shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye one Cor xv fifty one fifty two Translation not death was the hope of Enoch and as to the Church s hope it is thus briefly expressed by the apostle To wait for the Son from heaven one Thess i ten This the simplest and most unlettered Christian can understand and enjoy Its power too he can in some measure experience and manifest He may not be able to study prophecy very deeply but he can blessed be God taste the blessedness the reality the comfort the power the elevating and separating virtue of that celestial hope which properly belongs to him as a member of that heavenly body the Church which hope is not merely to see the Sun of righteousness how blessed soever that may be in its place but to see the bright and morning star reverend ii twenty eight And as in the natural world the morning star is seen by those who watch for it before the sun rises so Christ as the morning star will be seen by the Church before the remnant of Israel can behold the beams of the Sun FOOTNOTES eight The word used by Cain is Hebrew minneso which occurs in Psalm xxxii one whose transgression is forgiven The LXX renders it by Greek aphethenai to be remitted nine True the Lord is using all those things for the furtherance of his own gracious ends and the Lord s servant can freely use them also but this does not hinder our seeing the spirit which originates and characterizes them ten It is very evident that Enoch knew nothing whatever about the mode of making the best of both worlds To him there was but one world Thus it should be with us CHAPTERS VI IX We have now arrived at a deeply important and strongly marked division of our book Enoch has passed off the scene His walk as a stranger on earth has terminated in his translation to heaven He was taken away before human evil had risen to a head and therefore before the divine judgment had been poured out How little influence his course and translation had upon the world is manifest from the first two verses of Chapter VI And it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all which they chose The mingling of that which is of God with that which is of man is a special form of evil and a very effectual engine in Satan s hand for marring the testimony of Christ on the earth This mingling may frequently wear the appearance of something very desirable it may often look like a wider promulgation of that which is of God a fuller and a more vigorous outgoing of a divine influence a something to be rejoiced in rather than to be deplored but our judgment as to this will depend entirely upon the point of view from which we contemplate it If we look at it in the light of God s presence we cannot possibly imagine that an advantage is gained when the people of God mingle themselves with the children of this world or when the truth of God is corrupted by human admixture Such is not the divine method of promulgating truth or of advancing the interests of those who ought to occupy the place of witnesses for him on the earth Separation from all evil is God s principle and this principle can never be infringed without serious damage to the truth In the narrative now before us we see that the union of the sons of God with the daughters of men led to the most disastrous consequences True the fruit of that union seemed exceedingly fair in man s judgment as we read the same became mighty men which were of old men of renown yet God s judgment was quite different He seeth not as man seeth His thoughts are not as ours God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually Such was man s condition before God evil only evil continually So much for the mingling of the holy with the profane Thus it must ever be If the holy seed will not maintain its purity all must be forfeited as regards testimony on the earth Satan s first effort was to frustrate God s purpose by putting the holy seed to death and when that failed he sought to gain his end by corrupting it Now it is of the deepest moment that my reader should clearly understand the aim the character and the result of this union between the sons of God and the daughters of men There is great danger at the present day of compromising truth for the sake of union This should be carefully guarded against There can be no true union attained at the expense of truth The true Christian s motto should ever be maintain truth at all cost if union can be promoted in this way so much the better but maintain the truth The principle of expediency on the contrary may be thus enunciated Promote union at all cost if truth can be maintained as well so much the better but promote union This latter principle can only be carried out at the expense of all that is divine in the way of testimony eleven There can evidently be no true testimony where truth is forfeited and hence in the case of the antediluvian world we see that the unhallowed union between the holy and the profane between that which was divine and that which was human only had the effect of bringing the evil to a head and then God s judgment was poured out The Lord said I will destroy man Nothing less would do There must be the entire destruction of that which had corrupted God s way on the earth The mighty men and men of renown must all be swept away without distinction All flesh must be set aside as utterly unfit for God The end of all flesh is come before me It was not merely the end of some flesh no it was all corrupt in the sight of Jehovah all irrecoverably bad It had been tried and found wanting and the Lord announces his remedy to Noah in these words Make thee an ark of gopher wood Thus was Noah put in possession of God s thoughts about the scene around him The effect of the word of God was to lay bare the roots of all that which man s eye might rest upon with complacency and pride The human heart might swell with pride and the bosom heave with emotion as the eye ran down along the brilliant ranks of men of art men of skill men of might and men of renown The sound of the harp and the organ might send a thrill through the whole soul while at the same time the ground was cultivated and man s necessities were provided for in such a way as to contradict every thought in reference to approaching judgment But oh those solemn words I will destroy What a heavy gloom they would necessarily cast over the glittering scene Could not man s genius invent some way of escape Could not the mighty man deliver himself by his much strength Alas no there was one way of escape but it was revealed to faith not to sight not to reason not to imagination By faith Noah being warned of God of things not seen as yet moved with fear Greek eulabetheis prepared an ark to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith Heb xi seven The word of God brings his light to shine upon all that by which man s heart is deceived It removes completely the gilding with which the serpent covers a vain deceitful passing world over which hangs the sword of divine judgment But it is only faith that will be warned of God when the things of which he speaks are not seen as yet Nature is governed by what it sees it is governed by its senses Faith is governed by the pure word of God inestimable treasure in this dark world this gives stability let outward appearances be what they may When God spoke to Noah of judgment impending there was no sign of it It was not seen as yet but the word of God made it a present reality to the heart that was enabled to mix that word with faith Faith does not wait to see a thing ere it believes for faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God All that the man of faith needs is to know that God has spoken this imparts perfect certainty to his soul Thus saith the Lord settles every thing A single line of sacred scripture is an abundant answer to all the reasonings and all the imaginations of the human mind and when one has the word of God as the basis of his convictions he may calmly stand against the full tide of human opinion and prejudice It was the word of God which sustained the heart of Noah during his long course of service and the same word has sustained the millions of God s saints from that day to this in the face of the world s contradiction Hence we cannot set too high a value upon the word of God Without it all is dark and uncertainty with it all is light and peace Where it shines it marks out for the man of God a sure and blessed path where it shines not one is left to wander amid the bewildering mazes of human tradition How could Noah have preached righteousness for one hundred twenty years if he had not had the word of God as the ground of his preaching How could he have withstood the scoffs and sneers of an infidel world How could he have persevered in testifying of judgment to come when not a cloud appeared on the world s horizon Impossible The word of God was the ground on which he stood and the Spirit of Christ enabled him to occupy with holy decision that elevated and immovable ground And now my beloved Christian reader what else have we wherewith to stand in service for Christ in an evil day like the present Surely nothing nor do we want aught else The word of God and the Holy Ghost by whom alone that word can be understood applied or used are all we want to equip us perfectly to furnish us thoroughly to all good works under whatever head those works may range themselves two Tim iii sixteen seventeen What rest for the heart What relief from all Satan s imagery and man s imaginations God s pure incorruptible eternal word May our hearts adore him for the inestimable treasure Every imagination of the thoughts of man s heart was only evil continually but God s word was the simple resting place of Noah s heart God said unto Noah The end of all flesh is come before me Make thee an ark of gopher wood Here was man s ruin and God s remedy Man had been allowed to pursue his career to the utmost limit to bring his principles and ways to maturity The leaven had worked and filled the mass The evil had reached its climax All flesh had become so bad that it could not be worse wherefore nothing remained but for God to destroy it totally and at the same time to save all those who should be found according to his eternal counsels linked with the eighth person the only righteous man then existing This brings out the doctrine of the cross in a very vivid manner There we find at once God s judgment of nature with all its evil and at the same time the revelation of his saving grace in all its fulness and in all its perfect adaptation to those who have really reached the lowest point of their moral condition as judged by himself The Day spring from on high hath visited us Luke i seventy eight Where Just where we are as sinners God has come down to the very deepest depths of our ruin There is not a point in all the sinner s state to which the light of that blessed Day spring has not penetrated but if it has thus penetrated it must by virtue of what it is reveal our true character The light must judge every thing contrary to itself but while it does so it also gives the knowledge of salvation through the remission of sins The cross while it reveals God s judgment upon all flesh reveals his salvation for the lost and guilty sinner Sin is perfectly judged the sinner perfectly saved God perfectly revealed and perfectly glorified in the cross If my reader will turn for a moment to the First Epistle of Peter he will find much light thrown upon this entire subject At the third chapter verse eighteen we read for Christ also hath once suffered for sins the just for the unjust that he might bring us to God being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the Spirit by which Spirit he went and preached through Noah to the spirits now in prison which once were disobedient when the long suffering of God waited in the days of Noah while the ark was being prepared wherein few that is eight souls were saved through water Greek di hydatos to which the antitype Greek antitypon baptism doth also now save us not the putting away of the filth of the flesh as by water twelve but the answer of a good conscience towards God by the resurrection of Jesus Christ who having gone into heaven is at the right hand of God angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him This is a most important passage It sets the doctrine of the ark and its connection with the death of Christ very distinctly before us As in the Deluge so in the death of Christ all the billows and waves of divine judgment passed over that which in itself was without sin The creation was buried beneath the flood Of Jehovah s righteous wrath and the Spirit of Christ exclaims All thy billows and thy waves have gone over me Ps xlii seven Here is a profound truth for the heart and conscience of a believer All God s billows and waves passed over the spotless person of the Lord Jesus when he hung upon the cross and as a most blessed consequence not one of them remains to pass over the person of the believer At Calvary we see in good truth the fountains of the great deep broken up and the windows of heaven opened Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts Christ drank the cup and endured the wrath perfectly He put himself judicially under the full weight of all his people s liabilities and gloriously discharged them The belief of this gives settled peace to the soul If the Lord Jesus has met all that could be against us if he has removed out of the way every hindrance if he has put away sin if he has exhausted the cup of wrath and judgment on our behalf if he has cleared the prospect of every cloud should we not enjoy settled peace Unquestionably Peace is our unalienable portion To us belong the deep and untold blessedness and holy security which redeeming love can bestow on the righteous ground of Christ s absolutely accomplished work Had Noah any anxiety about the billows of divine judgment None whatever How could he He knew that all had been poured forth while he himself was raised by those very outpoured billows into a region of cloudless peace He floated in peace on that very water by which all flesh was judged He was put beyond the reach of judgment and put there too by God himself He might have said in the triumphant language of Romans viii If God be for us who can be against us He had been invited in by Jehovah himself as we read in Chapter vii one Come thou and all thy house into the ark and when he had taken his place there we read the Lord shut him in Here assuredly was full and perfect security for all within Jehovah kept the door and no one could go in or out without him There was both a window and a door to the ark The Lord secured with his own omnipotent hand the door and left Noah the window from which he might look upward to the place from whence all the judgment had emanated and see that no judgment remained for him The saved family could only look upward because the window was above Chap vi sixteen They could not see the waters of judgment nor the death and desolation which those waters had caused God s salvation the gopher wood stood between them and all these things They had only to gaze upward into a cloudless heaven the eternal dwelling place of the One who had condemned the world and saved them Nothing can more fully express the believer s perfect security in Christ than those words the Lord shut him in Who could open what God had shut None The family of Noah were as safe as God could make them There was no power angelic human or diabolical which could possibly burst open the door of the ark and let the waters in That door was shut by the self same hand that had opened the windows of heaven and broken up the fountains of the great deep Thus Christ is spoken of as the One that hath the key of David he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth reverend iii seven He also holds in his hand the keys of hell and of death reverend i eighteen None can enter the portals of the grave nor go forth therefrom without him He has all power in heaven and on earth He is head over all things to the Church and in him the believer is perfectly secure Matt xxviii eighteen Eph i twenty two Who could touch Noah What wave could penetrate that ark which was pitched within and without with pitch Just so now who can touch those who have by faith retreated into the shadow of the cross Every enemy has been met and silenced yes silenced for ever The death of Christ has triumphantly answered every demur while at the same time his resurrection is the satisfactory declaration of God s infinite complacency in that work which is at once the basis of his righteousness in receiving us and of our confidence in drawing nigh unto him Hence therefore the door of our ark being secured by the hand of God himself nothing remains for us but to enjoy the window or in other words to walk in happy and holy communion with him who has saved us from coming wrath and made us heirs and expectants of coming glory Peter speaks of those who are blind and cannot see afar off and have forgotten that they were purged from their old sins two Peter i nine This is a lamentable condition for any one to be in and it is the sure result of not cultivating diligent prayerful communion with him who has eternally shut us in in Christ Let us now ere we proceed further with Noah s history glance for a little at the condition of those to whom he had so long preached righteousness We have been looking at the saved let us now look at the lost we have been thinking of those within the ark let us now think of those without No doubt many an anxious look would be cast after the vessel of mercy as it rose with the water but alas the door was shut the day of grace was over the time of testimony closed and that forever so far as they were concerned The same hand which had shut Noah in had shut them out and it was as impossible for those without to get in as it was for those within to get out The former were irrecoverably lost the latter effectually saved The long suffering of God and the testimony of his servant had both been slighted Present things had engrossed them They did eat they drank they married wives and were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all Luke xvii twenty six twenty seven There was nothing wrong in any of these things abstractedly looked at The wrong was not in the things done but in the doers of them Every one of them might be done in the fear of the Lord and to the glory of his holy name were they only done in faith But alas they were not so done The word of God was rejected He told of judgment but they did not believe He spoke of sin and ruin but they were not convinced He spoke of a remedy but they would not give heed They went on with their own plans and speculations and had no room for God They acted as if the earth belonged to them by a lease forever They forgot that there was a clause of surrender They thought not of that solemn until God was shut out Every imagination of the thoughts of their heart was only evil continually and hence they could do nothing right They thought spake and acted for themselves They did their own pleasure and forgot God And my reader remember the words of the Lord Jesus Christ how he said as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the days of the Son of man Some would have us to believe that ere the Son of man appears in the clouds of heaven this earth shall be covered from pole to pole with a fair mantle of righteousness They would teach us to look for a reign of righteousness and peace as the result of agencies now in operation but the brief passage just quoted cuts up by the roots in a moment all such vain and delusive expectations How was it in the days of Noah Did righteousness cover the earth as the waters cover the sea Was God s truth dominant Was the earth filled with the knowledge of the Lord Scripture replies the earth was filled with violence All flesh had corrupted his way on the earth The earth also was corrupt before God Well then so shall it be in the days of the Son of man This is plain enough Righteousness and violence are not very like each other Neither is there any similarity between universal wickedness and universal peace It only needs a heart subject to the Word and freed from the influence of preconceived opinions in order to understand the true character of the days immediately preceding the coming of the Son of man Let not my reader be led astray Let him reverently bow to Scripture Let him look at the condition of the world in the days before the flood and let him bear in mind that as it was then so shall it be at the close of this present period This is most simple most conclusive There was nothing like a state of universal righteousness and peace then neither shall there be any thing like it by and by No doubt man displayed abundant energy in making the world a comfortable and an agreeable place for himself but that was a very different thing from making it a suitable place for God So also at this present time man is as busy as he can be in clearing the stones off the pathway of human life and making it as smooth as possible but this is not making straight in the desert a highway for our God nor is it making the rough places smooth that all flesh may see the salvation of Jehovah Civilization prevails but civilization is not righteousness The sweeping and garnishing are going forward but it is not in order to fit the house for Christ but for Antichrist The wisdom of man is put forth in order to cover with the folds of his own drapery the blots and blemishes of humanity but though covered they are not removed They are underneath and will ere long break out in more hideous deformity than ever The painting of vermilion will soon be obliterated and the carved cedar wood destroyed The dams by which man sedulously seeks to stem the torrent of human wretchedness must soon give way before the overwhelming force thereof All the efforts to confine the physical the mental and the moral degradation of Adam s posterity within those enclosures which human benevolence if you please has devised must in the sequel prove abortive The testimony has gone forth The end of all flesh has come before me It has not come before man but it has come before God and albeit the voice of the scoffers may be heard saying Where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation yet the moment is rapidly hastening on when those scoffers will get their answer The day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burnt up two Peter iii four ten This my reader is the answer to the intellectual scoffs of the children of this world but not to the spiritual affections and expectations of the children of God These latter thank God have a totally different prospect even to meet the Bridegroom in the air before evil shall have reached its culminating point and therefore before the divine judgment shall be poured forth thereon The Church of God looks not for the burning up of the world but for the arising of the bright and morning Star Now in whatever way we look at the future from whatever point of view we contemplate it whether the object which presents itself to the soul s vision be the Church in glory or the world in flames the coming of the Bridegroom or the breaking in of the thief the morning Star or the scorching sun the translation or the deluge we must feel the unspeakable importance of attending to God s present testimony in grace to lost sinners Now is the accepted time behold now is the day of salvation two Cor vi two God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them two Cor v nineteen He is reconciling now he will be judging by and by it is all grace now it will be all wrath then he is pardoning sin now through the cross he will punish it then in hell and that forever He is sending out a message of purest richest freest grace He is telling sinners of an accomplished redemption through the precious sacrifice of Christ He is declaring that all is done He is waiting to be gracious The long suffering of our Lord is salvation The Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is long suffering to usward not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance two Peter iii All this makes the present moment one of peculiar solemnity Unmingled grace declared unmingled wrath impending How solemn How deeply solemn And then with what profound interest should we mark the unfolding of the divine purposes Scripture sheds its light upon these things and such a light too that we need not as another has said vacantly stare on passing events as those who know not where they are and whither they are going We should accurately know our bearings We should fully understand the direct tendency of all the principles now at work We should be well aware of the vortex toward which all the tributary streams are rapidly flowing on Men dream of a golden age they promise themselves a millennium of the arts and sciences they feed upon the thought that to morrow shall be as this day and more abundant But oh how utterly vain are all those thoughts dreams and promises Faith can see the clouds gathering thickly around the world s horizon Judgment is coming The day of wrath is at hand The door will soon be shut The strong delusion will soon set in with terrible intensity How needful then it is to raise a warning voice to seek by faithful testimony to counteract man s pitiable self complacency True in so doing we shall be exposed to the charge which Ahab brought against Micaiah of always prophesying evil but no matter for that Let us prophesy what the word of God prophesies and let us do this simply for the purpose of persuading men The word of God only removes from beneath our feet a hollow foundation for the purpose of placing instead thereof a foundation which never can be moved It only takes away from us a delusive hope to give us instead a hope which maketh not ashamed It takes away a broken reed to give us the Rock of ages It sets aside a broken cistern which can hold no water to set in its place the Fountain of living waters This is true love It is God s love He will not cry peace peace when there is no peace nor daub with untempered mortar He would have the sinner s heart resting sweetly in his own eternal Ark of safety enjoying present communion with himself and fondly cherishing the hope that when all the ruin the desolation and the judgment have passed away it shall rest with him in a restored creation We shall now return to Noah and contemplate him in a new position We have seen him building the ark we have seen him in the ark and we shall now view him going forth of the ark and taking his place in the new world thirteen And God remembered Noah The strange work of judgment being over the saved family and all in association with them come into remembrance God made a wind to pass over the earth and the waters assuaged the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped and the rain from heaven was restrained The beams of the sun now begin to act upon a world that had been baptized with a baptism of judgment Judgment is God s strange work He delights not in though he is glorified by it Blessed be his name he is ever ready to leave the place of judgment and enter that of mercy because he delights in mercy And it came to pass at the end of forty days that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made and he sent forth a raven which went forth to and fro until the waters were dried up from off the earth The unclean bird made its escape and found no doubt a resting place upon some floating carcase It sought not the ark again Not so the dove She found no rest for the sole of her foot and she returned unto him into the ark and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark and the dove came in to him in the evening and lo in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off Sweet emblem of the renewed mind which amid the surrounding desolation seeks and finds its rest and portion in Christ and not only so but also lays hold of the earnest of the inheritance and furnishes the blessed proof that judgment has passed away and that a renewed earth is coming fully into view The carnal mind on the contrary can rest in any thing and every thing but Christ It can feed upon all uncleanness The olive leaf has no attraction for it It can find all it needs in a scene of death and hence is not occupied with the thought of a new world and its glories but the heart that is taught and exercised by the Spirit of God can only rest and rejoice in that in which he rests and rejoices It rests in the Ark of his salvation until the times of the restitution of all things May it be thus with you and me beloved reader May Jesus be the abiding rest and portion of our hearts that so we may not seek them in a world which is under the judgment of God The dove went back to Noah and waited for his time of rest and we should ever find our place with Christ until the time of his exaltation and glory in the ages to come He that shall come will come and will not tarry All we want as to this is a little patience May God direct our hearts into his love and into the patience of Christ And God spake unto Noah saying Go forth of the ark The same God that had said Make thee an ark and Come thou into the ark now says Go forth of the ark And Noah went forth and builded an altar unto the Lord All is simple obedience There is the obedience of faith and the worship of faith both go together The altar is erected where just before all had been a scene of death and judgment The ark had borne Noah and his family safely over the waters of judgment It had carried him from the old into the new world where he now takes his place as a worshipper fourteen And be it observed it was unto the Lord he erected his altar Superstition would have worshipped the ark as being the means of salvation It is ever the tendency of the heart to displace God by his ordinances Now the ark was a very marked and manifest ordinance but Noah s faith passed beyond the ark to the God of the ark and hence when he stepped out of it instead of casting back a lingering look at it or regarding it as an object of worship or veneration he built an altar unto the Lord and worshipped him and the ark is never heard of again This teaches us a very simple but at the same time a very seasonable lesson The moment the heart lets slip the reality of God himself there is no placing a limit to its declension it is on the highway to the grossest forms of idolatry In the judgment of faith an ordinance is only valuable as it conveys God in living power to the soul that is to say so long as faith can enjoy Christ therein according to his own appointment Beyond this it is worth just nothing and if it in the smallest degree comes between the heart and his precious work and his glorious person it ceases to be an ordinance of God and becomes an instrument of the devil In the judgment of superstition the ordinance is every thing and God is shut out and the name of God is only made use of to exalt the ordinance and give it a deep hold of the human heart and a mighty influence over the human mind Thus it was that the children of Israel worshipped the brazen serpent That which had once been a channel of blessing to them because used of God became when their hearts had departed from the Lord an object of superstitious veneration and Hezekiah had to break it in pieces and call it a piece of brass In itself it was only a Nehushtan but when used of God it was a means of rich blessing Now faith owned it to be what divine revelation said it was but superstition throwing as it ever does divine revelation overboard lost the real purpose of God in the thing and actually made a god of the thing itself See two Kings xviii four And my reader is there not a deep lesson in all this for the present age I am convinced there is We live in an age of ordinances The atmosphere which enwraps the professing church is impregnated with the elements of a traditionary religion which robs the soul of Christ and his divinely full salvation It is not that human traditions boldly deny that there is such a person as Christ or such a thing as the cross of Christ were they to do so the eyes of many might be opened However it is not thus The evil is of a far more insidious and dangerous character Ordinances are added to Christ and the work of Christ The sinner is not saved by Christ alone but by Christ and ordinances Thus he is robbed of Christ altogether for it will assuredly be found that Christ and ordinances will prove in the sequel to be ordinances and not Christ This is a solemn consideration for all who stand up for a religion of ordinances If ye be circumcised Christ shall profit you nothing It must be Christ wholly or not at all The devil persuades men that they are honoring Christ when they make much of his ordinances whereas all the while he knows full well that they are in reality setting Christ entirely aside and deifying the ordinance I would only repeat here a remark which I have made elsewhere namely that superstition makes every thing of the ordinance infidelity profanity and mysticism make nothing of it faith uses it according to divine appointment But I have already extended this section far beyond the limit which I had prescribed for it I shall therefore close it with a hasty glance at the contents of Chapter ix In it we have the new covenant under which creation was set after the Deluge together with the token of that covenant And God blessed Noah and his sons and said unto them Be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth Observe God s command to man on his entrance into the restored earth was to refill that earth not parts of the earth but the earth He desired to have men dispersed abroad over the face of the world and not relying upon their own concentrated energies We shall see in Chap xi how man neglected all this The fear of man is now lodged in the heart of every other creature Henceforth the service rendered by the inferior orders of creation to man must be the constrained result of fear and dread In life and in death the lower animals were to be at the service of man All creation is delivered by God s everlasting covenant from the fear of a second deluge Judgment is never again to take that shape The world that then was being overflowed with water perished but the heavens and the earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men The earth was once purged with water and it will be again purged by fire and in this second purgation none will escape save those who have fled for refuge to him who has passed through the deep waters of death and met the fire of divine judgment And God said This is the token of the covenant I do set my bow in the cloud and I will remember my covenant The whole creation rests as to its exemption from a second deluge on the eternal stability of God s covenant of which the bow is the token and it is happy to bear in mind that when the bow appears the eye of God rests upon it and man is cast not upon his own imperfect and most uncertain memory but upon God s I says God will remember How sweet to think of what God will and what he will not remember He will remember his own covenant but he will not remember his people s sins The cross which ratifies the former puts away the latter The belief of this gives peace to the troubled heart and uneasy conscience And it shall come to pass when I bring a cloud over the earth that the bow shall be seen in the cloud Beautiful and most expressive emblem The beams of the sun reflected from that which threatens judgment tranquillize the heart as telling of God s covenant God s salvation and God s remembrance Precious most precious sunbeams deriving additional beauty from the very cloud which reflects them How forcibly does this bow in the cloud remind us of Calvary There we see a cloud indeed a dark thick heavy cloud of judgment discharging itself upon the sacred head of the Lamb of God a cloud so dark that even at mid day there was darkness over all the earth But blessed be God faith discerns in that heaviest cloud that ever gathered the most brilliant and beauteous bow that ever appeared for it sees the bright beams of God s eternal love darting through the awful gloom and reflected in the cloud It hears too the words It is finished issuing from amid the darkness and in those words it recognizes the perfect ratification of God s everlasting covenant not only with creation but with the tribes of Israel and the Church of God The last paragraph of this chapter presents a humiliating spectacle The lord of creation fails to govern himself And Noah began to be an husbandman and he planted a vineyard and he drank of the wine and was drunken and he was uncovered within his tent What a condition for Noah the only righteous man the preacher of righteousness to be found in Alas what is man Look at him where you will and you see only failure In Eden he fails in the restored earth he fails in Canaan he fails in the Church he fails in the presence of millennial bliss and glory he fails He fails everywhere and in all things there is no good thing in him Let his advantages be ever so great his privileges ever so vast his position ever so desirable he can only exhibit failure and sin We must however look at Noah in two ways namely as a type and as a man and while the type is full of beauty and meaning the man is full of sin and folly yet the Holy Ghost has written these words Noah was a just man and perfect in his generation and Noah walked with God Divine grace had covered all his sins and clothed his person with a spotless robe of righteousness Though Noah exposed his nakedness God did not see it for he looked not at him in the weakness of his own condition but in the full power of divine and everlasting righteousness Hence we may see how entirely astray how totally alienated from God and his thoughts Ham was in the course he adopted he evidently knew nothing of the blessedness of the man whose iniquity is forgiven and his sin covered On the contrary Shem and Japheth exhibit in their conduct a fine specimen of the divine method of dealing with human nakedness wherefore they inherit a blessing whereas Ham inherits a curse FOOTNOTES eleven We should ever bear in mind that the wisdom which is from above is first pure then peaceable James iii seventeen The wisdom which is from beneath would put peaceable first and therefore it can never be pure twelve It is impossible to over estimate the wisdom of the Holy Ghost as seen in the way in which he treats the ordinance of baptism in the above remarkable passage We know the evil use which has been made of baptism we know the false place it has gotten in the thoughts of many we know how that the efficacy which belongs only to the blood of Christ has been attributed to the water of baptism we know how the regenerating grace of the Holy Ghost has been transferred to water baptism and with the knowledge of all this we cannot but be struck with the way in which the Spirit of God guards the subject by stating that it is not the mere washing away of the filth of the flesh as by water but the answer of a good conscience toward God which answer we get not by baptism how important soever it may be as an ordinance of the kingdom but by the resurrection of Jesus Christ who was delivered for our offences and raised again for our justification Baptism I need hardly say as an ordinance of divine institution and in its divinely appointed place is most important and deeply significant but when we find men in one way or another putting the figure in place of the substance we are bound to expose the work of Satan by the light of the word of God thirteen I would here mention for my reader s prayerful consideration a thought very familiar to the minds of those who have specially given themselves to the study of what is called dispensational truth It has reference to Enoch and Noah The former was taken away as we have seen before the judgment came whereas the latter was carried through the judgment Now it is thought that Enoch is a figure of the Church who shall be taken away before human evil reaches its climax and before the divine judgment falls thereon Noah on the other hand is a figure of the remnant of Israel who shall be brought through the deep waters of affliction and through the fire of judgment and led into the full enjoyment of millennial bliss in virtue of God s everlasting covenant I may add that I quite receive this thought in reference to those two Old Testament fathers I consider that it has the full support of the general scope and analogy of Holy Scripture fourteen It is interesting to look at this entire subject of the ark and deluge in connection with that most important and deeply significant ordinance of baptism A truly baptized person that is one who as the apostle says obeys from the heart that type of doctrine to which he is delivered is one who has passed from the old world into the new in spirit and principle and by faith The water rolls over his person signifying that his old man is buried that his place in nature is ignored that his old nature is entirely set aside in short that he is a dead man When he is plunged beneath the water expression is given to the fact that his name place and existence in nature are put out of sight that the flesh with all that pertained thereto its sins its iniquities its liabilities is buried in the grave of Christ and never can come into God s sight again Again when he rises up out of the water expression is given to the truth that he only comes up as the possessor of a new life even the resurrection life of Christ If Christ had not been raised from the dead the believer could not come up out of the water but should remain buried beneath its surface as the simple expression of the place which righteously belongs to nature But inasmuch as Christ rose from the dead in the power of a new life having entirely put away our sins we also come up out of the water and in so doing set forth the fact that we are put by the grace of God and through the death of Christ in full possession of a new life to which divine righteousness inseparably attaches We are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father even so we also should walk in newness of life See Rom vi and colonel ii passim Comp also one Peter iii eighteen twenty two All this makes the institution of baptism one of immense importance and pregnant with meaning CHAPTER X This section of our book records the generations of Noah s three sons noticing especially Nimrod the founder of the kingdom of Babel or Babylon a name which occupies a very prominent place on the page of inspiration Babylon is a well known name a well known influence From the tenth chapter of Genesis down to the eighteenth chapter of Revelation Babylon again and again appears before us and always as something decidedly hostile to those who occupy for the time being the position of public testimony for God Not that we are to look upon the Babylon of Old Testament scripture as identical with the Babylon of the Apocalypse By no means I believe the former is a city the latter a system but both the city and the system exert a powerful influence against God s people Hardly had Israel entered upon the wars of Canaan when a Babylonish garment brought defilement and sorrow defeat and confusion into the host This is the earliest record of Babylon s pernicious influence upon the people of God but every student of Scripture is aware of the place which Babylon gets throughout the entire history of Israel This would not be the place to notice in detail the various passages in which this city is introduced I would only remark here that whenever God has a corporate witness on the earth Satan has a Babylon to mar and corrupt that witness When God connects his name with a city on the earth then Babylon takes the form of a city and when God connects his name with the Church then Babylon takes the form of a corrupt religious system called the great whore the mother of abominations c In a word Satan s Babylon is always seen as the instrument moulded and fashioned by his hand for the purpose of counteracting the divine operations whether in Israel of old or the Church now Throughout the Old Testament Israel and Babylon are seen as it were in opposite scales when Israel is up Babylon is down and when Babylon is up Israel is down Thus when Israel had utterly failed as Jehovah s witness the king of Babylon broke his bones and swallowed him up The vessels of the house of God which ought to have remained in the city of Jerusalem were carried away to the city of Babylon But Isaiah in his sublime prophecy leads us onward to the opposite of all this He presents in most magnificent strains a picture in which Israel s star is in the ascendant and Babylon entirely sunk And it shall come to pass in the day that the Lord shall give thee rest from thy sorrow and from thy fear and from the hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve that thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon and say How hath the oppressor ceased the golden city ceased since thou art laid down no feller is come up against us Isa xiv three eight Thus much as to the Babylon of the Old Testament Then as to the Babylon of Revelation my reader has only to turn to the seventeenth and eighteenth chapters of that book to see her character and end She is presented in marked contrast with the bride the Lamb s wife and as to her end she is cast as a great millstone into the sea after which we have the marriage of the Lamb with all its accompanying bliss and glory However I could not attempt to pursue this most interesting subject here I have merely glanced at it in connection with the name of Nimrod I feel assured that my reader will find himself amply repaid for any trouble he may take in the close examination of all those scriptures in which the name of Babylon is introduced We shall now return to our chapter And Cush begat Nimrod he began to be a mighty one in the earth He was a mighty hunter before the Lord wherefore it is said Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the Lord And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel and Erech and Accad and Calneh in the land of Shinar Here then we have the character of the founder of Babylon He was a mighty one in the earth a mighty hunter before the Lord Such was the origin of Babylon and its character throughout the entire book of God remarkably corresponds therewith It is always seen as a mighty influence in the earth acting in positive antagonism to every thing which owes its origin to heaven and it is not until this Babylon has been totally abolished that the cry is heard amid the hosts above Alleluia for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth Then all Babylon s mighty hunting will be over forever whether it be its hunting of wild beasts to subdue them or its hunting of souls to destroy them All its might and all its glory all its pomp and pride its wealth and luxury its light and joy its glitter and glare its powerful attractions and wide spread influence shall have passed away forever She shall be swept with the besom of destruction and plunged in the darkness the horror and desolation of an everlasting night How long O Lord CHAPTER XI This is a chapter of very deep interest to the spiritual mind It records two great facts namely the building of Babel and the call of Abraham or in other words man s effort to provide for himself and God s provision made known to faith man s attempt to establish himself in the earth and God s calling a man out of it to find his portion and his home in heaven And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech And it came to pass as they journeyed from the east that they found a plain in the land of Shinar and they dwelt there And they said Go to let us build us a city and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven and let us make us a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth The human heart ever seeks a name a portion and a centre in the earth It knows nothing of aspirations after heaven heaven s God or heaven s glory Left to itself it will ever find its objects in this lower world it will ever build beneath the skies It needs God s call God s revelation and God s power to lift the heart of man above this present world for man is a grovelling creature alienated from heaven and allied to earth In the scene now before us there is no acknowledgment of God no looking up to or waiting on him nor was it the thought of the human heart to set up a place in which God might dwell to gather materials for the purpose of building a habitation for him alas no his name is never once mentioned To make a name for himself was man s object on the plain of Shinar and such has been his object ever since Whether we contemplate man on the plain of Shinar or on the banks of the Tiber we find him to be the same self seeking self exalting God excluding creature throughout There is a melancholy consistency in all his purposes his principles and his ways he ever seeks to shut out God and exalt himself Now in what light soever we view this Babel confederacy it is most instructive to see in it the early display of man s genius and energies regardless of God In looking down along the stream of human history we may easily perceive a marked tendency to confederacy or association Man seeks for the most part to compass his great ends in this way Whether it be in the way of Philanthropy Religion or Politics nothing can be done without an association of men regularly organized It is well to see this principle well to mark its incipient working to see the earliest model which the page of inspiration affords of a human association as exhibited on the plain of Shinar in its design its object its attempt its overthrow If we look around us at the present moment we see the whole scene filled with associations To name them were useless for they are as numerous as are the purposes of the human heart But it is important to mark that the first of all these was the Shinar association for the establishment of the human interests and the exaltation of the human name objects which may well be set in competition with any that engage the attention of this enlightened and civilized age But in the judgment of faith there is one grand defect namely God is shut out and to attempt to exalt man without God is to exalt him to a dizzy height only that he may be dashed down into hopeless confusion and irretrievable ruin The Christian should only know one association and that is the Church of the living God incorporated by the Holy Ghost who came down from heaven as the witness of Christ s glorification to baptize believers into one body and constitute them God s dwelling place Babylon is the very opposite of this in every particular and she becomes at the close as we know the habitation of devils See reverend xviii And the Lord said Behold the people is one and they have all one language and this they begin to do and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do Go to let us go down and there confound their language that they may not understand one another s speech So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth and they left off to build the city Such was the end of man s first association Thus it will be to the end Associate yourselves O ye people and ye shall be broken in pieces gird yourselves and ye shall be broken in pieces gird yourselves and ye shall be broken in pieces Isa viii nine How different it is when God associates men In the second chapter of Acts we see the blessed One coming down in infinite grace to meet man in the very circumstances in which his sin had set him The Holy Ghost enabled the messengers of grace to deliver their message in the very tongue wherein each was born Precious proof this that God desired to reach man s heart with the sweet story of grace The law from the fiery mount was not thus promulgated When God was telling what man ought to be he spoke in one tongue but when he was telling what he himself was he spoke in many Grace broke through the barrier which man s pride and folly had caused to be erected in order that every man might hear and understand the glad tidings of salvation the wonderful works of God And to what end was this Just to associate men on God s ground round God s centre and on God s principles It was to give them in reality one language one centre one object one hope one life It was to gather them in such a way as that they never should be scattered or confounded again to give them a name and a place which should endure forever to build for them a tower and a city which should not only have their top reaching to heaven but their imperishable foundation laid in heaven by the omnipotent hand of God himself It was to gather them around the glorious person of a risen and highly exalted Christ and unite them all in one grand design of magnifying and adoring him If my reader will turn to the seventh chapter of Revelation he will find at the close thereof All nations and kindreds and people and tongues standing round the Lamb and with one voice ascribing all praise to him Thus the three scriptures may be read in most interesting and profitable connection In general xi God gives various tongues as an expression of his judgment in Acts ii he gives various tongues as an expression of grace and in reverend vii we see all those tongues gathered round the Lamb in glory How much better it is therefore to find our place in God s association than in man s The former ends in glory the latter in confusion the former is carried forward by the energy of the Holy Ghost the latter by the unhallowed energy of fallen man the former has for its object the exaltation of Christ the latter has for its object the exaltation of man in some way or other Finally I would say that all who sincerely desire to know the true character object and issue of human associations should read the opening verses of Genesis xi and on the other hand all who desire to know the excellency the beauty the power the enduring character of divine association should look at that holy living heavenly corporation which is called in the New Testament the Church of the living God the body of Christ the bride of the Lamb May the Lord enable us to look at and apprehend all these things in the power of faith for only in this way can they profit our souls Points of truth however interesting scriptural knowledge however profound and extensive Biblical criticism however accurate and valuable may all leave the heart barren and the affections cold We want to find Christ in the Word and having found him to feed on him by faith This would impart freshness unction power vitality energy and intensity all of which we deeply stand in need of in this day of freezing formalism What is the value of a chilling orthodoxy without a living Christ known in all his powerful personal attractions No doubt sound doctrine is immensely important Every faithful servant of Christ will feel himself imperatively called upon to hold fast the form of sound words But after all a living Christ is the very soul and life the joints and marrow the sinews and arteries the essence and substance of sound doctrine May we by the power of the Holy Ghost see more beauty and preciousness in Christ and thus be weaned from the spirit and principles of Babylon We shall God willing consider the remainder of Chapter xi in the next section CHAPTER XII The book of Genesis is for the most part taken up with the history of seven men namely Abel Enoch Noah Abraham Isaac Jacob and Joseph There is I doubt not a specific line of truth brought out in connection with each of those men Thus for example in Abel we have the great foundation truth of man s coming to God in the way of atonement atonement apprehended by faith In Enoch we have the proper portion and hope of the heavenly family while Noah presents to us the destiny of the earthly family Enoch was taken to heaven before the judgment came Noah was carried through the judgment into a restored earth Thus in each we have a distinct character of truth and as a consequence a distinct phase of faith My reader can pursue the subject fully in connection with the eleventh of Hebrews and I feel assured he will find much interest and profit in so doing We shall now proceed with our immediate theme namely the call of Abraham By comparing Chapter xii one Chapter xi thirty one with Acts vii two four we learn a truth of immense practical value to the soul The Lord had said unto Abram Get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father s house unto a land that I will show thee Chap xii one Such was the communication made to Abraham a communication of the most definite character designed of God to act upon Abraham s heart and conscience The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia before he dwelt in Charran and said unto him Get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and come into a land that I will show thee Then went he forth out of the land of the Chaldeans and dwelt in Charran or Haran and from thence when his father was dead he removed him into this land wherein ye now dwell Acts vii two four The result of this communication is given in Chapter xi thirty one And Terah took Abram his son and Lot the son of Haran his son s son and Sarai his daughter in law his son Abram s wife and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees to go into the land of Canaan and they came unto Haran and dwelt there and Terah died in Haran From all these passages taken together we learn that the ties of nature hindered the full response of Abraham s soul to the call of God Though called to Canaan he nevertheless tarried at Haran till nature s tie was snapped by death and then with unimpeded step he made his way to the place to which the God of glory had called him This is full of meaning The influences of nature are ever hostile to the full realization and practical power of the calling of God We are sadly prone to take lower ground than that which the divine call would set before us It needs great simplicity and integrity of faith to enable the soul to rise to the height of God s thoughts and to make our own of that which he reveals The apostle s prayer Eph i fifteen twenty two demonstrates how fully he by the Holy Ghost entered into the difficulty with which the Church would ever have to contend in seeking to apprehend the hope of God s calling and the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints because evidently if we fail to apprehend the calling we cannot walk worthy thereof I must know where I am called to go before I can go thither Had Abraham s soul been fully under the power of the truth that God s calling was to Canaan and that there too lay his inheritance he could not have remained in Charran And so with us If we are led by the Holy Ghost into the understanding of the truth that we are called with a heavenly calling that our home our portion our hope our inheritance are all above where Christ sitteth at God s right hand we could never be satisfied to maintain a standing seek a name or lay up an inheritance on the earth The two things are incompatible this is the true way to look at the matter The heavenly calling is not an empty dogma a powerless theory nor a crude speculation It is either a divine reality or it is absolutely nothing Was Abraham s call to Canaan a speculation Was it a mere theory about which he might talk or argue while at the same time he continued in Charran Assuredly not It was a truth a divine truth a powerfully practical truth He was called to Canaan and God could not possibly sanction his stopping short thereof Thus it was with Abraham and thus it is with us If we would enjoy the divine sanction and the divine presence we must be seeking by faith to act upon the divine call That is to say we must seek to reach in experience in practice and moral character the point to which God has called us and that point is full fellowship with his own Son fellowship with him in his rejection below fellowship with him in his acceptance above But as in Abraham s case it was death that broke the link by which nature bound him to Charran so in our case it is death which breaks the link by which nature ties us down to this present world We must realize the truth that we have died in Christ our Head and Representative that our place in nature and in the world is amongst the things that were that the cross of Christ is to us what the Red Sea was to Israel namely that which separates us forever from the land of death and judgment Thus only shall we be able to walk in any measure worthy of the calling wherewith we are called our high our holy our heavenly calling our calling of God in Christ Jesus And here I would dwell for a little on the cross of Christ in its two grand fundamental phases or in other words the cross as the basis of our worship and our discipleship our peace and our testimony our relation with God and our relation with the world If as a convicted sinner I look at the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ I behold in it the everlasting foundation of my peace I see my sin put away as to the root or principle thereof and I see my sins borne I see God to be in very deed for me and that moreover in the very condition in which my convicted conscience tells me I am The cross unfolds God as the sinner s Friend It reveals him in that most wondrous character as the righteous Justifier of the most ungodly sinner Creation never could do this Providence never could do this Therein I may see God s power his majesty and his wisdom but what if all these things should be ranged against me Looked at in themselves abstractedly they would be so for I am a sinner and power majesty and wisdom could not put away my sin nor justify God in receiving me The introduction of the cross however changes the aspect of things entirely There I find God dealing with sin in such a manner as to glorify himself infinitely There I see the magnificent display and perfect harmony of all the divine attributes I see love and such love as captivates and assures my heart and weans it in proportion as I realize it from every other object I see wisdom and such wisdom as baffles devils and astonishes angels I see power and such power as bears down all opposition I see holiness and such holiness as repulses sin to the very farthest point of the moral universe and gives the most intense expression of God s abhorrence thereof that could possibly be given I see grace and such grace as sets the sinner in the very presence of God yea puts him into his bosom Where could I see all these things but in the cross Nowhere else Look where you please and you cannot find aught that so blessedly combines those two great points namely glory to God in the highest and on earth peace How precious therefore is the cross in this its first phase as the basis of the sinner s peace the basis of his worship and the basis of his eternal relationship with the God who is there so blessedly and so gloriously revealed How precious to God as furnishing him with a righteous ground on which to go in the full display of all his matchless perfections and in his most gracious dealings with the sinner So precious is it to God that as a recent writer has well remarked All that he has said all that he has done from the very beginning indicates that it was ever uppermost in his heart And no wonder His dear and well beloved Son was to hang there between heaven and earth the object of all the shame and suffering that men and devils could heap upon him because he loved to do his Father s will and redeem the children of his grace It will be the grand centre of attraction as the fullest expression of his love throughout eternity Then as the basis of our practical discipleship and testimony the cross demands our most profound consideration In this aspect of it I need hardly say it is as perfect as in the former The same cross which connects me with God has separated me from the world A dead man is evidently done with the world and hence the believer having died in Christ is done with the world and having risen with Christ is connected with God in the power of a new life a new nature Being thus inseparably linked with Christ he of necessity participates in his acceptance with God and in his rejection by the world The two things go together The former makes him a worshipper and a citizen in heaven the latter makes him a witness and a stranger on earth That brings him inside the veil this puts him outside the camp The one is as perfect as the other If the cross has come between me and my sins it has just as really come between me and the world In the former case it puts me into the place of peace with God in the latter it puts me into the place of hostility with the world that is in a moral point of view though in another sense it makes me the patient humble witness of that precious unfathomable eternal grace which is set forth in the cross Now the believer should clearly understand and rightly distinguish between both the above phases of the cross of Christ He should not profess to enjoy the one while he refuses to enter into the other If his ear is open to hear Christ s voice within the veil it should be open also to hear his voice outside the camp If he enters into the atonement which the cross has accomplished he should also realize the rejection which it necessarily involves The former flows out of the part which God had in the cross the latter out of the part which man had therein It is our happy privilege not only to be done with our sins but to be done with the world also All this is involved in the doctrine of the cross Well therefore might the apostle say God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ by which the world is crucified unto me and I unto the world Paul looked upon the world as a thing which ought to be nailed to the cross and the world in having crucified Christ had crucified all who belonged to him Hence there is a double crucifixion as regards the believer and the world and were this fully entered into it would prove the utter impossibility of ever amalgamating the two Beloved reader let us deeply honestly and prayerfully ponder these things and may the Holy Ghost give us the ability to enter into the full practical power of both the phases of the cross of Christ We shall now return to our theme We are not told how long Abraham tarried at Haran yet God graciously waited on his servant until freed from nature s clog he could fully obey his command There was however no accommodation of that command to the circumstances of nature This would never do God loves his servants too well to deprive them of the full blessedness of entire obedience There was no fresh revelation to Abraham s soul during the time of his sojourn in Haran It is well to see this We must act up to the light already communicated and then God will give us more To him that hath shall more be given This is God s principle Still we must remember that God will never drag us along the path of true hearted discipleship This would greatly lack the moral excellency which characterizes all the ways of God He does not drag but draw us along the path which leads to ineffable blessedness in himself and if we do not see that it is for our real advantage to break through all the barriers of nature in order to respond to God s call we forsake our own mercies But alas our hearts little enter into this We begin to calculate about the sacrifices the hindrances and the difficulties instead of bounding along the path in eagerness of soul as knowing and loving the One whose call has sounded in our ears There is much true blessing to the soul in every step of obedience for obedience is the fruit of faith and faith puts us into living association and communion with God himself Looking at obedience in this light we can easily see how distinctly it is marked off in every feature of it from legality This latter sets a man with the entire burden of his sins on him to serve God by keeping the law hence the soul is kept in constant torture and so far from running in the path of obedience it has not even taken the very first step True obedience on the contrary is simply the manifestation or outflow of a new nature communicated in grace To this new nature God graciously imparts precepts for its guidance and it is perfectly certain that the divine nature guided by the divine precepts can never by any possibility resolve itself into legality What constitutes legality is the old nature taking up God s precepts and essaying to carry them out To attempt to regulate man s fallen nature by God s pure and holy law is as useless and absurd as any thing can be How could fallen nature breathe an atmosphere so pure Impossible Both the atmosphere and the nature must be divine But not only does the blessed God impart a divine nature to the believer and guide that nature by his heavenly precepts he also sets before it suited hopes and expectations Thus in Abraham s case The God of glory appeared unto him And for what purpose To set before his soul s vision an attractive object a land that I will show thee This was not compulsion but attraction God s land was in the judgment of the new nature the judgment of faith far better than Ur or Charran and albeit he had not seen the land yet inasmuch as it was God s land faith judged it to be worth having and not only worth having but also fully worth the surrender of present things Hence we read by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive as an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whither he went That is to say he walked by faith not by sight Though he had not seen with his eyes he believed with his heart and faith became the great moving spring in his soul Faith rests on a far more solid ground than the evidence of our senses and that is the word of God Our senses may deceive us but God s word never can Now the entire truth of the divine nature together with the precepts which guide and the hopes which animate it the whole of the divine doctrine respecting these things is completely thrown overboard by the system of legalism The legalist teaches that we must surrender earth in order to get heaven But how can fallen nature surrender that to which it is allied How can it be attracted by that in which it sees no charms Heaven has no charms for nature yea it is the very last place it would like to be found in Nature has no taste for heaven its occupations or its occupants Were it possible for nature to find itself there it would be miserable Thus then nature has no ability to surrender earth and no desire to get heaven True it would be glad to escape hell and its ineffable torment gloom and misery But the desire to escape hell and the desire to get heaven spring from two very different sources The former may exist in the old nature the latter can only be found in the new Were there no lake of fire and no worm in hell nature would not so shrink from it The same principle holds good in reference to all of nature s pursuits and desires The legalist teaches that we must give up sin before we can get righteousness But nature cannot give up sin and as to righteousness it absolutely hates it True it would like a certain amount of religion but it is only with the idea that religion will preserve it from hell fire It does not love religion because of its introducing the soul to the present enjoyment of God and his ways How different from all this miserable system of legalism in every phase thereof is the gospel of the glory of the blessed God This gospel reveals God himself coming down in perfect grace and putting away sin by the sacrifice of the cross putting it away in the most absolute manner on the ground of eternal righteousness inasmuch as Christ suffered for it having been made sin for us And not only is God seen putting away sin but also imparting a new life even the risen life of his own risen exalted and glorified Son which life every true believer possesses in virtue of being linked in God s eternal counsels with him who was nailed to the cross but is now on the throne of the Majesty in the heavens This nature as we have remarked he graciously guides by the precepts of his holy word applied in power by the Holy Ghost He also animates it by the presentation of indestructible hopes He reveals in the distance the hope of glory a city which hath foundations a better country that is an heavenly the many mansions of the Father s house on high golden harps green palms and white robes a kingdom which cannot be moved everlasting association with himself in those regions of bliss and light where sorrow and darkness can never enter the unspeakable privilege of being led throughout the countless ages of eternity beside the still waters and through the green pastures of redeeming love How different is all this from the legalist s notion Instead of calling upon me to educate and manage by the dogmas of systematic religion an irremediably corrupt nature in order that thereby I may surrender an earth that I love and attain to a heaven which I hate he in infinite grace and on the ground of Christ s accomplished sacrifice bestows upon me a nature which can enjoy heaven and a heaven for that nature to enjoy and not only a heaven but himself the unfailing spring of all heaven s joy Such is God s most excellent way Thus he dealt with Abraham Thus he dealt with Saul of Tarsus Thus he deals with us The God of glory showed Abraham a better country than Ur or Charran He showed Saul of Tarsus a glory so bright that it closed his eyes to all earth s brightest glories and caused him to count them all but dung that he might win that blessed One who had appeared to him and whose voice had spoken to his inmost soul He saw a heavenly Christ in glory and throughout the remainder of his course notwithstanding the weakness of the earthen vessel that heavenly Christ and that heavenly glory engrossed his whole soul And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem unto the plain of Moreh And the Canaanite was then in the land The presence of the Canaanite in God s land would necessarily prove a trial to Abraham It would be a demand upon his faith and hope an exercise of heart a trial of patience He had left Ur and Charran behind and come into the country of which the God of glory had spoken to him and there he finds the Canaanite But there too he finds the Lord And the Lord appeared unto Abram and said Unto thy seed will I give this land The connection between the two statements is beautiful and touching The Canaanite was then in the land and lest Abraham s eye should rest upon the Canaanite the present possessor of the land Jehovah appears to him as the One who was going to give the land to him and to his seed forever Thus Abraham was taken up with the Lord and not with the Canaanite This is full of instruction for us The Canaanite in the land is the expression of the power of Satan but instead of being occupied with Satan s power to keep us out of the inheritance we are called to apprehend Christ s power to bring us in We wrestle not with flesh and blood but with spiritual wickedness in the heavenlies The very sphere into which we are called is the sphere of our conflict Should this terrify us By no means We have Christ there a victorious Christ in whom we are more than conquerors Hence instead of indulging a spirit of fear we cultivate a spirit of worship And there builded he an altar unto the Lord who appeared unto him And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel and pitched his tent The altar and the tent give us the two great features of Abraham s character A worshipper of God a stranger in the world most blessed characteristics Having nothing on earth having our all in God Abraham had not so much as to set his foot upon but he had God to enjoy and that was enough However faith has its trials as well as its answers It is not to be imagined that the man of faith having pushed out from the shore of circumstances finds it all smooth and easy sailing By no means Again and again he is called to encounter rough seas and stormy skies but it is all graciously designed to lead him into deeper and more matured experience of what God is to the heart that confides in him Were the sky always without a cloud and the ocean without a ripple the believer would not know so well the God with whom he has to do for alas we know how prone the heart is to mistake the peace of circumstances for the peace of God When every thing is going on smoothly and pleasantly our property safe our business prosperous our children and servants carrying themselves agreeably our residence comfortable our health excellent every thing in short just to our mind how apt we are to mistake the peace which reposes upon such circumstances for that peace which flows from the realized presence of Christ The Lord knows this and therefore he comes in in one way or another and stirs up the nest that is if we are found nestling in circumstances instead of in himself But again we are frequently led to judge of the rightness of a path by its exemption from trial and vice versa This is a great mistake The path of obedience may often be found most trying to flesh and blood Thus in Abraham s case he was not only called to encounter the Canaanite in the place to which God had called him but there was also a famine in the land Should he therefore have concluded that he was not in his right place Assuredly not That would have been to judge according to the sight of his eyes the very thing which faith never does No doubt it was a deep trial to the heart an inexplicable puzzle to nature but to faith it was all plain and easy When Paul was called into Macedonia almost the first thing he had to encounter was the prison at Philippi This to a heart out of communion would have seemed a death blow to the entire mission But Paul never questioned the rightness of his position He was enabled to sing praises in the midst of it all assured that every thing was just as it should be and so it was for in the prison of Philippi was one of God s vessels of mercy who could not humanly speaking have heard the gospel had not the preachers of it been thrust into the very place where he was The devil was made in spite of himself the instrument of sending the gospel to the ears of one of God s elect Now Abraham should have reasoned in the same way in reference to the famine He was in the very place in which God had set him and evidently he received no direction to leave it True the famine was there and moreover Egypt was at hand offering deliverance from pressure still the path of God s servant was plain It is better to starve in Canaan if it should be so than live in luxury in Egypt It is better far to suffer in God s path than be at ease in Satan s It is better to be poor with Christ than rich without him Abraham had sheep and oxen and he asses and men servants and maid servants and she asses and camels Substantial proofs the natural heart would doubtless say of the rightness of his step in going down to Egypt But ah he had no altar no communion Egypt was not the place of God s presence He lost more than he gained by going thither This is ever the case Nothing can ever make up for the loss of our communion with God Exemption from temporary pressure and the accession of the greatest wealth are but poor equivalents for what one loses by diverging a hair s breadth from the straight path of obedience How many of us can add our amen to this How many in order to avoid the trial and exercise connected with God s path have slipped aside into the current of this present evil world and thereby brought leanness and barrenness heaviness and gloom into their souls It may be they have to use the common phrase made money increased their store obtained the world s favor been entreated well by its Pharaohs gotten a name and a position amongst men but are these a proper equivalent for joy in God communion liberty of heart a pure uncondemning conscience a thankful worshipping spirit vigorous testimony and effectual service Alas for the man that can think so And yet all the above incomparable blessings have been often sold for a little ease a little influence a little money Christian reader let us watch against the tendency to slip aside from the narrow yet safe the sometimes rough yet always pleasant path of simple wholehearted obedience Let us keep guard jealous careful guard over faith and a pure conscience for which nothing can compensate Should trial come let us instead of turning aside into Egypt wait on God and thus the trial instead of proving an occasion of stumbling will prove an opportunity for obedience Let us when tempted to slip into the course of the world remember him who gave himself for our sins that he might deliver us from this present evil world according to the will of God and our Father Gal i four If such was his love for us and such his sense of the true character of this present world that he gave himself in order to deliver us from it shall we deny him by plunging again into that from which his cross has forever delivered us May God Almighty forbid May he keep us in the hollow of his hand and under the shadow of his wings until we see Jesus as he is and be like him and with him forever CHAPTER XIII The opening of this chapter presents to us a subject of immense interest to the heart namely the true character of divine restoration When the child of God has in any way declined in his spiritual condition and lost his communion he is in great danger when conscience begins to work of failing in the apprehension of divine grace and of stopping short of the proper mark of divine restoration Now we know that God does every thing in a way entirely worthy of himself Whether he creates redeems converts restores or provides he can only act like himself What is worthy of himself is ever and only his standard of action This is unspeakably happy for us inasmuch as we would ever seek to limit the Holy One of Israel and in nothing are we so prone to limit him as in his restoring grace In the case now before us we see that Abraham was not only delivered out of Egypt but brought back unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning unto the place of the altar which he had made there at the first and there Abraham called on the name of the Lord Nothing can satisfy God in reference to a wanderer or backslider but his being entirely restored We in the self righteousness of our hearts might imagine that such an one should take a lower place than that which he had formerly occupied and so he should were it a question of his merit or his character but inasmuch as it is altogether a question of grace it is God s prerogative to fix the standard of restoration and his standard is set forth in the following passage If thou wilt return O Israel return to me It is thus that God restores and it would be unworthy of himself to do any thing else He will either not restore at all or else restore in such a way as to magnify and glorify the riches of his grace Thus when the leper was brought back he was actually conducted to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation When the prodigal returned he was set down at the table with the father When Peter was restored he was able to stand before the men of Israel and say ye denied the Holy One and the Just the very thing which he had done himself under the most aggravated circumstances In all these cases and many more which might be adduced we see the perfectness of God s restoration He always brings the soul back to himself in the full power of grace and the full confidence of faith If thou wilt return return to me Abraham came unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning Then as to the moral effect of divine restoration it is most deeply practical If legalism gets its answer in the character of the restoration antinomianism gets its answer in the effect thereof The restored soul will have a very deep and keen sense of the evil from which it has been delivered and this will be evidenced by a jealous prayerful holy and circumspect spirit We are not restored in order that we may the more lightly go and sin again but rather that we may go and sin no more The deeper my sense of the grace of divine restoration the deeper will be my sense of the holiness of it also This principle is taught and established throughout all scripture but especially in two well known passages namely Psalms xxiii three and one John i nine He restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name s sake And again If we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness The proper path for a divinely restored soul is the path of righteousness In other words having tasted divine grace we walk in righteousness To talk of grace while walking in unrighteousness is as the apostle says to turn the grace of our God into lasciviousness If grace reigns through righteousness unto eternal life it also manifests itself in righteousness in the outflow of that life The grace that forgives us our sins cleanses us from all unrighteousness Those things must never be separated When taken together they furnish a triumphant answer to the legalism and antinomianism of the human heart But there was a deeper trial for Abraham s heart than even the famine namely that arising from the company of one who evidently was not walking in the energy of personal faith nor in the realization of personal responsibility It seems plain that Lot was from the very beginning borne onward rather by Abraham s influence and example than by his own faith in God This is a very common case If we look down along the history of the people of God we can easily see how that in every great movement produced by the Spirit of God certain individuals have attached themselves thereto who were not personally participators of the power which had produced the movement Such persons go on for a time either as a dead weight upon the testimony or an active hindrance to it Thus in Abraham s case the Lord called him to leave his kindred but he brought his kindred with him Terah retarded him in his movement until death took him out of the way Lot followed him somewhat farther until the lusts of other things overpowered him and he entirely broke down The same thing is observable in the great movement of Israel out of Egypt A mixed multitude followed them and caused much defilement weakness and sorrow for we read in Numbers xi the mixed multitude that was among them fell a lusting and the children of Israel also wept again and said who shall give us flesh to eat So also in the early days of the Church and not only so but in every revival which has taken place therein down to the present day many have been acted upon by various influences which not being divine proved evanescent and the persons so acted upon sooner or later gave way and found their proper level Nothing will endure but that which is of God I must realize the link between me and the living God I must know myself as one called of him into the position which I occupy else I shall have no stability and exhibit no consistency therein It will not do for us to follow in the track of other people merely because it is their track God will graciously give each a path to walk in a sphere to move in and a responsibility to fulfil and we are bound to know our calling and the functions thereof that by his grace ministered to our souls daily we may work therein effectually to his glory It matters not what our measure may be provided it be what God hath dealt to us We may have five talents or we may have but one still if we use the one with our eye fixed on the Master we shall be just as sure to hear from his gracious lips the words well done as if we had used the five This is encouraging Paul Peter James and John had each his peculiar measure his specific ministry and so with all none needs to interfere with another A carpenter has a saw and a plane a hammer and a chisel and he uses each as he needs it Nothing can be more worthless than imitation If in the natural world we look at the various orders of creation we see no imitation All have their proper sphere their proper functions And if it be thus in the natural world how much more in the spiritual The field is wide enough for all In every house there are vessels of various sizes and various shapes The master wants them all Let us therefore my beloved reader search and see whether we are walking under a divine or a human influence whether our faith stands in the wisdom of man or in the power of God whether we are doing things because others have done them or because the Lord has called us to do them whether we are merely propped up by the example and influence of our fellow or sustained by personal faith in God These are serious inquiries It is no doubt a happy privilege to enjoy the fellowship of our brethren but if we are propped up by them we shall soon make shipwreck So also if we go beyond our measure our action will be strained and unsightly uneasy and unnatural It is very easy to see when a man is working in his place and according to his measure All affectation assumption and imitation is contemptible in the extreme Hence though we cannot be great let us be honest and though we cannot be brilliant let us be genuine If a person goes beyond his depth without knowing how to swim he will surely flounder If a vessel put out to sea without being sea worthy and in trim it will surely be beaten back into harbor or lost Lot left Ur of the Chaldees but he fell in the plains of Sodom The call of God had not reached his heart nor the inheritance of God filled his vision Solemn thought may we ponder it deeply Blessed be God there is a path for each of his servants along which shines the light of his approving countenance and to walk therein should be our chief joy His approval is enough for the heart that knows him True we may not always be able to command the approval and concurrence of our brethren we may frequently be misunderstood but we cannot help these things The day will set all this to rights and the loyal heart can contentedly wait for that day knowing that then every man shall have praise of God But it may be well to examine more particularly what it was that caused Lot to turn aside off the path of public testimony There is a crisis in every man s history at which it will assuredly be made manifest on what ground he is resting by what motives he is actuated and by what objects he is animated Thus it was with Lot He did not die at Charran but he fell at Sodom The ostensible cause of his fall was the strife between his herdmen and those of Abraham but the fact is when one is not really walking with a single eye and purified affections he will easily find a stone to stumble over If he does not find it at one time he will at another If he does not find it here he will find it there In one sense it makes little matter as to what may be the apparent cause of turning aside the real cause lies underneath far away it may be from common observation in the hidden chambers of the heart s affections and desires where the world in some shape or form has been sought after The strife between the herdmen might have been easily settled without spiritual damage to either Abraham or Lot To the former indeed it only afforded an occasion for exhibiting the beautiful power of faith and the moral elevation the heavenly vantage ground on which faith ever sets the possessor thereof But to the latter it was an occasion for exhibiting the thorough worldliness of his heart The strife no more produced the worldliness in Lot than it produced the faith in Abraham it only manifested in the case of each what was really there Thus it is always controversies and divisions arise in the Church of God and many are stumbled thereby and driven back into the world in one way or another They then lay the blame on the controversy and division whereas the truth is that these things were only the means of developing the real condition of the soul and the bent of the heart The world was in the heart and would be reached by some route or another nor is there much of moral excellency exhibited in blaming men and things when the root of the matter lies within It is not that controversy and division are not to be deeply deplored assuredly they are To see brethren contending in the very presence of the Canaanite and the Perizzite is truly lamentable and humiliating Our language should ever be Let there be no strife I pray thee between me and thee for we are brethren Still why did not Abraham make choice of Sodom Why did not the strife drive him into the world Why was it not an occasion of stumbling to him Because he looked at it from God s point of view No doubt he had a heart that could be attracted by well watered plains just as powerfully as Lot s heart but then he did not allow his own heart to choose He first let Lot take his choice and then left God to choose for him This was heavenly wisdom This is what faith ever does it allows God to fix its inheritance as it also allows him to make it good It is always satisfied with the portion which God gives It can say the lines are fallen to me in pleasant places yea I have a goodly heritage It matters not where the lines fall for in the judgment of faith they always fall in pleasant places just because God casts them there The man of faith can easily afford to allow the man of sight to take his choice He can say If thou wilt take the left hand then I will go to the right or if thou depart to the right hand then I will go to the left What beautiful disinterestedness and moral elevation we have here and yet what security It is certain that let nature range where it will let it take its most comprehensive grasp its boldest and highest flight there is never the slightest danger of its laying its hand upon faith s treasure It will seek its portion in quite an opposite direction Faith lays up its treasure in a place which nature would never dream of examining and as to its approaching thereto it could not if it would and it would not if it could Hence therefore faith is perfectly safe as well as beautifully disinterested in allowing nature to take its choice What then did Lot choose when he got his choice He chose Sodom The very place that was about to be judged But how was this Why select such a spot Because he looked at the outward appearance and not at the intrinsic character and future destiny The intrinsic character was wicked Its future destiny was judgment to be destroyed by fire and brimstone out of heaven But it may be said Lot knew nothing of all this Perhaps not nor Abraham either but God did and had Lot allowed God to choose his inheritance for him he certainly would not have chosen a spot that he himself was about to destroy He did not however He judged for himself Sodom suited him though it did not suit God His eye rested on the well watered plains and his heart was attracted by them He pitched his tent toward Sodom Such is nature s choice Demas hath forsaken me having loved this present world Lot forsook Abraham for the same reason He left the place of testimony and got into the place of judgment And the Lord said unto Abram after that Lot was separated from him Lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art northward and southward and eastward and westward for all the land which thou seest to thee will I give it and to thy seed forever The strife and separation so far from damaging Abraham s spiritual condition rather brought out in full relief his heavenly principles and strengthened in his soul the life of faith Moreover it cleared the prospect for him and delivered him from the company of one who could only prove a dead weight Thus it worked for good and yielded a harvest of blessing It is at once most solemn and yet most encouraging to bear in mind that in the long run men find their proper level Men who run unsent break down in one way or another and find their way back to that which they profess to have left On the other hand those who are called of God and lean on him are by his grace sustained Their path is as the shining light which shineth more and more unto the perfect day The thought of this should keep us humble watchful and prayerful Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall for truly there are first that shall be last and there are last that shall be first He that endureth to the end the same shall be saved is a principle which whatever be its specific application has a wide moral bearing Many a vessel has sailed out of harbor in gallant style with all its canvas spread amid cheering and shouting and with many fair promises of a first rate passage but alas storms waves shoals rocks and quicksands have changed the aspect of things and the voyage that commenced with hope has ended in disaster I am here only referring to the path of service and testimony and by no means to the question of a man s eternal acceptance in Christ This latter blessed be God does not in any wise rest with ourselves but with him who has said I give unto my sheep eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any pluck them out of my hand But do we not know that many Christians set out on some special course of service or testimony under the impression that they are called of God thereto and after a time they break down Unquestionably And further very many set out in the profession of some special principle of action respecting which they have not been divinely taught or the consequences of which they have not maturely considered in the presence of God and as a necessary result they themselves have been found after a time in the open violation of those very principles All this is deplorable and should be carefully avoided It tends to weaken the faith of God s elect and causes the enemies of the truth to speak reproachfully Each one should receive his call and his commission directly from the Master himself All whom Christ calls into any special service he will infallibly maintain therein for he never sent any one a warfare at his own charges But if we run unsent we shall not only be left to learn our folly but to exhibit it Yet it is not that any one should set himself up as the impersonation of any principle or as an example of any special character of service or testimony God forbid This would be the most egregious folly and empty conceit It is a teacher s business to set forth God s Word and it is a servant s business to set forth the Master s will but while all this is fully understood and admitted we must ever remember the deep need there is of counting the cost ere we undertake to build a tower or go forth to war Were this more seriously attended to there would be far less confusion and failure in our midst Abraham was called of God from Ur to Canaan and hence God led him forth on the way When Abraham tarried at Charran God waited for him when he went down into Egypt he restored him when he needed guidance he guided him when there was a strife and a separation he took care of him so that Abraham had only to say Oh how great is thy goodness which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men He lost nothing by the strife He had his tent and his altar before and he had his tent and his altar afterwards Then Abram removed his tent and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre which is in Hebron and built there an altar unto the Lord Lot might choose Sodom but as for Abraham he sought and found his all in God There was no altar in Sodom Alas all who travel in that direction are in quest of something quite different from that It is never the worship of God but the love of the world that leads them thither And even though they should attain their object what is it How does it end Just thus He gave them their request but sent leanness into their souls CHAPTER XIV We are here presented with an historic record of the revolt of five kings from under the hand of Chedorlaomer and a battle consequent thereon 
7424-98608-0001	train-other-500	The Spirit of God can occupy himself with the movements of kings and their armies when such movements are in anywise connected with the people of God In the present case
7424-98608-0002	train-other-500	Abraham personally had nothing whatever to do with the revolt or its consequences His tent and altar were not likely to furnish an occasion for the declaration of war
none	none	 nor yet to be much affected by the outbreak or issue thereof 
7424-98608-0003	train-other-500	The proper portion of a heavenly man could never by any possibility tempt the cupidity nor excite the ambition of the kings and conquerors of this world However although Abraham was not affected by the battle of
7424-98608-0004	train-other-500	four kings with five yet Lot was His position was such as to involve him in the whole affair So long as we are enabled through grace to pursue the path of simple faith
7424-98608-0005	train-other-500	we shall be thrown completely outside the range of this world s circumstances but if we abandon our high and holy position as those whose citizenship is in heaven and seek a name a place and a portion in the earth
none	none	 we must expect to participate in earth s convulsions and vicissitudes 
7424-98608-0006	train-other-500	Lot had taken up his abode in the plains of Sodom and was therefore deeply and sensibly affected by the wars of Sodom It must ever be thus

7424-98608-0007	train-other-500	He can never do so without serious damage to his own soul as well as to the testimony with which he is entrusted What testimony was Lot in Sodom A very feeble one indeed if one at all
7424-98608-0008	train-other-500	The very fact of his settling himself there was the death blow to his testimony To have spoken a word against Sodom and its ways would have been to condemn himself for why was he there But in truth
7424-98608-0009	train-other-500	it does not by any means appear that to testify for God formed any part of his object in pitching his tent toward Sodom Personal and family interests seem to have been the leading springs of action in his heart and though as Peter tells us
7424-98608-0010	train-other-500	his righteous soul was vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked from day to day yet had he but little power to act against it even if inclined so to do It is important in a practical point of view
7424-98608-0011	train-other-500	to see that we cannot be governed by two objects at the same time For example I cannot have before my mind as objects my worldly interests and the interests of the gospel of Christ If I go to a town for the purpose of setting up in business
7424-98608-0012	train-other-500	then clearly business is my object and not the gospel I may no doubt propose to myself both to attend to business and to preach the gospel as well but all the while either one or the other must be my object
7424-98608-0013	train-other-500	It is not that a servant of Christ may not most blessedly and effectually preach the gospel and attend to business also he assuredly may but in such a case the gospel will be his object and not business
7424-98608-0014	train-other-500	Paul preached the gospel and made tents but the gospel was his object and not tent making If I make business my object the gospel preaching will speedily prove to be formal and unprofitable work
none	none	 yea it will be well if it be not made use of to sanctify my covetousness 
7424-98608-0015	train-other-500	The heart is very treacherous and it is often truly astonishing to see how it deceives us when we desire to gain some special point It will furnish in abundance the most plausible reasons
7424-98608-0016	train-other-500	while the eyes of our understanding are so blinded by self interest or unjudged wilfulness as to be incapable of detecting their plausibility How frequently do we hear persons defending a continuance in a position
7424-98608-0017	train-other-500	which they admit to be wrong on the plea that they thereby enjoy a wider sphere of usefulness To all such reasoning Samuel furnishes a pointed and powerful reply
7424-98608-0018	train-other-500	To obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams Which was Abraham or Lot able to do the more good Does not the history of those two men prove beyond a question
7424-98608-0019	train-other-500	that the most effectual way to serve the world is to be faithful to it by separating from and testifying against it But be it remembered that genuine separation from the world can only be the result of communion with God
7424-98608-0020	train-other-500	I may seclude myself from the world and constitute myself the centre of my being like a monk or a cynic but separation to God is a totally different thing The one chills and contracts the other warms and expands
7424-98608-0021	train-other-500	That drives us in upon ourselves this draws us out in love and interest for others That makes self and its interests our centre this makes God and his glory our centre Thus in Abraham s case
7424-98608-0022	train-other-500	we see that the very fact of his separation enabled him to render effectual service to one who had involved himself in trouble by his worldly ways When Abraham heard that his brother was taken captive he armed his trained servants
7424-98608-0023	train-other-500	born in his own house three hundred and eighteen and pursued them unto Dan and he brought back all the goods and also brought again his brother Lot and his goods and the women also and the people Lot was Abraham s brother after all
7424-98608-0024	train-other-500	and brotherly love must act A brother is born for adversity and it often happens that a season of adversity softens the heart and renders it susceptible of kindness even from one with whom we have had to part company
7424-98608-0025	train-other-500	and it is remarkable that while in verse twelve we read they took Lot Abraham s brother s son yet in verse fourteen we read when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive The claims of a brother s trouble are answered by the affections of a brother s heart
7424-98608-0026	train-other-500	This is divine Genuine faith while it always renders us independent never renders us indifferent It will never wrap itself up in its fleece while a brother shivers in the cold
none	none	 There are three things which faith does 
7424-98608-0027	train-other-500	it purifies the heart it works by love and it overcomes the world and all these results of faith are beautifully exhibited in Abraham on this occasion His heart was purified from Sodom s pollutions
7424-98608-0028	train-other-500	he manifested genuine love to Lot his brother and finally he was completely victorious over the kings Such are the precious fruits of faith that heavenly Christ honoring principle
7424-98608-0029	train-other-500	However the man of faith is not exempt from the assaults of the enemy and it frequently happens that immediately after a victory one has to encounter a fresh temptation Thus it was with Abraham
7424-98608-0030	train-other-500	The king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and of the kings that were with him There was evidently a very deep and insidious design of the enemy in this movement The king of Sodom
7424-98608-0031	train-other-500	presents a very different thought and exhibits a very different phase of the enemy s power from what we have in Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him In the former we have rather the hiss of the serpent in the latter the roar of the lion
7424-98608-0032	train-other-500	but whether it were the serpent or the lion the Lord s grace was amply sufficient and most seasonably was this grace ministered to the Lord s servant at the exact moment of need
7424-98608-0033	train-other-500	And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine and he was the priest of the most high God And he blessed him and said
none	none	 Blessed be Abram of the most high God possessor of heaven and earth 
7424-98608-0034	train-other-500	and blessed be the most high God which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand We have here to remark first the peculiar point at which Melchizedek enters the scene and secondly the double effect of his ministry
7424-98608-0035	train-other-500	He did not come forth when Abraham was in pursuit of Chedorlaomer but when the king of Sodom was in pursuit of Abraham This makes a great moral difference A deeper character of communion was needed to meet the deeper character of conflict
7424-98608-0036	train-other-500	And then as to the ministry the bread and wine refreshed Abraham s spirit after his conflict with Chedorlaomer while the benediction prepared his heart for his conflict with the king of Sodom Abraham was a conqueror
7424-98608-0037	train-other-500	and yet he was about to be a combatant and the royal priest refreshed the conqueror s spirit and fortified the combatant s heart It is peculiarly sweet to observe the manner in which Melchizedek introduces God to the thoughts of Abraham
7424-98608-0038	train-other-500	He calls him the most high God
none	none	 possessor of heaven and earth 
7424-98608-0039	train-other-500	and not only so but pronounces Abraham blessed of that same God This was effectually preparing him for the king of Sodom A man who was blessed of God did not need to take aught from the enemy
7424-98608-0040	train-other-500	and if the possessor of heaven and earth filled his vision the goods of Sodom could have but little attraction Hence as might be expected when the king of Sodom made his proposal Give me the persons and take the goods to thyself
7424-98608-0041	train-other-500	Abraham replies I have lift up my hand unto the Lord the most high God the possessor of heaven and earth that I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet and that I will not take any thing that is thine lest thou shouldest say
none	none	 I have made Abram rich 
7424-98608-0042	train-other-500	Abraham refuses to be enriched by the king of Sodom How could he think of delivering Lot from the power of the world if he himself were governed thereby The only true way in which to deliver another
7424-98608-0043	train-other-500	is to be thoroughly delivered myself So long as I am in the fire it is quite impossible I can pluck another out of it The path of separation is the path of power as it is also the path of peace and blessedness
7424-98608-0044	train-other-500	The world in all its various forms is the great instrument of which Satan makes use in order to weaken the hands and alienate the affections of the servants of Christ But blessed be God when the heart is true to him
7424-98608-0045	train-other-500	he always comes in to cheer to strengthen and to fortify at the right time The eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him
none	none	 two Chron xvi nine This is an encouraging truth for our poor timid doubting faltering hearts Christ will be our strength and shield He will cover our heads in the day of battle he will teach our hands to war 
7424-98608-0046	train-other-500	and our fingers to fight and finally he will bruise Satan under our feet shortly All this is unspeakably comforting to a heart sincerely desirous of making way against the world the flesh and the devil
none	none	 May the Lord keep our hearts true to himself in the midst of the ensnaring scene around us CHAPTER XV After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision saying Fear not Abram I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward The Lord would not suffer his servant to be a loser by rejecting the offers of this world It was infinitely better for Abraham to find himself hidden behind Jehovah s shield than to take refuge beneath the patronage of the king of Sodom and to be anticipating his exceeding great reward than to accept the goods of Sodom The position into which Abraham is put in the opening verse of our chapter is beautifully expressive of the position into which every soul is introduced by the faith of Christ Jehovah was his shield that he might rest in him Jehovah was his reward that he might wait for him So with the believer now he finds his present rest his present peace his present security all in Christ No dart of the enemy can possibly penetrate the shield which covers the weakest believer in Jesus And then as to the future Christ fills it Precious portion Precious hope A portion which can never be exhausted a hope which will never make ashamed Both are infallibly secured by the counsels of God and the accomplished atonement of Christ The present enjoyment thereof is by the ministry of the Holy Ghost who dwells in us This being the case it is manifest that if the believer is pursuing a worldly career or indulging in worldly or carnal desires he cannot be enjoying either the shield or the reward If the Holy Ghost is grieved he will not minister the enjoyment of that which is our proper portion our proper hope Hence in the section of Abraham s history now before us we see that when he had returned from the slaughter of the kings and rejected the offer of the king of Sodom Jehovah rose before his soul in the double character as his shield and his exceeding great reward Let the heart ponder this for it contains a volume of deeply practical truth We shall now examine the remainder of the chapter In it we have unfolded to us the two great principles of sonship and heirship And Abram said Lord God what wilt thou give me seeing I go childless and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus And Abram said Behold thou hast given to me no seed and lo one born in my house is mine heir Abraham desired a son for he knew upon divine authority that his seed should inherit the land Chap xiii fifteen Sonship and heirship are inseparably connected in the thoughts of God He that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir Sonship is the proper basis of every thing and moreover it is the result of God s sovereign counsel and operation as we read in James of his own will begat he us Finally it is founded upon God s eternal principle of resurrection How else could it be Abraham s body was dead wherefore in his case as in every other sonship must be in the power of resurrection Nature is dead and can neither beget nor conceive aught for God There lay the inheritance stretching out before the patriarch s eye in all its magnificent dimensions but where was the heir Abraham s body and Sarah s womb alike answered death But Jehovah is the God of resurrection and therefore a dead body was the very thing for him to act upon Had nature not been dead God should have put it to death ere he could fully show himself The most suitable theatre for the living God is that from which nature with all its boasted powers and empty pretensions has been totally expelled by the sentence of death Wherefore God s word to Abraham was look now toward heaven and tell the stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him So shall thy seed be When the God of resurrection fills the vision there is no limit to the soul s blessing for he who can quicken the dead can do any thing And he believed in the Lord and he counted it unto him for righteousness The imputation of righteousness to Abraham is here founded upon his believing in the Lord as the Quickener of the dead It is in this character that he reveals himself in a world where death reigns and when a soul believes in him as such it is counted righteous in his sight This necessarily shuts man out as regards his company operation for what can he do in the midst of a scene of death Can he raise the dead Can he open the gates of the grave Can he deliver himself from the power of death and walk forth in life and liberty beyond the limits of its dreary domain Assuredly not Well then if he cannot do so he cannot work out righteousness nor establish himself in the relation of sonship God is not the God of the dead but of the living and therefore so long as a man is under the power of death and under the dominion of sin he can neither know the position of a son nor the condition of righteousness Thus God alone can bestow the adoption of sons and he alone can impute righteousness and both are connected with faith in him as the One who raised up Christ from the dead It is in this way that the apostle handles the question of Abraham s faith in Romans iv where he says It was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed unto him but for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead Here the God of resurrection is presented to us also as the object of faith and our faith in him as the alone ground of our righteousness If Abraham had looked up into heaven s vault spangled with innumerable stars and then looked at his own body now dead how could he ever grasp the idea of a seed as numerous as those stars Impossible But he did not look at his own body but at the resurrection power of God and inasmuch as that was the power which was to produce the seed we can easily see that the stars of heaven and the sand on the sea shore are but feeble figures indeed for what natural object could possibly illustrate the effect of that power which can raise the dead So also when a sinner hearkens to the glad tidings of the gospel were he to look up to the unsullied light of the divine presence and then look down into the unexplored depths of his own evil nature he might well exclaim How can I ever get thither How can I ever be fit to dwell in that light Where is the answer In himself Nay blessed be God but in that blessed One who travelled from the bosom to the cross and the grave and from thence to the throne thus filling up in his person and work all the space between those extreme points There can be nothing higher than the bosom of God the eternal dwelling place of the Son and there can be nothing lower than the cross and the grave but amazing truth I find Christ in both I find him in the bosom and I find him in the grave He went down into death in order that he might leave behind him in the dust thereof the full weight of his people s sins and iniquities Christ in the grave exhibits the end of every thing human the end of sin the full limit of Satan s power The grave of Jesus forms the grand terminus of all But resurrection takes us beyond this terminus and constitutes the imperishable basis on which God s glory and man s blessing repose forever The moment the eye of faith rests on a risen Christ there is a triumphant answer to every question as to sin judgment death and the grave The One who divinely met all these is alive from the dead and has taken his seat at the right hand of the majesty in the heavens and not only so but the Spirit of that risen and glorified One in the believer constitutes him a son He is quickened out of the grave of Christ as we read and you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses colonel ii thirteen Hence therefore sonship being founded on resurrection stands connected with perfect justification perfect righteousness perfect freedom from every thing which could in any wise be against us God could not have us in his presence with sin upon us He could not suffer a single speck or stain of sin upon his sons and daughters The father could not have the prodigal at his table with the rags of the far country upon him He could go forth to meet him in those rags He could fall upon his neck and kiss him in those rags It was worthy and beautifully characteristic of his grace so to do but then to seat him at his table in the rags would never do The grace that brought the father out to the prodigal reigns through the righteousness which brought the prodigal in to the father It would not have been grace had the father waited for the son to deck himself in robes of his own providing and it would not have been righteous to bring him in in his rags but both grace and righteousness shone forth in all their respective brightness and beauty when the father went out and fell on the prodigal s neck but yet did not give him a seat at the table until he was clad and decked in a manner suited to that elevated and happy position God in Christ has stooped to the very lowest point of man s moral condition that by stooping he might raise man to the very highest point of blessedness in fellowship with himself From all this it follows that our sonship with all its consequent dignities and privileges is entirely independent of us We have just as little to do with it as Abraham s dead body and Sarah s dead womb had to do with a seed as numerous as the stars which garnish the heavens or as the sand on the sea shore It is all of God God the Father drew the plan God the Son laid the foundation and God the Holy Ghost raises the superstructure and on this superstructure appears the inscription THROUGH GRACE BY FAITH WITHOUT WORKS OF LAW But then our chapter opens another most important subject to our view namely heirship The question of sonship and righteousness being fully settled divinely and unconditionally settled the Lord said unto Abraham I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees to give thee this land to inherit it Here comes out the great question of heirship and the peculiar path along which the chosen heirs are to travel ere they reach the promised inheritance If children then heirs heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together Our way to the kingdom lies through suffering affliction and tribulation but thank God we can by faith say the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us And further we know that our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh out for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory Finally we glory in tribulation knowing that tribulation worketh patience and patience experience and experience hope It is a high honor and a real privilege to be allowed to drink of our blessed Master s cup and be baptized with his baptism to travel in blest companionship with him along the road which leads directly to the glorious inheritance The Heir and the joint heirs reach that inheritance by the pathway of suffering But let it be remembered that the suffering of which the joint heirs participate has no penal element in it It is not suffering from the hand of infinite justice because of sin all that was fully met on the cross when the divine Victim bowed his sacred head beneath the stroke Christ also hath once suffered for sins and that once was on the tree and nowhere else He never suffered for sins before and he never can suffer for sins again Once in the end of the world the end of all flesh hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself Christ was once offered There are two ways in which to view a suffering Christ first as bruised of Jehovah secondly as rejected of men In the former he stood alone in the latter we have the honor of being associated with him In the former I say he stood alone for who could have stood with him He bore the wrath of God alone he travelled in solitude down into the rough valley that had neither been eared nor sown and there he settled forever the question of our sins With this we had nothing to do though to this we are eternally indebted for every thing He fought the fight and gained the victory alone but he divides the spoils with us He was in solitude in the horrible pit and miry clay but directly he planted his foot on the everlasting rock of resurrection he associates us with him He uttered the cry alone he sings the new song in company Ps xl two three Now the question is Shall we refuse to suffer from the hand of man with him who suffered from the hand of God for us That it is in a certain sense a question is evident from the Spirit s constant use of the word if in connection with it If so be we suffer with him If we suffer we shall reign There is no such question as to sonship We do not reach the high dignity of sons through suffering but through the quickening power of the Holy Ghost founded on the accomplished work of Christ according to God s eternal counsel This can never be touched We do not reach the family through suffering The apostle does not say that ye may be counted worthy of the family of God for which ye also suffer They were in the family already but they were bound for the kingdom and their road to that kingdom lay through suffering and not only so but the measure of suffering for the kingdom would be according to their devotedness and conformity to the King The more like we are to him the more we shall suffer with him and the deeper our fellowship with him in the suffering the deeper will be our fellowship in the glory There is a difference between the house of the Father and the kingdom of the Son in the former it will be a question of capacity in the latter a question of assigned position All my children may be round my table but their enjoyment of my company and conversation will entirely depend on their capacity One may be seated on my knee in the full enjoyment of his relationship as a child yet perfectly unable to comprehend a word I say another may exhibit uncommon intelligence in conversation yet not be a whit happier in his relationship than the infant on my knee But when it becomes a question of service for me or public identification with me it is evidently quite another thing This is but a feeble illustration of the idea of capacity in the Father s house and assigned position in the kingdom of the Son But let it be remembered that our suffering with Christ is not a yoke of bondage but a matter of privilege not an iron rule but a gracious gift not constrained servitude but voluntary devotedness Unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ not only to believe on him but also to suffer for his sake Phil i twenty nine Moreover there can be little doubt but that the real secret of suffering for Christ is to have the heart s affections centred in him The more I love Jesus the closer I shall walk with him and the closer I walk with him the more faithfully I shall imitate him and the more faithfully I imitate him the more I shall suffer with him Thus it all flows from love to Christ and then it is a fundamental truth that we love him because he first loved us In this as in every thing else let us beware of a legal spirit for it must not be imagined that a man with the yoke of legality round his neck is suffering for Christ alas it is much to be feared that such an one does not know Christ does not know the blessedness of sonship has not yet been established in grace is rather seeking to reach the family by works of law than to reach the kingdom by the path of suffering On the other hand let us see that we are not shrinking from our Master s cup and baptism Let us not profess to enjoy the benefits which his cross secures while we refuse the rejection which that cross involves We may rest assured that the road to the kingdom is not enlightened by the sunshine of this world s favor nor strewed with the roses of its prosperity If a Christian is advancing in the world he has much reason to apprehend that he is not walking in company with Christ If any man serve me let him follow me and where I am there shall also my servant be What was the goal of Christ s earthly career Was it an elevated influential position in this world By no means What then He found his place on the cross between two condemned malefactors But it will be said God was in this True yet man was in it likewise and this latter truth is what must inevitably secure our rejection by the world if only we keep in company with Christ The companionship of Christ which lets me into heaven casts me out of earth and to talk of the former while I am ignorant of the latter proves there is something wrong If Christ were on earth now what would his path be Whither would it tend Where would it terminate Would we like to walk with him Let us answer these inquiries under the edge of the word and under the eye of the Almighty and may the Holy Ghost make us faithful to an absent a rejected a crucified Master The man who walks in the Spirit will be filled with Christ and being filled with him he will not be occupied with suffering but with him for whom he suffers If the eye is fixed on Christ the suffering will be as nothing in comparison with the present joy and future glory The subject of heirship has led me much further than I intended but I do not regret it as it is of considerable importance Let us now briefly glance at the deeply significant vision of Abraham as set forth in the closing verses of our chapter And when the sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon Abram and lo an horror of great darkness fell upon him And he said unto Abram Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and shall serve them and they shall afflict them four hundred years and also that nation whom they shall serve will I judge and afterward shall they come out with great substance And it came to pass that when the sun went down and it was dark behold a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces The entire of Israel s history is summed up in those two figures the furnace and the lamp The former presents to us those periods of their history in which they were brought into suffering and trial such for example as the long period of Egyptian bondage their subjection to the kings of Canaan the Babylonish captivity their present dispersed and degraded condition During all these periods they may be considered as passing through the smoking furnace See Deut iv twenty one Kings viii fifty one Isaiah xlviii ten Then in the burning lamp we have those points in Israel s eventful history at which Jehovah graciously appeared for their relief such as their deliverance from Egypt by the hand of Moses their deliverance from under the power of the kings of Canaan by the ministry of the various judges their return from Babylon by the decree of Cyrus and their final deliverance when Christ shall appear in his glory The inheritance must be reached through the furnace and the darker the smoke of the furnace the brighter and more cheering will be the lamp of God s salvation Nor is this principle confined merely to the people of God as a whole it applies just as fully to individuals All who have ever reached a position of eminence as servants have endured the furnace before they enjoyed the lamp An horror of great darkness passed across the spirit of Abraham Jacob had to endure twenty one years of sore hardship in the house of Laban Joseph found his furnace of affliction in the dungeons of Egypt Moses spent forty years in the desert Thus it must be with all God s servants They must be tried first that being found faithful they may be put into the ministry God s principle in reference to those who serve him is expressed in those words of saint Paul not a novice lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil one Tim iii six It is one thing to be a child of God it is quite another to be a servant of Christ I may love my child very much yet if I set him to work in my garden he may do more harm than good Why Is it because he is not a dear child No but because he is not a practised servant This makes all the difference Relationship and office are distinct things Not one of the Queen s children is at present capable of being her prime minister It is not that all God s children have not something to do something to suffer something to learn Undoubtedly they have yet it ever holds good that public service and private discipline are intimately connected in the ways of God One who comes forward much in public will need that chastened spirit that matured judgment that subdued and mortified mind that broken will that mellow tone which are the sure and beautiful result of God s secret discipline and it will generally be found that those who take a prominent place without more or less of the above moral qualifications will sooner or later break down Lord Jesus keep thy feeble servants very near unto thine own most blessed person and in the hollow of thine hand CHAPTER XVI Here we find unbelief casting its dark shadow across the spirit of Abraham and again turning him aside for a season from the path of simple happy confidence in God And Sarai said unto Abram Behold the Lord hath restrained me from bearing These words bespeak the usual impatience of unbelief and Abram should have treated them accordingly and waited patiently on the Lord for the accomplishment of his gracious promise The poor heart naturally prefers any thing to the attitude of waiting It will turn to any expedient any scheme any resource rather than be kept in that posture It is one thing to believe a promise at the first and quite another thing to wait quietly for the accomplishment thereof We can see this distinction constantly exemplified in a child If I promise my child any thing he has no idea of doubting my word but yet I can detect the greatest possible restlessness and impatience in reference to the time and manner of accomplishment And cannot the wisest sage find a true mirror in which to see himself reflected in the conduct of a child Truly so Abraham exhibits faith in Chapter xv and yet he fails in patience in Chapter xvi Hence the force and beauty of the apostle s word in Hebrews vi followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises God makes a promise faith believes it hope anticipates it patience waits quietly for it There is such a thing in the commercial world as the present worth of a bill or promissory note for if men are called upon to wait for their money they must be paid for waiting Now in faith s world there is such a thing as the present worth of God s promise and the scale by which that worth is regulated is the heart s experimental knowledge of God for according to my estimate of God will be my estimate of his promise and moreover the subdued and patient spirit finds its rich and full reward in waiting upon him for the accomplishment of all that he has promised However as to Sarah the real amount of her word to Abraham is this The Lord has failed me it may be my Egyptian maid will prove a resource for me Any thing but God for a heart under the influence of unbelief It is often truly marvellous to observe the trifles to which we will betake ourselves when once we have lost the sense of God s nearness his infallible faithfulness and unfailing sufficiency We lose that calm and well balanced condition of soul so essential to the proper testimony of the man of faith and just like other people betake ourselves to any or every expedient in order to reach the wished for end and call that a laudable use of means But it is a bitter thing to take ourselves out of the place of absolute dependence upon God The consequences must be disastrous Had Sarah said Nature has failed me but God is my resource how different it would have been This would have been her proper ground for nature really had failed her But then it was nature in one shape and therefore she wished to try nature in another She had not learnt to look away from nature in every shape In the judgment of God and of faith nature in Hagar was no better than nature in Sarah Nature whether young or old is alike to God and therefore alike to faith but ah we are only in the power of this truth when we are experimentally finding our living centre in God himself When the eye is taken off that glorious Being we are ready for the meanest device of unbelief It is only when we are consciously leaning on the only true the only wise the living God that we are enabled to look away from every creature stream It is not that we shall despise God s instrumentality By no means To do so would be recklessness and not faith Faith values the instrument not because of itself but because of him who uses it Unbelief looks only at the instrument and judges of the success of a matter by the apparent efficiency thereof instead of by the sufficiency of him who in grace uses it Like Saul who when he looked at David and then looked at the Philistine said Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him for thou art but a youth Yet the question in David s heart was not as to whether he was able but whether Jehovah was able The path of faith is a very simple and a very narrow one It neither deifies the means on the one hand nor despises it on the other It simply values it so far as it is evidently God s means and no further There is a vast difference between God s using the creature to minister to me and my using it to shut him out This difference is not sufficiently attended to God used the ravens to minister to Elijah but Elijah did not use them to exclude God If the heart be really trusting in God it will not trouble itself about his means It waits on him in the sweet assurance that by what means soever he pleases he will bless he will minister he will provide Now in the case before us in this chapter it is evident that Hagar was not God s instrument for the accomplishment of his promise to Abraham He had promised a son no doubt but he had not said that this son should be Hagar s and in point of fact we find from the narrative that both Abraham and Sarah multiplied their sorrow by having recourse to Hagar for when she saw that she had conceived her mistress was despised in her eyes This was but the beginning of those multiplied sorrows which flowed from hastening after nature s resources Sarah s dignity was trampled down by an Egyptian bond woman and she found herself in the place of weakness and contempt The only true place of dignity and power is the place of felt weakness and dependence There is no one so entirely independent of all around as the man who is really walking by faith and waiting only upon God but the moment a child of God makes himself a debtor to nature or the world he loses his dignity and will speedily be made to feel his loss It is no easy task to estimate the loss sustained by diverging in the smallest measure from the path of faith No doubt all those who walk in that path will find trial and exercise but one thing is certain that the blessings and joys which peculiarly belong to them are infinitely more than a counterpoise whereas when they turn aside they have to encounter far deeper trial and naught but that And Sarai said My wrong be upon thee When we act wrong we are ofttimes prone to lay the blame on some one else Sarah was only reaping the fruit of her own proposal and yet she says to Abraham My wrong be upon thee and then with Abraham s permission she seeks to get rid of the trial which her own impatience had brought upon her But Abram said unto Sarai Behold thy maid is in thy hand do to her as it pleaseth thee And when Sarai dealt hardly with her she fled from her face This will not do The bond woman cannot be got rid of by hard treatment When we make mistakes and find ourselves called upon to encounter the results thereof we cannot counteract those results by carrying ourselves with a high hand We frequently try this method but we are sure to make matters worse thereby If we have done wrong we should humble ourselves and confess the wrong and wait on God for deliverance But there was nothing like this manifested in Sarah s case Quite the reverse There is no sense of having done wrong and so far from waiting on God for deliverance she seeks to deliver herself in her own way However it will always be found that every effort which we make to rectify our errors previous to the full confession thereof only tends to render our path more difficult Thus Hagar had to return and give birth to her son which son proved to be not the child of promise at all but a very great trial to Abraham and his house as we shall see in the sequel Now we should view all this in a double aspect first as teaching us a direct practical principle of much value and secondly in a doctrinal point of view And first as to the direct practical teaching we may learn that when through the unbelief of our hearts we make mistakes it is not all in a moment nor yet by our own devices we can remedy them Things must take their course Whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting This is an unalterable principle meeting us again and again on the page of inspiration and also on the page of our personal history Grace forgives the sin and restores the soul but that which is sown must be reaped Abraham and Sarah had to endure the presence of the bond woman and her son for a number of years and then get rid of them in God s way There is peculiar blessedness in leaving ourselves in God s hands Had Abraham and Sarah done so on the present occasion they would never have been troubled with the presence of the bond woman and her son but having made themselves debtors to nature they had to endure the consequences But alas we are often like a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke when it would be our exceeding comfort to behave and quiet ourselves as a child that is weaned of his mother No two figures can be more opposite than a stubborn bullock and a weaned child The former represents a person senselessly struggling under the yoke of circumstances and rendering his yoke all the more galling by his efforts to get rid of it the latter represents one meekly bowing his head to every thing and rendering his portion all the sweeter by entire subjection of spirit And now as to the doctrinal view of this chapter We are authorized to look at Hagar and her son as figures of the covenant of works and all who are thereby brought into bondage See Gal iv twenty two twenty five The flesh is in this important passage contrasted with promise and thus we not only get the divine idea as to what the term flesh implies but also as to Abraham s effort to obtain the seed by means of Hagar instead of resting in God s promise The two covenants are allegorized by Hagar and Sarah and are diametrically opposite the one to the other The one gendering to bondage inasmuch as it raised the question as to man s competency to do and not to do and made life entirely dependent upon that competency The man that doeth these things shall live in them This was the Hagar covenant But the Sarah covenant reveals God as the God of promise which promise is entirely independent of man and founded upon God s willingness and ability to fulfil it When God makes a promise there is no if attached thereto He makes it unconditionally and is resolved to fulfil it and faith rests in him in perfect liberty of heart It needs no effort of nature to reach the accomplishment of a divine promise Here was precisely where Abraham and Sarah failed They made an effort of nature to reach a certain end which end was absolutely secured by a promise of God This is the grand mistake of unbelief By its restless activity it raises a hazy mist around the soul which hinders the beams of the divine glory from reaching it He could there do no mighty works because of their unbelief One great characteristic virtue of faith is that it ever leaves the platform clear for God to show himself and truly when he shows himself man must take the place of a happy worshipper The error into which the Galatians allowed themselves to be drawn was the addition of something of nature to what Christ had already accomplished for them by the cross The gospel which had been preached to them and which they had received was the simple presentation of God s absolute unqualified and unconditional grace Jesus Christ had been evidently set forth crucified among them This was not merely promise divinely made but promise divinely and most gloriously accomplished A crucified Christ settled every thing in reference both to God s claims and man s necessities But the false teachers upset all this or sought to upset it by saying Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses ye cannot be saved This as the apostle teaches them was in reality making Christ of none effect Christ must either be a whole Saviour or no Saviour at all The moment a man says Except ye be this or that ye cannot be saved he totally subverts Christianity for in Christianity I find God coming down to me just as I am a lost guilty self destroyed sinner and coming moreover with a full remission of all my sins and a full salvation from my lost estate all perfectly wrought by himself on the cross Hence therefore a man who tells me You must be so and so in order to be saved robs the cross of all its glory and robs me of all my peace If salvation depends upon our being or doing aught we shall inevitably be lost Thank God it does not for the great fundamental principle of the gospel is that God is ALL man is NOTHING It is not a mixture of God and man It is all of God The peace of the gospel does not repose in part on Christ s work and in part on man s work it reposes wholly on Christ s work because that work is perfect perfect forever and it renders all who put their trust in it as perfect as itself Under the law God as it were stood still to see what man could do but in the gospel God is seen acting and as for man he has but to stand still and see the salvation of God This being so the inspired apostle hesitates not to say to the Galatians Christ is become of no effect unto you whosoever of you are justified by law Greek en nomo ye are fallen from grace If man has any thing to do in the matter God is shut out and if God is shut out there can be no salvation for it is impossible that man can work out a salvation by that which proves him a lost creature and then if it be a question of grace it must be all grace It cannot be half grace half law The two covenants are perfectly distinct It cannot be half Sarah and half Hagar It must be either the one or the other If it be Hagar God has nothing to do with it and if it be Sarah man has nothing to do with it Thus it stands throughout The law addresses man tests him sees what he is really worth proves him a ruin and puts him under the curse and not only puts him under it but keeps him there so long as he is occupied with it so long as he is alive The law hath dominion over a man so long as he liveth but when he is dead its dominion necessarily ceases so far as he is concerned though it still remains in full force to curse every living man The gospel on the contrary assuming man to be lost ruined dead reveals God as he is the Saviour of the lost the Pardoner of the guilty the Quickener of the dead It reveals him not as exacting aught from man for what could be expected from one who has died a bankrupt but as exhibiting his own independent grace in redemption This makes a material difference and will account for the extraordinary strength of the language employed in the Epistle to the Galatians I marvel Who hath bewitched you I am afraid of you I stand in doubt of you I would they were even cut off that trouble you This is the language of the Holy Ghost who knows the value of a full Christ and a full salvation and who also knows how essential the knowledge of both is to a lost sinner We have no such language as this in any other epistle not even in that to the Corinthians although there were some of the grossest disorders to be corrected amongst them All human failure and error can be corrected by bringing in God s grace but the Galatians like Abraham in this chapter were going away from God and returning to the flesh What remedy could be devised for this How can you correct an error which consists in departing from that which alone can correct any thing To fall from grace is to get back under the law from which nothing can ever be reaped but the CURSE May the Lord establish our hearts in his own most excellent grace CHAPTER XVII Here we have God s remedy for Abraham s failure set before us And when Abram was ninety years old and nine the Lord appeared unto Abram and said unto him I am the Almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect fifteen This is a most comprehensive verse It is very evident that Abraham had not been walking before the Almighty God when he adopted Sarah s expedient in reference to Hagar It is faith alone that can enable a man to walk up and down before an Almighty One Unbelief will ever be thrusting in something of self something of circumstances second causes and the like and thus the soul is robbed of the joy and peace the calm elevation and holy independence which flow from leaning upon the arm of One who can do every thing I believe we deeply need to ponder this God is not such an abiding reality to our souls as he ought to be or as he would be were we walking in more simple faith and dependence Walk before me This is true power To walk thus implies our having nothing whatever before our hearts save God himself If I am founding my expectation upon men and things I am not walking before God but before men and things It is of the utmost importance to ascertain who or what I have before me as an object To what am I looking On whom or what am I leaning at this moment Does God entirely fill my future Have men or circumstances aught to do therein Is there any space allotted to the creature The only way in which to get above the world is to walk by faith because faith so completely fills the scene with God that there is no room for the creature no room for the world If God fills up my entire range of vision I can see nothing else and then I am able to say with the Psalmist My soul wait thou only upon God for my expectation is from him He only is my rock and my salvation he is my defence I shall not be moved Ps lxii five six This word only is deeply searching Nature cannot say this Not that it will save when under the direct influence of a daring and blasphemous skepticism formally shut out God altogether but it assuredly cannot say He only Now it is well to see that as in the matter of salvation so in all the details of actual life from day to day God will not share his glory with the creature From first to last it must be he only and this too in reality It will not do to have the language of dependence upon God on our lips while our hearts are really leaning on some creature resource God will make all this fully manifest he will test the heart he will put faith into the furnace Walk before me and be thou perfect Thus it is we reach the proper point When the soul is enabled by grace to get rid of all its fondly cherished creature expectations then and only then it is prepared to let God act and when he acts all must be well He will not leave any thing undone He will perfectly settle every thing on behalf of those who simply put their trust in him When unerring wisdom omnipotent power and infinite love combine the confiding heart may enjoy unruffled repose Unless we can find some circumstance too big or too little for the Almighty God we have no proper base on which to found a single anxious thought This is an amazing truth and one eminently calculated to put all who believe it into the blessed position in which we find Abraham in this chapter When God had in effect said to him Leave all to me and I will settle it for you beyond your utmost desires and expectations the seed and the inheritance and every thing pertaining thereto will be fully and everlastingly settled according to the covenant of the Almighty God then Abram fell on his face Truly blessed attitude the only proper one for a thoroughly empty feeble and unprofitable sinner to occupy in the presence of the living God the Creator of heaven and earth the possessor of all things the Almighty God And God talked with him It is when man is in the dust that God can talk to him in grace Abraham s posture here is the beautiful expression of entire prostration in the presence of God in the sense of utter weakness and nothingness And this be it observed is the sure precursor of God s revelation of himself It is when the creature is laid low that God can show himself in the unclouded effulgence of what he is He will not give his glory to another He can reveal himself and allow man to worship in view of that revelation but until the sinner takes his proper place there can be no unfolding of the divine character How different is Abraham s attitude in this and the preceding chapter There he had nature before him here he has the Almighty God There he was an actor here he is a worshipper There he was betaking himself to his own and Sarah s contrivance here he leaves himself and his circumstances his present and his future in God s hands and allows him to act in him for him and through him Hence God can say I will make I will establish I will give I will bless In a word it is all God and his actings and this is real rest for the poor heart that has learnt any thing of itself The covenant of circumcision is now introduced Every member of the household of faith must bear in his body the seal of that covenant There must be no exception He that is born in thy house and he that is bought with thy money must needs be circumcised and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised that soul shall be cut off from his people he hath broken my covenant We are taught in Romans iv that circumcision was a seal of the righteousness of faith Abraham believed God and it was counted unto him for righteousness Being thus counted righteous God set his seal upon him The seal with which the believer is now sealed is not a mark in the flesh but that Holy Spirit of promise whereby he is sealed unto the day of redemption This is founded upon his everlasting connection with Christ and his perfect identification with him in death and resurrection as we read in Colossians And ye are complete in him which is the head of all principality and power In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ buried with him in baptism wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God who hath raised him from the dead And you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses This is a most glorious passage unfolding to us the true idea of what circumcision was meant to typify Every believer belongs to the circumcision in virtue of his living association with him who by his cross has forever abolished every thing that stood in the way of his church s perfect justification There was not a speck of sin on the conscience nor a principle of sin in the nature of his people for which Christ was not judged on the cross and they are now looked upon as having died with Christ lain in the grave with Christ been raised with Christ perfectly accepted in him their sins their iniquities their transgressions their enmity their uncircumcision having been entirely put away by the cross The sentence of death has been written on the flesh but the believer is in possession of a new life in union with his risen Head in glory The apostle in the above passage teaches that the Church was quickened out of the grave of Christ and moreover that the forgiveness of all her trespasses is as complete and as entirely the work of God as was the raising of Christ from the dead and this latter we know was the result of God s mighty power or as it may be rendered according to the energy of the might of his power Eph i nineteen a truly wonderful expression calculated to set forth the magnitude and glory of redemption as well as the solid basis on which it rests What rest perfect rest for the heart and conscience is here What full relief for the burdened spirit All our sins buried in the grave of Christ not one even the smallest left out God did this for us All that his searching eye could detect in us he laid on the head of Christ when he hung upon the cross He judged him there and then instead of judging us in hell forever Precious fruit this of the admirable the profound the eternal counsels of redeeming love And we are sealed not with a certain mark cut in our flesh but with the Holy Ghost The entire household of faith is sealed thus Such is the dignity the value the changeless efficacy of the blood of Christ that the Holy Ghost the Third Person of the eternal Trinity can take up his abode in all those who have put their trust therein And now what remains for those who know these things save to be steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord Thus may it be O Lord through the grace of thy Holy Spirit FOOTNOTES fifteen I would here offer a remark as to the word perfect When Abraham was called upon to be perfect it did not mean perfect to himself for this he never was and never could be It simply meant that he should be perfect as regards the object before his heart that his hopes and expectations were to be perfectly and undividedly centred in the Almighty God In looking through the New Testament we find the word perfect used in at least four distinct senses In Matt v forty eight we read Be ye therefore perfect even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect Here we learn from the context that the word perfect refers to the principle of our walk At verse forty four we read love your enemies that ye may be the sons of your Father which is in heaven for he maketh the sun to rise upon the evil and the good and sendeth rain upon the just and the unjust Hence to be perfect in the sense of Matt v forty eight is to act on a principle of grace toward all even toward those who are injurious and hostile A Christian going to law and asserting or contending for his rights is not perfect as his Father for his Father is dealing in grace whereas he is dealing in righteousness The question here is not as to the right or wrong of going to law with worldly people as to brethren one Cor vi is conclusive All I contend for is that a Christian so doing is acting in a character the direct opposite to that of his Father for assuredly he is not going to law with the world He is not now on a judgment seat but on a mercy seat a throne of grace He showers his blessings upon those who were he to go to law with them should be in hell Wherefore it is plain that a Christian when he brings a man before the judgment seat is not perfect as his Father which is in heaven is perfect At the close of Matt xviii we have a parable which teaches us that a man who asserts his rights is ignorant of the true character and proper effect of grace The servant was not unrighteous in demanding what was due to him but he was ungracious He was totally unlike his master He had been forgiven ten thousand talents and yet he could seize his fellow by the throat for a paltry hundred pence What was the consequence He was delivered to the tormentors He lost the happy sense of grace and was left to reap the bitter fruits of having asserted his rights while being himself a subject of grace And observe further he was called a wicked servant not because of having owed ten thousand talents but because of not having forgiven the hundred pence The master had ample grace to settle the former but he had not grace to settle the latter This parable has a solemn voice for all Christians going to law for although in the application of it it is said so shall my heavenly Father do to you if you from your heart forgive not every one his brother their trespasses yet is the principle of general application that a man acting in righteousness will lose the sense of grace In Hebrews ix we have another sense of the term perfect Here too the context settles the import of the word It is perfect as pertaining to the conscience This is a deeply important use of the term The worshipper under the law never could have a perfect conscience for the simplest reason possible because he never had a perfect sacrifice The blood of a bullock and a goat did well enough for a time but it could not do forever and therefore could not give a perfect conscience Now however the weakest believer in Jesus is privileged to have a perfect conscience Why Is it because he is a better man than the worshipper under the law Nay but because he has gotten a better sacrifice If Christ s sacrifice is perfect forever the believer s conscience is perfect forever The two things necessarily go together For the Christian not to have a perfect conscience is a dishonor to the sacrifice of Christ It is tantamount to saying that his sacrifice is only temporary and not eternal in its effect and what is this but to bring it down to the level of the sacrifices under the Mosaic economy It is very needful to distinguish between perfection in the flesh and perfection as to conscience To pretend to the former is to exalt self to refuse the latter is to dishonor Christ The babe in Christ should have a perfect conscience whereas saint Paul had not nor could have perfect flesh The flesh is not presented in the word as a thing which is to be perfected but as a thing which has been crucified This makes a wide difference The Christian has sin in him but not on him Why Because Christ who had no sin in him ever had sin on him when he was nailed to the cross Finally in Phil iii we have two other senses of the word perfect The apostle says not as though I had already attained either were already perfect and yet a little farther on he says Let as many as be perfect be thus minded The former refers to the apostle s full and everlasting conformity to Christ in glory The latter refers to our having Christ as the all engrossing object before the heart s affections CHAPTER XVIII This chapter affords a beautiful exemplification of the results of an obedient separated walk Behold I stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and sup with him and he with me reverend iii twenty Again we read Jesus answered and said unto him If a man love me he will keep my words and my Father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him John xiv twenty three From these passages taken in connection with our chapter we learn that an obedient soul enjoys a character of communion entirely unknown to one who moves in a worldly atmosphere This does not touch in the most remote manner the question of forgiveness or justification All believers are clothed in the same spotless robe of righteousness all stand in one common justification under the eye of God The one life flows down from the Head in heaven through all the members on earth This is plain The doctrine in reference to the above important points is fully established in the word and has been again and again unfolded through the foregoing pages of this volume But we should remember that justification is one thing and the fruit thereof quite another To be a child is one thing to be an obedient child is quite another Now a father loves an obedient child and will make such a child more the depositary of his thoughts and plans And is this not true in reference to our heavenly Father Unquestionably John xiv twenty three puts this quite beyond dispute and moreover it proves that for one to speak of loving Christ and not to keep his words is hypocrisy If a man love me he will keep my words Hence if we are not keeping Christ s words it is a sure proof we are not walking in the love of his name Love to Christ is proved by doing the things which he commands and not by merely saying Lord Lord It is of very little avail to say I go sir while the heart has no idea of going However in Abraham we see one who however he may have failed in detail was nevertheless characterized in the main by a close simple and elevated walk with God and in the interesting section of his history now before us we find him in the enjoyment of three special privileges namely providing refreshment for the Lord enjoying full communion with the Lord and interceding for others before the Lord These are high distinctions and yet are they only such as ever result from an obedient separated holy walk Obedience refreshes the Lord as being the fruit of his own grace in our hearts We see in the only perfect man that ever lived how he constantly refreshed and delighted the Father Again and again God bore testimony to him from heaven as his beloved Son in whom he was well pleased The path of Christ furnished a continual feast to heaven His ways were ever sending up a fragrant incense to the throne of God From the manger to the cross he did always the things which pleased his Father There was no interruption no variation no salient point He was the only perfect One There only can the Spirit trace a perfect life below Here and there as we look along the current of inspiration we find one and another who occasionally refreshed the mind of heaven Thus in the chapter before us we find the tent of the stranger at Mamre affording refreshment to the Lord himself refreshment lovingly offered and willingly accepted Ver one eight Then we find Abraham enjoying high communion with the Lord first in reference to his own personal interests ver nine fifteen and secondly in reference to the destinies of Sodom Ver sixteen twenty one What confirmation to Abraham s heart in the absolute promise Sarah shall have a son Yet this promise only elicited a laugh from Sarah as it had elicited one from Abraham in the preceding chapter There are two kinds of laughter spoken of in scripture There is first the laughter with which the Lord fills our mouth when at some trying crisis he appears in a signal manner for our relief When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion we were like them that dream Then was our mouth filled with laughter and our tongue with singing then said they among the heathen the Lord hath done great things for them the Lord hath done great things for us whereof we are glad Ps cxxvi one two Again there is the laughter with which unbelief fills our mouths when God s promises are too magnificent for our narrow hearts to take in or the visible agency too small in our judgment for the accomplishment of his grand designs The first of these we are never ashamed or afraid to avow Zion s sons are not ashamed to say then was our mouth filled with laughter Ps cxxvi two When Jehovah makes us to laugh we may laugh heartily But Sarah denied saying I laughed not for she was afraid Unbelief makes us cowards and liars faith makes us bold and truthful It enables us to come boldly and to draw near with true hearts But further Abraham is made the depositary of God s thoughts and counsels about Sodom Though having nothing to do with it personally yet he was so near the Lord that he was let into his mind in reference to it The way to know the divine purposes about this present evil world is not to be mixed up with it in its schemes and speculations but to be entirely separated from it The more closely we walk with God and the more subject we are to his word the more we shall know of his mind about every thing I do not need to study the newspaper in order to know what is going to happen in the world God s word reveals all I want to know In its pure and sanctifying pages I learn all about the character the course and the destiny of the world whereas if I go to the men of the world for news I may expect that the devil will use them to cast dust in my eyes Had Abraham visited Sodom in order to obtain information about its facts had he applied to some of its leading intelligent men to know what they thought of Sodom s present condition and future prospects how would he have been answered Doubtless they would have called his attention to their agricultural and architectural schemes the vast resources of the country they would have placed before his eyes one vast mingled scene of buying and selling building and planting eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage Doubtless too they would never dream of judgment and if any one had made mention thereof their mouths would have been filled with infidel laughter Hence then it is plain that Sodom was not the place in which to learn about Sodom s end No the place where Abraham stood before the Lord afforded the only proper point from whence to take in the whole prospect There he could stand entirely above the fogs and mists which had gathered upon Sodom s horizon There in the clearness and calmness of the divine presence he could understand it all And what use did he make of his knowledge and his elevated position How was he occupied in the Lord s presence The answer to these inquiries leads us to the third special privilege enjoyed by our patriarch in this chapter namely Intercession for others before the Lord He was enabled to plead for those who were mixed up in Sodom s defilement and in danger of being involved in Sodom s judgment This was a happy and a holy use to make of his place of nearness to God Thus it is ever The soul that can draw near to God in the assurance of faith having the heart and conscience perfectly at rest being able to repose in God as to the past the present and the future that soul will be able and willing to intercede for others The man who has on the whole armor of God will be able to pray for all saints And oh what a view this gives us of the intercession of our Great High priest who has passed into the heavens What infinite repose he enjoys in all the divine counsels With what conscious acceptance he sits enthroned amid the brightness of the Majesty in the heavens And with what efficacy he pleads before that Majesty for those who are toiling along amid the defilement of this present scene Happy ineffably happy they who are the subjects of such all prevailing intercession At once happy and secure Would that we had hearts to enter into all this hearts enlarged by personal communion with God to take in more of the infinite fulness of his grace and the suitability of his provision for all our need We see in this scripture that how blessed soever Abraham s intercession might be yet it was limited because the intercessor was but a man It did not reach the need He said I will speak yet but this once and there he stopped short as if afraid of having presented too large a draft at the treasury of infinite grace or forgetting that faith s check was never yet dishonored at God s bank It was not that he was straitened in God By no means There was abundance of grace and patience in him to have hearkened to his dear servant had he proceeded even to three or one But the servant was limited He was afraid of overdrawing his account He ceased to ask and God ceased to give Not so our blessed Intercessor Of him it can be said He is able to save to the uttermost seeing he ever liveth to make intercession May our hearts cling to him in all our need our weakness and our conflict Before closing this section I would offer a remark which whether it may be regarded as properly flowing out of the truth contained therein or not is nevertheless worthy of consideration It is of the utmost importance in the study of scripture to distinguish between God s moral government of the world and the specific hope of the Church The entire body of Old Testament prophecy and much of the New treats of the former and in so doing presents I need hardly say a subject of commanding interest to every Christian It is interesting to know what God is doing and will do with all the nations of the earth interesting to read God s thoughts about Tyre Babylon Nineveh and Jerusalem about Egypt Assyria and the land of Israel In short the entire range of Old Testament prophecy demands the prayerful attention of every true believer But let it be remembered we do not find therein contained the proper hope of the Church How could we If we have not therein the Church s existence directly revealed how could we have the Church s hope Impossible It is not that the Church cannot find there a rich harvest of divine moral principles which she may most happily and profitably use She undoubtedly can but this is quite another thing from finding there her proper existence and specific hope And yet a large portion of the Old Testament prophecies has been applied to the Church and this application has involved the whole subject in such mist and confusion that simple minds are scared away from the study and in neglecting the study of prophecy they have also neglected that which is quite distinct from prophecy properly so called even the hope of the Church which hope be it well remembered is not any thing which God is going to do with the nations of the earth but to meet the Lord Jesus in the clouds of heaven to be forever with him and forever like him Many may say I have no head for prophecy Perhaps not but you have a heart for Christ Surely if you love Christ you will love his appearing though you may have no capacity for prophetic investigation An affectionate wife may not have a head to enter into her husband s affairs but she has a heart for her husband s return She might not be able to understand his ledger and day book but she knows his footstep and recognizes his voice The most unlettered saint if only he has affection for the person of the Lord Jesus can entertain the most intense desire to see him and this is the Church s hope The apostle could say to the Thessalonians Ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God and to wait for his Son from heaven one Thess i nine ten Now evidently those Thessalonian saints could at the moment of their conversion have known little if any thing of prophecy or the special subject thereof and yet they were at that very moment put into the full possession and power of the specific hope of the Church even the coming of the Son Thus is it throughout the entire New Testament There no doubt we have prophecy there too we have God s moral government but at the same time numberless passages might be adduced in proof of the fact that the common hope of Christians in apostolic times the simple unimpeded and unencumbered hope was THE RETURN OF THE BRIDEGROOM May the Holy Ghost revive that blessed hope in the Church may he gather in the number of the elect and make ready a people prepared for the Lord CHAPTER XIX There are two methods which the Lord graciously adopts in order to draw the heart away from this present world The first is by setting before it the attractiveness and stability of things above The second is by faithfully declaring the evanescent and shakeable nature of things on the earth The close of Hebrews xii furnishes a beautiful example of each of these methods After stating the truth that we are come unto mount Zion with all its attendant joys and privileges the apostle goes on to say See that ye refuse not him that speaketh for if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven whose voice then shook the earth but now he hath promised saying Yet once I shake not only the earth but also heaven Now this word Once signifieth the removal of the shakeable things as of things that are made that the unshakeable things may remain Now it is much better to be drawn by the joys of heaven than driven by the sorrows of earth The believer should not wait to be shaken out of present things He should not wait for the world to give him up before he gives up the world He should give it up in the power of communion with heavenly things There is no difficulty in giving up the world when we have by faith laid hold of Christ the difficulty would then be to hold it If a scavenger were left an estate of ten thousand a year he would not long continue to sweep the streets Thus if we are realizing our portion amid the unshakeable realities of heaven we shall find little difficulty in resigning the delusive joys of earth Let us now look at the solemn section of inspired history here set before us In it we find Lot sitting in the gate of Sodom the place of authority He has evidently made progress He has got on in the world Looked at from a worldly point of view his course has been a successful one He at first pitched his tent toward Sodom Then no doubt he found his way into it and now we find him sitting in the gate a prominent influential post How different is all this from the scene with which the preceding chapter opens But ah my reader the reason is obvious By faith Abraham sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in tabernacles We have no such statement in reference to Lot sixteen It could not be said By faith Lot sat in the gate of Sodom Alas no he gets no place among the noble army of confessors the great cloud of witnesses to the power of faith The world was his snare present things his bane He did not endure as seeing him who is invisible He looked at the things which are seen and temporal whereas Abraham looked at the things which are unseen and eternal There was a most material difference between those two men who though they started together on their course reached a very different goal so far as their public testimony was concerned No doubt Lot was saved yet it was so as by fire for truly his work was burned up On the other hand Abraham had an abundant entrance ministered unto him into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ Further we do not find that Lot is permitted to enjoy any of the high distinctions and privileges with which Abraham was favored Instead of refreshing the Lord Lot gets his righteous soul vexed instead of enjoying communion with the Lord he is at a lamentable distance from the Lord and lastly instead of interceding for others he finds enough to do to intercede for himself The Lord remained to commune with Abraham and merely sent his angels to Sodom and these angels could with difficulty be induced to enter into Lot s house or partake of his hospitality they said Nay but we will abide in the street all night What a rebuke How different from the willing acceptance of Abraham s invitation as expressed in the words So do as thou hast said There is a great deal involved in the act of partaking of any one s hospitality It expresses when intelligently looked at full fellowship with him I will come in unto him and sup with him and he with me If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord come into my house and abide If they had not so judged her they would not have accepted her invitation Hence the angels word to Lot contains a most unqualified condemnation of his position in Sodom They would rather abide in the street all night than enter under the roof of one in a wrong position Indeed their only object in coming to Sodom seems to have been to deliver Lot and that too because of Abraham as we read And it came to pass when God destroyed the cities of the plain that God remembered Abraham and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt This is strongly marked It was simply for Abraham s sake that Lot was suffered to escape the Lord has no sympathy with a worldly mind and such a mind it was that had led Lot to settle down amid the defilement of that guilty city Faith never put him there a spiritual mind never put him there his righteous soul never put him there It was simple love for this present evil world that led him first to choose then to pitch his tent toward and finally to sit in the gate of Sodom And oh what a portion he chose Truly it was a broken cistern which could hold no water a broken reed which pierced his hand It is a bitter thing to seek in any wise to manage for ourselves we are sure to make the most grievous mistakes It is infinitely better to allow God to order all our ways for us to commit them all in the spirit of a little child to him who is so willing and so able to manage for us to put the pen as it were into his blessed hand and allow him to sketch out our entire course according to his own unerring wisdom and infinite love No doubt Lot thought he was doing well for himself and his family when he moved to Sodom but the sequel shows how entirely he erred and it also sounds in our ears a voice of deepest solemnity a voice telling us to beware how we yield to the incipient workings of a worldly spirit Be content with such things as ye have Why Is it because you are so well off in the world Because you have all that your poor rambling hearts would seek after Because there is not so much as a single chink in your circumstances through which a vain desire might make its escape Is this to be the ground of our contentment By no means What then For he hath said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee Blessed portion Had Lot been content therewith he never would have sought the well watered plains of Sodom And then if we need any further ground of inducement to the exercise of a contented spirit truly we have it in this chapter What did Lot gain in the way of happiness and contentment Little indeed The people of Sodom surround his house and threaten to break into it he seeks to appease them by a most humiliating proposition but all in vain If a man will mingle with the world for the purpose of self aggrandizement he must make up his mind to endure the sad consequences We cannot profit by the world and at the same time bear effectual testimony against its wickedness This one fellow came in to sojourn and he will needs be a judge This will never do The true way to judge is to stand apart in the moral power of grace not in the supercilious spirit of Pharisaism To attempt to reprove the world s ways while we profit by association with it is vanity the world will attach very little weight to such reproof and such testimony Thus it was too with Lot s testimony to his sons in law he seemed as one that mocked It is vain to speak of approaching judgment while finding our place our portion and our enjoyment in the very scene which is to be judged Abraham was in a far better position to speak of judgment inasmuch as he was entirely outside of the sphere thereof The tent of the stranger at Mamre was in no danger though Sodom were in flames Oh that our hearts longed more after the precious fruits of a realized strangership so that instead of having like poor Lot to be dragged by main force out of the world and casting a lingering look behind we might with holy alacrity bound forward like a racer towards the goal Lot evidently longed after the scene which he was forced by angelic power to abandon for not only had the angels to lay hold of him and hasten him away from the impending judgment but even when exhorted to escape for his life which was all he could save from the wreck and flee to the mountain he replies Oh not so my Lord behold now thy servant hath found grace in thy sight and thou hast magnified thy mercy which thou hast showed unto me in saving my life and I cannot escape to the mountain lest some evil take me and I die behold now this city is near to flee unto and it is a little one oh let me escape thither is it not a little one and my soul shall live What a picture He seems like a drowning man ready to catch even at a floating feather Though commanded by the angel to flee to the mountain he refuses and still fondly clings to the idea of a little city some little shred of the world He feared death in the place to which God was mercifully directing him yea he feared all manner of evil and could only hope for safety in some little city some spot of his own devising Oh let me escape thither and my soul shall live How sad There is no casting himself wholly upon God Alas he had too long walked at a distance from him too long breathed the dense atmosphere of a city to be able to appreciate the pure air of the divine presence or lean on the arm of the Almighty His soul seemed completely unhinged his worldly nest had been abruptly broken up and he was not quite able to nestle himself by faith in the bosom of God He had not been cultivating communion with the invisible world and now the visible was passing away from beneath his feet with tremendous rapidity The fire and brimstone from heaven were about to fall upon that in which all his hopes and all his affections were centred The thief had broken in upon him and he seems entirely divested of spiritual nerve and self possession He is at his wits end but the worldly element being strong in his heart prevails and he seeks his only refuge in a little city Yet he is not at ease even there for he leaves it and gets up to the mountain He does through fear what he would not do at the command of God s messenger And then see his end His own children make him drunk and in his drunkenness he becomes the instrument of bringing into existence the Ammonites and the Moabites the determined enemies of the people of God What a volume of solemn instruction is here Oh my reader see here what the world is see what a fatal thing it is to allow the heart to go out after it What a commentary is Lot s history upon that brief but comprehensive admonition Love not the world This world s Sodoms and its Zoars are all alike There is no security no peace no rest no solid satisfaction for the heart therein The judgment of God hangs over the whole scene and he only holds back the sword in long suffering mercy not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance Let us then seek to pursue a path of holy separation from the world Let us while standing outside its entire range be found cherishing the hope of the Master s return May its well watered plains have no charms for our hearts May its honors its distinctions and its riches be all surveyed by us in the light of the coming glory of Christ May we be enabled like the holy patriarch Abraham to get up into the presence of the Lord and from that elevated ground look forth upon the scene of wide spread ruin and desolation to see it all by faith s anticipative glance a smoking ruin Such it will be The earth also and the things that are therein shall be burned up All that about which the children of this world are so intensely anxious after which they are so eagerly grasping for which they are so fiercely contending all all will be burned up And who can tell how soon Where is Sodom Where is Gomorrah Where are the cities of the plain those cities which were once all life and stir and bustle Where are they now All gone swept away by the judgment of God Consumed by his fire and brimstone Well his judgments now hang over this guilty world The day is at hand and while judgments impend the sweet story of grace is being told out to many an ear Happy they who hear and believe that story Happy they who flee to the strong mountain of God s salvation who take refuge behind the cross of the Son of God and therein find pardon and peace God grant that the reader of these lines may know what it is with a conscience purged from sin and his heart s affections purged from the defiling influence of the world to wait for the Son from heaven FOOTNOTES sixteen It would furnish a very searching question for the heart in reference to every undertaking were we to ask Am I doing this by faith Whatever is not of faith is sin and Without faith it is impossible to please God CHAPTER XX We have two distinct points in this chapter first the moral degradation to which the child of God sometimes subjects himself in the view of the world and secondly the moral dignity which always belongs to him in the view of God Abraham again exhibits the dread of circumstances which the heart can so easily understand He sojourns in Gerar and fears the men of that place Judging that God was not there he forgets that he is always with him He seems to be more occupied with the men of Gerar than with the One who was stronger than they Forgetting God s ability to protect his wife he has recourse to the same stratagem which years before he had adopted in Egypt This is very admonitory The father of the faithful was carried away by taking his eye off God He lost for a little his centre in God and therefore gave way How true it is that we are only strong as we cling to God in the sense of our perfect weakness So long as we are in the path of his appointment nothing can harm us Had Abraham simply leaned on God the men of Gerar would not have meddled with him and it was his privilege to have vindicated God s faithfulness in the midst of the most appalling difficulties Thus too he would have maintained his own dignity as a man of faith It is often a source of sorrow to the heart to mark how the children of God dishonor him and as a consequence lower themselves before the world by losing the sense of his sufficiency for every emergency So long as we live in the realization of the truth that all our springs are in God so long shall we be above the world in every shape and form There is nothing so elevating to the whole moral being as faith it carries one entirely beyond the reach of this world s thoughts for how can the men of the world or even worldly minded Christians understand the life of faith Impossible the springs on which it draws lie far away beyond their comprehension They live on the surface of present things So long as they can see what they deem a proper foundation for hope and confidence so long they are hopeful and confident but the idea of resting solely on the promise of an unseen God they understand not But the man of faith is calm in the midst of scenes in which nature can see nothing Hence it is that faith ever seems in the judgment of nature such a reckless improvident visionary thing None but those who know God can ever approve the actings of faith for none but they really understand the solid and truly reasonable ground of such actings In this chapter we find the man of God actually exposing himself to the rebuke and reproach of the men of the world by reason of his actings when under the power of unbelief Thus it must ever be Nothing but faith can impart true elevation to a man s course and character We may it is true see some who are naturally upright and honorable in their ways yet nature s uprightness and honor cannot be trusted they rest on a bad foundation and are liable to give way at any moment It is only faith which can impart a truly elevated moral tone because it connects the soul in living power with God the only Source of true morality And it is a remarkable fact that in the case of all those whom God has graciously taken up we see that when off the path of faith they sank even lower than other men This will account for Abraham s conduct in this part of his history But there is another point of much interest and value brought out here We find that Abraham had harbored an evil thing for a number of years he had it seems started upon his course with a certain reserve in his soul which reserve was the result of his want of full unqualified confidence in God Had he been able fully to trust God in reference to Sarah there would have been no need of any reserve or subterfuge whatever God would have fenced her round about from every ill and who can harm those who are the happy subjects of his unslumbering guardianship However through mercy Abraham is enabled to bring out the root of the whole matter to confess and judge it thoroughly and get rid of it This is the true way to act There can be no real blessing and power till every particle of leaven is brought forth into the light and there trampled under foot God s patience is exhaustless He can wait He can bear with us but he never will conduct a soul to the culminating point of blessing and power while leaven remains known and unjudged Thus much as to Abimelech and Abraham Let us now look at the moral dignity of the latter in the view of God In the history of God s people whether we look at them as a whole or as individuals we are often struck with the amazing difference between what they are in God s view and what they are in the view of the world God sees his people in Christ He looks at them through Christ and hence he sees them without spot or wrinkle or any such thing They are as Christ is before God They are perfected forever as to their standing in Christ They are not in the flesh but in the Spirit But in themselves they are poor feeble imperfect stumbling inconsistent creatures and inasmuch as it is what they are in themselves and that alone that the world takes knowledge of therefore it is that the difference seems so great between the divine and the human estimate Yet it is God s prerogative to set forth the beauty the dignity and the perfection of his people It is his exclusive prerogative inasmuch as it is he himself who has bestowed those things They are only comely through the comeliness which he has put upon them and it is therefore due to him to declare what that comeliness is and truly he does it in a manner worthy of himself and never more blessedly than when the enemy comes forth to injure to curse or accuse Thus when Balak seeks to curse the seed of Abraham Jehovah s word is I have not beheld iniquity in Jacob neither have I seen perverseness in Israel How goodly are thy tents O Jacob and thy tabernacles O Israel Again when Satan stands forth to resist Joshua the word is The Lord rebuke thee O Satan is not this a brand plucked out of the fire Thus he ever puts himself between his people and every tongue that would accuse them He does not answer the accusation by a reference to what his people are in themselves or to what they are in the view of the men of this world but to what he himself has made them and where he set them Thus in Abraham s case he might lower himself in the view of Abimelech king of Gerar and Abimelech might have to rebuke him yet when God comes to deal with the case he says to Abimelech Behold thou art but a dead man and of Abraham he says He is a prophet and he shall pray for thee Yes with all the integrity of his heart and the innocency of his hands the king of Gerar was but a dead man and moreover he must be a debtor to the prayers of the erring and inconsistent stranger for the restoration of the health of his household Such is the manner of God he may have many a secret controversy with his child on the ground of his practical ways but directly the enemy enters a suit against him Jehovah ever pleads his servant s cause Touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm He that toucheth you toucheth the apple of mine eye It is God that justifieth who is he that condemneth No dart of the enemy can penetrate the shield behind which the Lord has hidden the very feeblest lamb of his blood bought flock He hides his people in his pavilion sets their feet upon the Rock of ages lifts their head above their enemies round about and fills their hearts with the everlasting joy of his salvation His name be praised for evermore CHAPTER XXI And the Lord visited Sarah as he had said and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken Here we have accomplished promise the blessed fruit of patient waiting upon God None ever waited in vain The soul that takes hold of God s promise by faith has gotten a stable reality which will never fail him Thus was it with Abraham thus was it with all the faithful from age to age and thus will it be with all those who are enabled in any measure to trust in the living God Oh it is a wonderful blessing to have God himself as our portion and resting place amid the unsatisfying shadows of this scene through which we are passing to have our anchor cast within the veil to have the word and oath of God the two immutable things to lean upon for the comfort and tranquillity of our souls When God s promise stood before the soul of Abraham as an accomplished fact he might well have learnt the futility of his own effort to reach that accomplishment Ishmael was of no use whatever so far as God s promise was concerned He might and did afford something for nature s affections to entwine themselves around thus furnishing a more difficult task for Abraham to perform afterwards but he was in no wise conducive to the development of the purpose of God or to the establishment of Abraham s faith quite the reverse Nature can never do aught for God The Lord must visit and the Lord must do and faith must wait and nature must be still yea must be entirely set aside as a dead worthless thing and then the divine glory can shine out and faith find in that outshining all its rich and sweet reward Sarah conceived and bare Abraham a son in his old age at the set time of which God had spoken to him There is such a thing as God s set time his due season and for this the faithful must be content to wait The time may seem long and hope deferred may make the heart sick but the spiritual mind will ever find its relief in the assurance that all is for the ultimate display of God s glory For the vision is for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it tarry wait for it because it will surely come it will not tarry but the just shall live by his faith Hab ii three four This wondrous faith It brings into our present all the power of God s future and feeds upon God s promise as a present reality By its power the soul is kept hanging upon God when every outward thing seems to be against it and at the set time the mouth is filled with laughter Abraham was an hundred years old when his son Isaac was born unto him Thus nature had nothing to glory in Man s extremity was God s opportunity and Sarah said God hath made me to laugh All is triumph when God is allowed to show himself Now while the birth of Isaac filled Sarah s mouth with laughter it introduced an entirely new element into Abraham s house The son of the free woman very speedily developed the true character of the son of the bond woman Indeed Isaac proved in principle to be to the household of Abraham what the implantation of the new nature is in the soul of a sinner It was not Ishmael changed but it was Isaac born The son of the bond woman could never be any thing else but that He might become a great nation he might dwell in the wilderness and become an archer he might become the father of twelve princes but he was the son of the bond woman all the while On the contrary no matter how weak and despised Isaac might be he was the son of the free woman His position and character his standing and prospects were all from the Lord That which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit Regeneration is not a change of the old nature but the introduction of a new it is the implantation of the nature or life of the second Adam by the operation of the Holy Ghost founded upon the accomplished redemption of Christ and in full keeping with the sovereign will or counsel of God The moment a sinner believes in his heart and confesses with his mouth the Lord Jesus he becomes the possessor of a new life and that life is Christ He is born of God is a child of God is a son of the free woman See Rom x nine colonel iii four one John iii one two Gal iii twenty six iv thirty one Nor does the introduction of this new nature alter in the slightest degree the true essential character of the old This latter continues what it was and is made in no respect better yea rather there is the full display of its evil character in opposition to the new element The flesh lusteth against the Spirit and the Spirit against the flesh and these are contrary the one to the other There they are in all their distinctness and the one is only thrown into relief by the other I believe this doctrine of the two natures in the believer is not generally understood and yet so long as there is ignorance of it the mind must be utterly at sea in reference to the true standing and privileges of the child of God Some there are who think that regeneration is a certain change which the old nature undergoes and moreover that this change is gradual in its operation until at length the whole man becomes transformed That this idea is unsound can be proved by various quotations from the New Testament For example the carnal mind is enmity against God How can that which is thus spoken of ever undergo any improvement The apostle goes on to say it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be If it cannot be subject to the law of God how can it be improved How can it undergo any change Again that which is born of the flesh is flesh Do what you will with flesh and it is flesh all the while As Solomon says Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle yet will not his foolishness depart from him Prov xxvii twenty two There is no use in seeking to make foolishness wise you must introduce heavenly wisdom into the heart that has been heretofore only governed by folly Again ye have put off the old man colonel iii nine He does not say Ye have improved or are seeking to improve the old man but Ye have put it off This gives us a totally different idea There is a very great difference between seeking to mend an old garment and casting it aside altogether and putting on a new one This is the idea of the last quoted passage It is a putting off the old and a putting on of the new Nothing can be more distinct or simple Passages might easily be multiplied to prove the unsoundness of the theory with respect to the gradual improvement of the old nature to prove that the old nature is dead in sins and utterly unrenewable and unimproveable and moreover that the only thing we can do with it is to keep it under our feet in the power of that new life which we have in union with our risen Head in the heavens The birth of Isaac did not improve Ishmael but only brought out his real opposition to the child of promise He might have gone on very quietly and orderly till Isaac made his appearance but then he showed what he was by persecuting and mocking at the child of resurrection What then was the remedy To make Ishmael better By no means but cast out this bond woman and her son for the son of this bond woman shall not be heir with my son even with Isaac eight ten Here was the only remedy That which is crooked cannot be made straight therefore you have only to get rid of the crooked thing altogether and occupy yourself with that which is divinely straight It is labor lost to seek to make a crooked thing straight Hence all efforts after the improvement of nature are utterly futile so far as God is concerned It may be all very well for men to cultivate and improve that which is of use to themselves but God has given his children something infinitely better to do even to cultivate that which is his own creation the fruits of which while they in no wise serve to exalt nature are entirely to his praise and glory Now the error into which the Galatian churches fell was the introduction of that which addressed itself to nature Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses ye cannot be saved Here salvation was made to depend upon something that man could be or man could do or man could keep This was upsetting the whole glorious fabric of redemption which as the believer knows rests exclusively upon what Christ is and what he has done To make salvation dependent in the most remote manner upon any thing in or done by man is to set it entirely aside In other words Ishmael must be entirely cast out and all Abraham s hopes be made to depend upon what God had done and given in the person of Isaac This it is needless to say leaves man nothing to glory in If present or future blessedness were made to depend upon even a divine change wrought in nature flesh might glory Though my nature were improved it would be something of me and thus God would not have all the glory But when I am introduced into a new creation I find it is all of God designed matured developed by himself alone God is the actor and I am a worshipper he is the blesser and I am the blessed he is the better and I am the less Heb vii seven he is the giver and I am the receiver This is what makes Christianity what it is and moreover distinguishes it from every system of human religion under the sun whether it be Romanism Puseyism or any other ism whatsoever Human religion gives the creature a place more or less it keeps the bond woman and her son in the house it gives man something to glory in On the contrary Christianity excludes the creature from all interference in the work of salvation casts out the bond woman and her son and gives all the glory to him to whom alone it is due But let us inquire who this bond woman and her son really are and what they shadow forth Galatians iv furnishes ample teaching as to these two points In a word then the bond woman represents the covenant of the law and her son represents all who are of works of law or on that principle Greek ex ergon nomou This is very plain The bond woman only genders to bondage and can never bring forth a free man How can she The law never could give liberty for so long as a man was alive it ruled him Rom vii one I can never be free so long as I am under the dominion of any one But while I live the law rules me and nothing but death can give me deliverance from its dominion This is the blessed doctrine of Romans vii Wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ that ye should be married to another even to him that is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God This is freedom for If the Son shall make you free ye shall be free indeed John viii thirty six So then brethren we are not children of the bond woman but of the free Gal iv thirty one Now it is in the power of this freedom that we are enabled to obey the command Cast out this bond woman and her son If I am not consciously free I shall be seeking to attain liberty in the strangest way possible even by keeping the bond woman in the house in other words I shall be seeking to get life by keeping the law I shall be establishing any own righteousness No doubt it will involve a struggle to cast out this element of bondage for legalism is natural to our hearts The thing was very grievous in Abraham s sight because of his son Still however grievous it may be it is according to the divine mind that we should abidingly stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free and not be entangled again with the yoke of bondage Gal v one May we beloved reader so fully and experimentally enter into the blessedness of God s provision for us in Christ that we may be done with all thoughts about the flesh and all that it can be do or produce There is a fulness in Christ which renders all appeal to nature utterly superfluous and vain CHAPTER XXII Abraham is now in a fit moral position to have his heart put to a most severe test The long cherished reserve being put forth from his heart in Chap xx the bond woman and her son being put forth from his house as in Chap xxi he now stands forth in the most honored position in which any soul can be placed and that is a position of trial from the hand of God himself There are various kinds of trial trial from the hand of Satan trial from surrounding circumstances but the highest character of trial is that which comes directly from the hand of God when he puts his dear child into the furnace for the purpose of testing the reality of his faith God will do this he must have reality It will not do to say Lord Lord or I go sir The heart must be probed to the very bottom in order that no element of hypocrisy or false profession may be allowed to lodge there My son give me thine heart He does not say Give me thine head or thine intellect or thy talents or thy tongue or thy money but Give me thine heart and in order to prove the sincerity of our response to this gracious command he will lay his hand upon something very near our hearts Thus he says to Abraham Take now thy son thine only son Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of Moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of This was coming very close to Abraham s heart It was passing him through a searching crucible indeed God requires truth in the inward parts There may be much truth on the lips and much in the intellect but God looks for it in the heart It is no ordinary proof that will satisfy God as to the love of our hearts He himself did not rest satisfied with giving an ordinary proof He gave his Son and we should aim at giving very striking proofs of our love to him who so loved us even when we were dead in trespasses and sins However it is well to see that God confers a signal honor upon us when he thus tests our hearts We never read that the Lord did tempt Lot No Sodom tempted Lot He never reached a sufficiently high elevation to warrant his being tried by the hand of Jehovah It was too plainly manifest that there was plenty between his heart and the Lord and it did not therefore require the furnace to bring that out Sodom would have held out no temptation whatever to Abraham This was made manifest in his interview with Sodom s king in Chapter xiv God knew well that Abraham loved him far better than Sodom but he would make it manifest that he loved him better than any one or any thing by laying his hand upon the nearest and dearest object Take now thy son thine only son Isaac Yes Isaac the child of promise Isaac the object of long deferred hope the object of parental love and the one in whom all the kindreds of the earth were to be blessed This Isaac must be offered as a burnt offering This surely was putting faith to the test in order that being more precious than gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire it might be found unto praise and honor and glory Had Abraham s whole soul not been stayed simply on the Lord he never could have yielded unhesitating obedience to such a searching command But God himself was the living and abiding support of his heart and therefore he was prepared to give up all for him The soul that has found all its springs in God can without any demur retire from all creature streams We can give up the creature just in proportion as we have found out or become experimentally acquainted with the Creator and no further To attempt to give up the visible things in any other way save in the energy of that faith which lays hold of the invisible is the most fruitless labor possible It cannot be done I will hold fast my Isaac until I have found my all in God It is when we are enabled by faith to say God is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble that we can also add therefore will we not fear though the earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea Ps xlvi one two And Abraham rose up early in the morning There is ready obedience I made haste and delayed not to keep thy commandments Faith never stops to look at circumstances or ponder results it only looks at God it expresses itself thus But when it pleased God who separated me from my mother s womb and called me by his grace to reveal his Son in me that I might preach him among the Gentiles immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood Gal i fifteen sixteen The moment we confer with flesh and blood our testimony and service are marred for flesh and blood can never obey We must rise early and carry out through grace the divine command Thus we are blessed and God is glorified Having God s own word as the basis of our acting will ever impart strength and stability to our acting If we merely act from impulse when the impulse subsides the acting will subside also There are two things needful to a course of steady and consistent action viz the Holy Ghost as the power of action and the word to give proper direction To use a familiar illustration on a railway we should find steam of little use without the iron rails firmly laid down the former is the power by which we move and the latter the direction It is needless to add that the rails would be of little use without the steam Now Abraham was blessed with both He had the power of action conferred by God and the command to act given by God also His devotedness was of a most definite character and this is deeply important We frequently find much that looks like devotedness but which in reality is but the desultory activity of a will not brought under the powerful action of the word of God All such apparent devotedness is worthless and the spirit from which it proceeds will very speedily evaporate We may lay down the following principle viz whenever devotedness passes beyond divinely appointed bounds it is suspicious If it comes not up to these bounds it is defective if it flows without them it is erratic I quite admit that there are extraordinary operations and ways of the Spirit of God in which he asserts his own sovereignty and rises above ordinary bounds but in such cases the evidence of divine activity will be sufficiently strong to carry home conviction to every spiritual mind nor will they in the slightest degree interfere with the truth of the principle that true devotedness will ever be founded upon and governed by divine principle To sacrifice a son might seem to be an act of most extraordinary devotedness but be it remembered that what gave that act all its value in God s sight was the simple fact of its being based upon God s command Then we have another thing connected with true devotedness and that is a spirit of worship I and the lad will go yonder and worship The really devoted servant will keep his eye not on his service be it ever so great but on the Master and this will produce a spirit of worship If I love my master according to the flesh I shall not mind whether I am cleaning his shoes or driving his carriage but if I am thinking more of myself than of him I shall rather be a coachman than a shoeblack So it is precisely in the service of the heavenly Master if I am thinking only of him planting churches and making tents will be both alike to me We may see the same thine in angelic ministry It matters not to an angel whether he be sent to destroy an army or to protect the person of some heir of salvation It is the Master who entirely fills his vision As some one has remarked if two angels were sent from heaven one to rule an empire and the other to sweep the streets they would not dispute about their respective work This is most true and so should it be with us The servant should ever be combined with the worshipper and the works of our hands perfumed with the ardent breathings of our spirits In other words we should go forth to our work in the spirit of those memorable words I and the lad will go yonder and worship This would effectually preserve us from that merely mechanical service into which we are so prone to drop doing things for doing s sake and being more occupied with our work than with our Master All must flow from simple faith in God and obedience to his word By faith Abraham when he was tried offered up Isaac and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten Heb xi seventeen It is only as we are walking by faith that we can begin continue and end our works in God Abraham not merely set out to offer his son but he went on and reached the spot which God had appointed And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac his son and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together And further on we read And Abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood And Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son This was real work a work of faith and labor of love in the highest sense It was no mere mockery no drawing near with the lips while the heart was far off no saying I go sir and went not It was all deep reality just such as faith ever delights to produce and which God delights to accept It is easy to make a show of devotedness when there is no demand for it It is easy to say though all shall be offended because of thee yet will I never be offended though I should die with thee yet will I not deny thee but the point is to stand the trial When Peter was put to the test he entirely broke down Faith never talks of what it will do but does what it can in the strength of the Lord Nothing can be more thoroughly worthless than a spirit of empty pretension It is just as worthless as the basis on which it rests But faith acts when it is tried and till then it is content to be unseen and silent Now it needs hardly to be remarked that God is glorified in those holy activities of faith He is the immediate object of them as he is the spring from whence they emanate There was not a scene in Abraham s entire history in which God was so much glorified as the scene on Mount Moriah There it was that he was enabled to bear testimony to the fact that he had found all his fresh springs in God found them not merely previous to but after Isaac s birth This is a most touching point It is one thing to rest in God s blessings and another thing to rest in himself It is one thing to trust God when I have before my eyes the channel through which the blessing is to flow and quite another thing to trust him when that channel is entirely stopped up This was what proved the excellency of Abraham s faith He showed that he could not merely trust God for an innumerable seed while Isaac stood before him in health and vigor but just as fully if he were a smoking victim on the altar This was a high order of confidence in God it was unalloyed confidence it was not a confidence propped up in part by the Creator and in part by the creature No it rested on one solid pedestal viz God himself He accounted that God was able He never accounted that Isaac was able Isaac without God was nothing God without Isaac was every thing This is a principle of the very last importance and one eminently calculated to test the heart most keenly Does it make any difference to me to see the apparent channel of all my blessings dried up Am I dwelling sufficiently near the fountain head to be able with a worshipping spirit to behold all the creature streams dried up This I do feel to be a searching question Have I such a simple view of God s sufficiency as to be able as it were to stretch forth my hand and take the knife to slay my son Abraham was enabled to do this because his eye rested on the God of resurrection He accounted that God was able to raise him up even from the dead In a word it was with God he had to do and that was quite enough He was not suffered to strike the blow He had gone to the very utmost bounds he had come up to the line beyond which God could not suffer him to go The Blessed One spared the father s heart the pang which he did not spare his own heart even that of smiting his Son He blessed be his name passed beyond the utmost bounds for he spared not his own Son but delivered him up for us all It pleased the Lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief There was no voice from heaven when on Calvary the Father offered up his only begotten Son No it was a perfectly accomplished sacrifice and in its accomplishment our everlasting peace is sealed However Abraham s devotedness was fully proved and fully accepted For now I know that thou fearest God seeing thou hast not withheld thy son thine only son from me Mark it is now I know It had never been proved before It was there no doubt and if there God knew it but the valuable point here is that God founds his knowledge of it upon the palpable evidence afforded at the altar upon Mount Moriah Faith is always proved by action and the fear of God by the fruits which flow from it Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he had offered Isaac his son on the altar James ii twenty one Who could think of calling his faith in question Take away faith and Abraham appears on Moriah as a murderer and a madman Take faith into account and he appears as a devoted worshipper a God fearing justified man But faith must be proved What doth it profit my brethren though a man say he hath faith and have not works James ii fourteen Will either God or man be satisfied with a powerless and profitless profession Surely not God looks for reality and honors it where he sees it and as for man he can understand naught save the living and intelligible utterance of a faith that shows itself in acts We are surrounded by the profession of religion the phraseology of faith is on every lip but faith itself is as rare a gem as ever that faith which will enable a man to push out from the shore of present circumstances and meet the waves and the winds and not only meet them but endure them even though the Master should seem to be asleep on the pillow And here I would remark the beautiful harmony between saint James and saint Paul on the subject of justification The intelligent and spiritual reader who bows to the important truth of the plenary inspiration of holy scripture knows full well that on this question it is not with Paul or James we have to do but with the Holy Ghost who graciously used each of those honored men as the pen to write his thoughts just as I might take up a quill pen or a steel pen to write my thoughts in which case it would be quite preposterous to speak of a discrepancy between the two pens inasmuch as the writer is one Hence it is just as impossible that two divinely inspired penmen could clash as that two heavenly bodies while moving in their divinely appointed orbits could come into collision But in reality as might be expected there is the fullest and most perfect harmony between those two apostles indeed on the subject of justification the one is the counterpart or exponent of the other saint Paul gives us the inward principle saint James the outward development of that principle the former presents the hidden life the latter the manifested life the former looks at man in relation to God the latter looks at him in his relation to man Now we want both the inward would not do without the outward and the outward would be valueless and powerless without the inward Abraham was justified when he believed God and Abraham was justified when he offered Isaac his son In the former case we have his secret standing in the latter his public acknowledgment by heaven and earth It is well to understand this distinction There was no voice from heaven when Abraham believed God though in God s view he was there then and thus counted righteous but when he had offered his son upon the altar God could say now I know and all the world had a powerful and unanswerable proof of the fact that Abraham was a justified man Thus will it ever be Where there is the inward principle there will be the outward acting but all the value of the latter springs from its connection with the former Disconnect for one moment Abraham s acting as set forth by saint James from Abraham s faith as set forth by saint Paul and what justifying virtue did it possess None whatever All its value all its efficacy all its virtue springs from the fact that it was the outward manifestation of that faith by virtue of which he had been already counted righteous before God Thus much as to the admirable harmony between saint Paul and saint James or rather as to the unity of the voice of the Holy Ghost whether that voice be uttered by saint Paul or saint James We now return to our chapter It is deeply interesting to mark here how Abraham s soul is led into a fresh discovery of God s character by the trial of his faith When we are enabled to bear the testings of God s own hand it is sure to lead us into some new experience with respect to his character which makes us to know how valuable the testing is If Abraham had not stretched out his hand to slay his son he never would have known the rich and exquisite depths of that title which he here bestows upon God viz Jehovah Jireh It is only when we are really put to the test that we discover what God is Without trial we can be but theorists and God would not have us such he would have us entering into the living depths that are in himself the divine realities of personal communion with him With what different feelings and convictions must Abraham have retraced his steps from Moriah to Beersheba from the mount of the Lord to the well of the oath What very different thoughts of God What different thoughts of Isaac What different thoughts of every thing Truly we may say Happy is the man that endureth trial It is an honor put upon one by the Lord himself and the deep blessedness of the experience to which it leads cannot easily be estimated It is when men are brought to use the language of the one hundred and seventh Psalm to their wits end that they discover what God is Oh for grace to endure trial that God s workmanship may appear and his name be glorified in us There is one point which before closing my remarks on this chapter I shall notice and that is the gracious way in which God gives Abraham credit for having done the act which he had showed himself so fully prepared to do By myself have I sworn saith the Lord for because thou hast done this thing and hast not withheld thy son thine only son that in blessing I will bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven and as the sand which is upon the sea shore and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou hast obeyed my voice This beautifully corresponds with the Spirit s notice of Abraham s acting as put before us in Heb xi and also in James ii in both of which scriptures he is looked upon as having offered Isaac his son upon the altar The grand principle conveyed in the whole matter is this Abraham proved that he was prepared to have the scene entirely cleared of all but God and moreover it was this same principle which both constituted and proved him a justified man Faith can do without every one and every thing but God It has the full sense of his sufficiency and can therefore let go all beside Hence Abraham could rightly estimate the words by myself have I sworn Yes this wondrous word myself was every thing to the man of faith For when God made promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he sware by himself For men verily swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife Wherein God willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath The word and oath of the living God should put an end to all the strivings and workings of the human will and form the immovable anchor of the soul amid all the tossing and tumult of this stormy world Now we must condemn ourselves constantly because of the little power which the promise of God has in our hearts There it is and we profess to believe it but ah it is not that deep abiding influential reality which it ought ever to be we do not draw from it that strong consolation which it is calculated to afford How little prepared are we in the power of faith in the promise of God to slay our Isaac We need to cry to God that he would be graciously pleased to endow us with a deeper insight into the blessed reality of a life of faith in himself that so we may understand better the import of that word of saint John This is the victory that overcometh the world even your faith We can only overcome the world by faith Unbelief puts us under the power of present things in other words it gives the world the victory over us A soul that has entered by the teaching of the Holy Ghost into the sense of God s sufficiency is entirely independent of things here Beloved reader may we know this for our peace and joy in God and his glory in us CHAPTER XXIII This little section of inspiration furnishes much sweet and profitable instruction to the soul In it the Holy Spirit sets before us a beautiful exhibition of the mode in which the man of faith should carry himself toward those that are without While it is true divinely true that faith makes a man independent of the men of the world it is no less true that faith will ever teach him to walk honestly toward them We are told to walk honestly toward them that are without one Thess iv twelve to provide things honest in the sight of all two Cor viii twenty one to owe no man any thing Rom xiii eight These are weighty precepts precepts which even before their distinct enunciation were duly observed in all ages by the faithful servants of Christ but which in modern times alas have not been sufficiently attended to The twenty threed of Genesis therefore is worthy of special notice It opens with the death of Sarah and introduces Abraham in a new character viz that of a mourner Abraham came to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her The child of God must meet such things but he must not meet them as others The great fact of resurrection comes in to his relief and imparts a character to his sorrow quite peculiar one Thess iv thirteen fourteen The man of faith can stand at the grave of a brother or sister in the happy consciousness that it shall not long hold its captive For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him The redemption of the soul secures the redemption of the body the former we have the latter we wait for Rom viii twenty three Now I believe that in purchasing Machpelah for a burying place Abraham gave expression to his faith in resurrection He stood up from before his dead Faith cannot long keep death in view it has a higher object blessed be the living God who has given it Resurrection is that which ever fills the vision of faith and in the power thereof it can rise up from before the dead There is much conveyed in this action of Abraham We want to understand its meaning much more fully because we are much too prone to be occupied with death and its consequences Death is the boundary of Satan s power but where Satan ends God begins Abraham understood this when he rose up and purchased the cave of Machpelah as a sleeping place for Sarah This was the expression of Abraham s thought in reference to the future He knew that in the ages to come God s promise about the land of Canaan would be fulfilled and he was able to lay the body of Sarah in the tomb in sure and certain hope of a glorious resurrection The sons of Heth knew nothing about this The thoughts which were filling the patriarch s soul were entirely foreign to the uncircumcised children of Heth To them it seemed a small matter where he buried his dead but it was by no means a small matter to him I am a stranger and a sojourner with you give me a possession of a burying place with you that I may bury my dead out of my sight It might and manifestly did appear strange to them to make so much ado about a grave but beloved the world knoweth us not even as it knew him not The finest traits and characteristics of faith are those which are most incomprehensible to the natural man The Canaanites had no idea of the expectations which were giving character to Abraham s actings on this occasion They had no idea that he was looking forward to the possession of the land while he was merely looking for a spot in which as a dead man he might wait for God s time and God s manner viz the MORNING OF RESURRECTION He felt he had no controversy with the children of Heth and hence he was quite prepared to lay his head in the grave and allow God to act for him and with him and by him These all died in or according to faith Greek kata pistin not having received the promises but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth Heb xi thirteen This is a truly exquisite feature in the divine life Those witnesses of whom the apostle is speaking in Heb xi not merely lived by faith but even when they arrived at the close of their career they proved that the promises of God were as real and satisfying to their souls as when they first started Now I believe this purchase of a burying place in the land was an exhibition of the power of faith not only to live but to die Why was Abraham so particular about this purchase Why was he so anxious to make good his claim to the field and cave of Ephron on righteous principles Why so determined to weigh out the full price current with the merchant FAITH is the answer He did it all by faith He knew the land was his in prospect and that in resurrection glory his seed should yet possess it and until then he would be no debtor to those who were yet to be dispossessed Thus we may view this beautiful chapter in a twofold light first as setting before us a plain practical principle as to our dealings with the men of this world and secondly as presenting the blessed hope which should ever animate the man of faith Putting both these points together we have an example of what the child of God should ever be The hope set before us in the gospel is a glorious immortality and this while it lifts the heart above every influence of nature and the world furnishes a high and holy principle with which to govern all our intercourse with those who are without We know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is This is our hope What is the moral effect of this Every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure one John iii two three If I am to be like Christ by and by I shall seek to be as like him now as I can Hence the Christian should ever seek to walk in purity integrity and moral grace in the view of all around Thus it was with Abraham in reference to the sons of Heth His whole deportment and conduct as set forth in our chapter would seem to have been marked with very pure elevation and disinterestedness He was a mighty prince among them and they would fain have done him a favor but Abraham had learnt to take his favors only from the God of resurrection and while he would pay them for Machpelah he would look to him for Canaan The sons of Heth knew well the value of current money with the merchant and Abraham knew the value of the cave of Machpelah It was worth much more to him than it was to them The land was worth to them four hundred shekels of silver but to him it was priceless as the earnest of an everlasting inheritance which because it was an everlasting inheritance could only be possessed in the power of resurrection Faith conducts the soul onward into God s future it looks at things as he looks at them and estimates them according to the judgment of the sanctuary Therefore in the intelligence of faith Abraham stood up from before his dead and purchased a burying place which significantly set forth his hope of resurrection and of an inheritance founded thereon CHAPTER XXIV The connection of this chapter with the two which precede it is worthy of notice In Chapter xxii the son is offered up in Chap xxiii Sarah is laid aside and in Chapter xxiv the servant is sent forth to procure a bride for him who had been as it were received from the dead in a figure This connection in a very striking manner coincides with the order of events connected with the calling out of the Church Whether this coincidence is to be regarded as of divine origin will it may be raise a question in the minds of some but it must at least be regarded as not a little remarkable When we turn to the New Testament the grand events which meet our view are first the rejection and death of Christ secondly the setting aside of Israel after the flesh and lastly the calling out of the Church to occupy the high position of the bride of the Lamb Now all this exactly corresponds with the contents of this and the two preceding chapters The death of Christ needed to be an accomplished fact ere the Church properly so called could be called out The middle wall of partition needed to be broken down ere the one new man could be developed It is well to understand this in order that we may know the place which the Church occupies in the ways of God So long as the Jewish economy subsisted there was the most strict separation maintained between Jew and Gentile and hence the idea of both being united in one new man was far removed from the mind of a Jew He was led to view himself in a position of entire superiority to that of a Gentile and to view the latter as utterly unclean to whom it was unlawful to come in Acts x twenty eight If Israel had walked with God according to the truth of the relationship into which he had graciously brought them they would have continued in their peculiar place of separation and superiority but this they did not do and therefore when they had filled up the measure of their iniquity by crucifying the Lord of life and glory and rejecting the testimony of the Holy Ghost we find saint Paul is raised up to be the minister of a new thing which was held back in the counsels of God while the testimony to Israel was going on For this cause I Paul the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you ward how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets i e New Testament prophets Greek tois hagiois apostolois autou kai prophetais by the Spirit that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel Eph iii one six This is conclusive The mystery of the Church composed of Jew and Gentile baptized by one Spirit into one body united to the glorious Head in the heavens had never been revealed until Paul s day Of this mystery the apostle goes on to say I was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power Ver seven The apostles and prophets of the New Testament formed as it were the first layer of this glorious building See Eph ii twenty This being so it follows as a consequence that the building could not have been begun before If the building had been going on from the days of Abel downwards the apostle would then have said the foundation of the Old Testament saints But he has not said so and therefore we conclude that whatever be the position assigned to the Old Testament saints they cannot possibly belong to a body which had no existence save in the purpose of God until the death and resurrection of Christ and the consequent descent of the Holy Ghost Saved they were blessed be God saved by the blood of Christ and destined to enjoy heavenly glory with the Church but they could not have formed a part of that which did not exist for hundreds of years after their time It were easy to enter upon a more elaborate demonstration of this most important truth were this the place for so doing but I shall now go on with our chapter having merely touched upon a question of commanding interest because of its being suggested by the position of the twenty fourth of Genesis There may be a question in some minds as to whether we are to view this deeply interesting portion of scripture as a type of the calling out of the Church by the Holy Ghost For myself I feel happier in merely handling it as an illustration of that glorious work We cannot suppose that the Spirit of God would occupy an unusually long chapter with the mere detail of a family compact were that compact not typical or illustrative of some great truth Whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning This is emphatic What therefore are we to learn from the chapter before us I believe it furnishes us with a beautiful illustration or foreshadowing of the great mystery of the Church It is important to see that while there is no direct revelation of this mystery in the Old Testament there are nevertheless scenes and circumstances which in a very remarkable manner shadow it forth as for example the chapter before us As has been remarked the son being in a figure offered up and received again from the dead the original parent stem as it were being laid aside the messenger is sent forth by the father to procure a bride for the son Now in order to the clear and full understanding of the contents of the entire chapter we may consider the following points viz one the oath two the testimony three the result It is beautiful to observe that the call and exaltation of Rebekah were founded upon the oath between Abraham and his servant She knew nothing of this though she was in the purpose of God so entirely the subject of it all So it is exactly with the Church of God as a whole and each constituent part In thy book were all my members written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there were none of them Ps cxxxix sixteen Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in the heavenlies in Christ according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love Eph i three four For whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son that he might be the first born among many brethren Moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified Rom viii twenty nine thirty These scriptures are all in beautiful harmony with the point immediately before us The call the justification and the glory of the Church are all founded on the eternal purpose of God his word and oath ratified by the death resurrection and exaltation of the Son Far back beyond the bounds of time in the deep recesses of God s eternal mind lay this wondrous purpose respecting the Church which cannot by any means be separated from the divine thought respecting the glory of the Son The oath between Abraham and the servant had for its object the provision of a partner for the son It was the father s desire with respect to the son that all led to Rebekah s after dignity It is happy to see this Happy to see how the Church s security and blessing stand inseparably connected with Christ and his glory For the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man Neither was the man created for the woman but the woman for the man one Cor xi eight nine So it is in the beautiful parable of the marriage supper the kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king which made a marriage for his son Matt xxii two THE SON is the grand object of all the thoughts and counsels of God and if any are brought into blessing or glory or dignity it can only be in connection with him All title to these things and even to life itself was forfeited by sin but Christ met all the penalty due to sin he made himself responsible for every thing on behalf of his body the Church he was nailed to the cross as her representative he bore her sins in his own body on the tree and went down into the grave under the full weight of them Hence nothing can be more complete than the Church s deliverance from all that was against her She is quickened out of the grave of Christ where all her trespasses were laid The life which she has is a life taken up at the other side of death after every possible demand had been met Hence this life is connected with and founded upon divine righteousness inasmuch as Christ s title to life is founded upon his having entirely exhausted the power of death and he is the Church s life Thus the Church enjoys divine life she stands in divine righteousness and the hope that animates her is the hope of righteousness See amongst many other scriptures John iii sixteen thirty six v thirty nine forty vi twenty seven forty forty seven sixty eight xi twenty five xvii two Rom v twenty one vi twenty three one Tim i sixteen one John ii twenty five v twenty Jude twenty one Eph ii one six fourteen fifteen colonel i twelve twenty two ii ten fifteen Rom i seventeen iii twenty one twenty six iv five twenty three twenty five two Cor v twenty one Gal v five These scriptures most fully establish the three points viz the life the righteousness and the hope of the Church all of which flow from her being one with him who was raised from the dead Now nothing can be so calculated to assure the heart as the conviction that the Church s existence is essential to the glory of Christ The woman is the glory of the man one Cor xi seven And again the Church is called the fulness of him that filleth all in all Eph i twenty three This last is a remarkable expression The word translated fulness means the complement that which being added to something else makes up a whole Thus it is that Christ the Head and the Church the body make up the one new man Eph ii fifteen Looking at the matter in this point of view it is no marvel that the Church should have been the object of God s eternal counsels When we view her as the body the bride the companion the counterpart of his only begotten Son we feel that there was through grace wondrous reason for her being so thought of before the foundation of the world Rebekah was necessary to Isaac and therefore she was the subject of secret counsel while yet in profound ignorance about her high destiny All Abraham s thought was about Isaac I will make thee swear by the Lord the God of heaven and the God of the earth that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I dwell Here we see that the all important point was a wife unto my son It is not good that the man should be alone This opens up a very deep and blessed view of the Church In the counsels of God she is necessary to Christ and in the accomplished work of Christ divine provision has been made for her being called into existence While occupied with such a character of truth as this it is no longer a question as to whether God can save poor sinners he actually wants to make a marriage for his Son and the Church is the destined bride she is the object of the Father s purpose the object of the Son s love and of the testimony of the Holy Ghost She is to be the sharer of all the Son s dignity and glory as she is the sharer of all that love of which he has been the everlasting object Hear his own words And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them that they may be one even as we are one I in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou hast sent me and hast loved them as thou hast loved me John xvii twenty two twenty three This settles the whole question The words just quoted give us the thoughts of Christ s heart in reference to the Church She is to be as he is and not only so but she is so even now as saint John tells us Herein is love perfected with us that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world one John iv seventeen This gives full confidence to the soul We are in him that is true in his Son Jesus Christ This is the true God and eternal life one John v twenty There is here no ground for uncertainty Every thing is secured for the bride in the bridegroom All that belonged to Isaac became Rebekah s because Isaac was hers and so all that belongs to Christ is made available to the Church All things are yours whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come all are yours and ye are Christ s and Christ is God s one Cor iii twenty one twenty three Christ is head over all things to the Church Eph i twenty two It will be his joy throughout eternity to exhibit the Church in all the glory and beauty with which he has endowed her for her glory and beauty will be but the reflection of his Angels and principalities shall behold in the Church the marvellous display of the wisdom power and grace of God in Christ But we shall now look at the second point for consideration viz the testimony Abraham s servant carried with him a very distinct testimony And he said I am Abraham s servant And the Lord hath blessed my master greatly and he is become great and he hath given him flocks and herds and silver and gold and men servants and maid servants and camels and asses And Sarah my master s wife bare a son to my master when she was old and unto him hath he given all that he hath Ver thirty four thirty six He reveals the father and the son Such was his testimony He speaks of the vast resources of the father and of the son s being endowed with all these in virtue of his being the only begotten and the object of the father s love With this testimony he seeks to obtain a bride for the son All this I need hardly remark is strikingly illustrative of the testimony with which the Holy Ghost was sent from heaven upon the day of Pentecost When the Comforter is come whom I will send unto you from the Father even the Spirit of truth which proceedeth from the Father he shall testify of me John xv twenty six Again Howbeit when he the Spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come He shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and show it unto you All things that the Father hath are mine therefore said I that he shall take of mine and shall show it unto you John xvi thirteen fifteen The coincidence of these words with the testimony of Abraham s servant is instructive and interesting It was by telling of Isaac that he sought to attract the heart of Rebekah and it is as we know by telling of Jesus that the Holy Ghost seeks to draw poor sinners away from a world of sin and folly into the blessed and holy unity of the body of Christ He shall take of mine and show it unto you The Spirit of God will never lead any one to look at himself or his work but only and always at Christ Hence the more really spiritual any one is the more entirely will he be occupied with Christ Some there are who regard it as a great mark of spirituality to be ever looking in at their own hearts and dwelling upon what they find there even though that be the work of the Spirit This is a great mistake So far from its being a proof of spirituality it is a proof of the very reverse for it is expressly declared of the Holy Ghost that he shall not speak of himself but that on the contrary he shall take of mine and show it unto you Therefore whenever one is looking inward and building on the evidences of the Spirit s work there he may be assured he is not led by the Spirit of God in so doing It is by holding up Christ that the Spirit draws souls to God This is very important The knowledge of Christ is life eternal and it is the Father s revelation of Christ by the Holy Ghost that constitutes the basis of the Church When Peter confessed Christ to be the Son of the living God Christ s answer was Blessed art thou Simon Bar jonah for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven And I say unto thee that thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it Matt xvi seventeen eighteen What rock Peter God forbid This rock Greek taute te petra simply means the Father s revelation of Christ as the Son of the living God which is the only means by which any one is introduced into the assembly of Christ Now this opens to us very much the true character of the gospel It is pre eminently and emphatically a revelation a revelation not merely of a doctrine but of a Person the Person of the Son This revelation being received by faith draws the heart to Christ and becomes the spring of life and power the ground of membership the power of fellowship When it pleased God to reveal his Son in me c Here we have the true principle of the rock viz God revealing his Son It is thus the superstructure is reared up and on this solid foundation it reposes according to God s eternal purpose It is therefore peculiarly instructive to find in this twenty fourth of Genesis such a marked and beautiful illustration of the mission and special testimony of the Holy Ghost Abraham s servant in seeking to procure a bride for Isaac sets forth all the dignity and wealth with which he had been endowed by the father the love of which he was the object and in short all that was calculated to affect the heart and draw it off from present things He showed Rebekah an object in the distance and set before her the blessedness and reality of being made one with that beloved and highly favored object All that belonged to Isaac would belong to Rebekah too when she became part of him Such was his testimony Such also is the testimony of the Holy Ghost He speaks of Christ the glory of Christ the beauty of Christ the fulness of Christ the grace of Christ the unsearchable riches of Christ the dignity of his Person and the perfectness of his work Moreover he sets forth the amazing blessedness of being one with such a Christ members of his body of his flesh and of his bones Such is the Spirit s testimony always and herein we have an excellent touchstone by which to try all sorts of teaching and preaching The most spiritual teaching will ever be characterized by a full and constant presentation of Christ He will ever form the burden of such teaching The Spirit cannot dwell on aught but Jesus Of him he delights to speak He delights in setting forth his attractions and excellencies Hence when a man is ministering by the power of the Spirit of God there will always be more of Christ than any thing else in his ministry There will be little room in such ministry for human logic and reasoning Such things may do very well where a man desires to set forth himself but the Spirit s sole object be it well remembered by all who minister will ever be to set forth Christ Let us now look in the last place at the result of all this Truth and the practical application of truth are two very different things It is one thing to speak of the peculiar glories of the Church and quite another thing to be practically influenced by those glories In Rebekah s case the effect was most marked and decisive The testimony of Abraham s servant sank down into her ears and into her heart and entirely detached her heart s affections from the scene of things around her She was ready to leave all and follow after in order that she might apprehend that for which she had been apprehended It was morally impossible that she could believe herself to be the subject of such high destinies and yet continue amid the circumstances of nature If the report concerning the future were true attachment to the present was the worst of folly If the hope of being Isaac s bride joint heir with him of all his dignity and glory if this were a reality then to continue to tend Laban s sheep would be practically to despise all that God had in grace set before her But no the prospect was far too bright to be thus lightly given up True she had not yet seen Isaac nor yet the inheritance but she had believed the report the testimony of him and had received as it were the earnest of it and these were enough for her heart and hence she unhesitatingly arises and expresses her readiness to depart in the memorable words I will go She was fully prepared to enter upon an unknown path in companionship with one who had told her of an object far away and of a glory connected with him to which she was about to be raised I will go said she and forgetting the things which were behind and reaching forth toward the things which were before she pressed toward the mark for the prize of her high calling Most touching and beautiful illustration this of the Church under the conduct of the Holy Ghost going onward to meet her heavenly Bridegroom This is what the Church should be but alas there is sad failure here There is little of that holy alacrity in laying aside every weight and every entanglement in the power of communion with the Holy Guide and Companion of our way whose office and delight it is to take of the things of Jesus and show them unto us just as Abraham s servant took of the things of Isaac and showed them to Rebekah and no doubt too he found his joy in pouring fresh testimonies concerning the son into her ear as they moved onward toward the consummation of all her joy and glory Thus it is at least with our heavenly guide and companion He delights to tell of Jesus He shall take of mine and show it unto you and again he shall show you things to come Now this is what we really want this ministry of the Spirit of God unfolding Christ to our souls producing earnest longing to see him as he is and be made like him forever Naught but this will ever detach our hearts from earth and nature What save the hope of being associated with Isaac would ever have led Rebekah to say I will go when her brother and her mother said Let the damsel abide with us a few days at least ten And so with us nothing but the hope of seeing Jesus as he is and being like him will ever enable or lead us to purify ourselves even as he is pure CHAPTER XXV In the opening of this chapter Abraham s second marriage is set before us an event not without its interest to the spiritual mind when viewed in connection with what we have been considering in the preceding chapter With the light furnished by the prophetic scriptures of the New Testament we understand that after the completion and taking up of the elect bride of Christ the seed of Abraham will again come into notice Thus after the marriage of Isaac the Holy Ghost takes up the history of Abraham s seed by a new marriage together with other points in his history and that of his seed according to the flesh I do not press any special interpretation of all this I merely say that it is not without its interest We have already referred to the remark of some one on the book of Genesis namely that it is full of the seeds of things and as we pass along its comprehensive pages we shall find them teeming with all the fundamental principles of truth which are more elaborately wrought out in the New Testament True in Genesis these principles are set forth illustratively and in the New Testament didactically still the illustration is deeply interesting and eminently calculated to bring home the truth with power to the soul At the close of this chapter we are presented with some principles of a very solemn and practical nature Jacob s character and actings will hereafter if the Lord will come more fully before us but I would just notice ere passing on the conduct of Esau in reference to the birthright and all which it involved The natural heart places no value on the things of God To it God s promise is a vague valueless powerless thing simply because God is not known Hence it is that present things carry such weight and influence in man s estimation Any thing that man can see he values because he is governed by sight and not by faith To him the present is every thing the future is a mere uninfluential thing a matter of the merest uncertainty Thus it was with Esau Hear his fallacious reasoning Behold I am at the point to die and what profit shall this birthright do to me What strange reasoning The present is slipping from beneath my feet I will therefore despise and entirely let go the future Time is fading from my view I will therefore abandon all interest in eternity Thus Esau despised his birthright Thus Israel despised the pleasant land Ps cvi twenty four thus they despised Christ Zech xi thirteen Thus those who were bidden to the marriage despised the invitation Matt xxii five Man has no heart for the things of God The present is every thing to him A mess of pottage is better than a title to Canaan Hence the very reason why Esau made light of the birthright was the reason why he ought to have grasped it with the greater intensity The more clearly I see the vanity of man s present the more I shall cleave to God s future Thus it is in the judgment of faith Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat Nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness two Pet iii eleven thirteen These are the thoughts of God and therefore the thoughts of faith The things that are seen shall be dissolved What then are we to despise the unseen By no means The present is rapidly passing away What is our resource Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God This is the judgment of the renewed mind and any other judgment is only that of a profane person as Esau who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright Heb xii sixteen The Lord keep us judging of things as he judges This can only be done by faith CHAPTER XXVI The opening verse of this chapter connects itself with Chap xii There was a famine in the land beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham The trials which meet God s people in their course are very much alike and they ever tend to make manifest how far the heart has found its all in God It is a difficult matter a rare attainment so to walk in sweet communion with God as to be rendered thereby entirely independent of things and people here The Egypts and the Gerars which lie on our right hand and on our left present great temptations either to turn aside out of the right way or to stop short of our true position as servants of the true and living God And Isaac went unto Abimelech King of the Philistines unto Gerar There is a manifest difference between Egypt and Gerar Egypt is the expression of the world in its natural resources and its independence of God My river is mine own is the language of an Egyptian who knew not Jehovah and thought not of looking to him for aught Egypt was locally farther removed from Canaan than Gerar and morally it expresses a condition of soul farther from God Gerar is thus referred to in Chap x And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon as thou comest to Gerar unto Gaza as thou goest unto Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboim even unto Lasha Ver nineteen We are informed that from Gerar to Jerusalem was three days journey It was therefore as compared with Egypt an advanced position but still it lay within the range of very dangerous influences Abraham got into trouble there and so does Isaac in this chapter and that too in the very same way Abraham denied his wife and so does Isaac This is peculiarly solemn To see both the father and the son fall into the same evil in the same place tells us plainly that the influence of that place was not good Had Isaac not gone to Abimelech King of Gerar he would have no necessity for denying his wife but the slightest divergence from the true line of conduct superinduces spiritual weakness It was when Peter stood and warmed himself at the high priest s fire that he denied his Master Now it is manifest that Isaac was not really happy in Gerar True the Lord says unto him sojourn in this land but how often does the Lord give directions to his people morally suitable to the condition he knows them to be in and calculated also to arouse them to a true sense of that condition He directed Moses in Num xiii to send men to search the land of Canaan but had they not been in a low moral condition such a step would not have been necessary We know well that faith does not need to spy out when God s promise lies before us Again he directed Moses to choose out seventy elders to help him in the work but had Moses fully entered into the dignity and blessedness of his position he would not have needed such a direction So in reference to the setting up of a king in one Sam viii They ought not to have needed a king Hence we must always take into consideration the condition of an individual or a people to whom a direction is given before we can form any correct judgment as to the direction But again it may be said if Isaac s position in Gerar was wrong how do we read Then Isaac sowed in that land and received the same year an hundred fold and the Lord blessed him Ver twelve I reply we can never judge that a person s condition is right because of prosperous circumstances We have had already to remark that there is a great difference between the Lord s presence and his blessing Many have the latter without the former and moreover the heart is prone to mistake the one for the other prone to put the blessing for the presence or at least to argue that the one must ever accompany the other This is a great mistake How many do we see surrounded by God s blessings who neither have nor wish for God s presence It is important to see this A man may wax great and go forward and grow until he becomes very great and have possession of flocks and possession of herds and great store of servants and all the while not have the full unhindered joy of the Lord s presence with him Flocks and herds are not the Lord They are things on account of which the Philistines might envy Isaac whereas they never would have envied him on account of the Lord s presence He might have been enjoying the sweetest and richest communion with God and the Philistines have thought nothing whatever about it simply because they had no heart to understand or appreciate such a reality Flocks herds servants and wells of water they could appreciate but the divine presence they could not appreciate However Isaac at length makes his way from amongst the Philistines and gets up to Beersheba And the Lord appeared unto him the same night and said I am the God of Abraham thy father fear not for I am with thee and will bless thee Ver twenty four Mark it was not the Lord s blessing merely but the Lord himself And why because Isaac had left the Philistines with all their envy and strife and contention behind and gone up to Beersheba Here the Lord could show himself to his servant The blessings of his liberal hand might follow him during his sojourn in Gerar but his presence could not there be enjoyed To enjoy God s presence we must be where he is and he certainly is not to be found amid the strife and contention of an ungodly world and hence the sooner the child of God gets away from all such the better So Isaac found it He had no rest in his own spirit and he assuredly did not in any wise serve the Philistines by his sojourn amongst them It is a very common error to imagine that we serve the men of this world by mixing ourselves up with them in their associations and ways The true way to serve them is to stand apart from them in the power of communion with God and thus show them the pattern of a more excellent way Mark the progress in Isaac s soul and the moral effect of his course He went up from thence the Lord appeared unto him he builded an altar he called upon the name of the Lord he pitched his tent his servants digged a well Here we have most blessed progress The moment he took a step in the right direction he went from strength to strength He entered into the joy of God s presence tasted the sweets of true worship and exhibited the character of a stranger and pilgrim and found peaceful refreshment an undisputed well which the Philistines could not stop because they were not there These were blessed results in reference to Isaac himself and now observe the effect produced upon others Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar and Ahuzzath one of his friends and Phicol the chief captain of his army And Isaac said unto them Wherefore come ye to me seeing ye hate me and have sent me away from you And they said We saw certainly that the Lord was with thee and we said Let there now be an oath betwixt us c The true way to act on the hearts and consciences of the men of the world is to stand in decided separation from them while dealing in perfect grace toward them So long as Isaac continued in Gerar there was nothing but strife and contention He was reaping sorrow for himself and producing no effect whatever upon those around him On the contrary the moment he went away from them their hearts were touched and they followed him and desired a covenant This is very instructive The principle unfolded here may be seen constantly exemplified in the history of the children of God The first point with the heart should ever be to see that in our position we are right with God and not only right in position but in the moral condition of the soul When we are right with God we may expect to act salutarily upon men The moment Isaac got up to Beersheba and took his place as a worshipper his own soul was refreshed and he was used of God to act upon others So long as we continue in a low position we are robbing ourselves of blessing and failing totally in our testimony and service Nor should we when in a wrong position stop to inquire as we so often do Where can I find any thing better God s order is Cease to do evil and when we have acted upon that holy precept we are furnished with another namely Learn to do well If we expect to learn how to do well before we cease to do evil we are entirely mistaken Awake thou that sleepest and arise from among the dead Greek ek ton nekron And what then Christ shall give thee light Eph v fourteen My beloved reader if you are doing what you know to be wrong or if you are identified in any way with what you own to be contrary to scripture hearken to the word of the Lord Cease to do evil And be assured when you have yielded obedience to this word you will not long be left in ignorance as to your path It is sheer unbelief that leads us to say I cannot cease to do evil until I find something better The Lord grant us a single eye and a docile spirit CHAPTERS XXVII XXXV These chapters present to us the history of Jacob at least the principal scenes in that history The Spirit of God here sets before us the deepest instruction first as to God s purpose of infinite grace and secondly as to the utter worthlessness and depravity of human nature There is a passage in Chap xxv which I purposely passed over in order to take it up here so that we might have the truth in reference to Jacob fully before us And Isaac entreated the Lord for his wife because she was barren and the Lord was entreated of him and Rebekah his wife conceived And the children struggled together within her and she said If it be so why am I thus And she went to inquire of the Lord And the Lord said unto her Two nations are in thy womb and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels and the one people shall be stronger than the other people and the elder shall serve the younger This is referred to in Malachi where we read I have loved you saith the Lord yet ye say wherein hast thou loved us Was not Esau Jacob s brother saith the Lord yet I have loved Jacob and hated Esau This is again referred to in Rom ix For the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her The elder shall serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated Thus we have very distinctly before us God s eternal purpose according to the election of grace There is much involved in this expression It banishes all human pretension from the scene and asserts God s right to act as he will This is of the very last importance The creature can enjoy no real blessedness until he is brought to bow his head to sovereign grace It becomes him so to do inasmuch as he is a sinner and as such utterly without claim to act or dictate The great value of finding oneself on this ground is that it is then no longer a question of what we deserve to get but simply of what God is pleased to give The prodigal might talk of being a servant but he really did not deserve the place of a servant if it were to be made a question of desert and therefore he had only to take what the father was pleased to give and that was the very highest place even the place of fellowship with himself Thus it must ever be Grace all the work shall crown through everlasting days Happy for us that it is so As we go on day by day making fresh discoveries of ourselves we need to have beneath our feet the solid foundation of God s grace nothing else could possibly sustain us in our growing self knowledge The ruin is hopeless and therefore the grace must be infinite and infinite it is having its source in God himself its channel in Christ and the power of application and enjoyment in the Holy Ghost The Trinity is brought out in connection with the grace that saves a poor sinner Grace reigns through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord It is only in redemption that this reign of grace could be seen We may see in creation the reign of wisdom and power we may see in providence the reign of goodness and long suffering but only in redemption do we see the reign of grace and that too on the principle of righteousness Now we have in the person of Jacob a most striking exhibition of the power of divine grace and for this reason that we have in him a striking exhibition of the power of human nature In him we see nature in all its obliquity and therefore we see grace in all its moral beauty and power From the facts of his remarkable history it would seem that before his birth at his birth and after his birth the extraordinary energy of nature was seen Before his birth we read the children struggled together within her At his birth we read his hand took hold on Esau s heel And after his birth yea to the turning point of his history in Chap xxxii without any exception his course exhibits nothing but the most unamiable traits of nature but all this only serves like a dark back ground to throw into relief the grace of him who condescends to call himself by the peculiarly touching name the God of Jacob a name most sweetly expressive of free grace Let us now examine the chapters consecutively Chap xxvii exhibits a most humbling picture of sensuality deceit and cunning and when one thinks of such things in connection with the people of God it is sad and painful to the very last degree Yet how true and faithful is the Holy Ghost He must tell all out He cannot give us a partial picture If he gives us a history of man he must describe man as he is and not as he is not So if he unfolds to us the character and ways of God he gives us God as he is And this we need hardly remark is exactly what we need We need the revelation of one perfect in holiness yet perfect in grace and mercy who could come down into all the depth of man s need his misery and his degradation and deal with him there and raise him up out of it into full unhindered fellowship with himself in all the reality of what he is This is what scripture gives us God knew what we needed and he has given it to us blessed be his name And be it remembered that in setting before us in faithful love all the traits of a man s character it is simply with a view to magnify the riches of divine grace and to admonish our souls It is not by any means in order to perpetuate the memory of sins forever blotted out from his sight The blots the failures and the errors of Abraham Isaac and Jacob have been perfectly washed away and they have taken their place amid the spirits of just men made perfect but their history remains on the page of inspiration for the display of God s grace and for the warning of God s people in all ages and moreover that we may distinctly see that the blessed God has not been dealing with perfect men and women but with those of like passions as we are that he has been walking and bearing with the same failures the same infirmities the same errors as those over which we mourn every day This is peculiarly comforting to the heart and it may well stand in striking contrast with the way in which the great majority of human biographies are written in which for the most part we find not the history of men but of beings devoid of error and infirmity Such histories have rather the effect of discouraging than of edifying those who read them They are rather histories of what men ought to be than of what they really are and they are therefore useless to us yea not only useless but mischievous Nothing can edify save the presentation of God dealing with man as he really is and this is what the word gives us The chapter before us illustrates this very fully Here we find the aged patriarch Isaac standing as it were at the very portal of eternity the earth and nature fast fading away from his view yet occupied about savory meat and about to act in direct opposition to the divine counsel by blessing the elder instead of the younger Truly this was nature and nature with its eyes dim If Esau had sold his birthright for a mess of pottage Isaac was about to give away the blessing for a mess of venison How very humiliating But God s purpose must stand and he will do all his pleasure Faith knows this and in the power of that knowledge can wait for God s time This nature never can do but must set about gaining its own ends by its own inventions These are the two grand points brought out in Jacob s history God s purpose of grace on the one hand and on the other nature plotting and scheming to reach what that purpose would have infallibly brought about without any plot or scheme at all This simplifies Jacob s history amazingly and not only simplifies it but heightens the soul s interest in it also There is nothing perhaps in which we are so lamentably deficient as in the grace of patient self renouncing dependence upon God Nature will be working in some shape or form and thus so far as in it lies hindering the outshining of divine grace and power God did not need the aid of such elements as Rebekah s cunning and Jacob s gross deceit in order to accomplish his purpose He had said the elder shall serve the younger This was enough enough for faith but not enough for nature which must ever adopt its own ways and know nothing of what it is to wait on God Now nothing can be more truly blessed than the position of hanging in child like dependence upon God and being entirely content to wait for his time True it will involve trial but the renewed mind learns some of its deepest lessons and enjoys some of its sweetest experiences while waiting on the Lord and the more pressing the temptation to take ourselves out of his hands the richer will be the blessing of leaving ourselves there It is so exceedingly sweet to find ourselves wholly dependent upon one who finds infinite joy in blessing us It is only those who have tasted in any little measure the reality of this wondrous position that can at all appreciate it The only one who ever occupied it perfectly and uninterruptedly was the Lord Jesus himself He was over dependent upon God and utterly rejected every proposal of the enemy to be any thing else His language was In thee do I put my trust and again I was cast upon thee from the womb Hence when tempted by the devil to make an effort to satisfy his hunger his reply was It is written Man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God When tempted to cast himself from the pinnacle of the temple his reply was It is written again Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God When tempted to take the kingdoms of the world from the hand of another than God and by doing homage to another than him his reply was It is written Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve In a word nothing could allure the perfect man from the place of absolute dependence upon God True it was God s purpose to sustain his Son it was his purpose that he should suddenly come to his temple it was his purpose to give him the kingdoms of this world but this was the very reason why the Lord Jesus would simply and uninterruptedly wait on God for the accomplishment of his purpose in his own time and in his own way He did not set about accomplishing his own ends He left himself thoroughly at God s disposal He would only eat when God gave him bread he would only enter the temple when sent of God he will ascend the throne when God appoints the time Sit thou at my right hand until I make thine enemies thy footstool Ps cx This profound subjection of the Son to the Father is admirable beyond expression Though entirely equal with God he took as man the place of dependence rejoicing always in the will of the Father giving thanks even when things seemed to be against him doing always the things which pleased the Father making it his grand and unvarying object to glorify the Father and finally when all was accomplished when he had perfectly finished the work which the Father had given he breathed his spirit into the Father s hand and his flesh rested in hope of the promised glory and exaltation Well therefore may the inspired apostle say Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father Phil ii five eleven How little Jacob knew in the opening of his history of this blessed mind How little was he prepared to wait for God s time and God s way He much preferred Jacob s time and Jacob s way He thought it much better to arrive at the blessing and the inheritance by all sorts of cunning and deception than by simple dependence upon and subjection to God whose electing grace had promised and whose almighty power and wisdom would assuredly accomplish all for him But oh how well one knows the opposition of the human heart to all this Any attitude for it save that of patient waiting upon God It is almost enough to drive nature to distraction to find itself bereft of all resource but God This tells us in language not to be misunderstood the true character of human nature In order to know what nature is I need not travel into those scenes of vice and crime which justly shock all refined moral sense No all that is needful is just to try it for a moment in the place of dependence and see how it will carry itself there It really knows nothing of God and therefore cannot trust him and herein lies the secret of all its misery and moral degradation It is totally ignorant of the true God and can therefore be naught else but a ruined and worthless thing The knowledge of God is the source of life yea is itself life and until a man has life what is he or what can he be Now in Rebekah and Jacob we see nature taking advantage of nature in Isaac and Esau It was really this There was no waiting upon God whatever Isaac s eyes were dim he could therefore be imposed upon and they set about doing so instead of looking to God who would have entirely frustrated Isaac s purpose to bless the one whom God would not bless a purpose founded in nature and most unlovely nature for Isaac loved Esau not because he was the first born but because he did eat of his venison How humiliating But we are sure to bring unmixed sorrow upon ourselves when we take ourselves our circumstances or our destinies out of the hands of God seventeen Thus it was with Jacob as we shall see in the sequel It has been observed by another that whoever observes Jacob s life after he had surreptitiously obtained his father s blessing will perceive that he enjoyed very little worldly felicity His brother purposed to murder him to avoid which he was forced to flee from his father s house his uncle Laban deceived him as he had deceived his father and treated him with great rigor after a servitude of twenty one years he was obliged to leave him in a clandestine manner and not without danger of being brought back or murdered by his enraged brother no sooner were these fears over than he experienced the baseness of his son Reuben in defiling his bed he had next to bewail the treachery and cruelty of Simeon and Levi towards the Shechemites then he had to feel the loss of his beloved wife he was next imposed upon by his own sons and had to lament the supposed untimely end of Joseph and to complete all lie was forced by famine to go into Egypt and there died in a strange land So just wonderful and instructive are all the ways of providence This is a true picture so far as Jacob was concerned but it only gives us one side and that the gloomy side Blessed be God there is a bright side likewise for God had to do with Jacob and in every scene of his life when Jacob was called to reap the fruits of his own plotting and crookedness the God of Jacob brought good out of evil and caused his grace to abound over all the sin and folly of his poor servant This we shall see as we proceed with his history I shall just offer a remark here upon Isaac Rebekah and Esau It is very interesting to observe how notwithstanding the exhibition of nature s excessive weakness in the opening of this twenty seventh chapter Isaac maintains by faith the dignity which God had conferred upon him He blesses with all the consciousness of being endowed with power to bless He says I have blessed him yea and he shall be blessed Behold I have made him thy lord and all his brethren have I given to him for servants and with corn and wine have I sustained him and what shall I do now unto thee my son He speaks as one who by faith had at his disposal all the treasures of earth There is no false humility no taking a low ground by reason of the manifestation of nature True he was on the eve of making a grievous mistake even of moving right athwart the counsel of God still he knew God and took his place accordingly dispensing blessings in all the dignity and power of faith I have blessed him yea and he shall be blessed With corn and wine have I sustained him It is the proper province of faith to rise above all one s own failure and the consequences thereof into the place where God s grace has set us As to Rebekah she was called to feel all the sad results of her cunning actings She no doubt imagined she was managing matters most skilfully but alas she never saw Jacob again so much for management How different would it have been had she left the matter entirely in the hands of God This is the way in which faith manages and it is ever a gainer Which of you by taking thought can add to his stature one cubit We gain nothing by our anxiety and planning we only shut out God and that is no gain It is a just judgment from the hand of God to be left to reap the fruits of our own devices and I know of few things more sad than to see a child of God so entirely forgetting his proper place and privilege as to take the management of his affairs into his own hands The birds of the air and the lilies of the field may well be our teachers when we so far forget our position of unqualified dependence upon God Then again as to Esau the apostle calls him a profane person who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright and afterwards when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected for he found no place of change of mind though he sought it carefully with tears Thus we learn what a profane person is viz one who would like to hold both worlds one who would like to enjoy the present without forfeiting his title to the future This is by no means an uncommon case It expresses to us the mere worldly professor whose conscience has never felt the action of divine truth and whose heart has never felt the influence of divine grace FOOTNOTES seventeen We should ever remember in a place of trial that what we want is not a change of circumstances but victory over self CHAPTER XXVIII We are now called to trace Jacob in his movement from under his father s roof to view him as a homeless and lonely wanderer on the earth It is here that God s special dealings with him commence Jacob now begins to realize in some measure the bitter fruit of his conduct in reference to Esau while at the same time God is seen rising above all the weakness and folly of his servant and displaying his own sovereign grace and profound wisdom in his dealings with him God will accomplish his own purpose no matter by what instrumentality but if his child in impatience of spirit and unbelief of heart will take himself out of his hands he must expect much sorrowful exercise and painful discipline Thus it was with Jacob he might not have had to flee to Haran had he allowed God to act for him God would assuredly have dealt with Esau and caused him to find his destined place and portion and Jacob might have enjoyed that sweet peace which nothing can yield save entire subjection in all things to the hand and counsel of God But here is where the excessive feebleness of our hearts is constantly disclosed We do not lie passive in God s hand we will be acting and by our acting we hinder the display of God s grace and power on our behalf Be still and know that I am God is a precept which naught save the power of divine grace can enable one to obey Let your moderation be known unto all men The Lord is at hand Greek engys Be careful for nothing but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God What will be the result of thus acting The peace of God which passeth all understanding shall garrison Greek phrouresei your hearts and minds by Christ Jesus Phil iv five seven However God graciously overrules our folly and weakness and while we are called upon to reap the fruits of our unbelieving and impatient ways he takes occasion from them to teach our hearts still deeper lessons of his own tender grace and perfect wisdom This while it assuredly affords no warrant whatever for unbelief and impatience does most wonderfully exhibit the goodness of our God and comfort the heart even while we may be passing through the painful circumstances consequent upon our failure God is above all and moreover it is his special prerogative to bring good out of evil to make the eater yield meat and the strong yield sweetness and hence while it is quite true that Jacob was compelled to be an exile from his father s roof in consequence of his own restless and deceitful acting it is equally true that he never could have learnt the meaning of Bethel had he been quietly at home Thus the two sides of the picture are strongly marked in every scene of Jacob s history It was when he was driven by his own folly from Isaac s house that he was led to taste in some measure the blessedness and solemnity of God s house And Jacob went out from Beersheba and went toward Haran And he lighted upon a certain place and tarried there all night because the sun was set and he took of the stones of that place and put them for his pillows and lay down in that place to sleep Here we find the homeless wanderer just in the very position in which God could meet him and in which he could unfold his purposes of grace and glory Nothing could possibly be more expressive of helplessness and nothingness than Jacob s condition as here set before us Beneath the open canopy of heaven with a pillow of stone in the helpless condition of sleep Thus it was that the God of Bethel unfolded to Jacob his purposes respecting him and his seed And he dreamed and behold a ladder set up on the earth and the top of it reached to heaven and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it And behold the Lord stood above it and said I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father and the God of Isaac the land whereon thou liest to thee will I give it and to thy seed And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth and thou shalt spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed And behold I am with thee and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest and will bring thee again into this land for I will not leave thee until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of Here we have indeed grace and glory The ladder set on the earth naturally leads the heart to meditate on the display of God s grace in the Person and work of his Son On the earth it was that the wondrous work was accomplished which forms the basis the strong and everlasting basis of all the divine counsels in reference to Israel the Church and the world at large On the earth it was that Jesus lived labored and died that through his death he might remove out of the way every obstacle to the accomplishment of the divine purpose of blessing to man But the top of the ladder reached to heaven It formed the medium of communication between heaven and earth and behold the angels of God ascending and descending upon it striking and beautiful picture of him by whom God has come down into all the depth of man s need and by whom also he has brought man up and set him in his own presence forever in the power of divine righteousness God has made provision for the accomplishment of all his plans despite of man s folly and sin and it is for the everlasting joy of any soul to find itself by the teaching of the Holy Ghost within the limits of God s gracious purpose The prophet Hosea leads us on to the time when that which was foreshadowed by Jacob s ladder shall have its full accomplishment And in that day I will make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field and with the fowls of heaven and with the creeping things of the ground and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth and will make them to lie down safely And I will betroth thee unto me forever yea I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness and in judgment and in loving kindness and in mercies I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness and thou shalt know the Lord And it shall come to pass in that day I will hear saith the Lord I will hear the heavens and they shall hear the earth and the earth shall hear the corn and the wine and the oil and they shall hear Jezreel And I will sow her unto me in the earth and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy and I will say to them which were not my people Thou art my people and they shall say Thou art my God Hosea ii eighteen twenty three There is also an expression in the first chapter of John bearing upon Jacob s remarkable vision it is Christ s word to Nathanael Verily verily I say unto you hereafter ye shall see heaven open and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man Ver fifty one Now this vision of Jacob s is a very blessed disclosure of divine grace to Israel We have been led to see something of Jacob s real character something too of his real condition both were evidently such as to show that it should either be divine grace for him or nothing By birth he had no claim nor yet by character Esau might put forward some claim on both these grounds i e provided God s prerogative were set aside but Jacob had no claim whatsoever and hence while Esau could only stand upon the exclusion of God s prerogative Jacob could only stand upon the introduction and establishment thereof Jacob was such a sinner and so utterly divested of all claim both by birth and by practice that he had nothing whatever to rest upon save God s purpose of pure free and sovereign grace Hence in the revelation which the Lord makes to his chosen servant in the passage just quoted it is a simple record or prediction of what he himself would yet do I am I will give I will keep I will bring I will not leave thee until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of It was all himself There is no condition whatever No if or but for when grace acts there can be no such thing Where there is an if it cannot possibly be grace Not that God cannot put man into a position of responsibility in which he must needs address him with an if We know he can but Jacob asleep on a pillow of stone was not in a position of responsibility but of the deepest helplessness and need and therefore he was in a position to receive a revelation of the fullest richest and most unconditional grace Now we cannot but own the blessedness of being in such a condition that we have nothing to rest upon save God himself and moreover that it is in the most perfect establishment of God s own character and prerogative that we obtain all our true joy and blessing According to this principle it would be an irreparable loss to us to have any ground of our own to stand upon for in that case God should address us on the ground of responsibility and failure would then be inevitable Jacob was so bad that none but God himself could do for him And be it remarked that it was his failure in the habitual recognition of this that led him into so much sorrow and pressure God s revelation of himself is one thing and our resting in that revelation is quite another God shows himself to Jacob in infinite grace but no sooner does Jacob awake out of sleep than we find him developing his true character and proving how little he knew practically of the blessed One who had just been revealing himself so marvellously to him He was afraid and said How dreadful is this place This is none other but the house of God and this is the gate of heaven His heart was not at home in the presence of God nor can any heart be so until it has been thoroughly emptied and broken God is at home blessed be his name with a broken heart and a broken heart at home with him But Jacob s heart was not yet in this condition nor had he yet learnt to repose like a little child in the perfect love of one who could say Jacob have I loved Perfect love casteth out fear but where such love is not known and fully realized there will always be a measure of uneasiness and perturbation God s house and God s presence are not dreadful to a soul who knows the love of God as expressed in the perfect sacrifice of Christ Such a soul is rather led to say Lord I have loved the habitation of thy house and the place where thine honor dwelleth Ps xxvi eight And again One thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his temple Ps xxvii four And again How amiable are thy tabernacles O Lord of hosts My soul longeth yea even fainteth for the courts of the Lord Ps lxxxiv When the heart is established in the knowledge of God it will assuredly love his house whatever the character of that house may be whether it be Bethel or the temple at Jerusalem or the Church now composed of all true believers builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit However Jacob s knowledge both of God and his house was very shallow at that point in his history on which we are now dwelling We shall have occasion again to refer to some principles connected with Bethel and shall now close our meditations upon this chapter with a brief notice of Jacob s bargain with God so truly characteristic of him and so demonstrative of the truth of the statement with respect to the shallowness of his knowledge of the divine character And Jacob vowed a vow saying If God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go and will give me bread to eat and raiment to put on so that I come again to my Father s house in peace then shall the Lord be my God and this stone which I have set for a pillar shall be God s house and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee Observe if God will be with me Now the Lord had just said emphatically I am with thee and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest and will bring thee again into this land c And yet poor Jacob s heart cannot get beyond an if nor in its thoughts of God s goodness can it rise higher than bread to eat and raiment to put on Such were the thoughts of one who had just seen the magnificent vision of the ladder reaching from earth to heaven with the Lord standing above and promising an innumerable seed and an everlasting possession Jacob was evidently unable to enter into the reality and fulness of God s thoughts He measured God by himself and thus utterly failed to apprehend him In short Jacob had not yet really got to the end of himself and hence he had not really begun with God CHAPTERS XXIX XXXI Then Jacob went on his journey and came into the land of the people of the east As we have just seen in Chap xxviii Jacob utterly fails in the apprehension of God s real character and meets all the rich grace of Bethel with an if and a miserable bargain about food and raiment We now follow him into a scene of thorough bargain making Whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap 
7424-98623-0000	train-other-500	There is no possibility of escaping from this Jacob had not yet found his true level in the presence of God and therefore God uses circumstances to chasten and break him down This is the real secret of much
none	none	 very much of our sorrow and trial in the world Our hearts have never been really broken before the Lord we have never been self judged and self emptied and hence again and again we as it were knock our heads against the wall No one can really enjoy God until he has got to the bottom of self and for this plain reason that God has begun the display of himself at the very point at which the end of flesh is seen 
7424-98623-0001	train-other-500	If therefore I have not reached the end of my flesh in the deep and positive experience of my soul it is morally impossible that I can have any thing like a just apprehension of God s character
7424-98623-0002	train-other-500	But I must in some way or other be conducted to the true measure of nature To accomplish this end the Lord makes use of various agencies which
none	none	 no matter what they are 
7424-98623-0003	train-other-500	are only effectual when used by him for the purpose of disclosing in our view the true character of all that is in our hearts
none	none	 How often do we find as in Jacob s case that even although the Lord may come near to us and speak in our ears 
7424-98623-0004	train-other-500	yet we do not understand his voice or take our true place in his presence The Lord is in this place and I knew it not How dreadful is this place Jacob learnt nothing by all this
7424-98623-0005	train-other-500	and it therefore needed twenty years of terrible schooling and that too in a school marvellously adapted to his flesh and even that as we shall see was not sufficient to break him down
7424-98623-0006	train-other-500	However it is remarkable to see how he gets back into an atmosphere so entirely suited to his moral constitution The bargain making Jacob meets with the bargain making Laban and they are both seen as it were straining every nerve to outwit each other
7424-98623-0007	train-other-500	Nor can we wonder at Laban for he had never been at Bethel he had seen no open heaven with a ladder reaching from thence to earth he had heard no magnificent promises from the lips of Jehovah securing to him all the land of Canaan
7424-98623-0008	train-other-500	with a countless seed no marvel therefore that he should exhibit a grasping grovelling spirit he had no other resource It is useless to expect from worldly men aught but a worldly spirit and worldly principles and ways
7424-98623-0009	train-other-500	they have gotten naught superior and you cannot bring a clean thing out of an unclean But to find Jacob after all he had seen and heard at Bethel struggling with a man of the world and endeavoring by such means to accumulate property
7424-98623-0010	train-other-500	is peculiarly humbling And yet alas it is no uncommon thing to find the children of God thus forgetting their high destinies and heavenly inheritance and descending into the arena with the children of this world
none	none	 to struggle there for the riches and honors of a perishing sin stricken earth 
7424-98623-0011	train-other-500	Indeed to such an extent is this true in many instances that it is often hard to trace a single evidence of that principle which saint John tells us overcometh the world Looking at Jacob and Laban
7424-98623-0012	train-other-500	and judging of them upon natural principles it would be hard to trace any difference One should get behind the scenes and enter into God s thoughts about both in order to see how widely they differed But it was God that had made them to differ not Jacob
none	none	 and so it is now Difficult as it may be to trace any difference between the children of light and the children of darkness there is nevertheless a very wide difference indeed a difference founded on the solemn fact that the former are the vessels of mercy 
7424-98623-0013	train-other-500	which God has afore prepared unto glory while the latter are the vessels of wrath fitted not by God but by sin to destruction
none	none	 eighteen Rom ix twenty two twenty three 
7424-98623-0014	train-other-500	This makes a very serious difference The Jacobs and the Labans differ materially and have differed and will differ forever though the former may so sadly fail in the realization and practical exhibition of their true character and dignity
7424-98623-0015	train-other-500	Now in Jacob s case as set forth in the three chapters now before us all his toiling and working like his wretched bargain before is the result of his ignorance of God s grace
7424-98623-0016	train-other-500	and his inability to put implicit confidence in God s promise The man that could say after a most unqualified promise from God to give him the whole land of Canaan
none	none	 IF God will give me food to eat and raiment to put on 
7424-98623-0017	train-other-500	could have had but a very faint apprehension of who God was or what his promise was either and because of this we see him seeking to do the best he can for himself This is always the way when grace is not understood
7424-98623-0018	train-other-500	the principles of grace may be professed but the real measure of our experience of the power of grace is quite another thing One would have imagined that Jacob s vision had told him a tale of grace but God s revelation at Bethel
7424-98623-0019	train-other-500	and Jacob s actings at Haran are two very different things yet the latter tell out what was Jacob s sense of the former Character and conduct prove the real measure of the soul s experience and conviction whatever the profession may be
none	none	 But Jacob had never yet been brought to measure himself in God s presence 
7424-98623-0020	train-other-500	and therefore he was ignorant of grace and he proved his ignorance by measuring himself with Laban and adopting his maxims and ways One cannot help remarking the fact that inasmuch as Jacob failed to learn and judge
7424-98623-0021	train-other-500	the inherent character of his flesh before God therefore he was in the providence of God led into the very sphere in which that character was fully exhibited in its broadest lines He was conducted to Haran the country of Laban and Rebekah
7424-98623-0022	train-other-500	the very school from whence those principles in which he was such a remarkable adept had emanated and where they were taught exhibited and maintained If one wanted to learn what God was he should go to Bethel
7424-98623-0023	train-other-500	if to learn what man was he should go to Haran But Jacob had failed to take in God s revelation of himself at Bethel and he therefore went to Haran and there showed what he was and oh what scrambling and scraping
7424-98623-0024	train-other-500	what shuffling and shifting There is no holy and elevated confidence in God no simply looking to and waiting on him True God was with Jacob for nothing can hinder the outshinings of divine grace
7424-98623-0025	train-other-500	Moreover Jacob in a measure owns God s presence and faithfulness Still nothing can be done without a scheme and a plan Jacob cannot allow God to settle the question as to his wives and his wages
7424-98623-0026	train-other-500	but seeks to settle all by his own cunning and management In short it is the supplanter throughout Let the reader turn for example
none	none	 to Chap xxx thirty seven forty two 
7424-98623-0027	train-other-500	and say where he can find a more masterly piece of cunning It is verily a perfect picture of Jacob In place of allowing God to multiply the ringstraked speckled and spotted cattle as he most assuredly would have done had he been trusted
none	none	 he sets about securing their multiplication by a piece of policy which could only have found its origin in the mind of a Jacob 
7424-98623-0028	train-other-500	So in all his actings during his twenty years sojourn with Laban and finally he most characteristically steals away thus maintaining in every thing his consistency with himself
7424-98623-0029	train-other-500	Now it is in tracing out Jacob s real character from stage to stage of his extraordinary history that one gets a wondrous view of divine grace None but God could have borne with such an one as none but God would have taken such an one up
7424-98623-0030	train-other-500	Grace begins at the very lowest point It takes up man as he is and deals with him in the full intelligence of what he is It is of the very last importance to understand this feature of grace at one s first starting
7424-98623-0031	train-other-500	it enables us to bear with steadiness of heart the after discoveries of personal vileness which so frequently shake the confidence and disturb the peace of the children of God Many there are who at first fail in the full apprehension of the utter ruin of nature
7424-98623-0032	train-other-500	as looked at in God s presence though their hearts have been attracted by the grace of God and their consciences tranquillized in some degree by the application of the blood of Christ Hence as they get on in their course
7424-98623-0033	train-other-500	they begin to make deeper discoveries of the evil within and being deficient in their apprehensions of God s grace and the extent and efficacy of the sacrifice of Christ they immediately raise a question as to their being children of God at all
7424-98623-0034	train-other-500	Thus they are taken off Christ and thrown on themselves and then they either betake themselves to ordinances in order to keep up their tone of devotion or else fall back into thorough worldliness and carnality
7424-98623-0035	train-other-500	These are disastrous consequences and all the result of not having the heart established in grace It is this that renders the study of Jacob s history so profoundly interesting
none	none	 and eminently useful No one can read the three chapters now before us and not be struck at the amazing grace that could take up such an one as Jacob and not only take him up but say after the full discovery of all that was in him He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel Numb xxiii twenty one He does not say that iniquity and perverseness were not in him This would never give the heart confidence 
7424-98623-0036	train-other-500	the very thing above all others which God desires to give
none	none	 It could never assure a poor sinner s heart to be told that there was no sin in him 
7424-98623-0037	train-other-500	for alas he knows too well there is but to be told there is no sin on him and that moreover in God s sight on the simple ground of Christ s perfect sacrifice must infallibly set his heart and conscience at rest Had God taken up Esau
7424-98623-0038	train-other-500	we should not have had by any means such a blessed display of grace for this reason that he does not appear before us in the unamiable light in which we see Jacob The more man sinks the more God s grace rises
7424-98623-0039	train-other-500	As my debt rises in my estimation from the fifty pence up to the five hundred so my sense of grace rises also my experience of that love which when we had nothing to pay could frankly forgive us all
none	none	 Luke vii forty two Well might the apostle say it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace not with meats which have not profited them that have been occupied therein Heb xiii nine FOOTNOTES eighteen It is deeply interesting to the spiritual mind to mark how sedulously the Spirit of God in Rom ix and indeed throughout all scripture guards against the horrid inference which the human mind draws from the doctrine of God s election When he speaks of vessels of wrath he simply says fitted to destruction He does not say that God fitted them Whereas on the other hand when he refers to the vessels of mercy he says whom he had afore prepared unto glory This is most marked If my reader will turn for a moment to Matt xxv thirty four forty one he will find another striking and beautiful instance of the same thing When the king addresses those on his right hand he says Come ye blessed of my Father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world Verse thirty four But when he addresses those on his left he says Depart from me ye cursed He does not say cursed of my Father And further he says into everlasting fire prepared not for you but for the devil and his angels Verse forty one In a word then it is plain that God has prepared a kingdom of glory and vessels of mercy to inherit that kingdom but he has not prepared everlasting fire for men but for the devil and his angels nor has he fitted the vessels of wrath but they have fitted themselves The word of God as clearly establishes election as it sedulously guards against reprobation Every one who finds himself in heaven will have to thank God for it and every one that finds himself in hell will have to thank himself CHAPTER XXXII And Jacob went on his way and the angels of God met him Still God s grace follows him notwithstanding all Nothing changeth God s affection Whom he loves and how he loves he loves to the end His love is like himself the same yesterday to day and forever But how little effect God s host had upon Jacob may be seen by his actings as here set before us And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir the country of Edom He evidently feels uneasy in reference to Esau and not without reason He had treated him badly and his conscience was not at ease but instead of casting himself unreservedly upon God he betakes himself to his usual planning again in order to avert Esau s wrath He tries to manage Esau instead of leaning on God And he commanded them saying Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau thy servant Jacob saith thus I have sojourned with Laban and stayed there until now All this bespeaks a soul very much off its centre in God My lord and thy servant is not like the language of a brother or of one in the conscious dignity of the presence of God but it was the language of Jacob and of Jacob too with a bad conscience And the messengers returned to Jacob saying We came to thy brother Esau and also he cometh to meet thee and four hundred men with him Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed But what does he first do Does he at once cast himself upon God No he begins to manage He divided the people that was with him and the flocks and herds and the camels into two bands and said If Esau come to the one company and smite it then the other company which is left shall escape Jacob s first thought was always a plan and in this we have a true picture of the poor human heart True he turns to God after he makes his plan and cries to him for deliverance but no sooner does he cease praying than he resumes the planning Now praying and planning will never do together If I plan I am leaning more or less on my plan but when I pray I should lean exclusively upon God Hence the two things are perfectly incompatible they virtually destroy each other When my eye is filled with my own management of things I am not prepared to see God acting for me and in that case prayer is not the utterance of my need but the mere superstitious performance of something which I think ought to be done or it may be asking God to sanctify my plans This will never do It is not asking God to sanctify and bless my means but it is asking him to do it all himself nineteen Though Jacob asked God to deliver him from his brother Esau he evidently was not satisfied with that and therefore he tried to appease him with a present Thus his confidence was in the present and not entirely in God The heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked It is often hard to detect what is the real ground of the heart s confidence We imagine or would fain persuade ourselves that we are leaning upon God when we are in reality leaning upon some scheme of our own devising Who after hearkening to Jacob s prayer wherein he says Deliver me I pray thee from the hand of my brother from the hand of Esau for I fear him lest he will come and smite me and the mother with the children could imagine him saying I will appease him with a present Had he forgotten his prayer Was he making a god of his present Did he place more confidence in a few cattle than in Jehovah to whom he had just been committing himself These are questions which naturally arise out of Jacob s actings in reference to Esau and we can readily answer them by looking into the glass of our own hearts There we learn as well as on the page of Jacob s history how much more apt we are to lean on our own management than on God but it will not do we must be brought to see the end of our management that it is perfect folly and that the true path of wisdom is to repose in full confidence upon God Nor will it do to make our prayers part of our management We often feel very well satisfied with ourselves when we add prayer to our arrangement or when we have used all lawful means and called upon God to bless them When this is the case our prayers are worth about as much as our plans inasmuch as we are leaning upon them instead of upon God We must be really brought to the end of every thing with which self has aught to do for until then God cannot show himself But we can never get to the end of our plans until we have been brought to the end of ourselves We must see that all flesh is grass and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field Isa xl six Thus it is in this interesting chapter when Jacob had made all his prudent arrangements we read And Jacob was left alone and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day This is a turning point in the history of this very remarkable man To be left alone with God is the only true way of arriving at a just knowledge of ourselves and our ways We can never get a true estimate of nature and all its actings until we have weighed them in the balance of the sanctuary and there we ascertain their real worth No matter what we may think about ourselves nor yet what man may think about us the great question is What does God think about us And the answer to this question can only be heard when we are left alone Away from the world away from self away from all the thoughts reasonings imaginations and emotions of mere nature and alone with God thus and thus alone can we get a correct judgment about ourselves Jacob was left alone and there wrestled a man with him Mark it was not Jacob wrestling with a man but a man wrestling with Jacob this scene is very commonly referred to as an instance of Jacob s power in prayer That it is not this is evident from the simple wording of the passage My wrestling with a man and a man wrestling with me present two totally different ideas to the mind In the former case I want to gain some object from him in the latter he wants to gain some object from me Now in Jacob s case the divine object was to bring him to see what a poor feeble worthless creature he was and when Jacob so pertinaciously held out against the divine dealing with him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of Jacob s thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him The sentence of death must be written on the flesh the power of the cross must be entered into before we can steadily and happily walk with God We have followed Jacob so far amid all the windings and workings of his extraordinary character we have seen him planning and managing during his twenty years sojourn with Laban but not until he was left alone did he get a true idea of what a perfectly helpless thing he was in himself Then the seat of his strength being touched he learnt to say I will not let thee go Other refuge have I none Clings my helpless soul to thee This was a new era in the history of the supplanting planning Jacob Up to this point he had held fast by his own ways and means but now he is brought to say I will not let thee go Now let my reader remark that Jacob did not express himself thus until the hollow of his thigh was touched This simple fact is quite sufficient to settle the true interpretation of the whole scene God was wrestling with Jacob to bring him to this point We have already seen that as to Jacob s power in prayer he had no sooner uttered a few words to God than he let out the real secret of his soul s dependence by saying I will appease him Esau with a present Would he have said this if he had really entered into the meaning of prayer or true dependence upon God Assuredly not If he had been looking to God alone to appease Esau could he have said I will appease him by a present Impossible God and the creature must be kept distinct and will be kept so in every soul that knows much of the sacred reality of a life of faith But alas here is where we fail if one may speak for another Under the plausible and apparently pious formula of using means we really cloak the positive infidelity of our poor deceitful hearts we think we are looking to God to bless our means while in reality we are shutting him out by leaning on the means instead of leaning on him Oh may our hearts be taught the evil of thus acting May we learn to cling more simply to God alone that so our history may be more characterized by that holy elevation above the circumstances through which we are passing It is not by any means an easy matter so to get to the end of the creature in every shape and form as to be able to say I will not let thee go except thou bless me To say this from the heart and to abide in the power of it is the secret of all true strength Jacob said it when the hollow of his thigh was touched but not till then He struggled long ere he gave way because his confidence in the flesh was strong But God can bring down to the dust the stoutest character He knows how to touch the spring of nature s strength and write the sentence of death thoroughly upon it and until this is done there can be no real power with God or man We must be weak ere we can be strong The power of Christ can only rest on us in connection with the knowledge of our infirmities Christ cannot put the seal of his approval upon nature s strength its wisdom or its glory all these must sink that he may rise Nature can never form in any one way a pedestal on which to display the grace or power of Christ for if it could then might flesh glory in his presence but this we know can never be And inasmuch as the display of God s glory and God s name or character is connected with the entire setting aside of nature so until this latter is set aside the soul can never enjoy the disclosure of the former Hence though Jacob is called to tell out his name to own that his name is Jacob or a supplanter he yet receives no revelation of the name of him who had been wrestling with him and bringing him down into the dust He received for himself the name of Israel or prince which was a great step in advance but when he says Tell me I pray thee thy name he received the reply Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name The Lord refuses to tell his name though he had elicited from Jacob the truth as to himself and he blesses him accordingly How often is this the case in the annals of God s family There is the disclosure of self in all its moral deformity but we fail to get hold practically of what God is though he has come so very close to us and blessed us too in connection with the discovery of ourselves Jacob received the new name of Israel when the hollow of his thigh had been touched He became a mighty prince when he had been brought to know himself as a weak man but still the Lord had to say Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name There is no disclosure of the name of him who nevertheless had brought out the real name and condition of Jacob From all this we learn that it is one thing to be blessed by the Lord and quite another thing to have the revelation of his character by the Spirit to our hearts He blessed him there but he did not tell his name There is blessing in being brought in any measure to know ourselves for therein we are led into a path in which we are able more clearly to discern what God is to us in detail Thus it was with Jacob When the hollow of his thigh was touched he found himself in a condition in which it was either God or nothing A poor halting man could do little it therefore behoved him to cling to one who was almighty I would remark ere leaving this chapter that the book of Job is in a certain sense a detailed commentary on this scene in Jacob s history Throughout the first thirty one chapters Job grapples with his friends and maintains his point against all their arguments but in Chapter xxxii God by the instrumentality of Elihu begins to wrestle with him and in Chapter xxxviii he comes down upon him directly with all the majesty of his power overwhelms him by the display of his greatness and glory and elicits from him the well known words I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear but now mine eye seeth thee Wherefore I abhor myself and repent in dust and ashes Chap xlii five six This was really touching the hollow of his thigh And mark the expression mine eye seeth thee He does not say I see myself merely no but thee Nothing but a view of what God is can really lead to repentance and self loathing Thus it will be with the people of Israel whose history is very analogous with that of Job When they shall look upon him whom they have pierced they will mourn and then there will be full restoration and blessing Their latter end like Job s will be better than their beginning They will learn the full meaning of that word O Israel thou hast destroyed thyself but in me is thine help Hosea xiii nine FOOTNOTES nineteen No doubt when faith allows God to act he will use his own agency but this is a totally different thing from his owning and blessing the plans and arrangements of unbelief and impatience This distinction is not sufficiently understood CHAPTERS XXXIII XXXIV We may here see how groundless were all Jacob s fears and how useless all his plans Notwithstanding the wrestling the touching the hollow of the thigh and the halting we find Jacob still planning And Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked and behold Esau came and with him four hundred men And he divided the children unto Leah and unto Rachel and unto the two handmaids And he put the handmaids and their children foremost and Leah and her children after and Rachel and Joseph hindermost This arrangement proved the continuance of his fears He still anticipated vengeance from the hand of Esau and he exposed those about whom he cared least to the first stroke of that vengeance How wondrous are the depths of the human heart How slow it is to trust God Had Jacob been really leaning upon God he never could have anticipated destruction for himself and his family but alas the heart knows something of the difficulty of simply reposing in calm confidence upon an ever present all powerful and infinitely gracious God But mark now the thorough vanity of the heart s anxiety And Esau ran to meet him and embraced him and fell on his neck and kissed him and they wept The present was quite unnecessary the plan useless God appeased Esau as he had already appeased Laban Thus it is he ever delights to rebuke our poor coward unbelieving hearts and put to flight all our fears Instead of the dreaded sword of Esau Jacob meets his embrace and kiss instead of strife and conflict they mingle their tears Such are God s ways Who would not trust him Who would not honor him with the heart s fullest confidence Why is it that notwithstanding all the sweet evidence of his faithfulness to those who put their trust in him we are so ready on every fresh occasion to doubt and hesitate The answer is simple we are not sufficiently acquainted with God Acquaint now thyself with him and be at peace Job xxii twenty one This is true whether in reference to the unconverted sinner or to the child of God The true knowledge of God real acquaintance with him is life and peace This is life eternal that they might know thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent John xvii three The more intimate our acquaintance with God the more solid will be our peace and the more will our souls be lifted above every creature dependence God is a rock and we only need to lean our whole weight upon him to know how ready and how able he is to sustain us After all this manifestation of God s goodness we find Jacob settling down in Succoth and contrary to the spirit and principles of a pilgrim life building a house as if it were his home Now Succoth was evidently not his divinely appointed destination The Lord had not said to him I am the God of Succoth no but I am the God of Bethel Bethel therefore and not Succoth should have been Jacob s grand object But alas the heart is always prone to rest satisfied with a position and portion short of what God would graciously assign Jacob then moves on to Shechem and purchases ground still falling short of the divine mark and the name by which he calls his altar is indicative of the moral condition of his soul He calls it El elohe Israel or God the God of Israel This was taking a very contracted view of God True it is our privilege to know God as our God but it is a higher thing to know him as the God of his own house and to view ourselves as part of that house It is the believer s privilege to know Christ as his head but it is a higher thing to know him as the head of his body the Church and to know ourselves as members of that body We shall see when we come to Chap xxxv that Jacob is led to take a higher and a wider view of God but at Shechem he was manifestly on low ground and he was made to smart for it as is always the case when we stop short of God s own ground The two tribes and a half took up their position on this side of Jordan and they were the first to fall into the enemy s hand So it was with Jacob We see in Chap xxxiv the bitter fruits of his sojourn at Shechem There is a blot cast upon his family which Simeon and Levi attempt to wipe out in the mere energy and violence of nature which only led to still deeper sorrow and that too which touched Jacob still more keenly than the insult offered to his daughter And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land among the Canaanites and the Perizzites and I being few in number they shall gather themselves together against me and slay me and I shall be destroyed I and my house Thus it was the consequences in reference to himself that affected Jacob most He seems to have walked in constant apprehension of danger to himself or his family and in the manifestation of an anxious a cautious timid calculating spirit utterly incompatible with a life of genuine faith in God It is not that Jacob was not in the main a man of faith he assuredly was and as such gets a place amongst the cloud of witnesses in Heb xi But then he exhibited sad failure from not walking in the habitual exercise of that divine principle Could faith have led him to say I shall be destroyed I and my house Surely not God s promise in Chapter xxviii fourteen fifteen should have banished every fear from his poor timid spirit I will keep thee I will not leave thee This should have tranquillized his heart But the fact is his mind was more occupied with his danger among the Shechemites than with his security in the hand of God He ought to have known that not a hair of his head could be touched and therefore instead of looking at Simeon and Levi or the consequences of their rash acting he should have judged himself for being in such a position at all If he had not settled at Shechem Dinah would not have been dishonored and the violence of his sons would not have been exhibited We constantly see Christians getting into deep sorrow and trouble through their own unfaithfulness and then instead of judging themselves they begin to look at circumstances and to cast upon them the blame How often do we see Christian parents for instance in keen anguish of soul about the wildness unsubduedness and worldliness of their children and all the while they have mainly to blame themselves for not walking faithfully before God in reference to their family Thus was it with Jacob He was on low moral ground at Shechem and inasmuch as he lacked that refined sensibility which would have led him to detect the low ground God in very faithfulness used his circumstances to chastise him God is not mocked for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap This is a principle flowing out of God s moral government a principle from the application of which none can possibly escape and it is a positive mercy to the children of God that they are obliged to reap the fruits of their errors It is a mercy to be taught in any way the bitterness of departing from or stopping short of the living God We must learn that this is not our rest for blessed be God he would not give us a polluted rest He would ever have us resting in and with himself Such is his perfect grace and when our hearts wander or fall short his word is If thou wilt return return unto me False humility which is simply the fruit of unbelief would lead the wanderer or backslider to take lower ground not knowing the principle or measure of God s restoration The prodigal would seek to be made a servant not knowing that so far as he was concerned he had no more title to the place of a servant than to that of a son and moreover that it would be utterly unworthy of the father s character to put him in such a position We must come to God on a principle and in a manner worthy of himself or not at all CHAPTER XXXV And God said unto Jacob Arise go up to Bethel and dwell there This confirms the principle on which we have been dwelling When there is a failure or declension the Lord calls the soul back to himself Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent and do the first works reverend ii five This is the divine principle of restoration The soul must be recalled to the very highest point it must be brought back to the divine standard The Lord does not say remember where you are no but remember the lofty position from whence you have fallen Thus only can one learn how far he has declined and how he is to retrace his steps Now it is when thus recalled to God s high and holy standard that one is really led to see the sad evil of one s fallen condition What a fearful amount of moral evil had gathered round Jacob s family unjudged by him until his soul was roused by the call to go up to Bethel Shechem was not the place in which to detect all this evil The atmosphere of that place was too much impregnated with impure elements to admit of the soul s discerning with any degree of clearness and precision the true character of evil But the moment the call to Bethel fell on Jacob s ear Then Jacob said unto his household and to all that were with him Put away the strange gods that are among you and be clean and change your garments and let us arise and go up to Bethel and I will make thee an altar unto God who answered me in the day of my distress and was with me in the way which I went The very mention of the house of God struck a chord in the soul of the patriarch it carried him in the twinkling of an eye over the history of twenty eventful years It was at Bethel he had learnt what God was and not at Shechem hence he must get back to Bethel again and erect an altar upon a totally different base and under a totally different name from his altar at Shechem This latter was connected with a mass of uncleanness and idolatry Jacob could speak of El elohe Israel while surrounded by a quantity of things utterly incompatible with the holiness of the house of God It is important to be clear in reference to this point Nothing can keep the soul in a path of consistent intelligent separation from evil save the sense of what the house of God is and what becomes that house If I merely look at God in reference to myself I shall not have a clear full divine sense of all that flows out of a due recognition of God s relation to his house Some there are who deem it a matter of no importance how they are mixed up with impure materials in the worship of God provided they themselves are true and upright in heart In other words they think they can worship God at Shechem and that an altar named El elohe Israel is just as elevated just as much according to God as an altar named El Bethel This is evidently a mistake The spiritually minded reader will at once detect the vast moral difference between Jacob s condition at Shechem and his condition at Bethel and the same difference is observable between the two altars Our ideas in reference to the worship of God must of necessity be affected by our spiritual condition and the worship which we present will be low and contracted or elevated and comprehensive just in proportion as we enter into the apprehension of his character and relationship Now the name of our altar and the character of our worship express the same idea El Bethel worship is higher than El elohe Israel worship for this simple reason that it conveys a higher idea of God It gives me a more elevated thought of God to speak of him as the God of his house than as the God of a solitary individual True there is beautiful grace expressed in the title God the God of Israel and the soul must ever feel happy in looking at the character of God as graciously connecting himself with every separate stone of his house and every separate member of the body Each stone in the building of God is a lively stone as connected with the living stone having communion with the living God by the power of the Spirit of life But while all this is blessedly true God is the God of his house and when we are enabled by an enlarged spiritual intelligence to view him as such we enjoy a higher character of worship than that which flows from merely apprehending what he is to ourselves individually But there is another thing to be remarked in Jacob s recall to Bethel He is told to make an altar unto God that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother He is thus reminded of the day of his distress It is often well to have our minds led in this way to the point in our history in which we found ourselves brought down to the lowest step of the ladder Thus Saul is brought back to the time when he was little in his own eyes This is the true starting point with all of us When thou wast little in thine own eyes is a point of which we often need to be reminded It is then that the heart really leans on God Afterwards we begin to fancy ourselves to be something and the Lord is obliged to teach us afresh our own nothingness When first one enters upon a path of service or testimony what a sense there is of personal weakness and incapacity and as a consequence what leaning upon God what earnest fervent appeals to him for help and strength Afterwards we begin to think that from being so long at the work we can get on by ourselves at least there is not the same sense of weakness or the same simple dependence upon God and then our ministry becomes a poor meagre flippant wordy thing without unction or power a thing flowing not from the exhaustless tide of the Spirit but from our own wretched minds From ver nine fifteen God renews his promise to Jacob and confirms the new name of prince instead of supplanter and Jacob again calls the name of the place Bethel At verse eighteen we have an interesting example of the difference between the judgment of faith and the judgment of nature The latter looks at things through the hazy mist with which it is surrounded the former looks at them in the light of the presence and counsels of God And it came to pass as her soul was in departing for she died that she called his name Ben oni but his father called him Benjamin Nature called him the son of my sorrow but faith called him the son of the right hand Thus is it ever The difference between the thoughts of nature and those of faith must ever be wide indeed and we should earnestly desire that our souls should be governed only by the latter and not by the former CHAPTER XXXVI Furnishes a catalogue of Esau s sons with their various titles and localities We shall not dwell on this but pass on to one of the most fruitful and interesting sections in the entire canon of inspiration viz CHAPTERS XXXVII L On which we shall dwell more particularly There is not in scripture a more perfect and beautiful type of Christ than Joseph Whether we view Christ as the object of the Father s love the object of the envy of his own in his humiliation sufferings death exaltation and glory in all we have him strikingly typified by Joseph In Chapter xxxvii we have Joseph s dreams the statement of which draws out the enmity of his brethren He was the object of his father s love and the subject of very high destinies and inasmuch as the hearts of his brethren were not in communion with these things they hated him They had no fellowship in the father s love and they would not yield to the thought of Joseph s exaltation In all this they represent the Jews in Christ s day He came to his own and his own received him not He had no form nor comeliness in their eyes They would neither own him as the Son of God nor King of Israel Their eyes were not open to behold his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth They would not have him yea they hated him Now in Joseph s case we see that he in no wise relaxed his testimony in consequence of his brethren s refusal of his first dream And Joseph dreamed a dream and he told it to his brethren and they hated him yet the more And he dreamed yet another dream and he told it to his brethren This was simple testimony founded upon divine revelation but it was testimony which brought Joseph down to the pit Had he kept back his testimony or taken off aught of its edge and power he might have spared himself but no he told them the truth and therefore they hated him Thus was it with Joseph s great Antitype He bore witness to the truth he witnessed a good confession he kept back nothing he could only speak the truth because he was the truth and his testimony to the truth was answered on man s part by the cross the vinegar the soldier s spear The testimony of Christ too was connected with the deepest fullest richest grace He not only came as the truth but also as the perfect expression of all the love of the Father s heart grace and truth came by Jesus Christ He was the full disclosure to man of what God was Hence man was left entirely without excuse He came and showed God to man and man hated God with a perfect hatred The fullest exhibition of divine love was answered by the fullest exhibition of human hatred This is seen in the cross and we have it touchingly foreshadowed at the pit into which Joseph was cast by his brethren And when they saw him afar off even before he came near unto them they conspired against him to slay him And they said one to another Behold this dreamer cometh come now therefore and let us slay him and cast him into some pit and we will say some evil beast hath devoured him and we shall see what will become of his dreams These words forcibly remind us of the parable in Matthew xxii But last of all he sent unto them his son saying They will reverence my son But when the husbandmen saw the son they said among themselves This is the heir come let us kill him and let us seize on his inheritance And they caught him and cast him out of the vineyard and slew him God sent his Son into the world with this thought They will reverence my son but alas man s heart had no reverence for the well beloved of the Father They cast him out Earth and heaven were at issue in reference to Christ and they are at issue still Man crucified him but God raised him from the dead Man placed him on a cross between two thieves God set him at his own right hand in the heavens Man gave him the very lowest place on earth God gave him the very highest place in heaven in brightest majesty All this is shown out in Joseph s history Joseph is a fruitful bough even a fruitful bough by a well whose branches run over the wall The archers have sorely grieved him and shot at him and hated him but his bow abode in strength and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob from thence is the shepherd the stone of Israel even by the God of thy father who shall help thee and by the Almighty who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above blessings of the deep that lieth under blessings of the breast and of the womb the blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bounds of the everlasting hills they shall be on the head of Joseph and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren general xlix twenty two twenty six These verses beautifully exhibit to our view the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow The archers have done their work but God was stronger than they The true Joseph has been shot at and grievously wounded in the house of his friends but the arms of his hands have been made strong in the power of resurrection and faith now knows him as the basis of all God s purposes of blessing and glory in reference to the Church Israel and the whole creation When we look at Joseph in the pit and in the prison and look at him afterwards as ruler over all the land of Egypt we see the difference between the thoughts of God and the thoughts of men and so when we look at the cross and at the throne of the majesty in the heavens we see the same thing Nothing ever brought out the real state of man s heart toward God but the coming of Christ If I had not come and spoken unto them they had not had sin John xv twenty two It is not that they would not have been sinners No but they had not had sin So he says in another place If ye were blind ye should have no sin John ix forty one God came near to man in the person of his Son and man was able to say this is the heir but yet he said come let us kill him Hence they have no cloak for their sin Those who say they see have no excuse Confessed blindness is not at all the difficulty but professed sight This is a truly solemn principle for a professing age like the present The permanence of sin is connected with the mere profession to see A man who is blind and knows it can have his eyes opened but what can be done for one who thinks he sees when he really does not CHAPTER XXXVIII Presents one of those remarkable circumstances in which divine grace is seen gloriously triumphing over man s sin It is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda Heb vii fourteen But how Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar Matt i three This is peculiarly striking God in his great grace rising above the sin and folly of man in order to bring about his own purposes of love and mercy Thus a little farther on in Matthew we read David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias It is worthy of God thus to act The Spirit of God is conducting us along the line through which according to the flesh Christ came and in doing so he gives us as links in the genealogical chain Tamar and Bathsheba How evident it is that there is nothing of man in this How plain it is that when we reach the close of the first chapter of Matthew it is God manifest in the flesh we find and that too from the pen of the Holy Ghost Man could never have devised such a genealogy It is entirely divine and no spiritual person can read it without seeing in it a blessed exhibition of divine grace in the first place and of the divine inspiration of Matthew s gospel in the second place at least of his account of Christ s genealogy according to the flesh I believe a comparison of two Sam xi and general xxxviii with Matt i will furnish the thoughtful Christian with matter for a very sweet and edifying meditation CHAPTER XXXIX XLV In perusing these interesting sections of inspiration we perceive a remarkable chain of providential actings all tending to one grand point namely the exaltation of the man who had been in the pit and at the same time bringing out by the way a number of subordinate objects The thoughts of many hearts were to be revealed but Joseph was to be exalted He called for a famine upon the land he brake the whole staff of bread He sent a man before them even Joseph who was sold for a servant whose feet they hurt with fetters he was laid in iron until the time that his word came the word of the Lord tried him The king sent and loosed him even the ruler of the people and let him go free He made him lord of his house and ruler of all his substance to bind his princes at his pleasure and teach his senators wisdom Psalm cv sixteen twenty two It is well to see that the leading object was to exalt the one whom men had rejected and then to produce in those same men a sense of their sin in rejecting And how admirably all this is effected The most trivial and the most important the most likely and the most unlikely circumstances are made to minister to the development of God s purposes In Chapter xxxix Satan uses Potiphar s wife and in Chap xl he uses Pharaoh s chief butler The former he used to put Joseph into the dungeon and the latter he used to keep him there through his ungrateful negligence but all in vain God was behind the scenes His finger was guiding all the springs of the vast machine of circumstances and when the due time was come he brought forth the man of his purpose and set his feet in a large room Now this is ever God s prerogative He is above all and can use all for the accomplishment of his grand and unsearchable designs It is sweet to be able thus to trace our Father s hand and counsel in every thing Sweet to know that all sorts of agents are at his sovereign disposal angels men and devils all are under his omnipotent hand and all are made to carry out his purposes In the scripture now before us all this is seen in a most remarkable manner God visits the domestic circle of a heathen captain the household of a heathen king yea and his bed side and makes the very visions of his head upon his bed contribute to the development of his counsels Nor is it merely individuals and their circumstances that we see thus taken up and used for the furtherance of God s ends but Egypt and all the surrounding countries are brought into the scene in short the whole earth was prepared by the hand of God to be a theatre on which to display the glory and greatness of the one who was separate from his brethren Such are God s ways and it is one of the happiest and most elevating exercises for the soul of a saint to trace thus the admirable actings of his heavenly Father How forcibly is God s providence brought out in this profoundly interesting history of Joseph Look for a moment into the dungeon of the captain of the guard See there a man laid in iron charged with a most abominable crime the outcast and offscouring of society and yet see him almost in a moment raised to the very highest eminence and who can deny that God is in it all And Pharaoh said unto Joseph Forasmuch as God hath showed thee all this there is none so discreet and wise as thou art thou shalt be over my house and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled only in the throne will I be greater than thou And Pharaoh said unto Joseph See I have set thee over all the land of Egypt And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it upon Joseph s hand and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck And he made him to ride in the second chariot that he had and they cried before him Bow the knee and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt And Pharaoh said unto Joseph I am Pharaoh and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt Chap xli thirty nine forty four Here then was exaltation of no ordinary kind Contrast this with the pit and the dungeon and mark the chain of events by which it was all brought about and you have at once a marked exhibition of the hand of God and a striking type of the sufferings and glory of the Lord Jesus Christ Joseph was taken from the pit and the dungeon into which he had been brought by the envy of his brethren and the false judgment of the Gentile to be ruler over the whole land of Egypt and not only so but to be the channel of blessing and the sustainer of life to Israel and the whole earth This is all typical of Christ indeed a type could hardly be more perfect We see a man laid to all intents and purposes in the place of death by the hand of man and then raised up by the hand of God and set in dignity and glory Ye men of Israel hear these words Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you as ye yourselves also know him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God ye have taken and by wicked hands have crucified and slain whom God hath raised up having loosed the pains of death because it was not possible that he should be holden of it Acts ii twenty two twenty four But there are two points in Joseph s history which together with what has been noticed render the type remarkably perfect I allude to his marriage with a stranger in Chapter xli and his interview with his brethren in Chapter xlv The following is the order of events Joseph presents himself to his brethren as one sent by the father they reject him and so far as lies in them put him in the place of death God takes him up from thence and raises him to a position of highest dignity thus exalted he gets a bride and when his brethren according to the flesh are thoroughly broken and prostrate before him he makes himself known to them tranquillizes their hearts and brings them into blessing he then becomes the channel of blessing to them and to the whole world I shall just make a few remarks on Joseph s marriage and the restoration of his brethren The strange wife shadows forth the Church Christ presented himself to the Jews and being rejected took his seat on high and sent down the Holy Ghost to gather out an elect Church composed of Jew and Gentile to be united with him in heavenly glory The doctrine of the Church has already been dwelt upon in our remarks on Chapter xxiv but one or two points remain to be noticed here And first we may observe that Joseph s Egyptian bride was intimately associated with him in his glory twenty She as being part of himself shared in all that was his Moreover she occupied a place of nearness and intimacy known only to herself Thus it is with the Church the bride of the Lamb She is gathered to Christ to be the sharer at once of his rejection and his glory It is Christ s position which gives character to the position of the Church and her position should ever give character to her walk If we are gathered to Christ it is as exalted in glory and not as humbled down here Henceforth know we no man after the flesh yea though we have known Christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more two Cor v sixteen The Church s gathering point is Christ in glory I if I be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me John xii thirty two There is far more of practical value in the clear apprehension of this principle than might at first sight appear It is ever the aim of Satan as it is the tendency of our hearts to lead us to stop short of God s mark in every thing and specially in the centre of our unity as Christians It is a popular sentiment that the blood of the Lamb is the union of saints i e it is the blood which forms their centre of unity Now that it is the infinitely precious blood of Christ which sets us individually as worshippers in the presence of God is blessedly true The blood therefore forms the divine basis of our fellowship with God But when we come to speak of the centre of our unity as a church we must see that the Holy Ghost gathers us to the Person of a risen and glorified Christ and this grand truth gives character high and holy character to our association as Christians If we take lower ground than this we must inevitably form a sect or an ism If we gather round an ordinance however important or round a truth however indisputable we make something less than Christ our centre Hence it is more important to ponder the practical consequences which flow out of the truth of our being gathered to a risen and glorified Head in the heavens If Christ were on earth we should be gathered to him here but inasmuch as he is hidden in the heavens the Church takes her character from his position there Hence Christ could say They are not of the world even as I am not of the world and again For their sakes I sanctify myself that they also might be sanctified through the truth John xvii sixteen nineteen So also in one Peter we read To whom coming as unto a living stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house an holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ Chap ii four five If we are gathered to Christ we must be gathered to him as he is and where he is and the more the Spirit of God leads our souls into the understanding of this the more clearly we shall see the character of walk that becomes us Joseph s bride was united to him not in the pit or the dungeon but in the dignity and glory of his position in Egypt and in her case we can have no difficulty in perceiving the vast difference between the two positions But farther we read And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came There was a time of trouble coming but previous thereto the fruit of his union appeared The children whom God had given him were called into existence previous to this time of trial So will it be in reference to the Church All the members thereof will be called out the whole body will be completed and gathered to the Head in heaven previous to the great tribulation which shall come upon all the earth We shall now turn for a little to Joseph s interview with his brethren in which we shall find some points of resemblance to Israel s history in the latter day During the period that Joseph was hidden from the view of his brethren these latter were called to pass through deep and searching trial through intensely painful exercises of conscience One of these exercises is poured out in the following words And they said one to another We are verily guilty concerning our brother in that we saw the anguish of his soul when he besought us and we would not hear therefore is this distress come upon us And Reuben answered them saying Spake I not unto you saying Do not sin against the child and ye would not hear therefore behold also his blood is required Chap xlii twenty one twenty two Again in Chap xliv we read And Judah said What shall we say unto my Lord What shall we speak or how shall we clear ourselves God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants None can teach like God He alone can produce in the conscience the true sense of sin and bring the soul down into the profound depths of its own condition in his presence This is all his own work Men run on in their career of guilt heedless of every thing until the arrow of the Almighty pierces their conscience and then they are led into those searchings of heart and intense exercises of soul which can only find relief in the rich resources of redeeming love Joseph s brethren had no conception of all that was to flow to them from their actings toward him They took him and cast him into a pit and they sat down to eat bread Woe to them that drink wine in bowls and anoint themselves with the chief ointments but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph Amos vi six However God produced grief of heart and exercises of conscience and that in a most wonderful way Years rolled on and these brethren might have vainly imagined that all was right but then seven years of plenty and seven years of scarcity What did they mean Who sent them And for what were they designed Admirable providence Unsearchable wisdom The famine reaches to Canaan and the calls of hunger actually bring the guilty brethren to the feet of the injured Joseph How marked is the display of God s own hand in all this There they stand with the arrow of conviction thrust through and through their consciences in the presence of the man whom they had with wicked hands cast into the pit Surely their sin had found them out but it was in the presence of Joseph Blessed place Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him and he cried Cause every man to go out from me And there stood no man with him while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren Chap xlv one No stranger was allowed to witness this sacred scene What stranger could understand or appreciate it We are here called to witness as it were divinely wrought conviction in the presence of divine grace and we may say when these two come together there is an easy settlement of every question And Joseph said unto his brethren Come near to me I pray you And they came near And he said I am Joseph your brother whom ye sold into Egypt Now therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that you sold me hither for God did send me before you to preserve life And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance So now it was not you sent me hither but God This is grace indeed setting the convicted conscience perfectly at rest The brethren had already most thoroughly condemned themselves and hence Joseph had only to pour in the blessed balm into their broken hearts This is all sweetly typical of God s dealings with Israel in the latter day when they shall look upon him whom they have pierced and mourn Then they shall prove the reality of divine grace and the cleansing efficacy of that fountain which shall be opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness Zech xiii one In the third chapter of Acts we find the Spirit of God in Peter seeking to produce this divine conviction in the consciences of the Jews The God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob the God of our fathers hath glorified his son Jesus whom ye delivered up and denied him in the presence of Pilate when he was determined to let him go But ye denied the holy One and the just and desired a murderer to be granted unto you and killed the Prince of life whom God hath raised from the dead whereof we are witnesses These statements were designed to elicit from the hearts and lips of the hearers the confession made by Joseph s brethren We are verily guilty Then follows the grace And now brethren I wot that through ignorance ye did it as did also your rulers But those things which God before had showed by the mouth of all his prophets that Christ should suffer he hath so fulfilled Repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord We here see that although the Jews really carried out the enmity of their hearts in the death of Christ as did also Joseph s brethren in their treatment of him yet the grace of God to each is seen in this that all is shown to be decreed and foreshown of God for their blessing This is perfect grace surpassing all human thought and all that is needed in order to the enjoyment thereof is a conscience truly convicted by the truth of God Those who could say We are verily guilty could rightly understand the words of precious grace It was not you but God Thus it must ever be The soul that has thoroughly pronounced its own condemnation is prepared to understand and appreciate God s pardon The remaining chapters of this book are taken up with the removal of Jacob and his family into Egypt and their settlement there Joseph s actings during the remaining years of famine Jacob s blessing the twelve patriarchs his death and burial We shall not dwell in detail upon these things though the spiritual mind may find much to feed upon therein twenty one Jacob s groundless fears dissipated by the sight of his son alive and exalted the peculiar grace of God seen in its overruling power yet evidently mingled with judgment inasmuch as Jacob s sons have to go down into the very place whither they had sent their brother Again Joseph s remarkable grace throughout though exalted by Pharaoh he hides himself as it were and binds the people in abiding obligation to the king Pharaoh says Go to Joseph and Joseph in effect says all you have and all you are belong to Pharaoh This is sweetly interesting and leads the soul on to that glorious time when the Son of man shall take the reins of government into his own hand by divine appointment and rule over the whole redeemed creation his Church the bride of the Lamb occupying the nearest and most intimate place according to the eternal counsels The house of Israel fully restored shall be nourished and sustained by his gracious hand and all the earth shall know the deep blessedness of being under his sceptre Finally having brought every thing into subjection he shall hand back the reins of government into the hands of God that he may be all in all From all this we may form some idea of the richness and copiousness of Joseph s history In short it sets before us distinctly in type the mission of the Son to the house of Israel his humiliation and rejection the deep exercises and final repentance and restoration of Israel the union of the Church with Christ his exaltation and universal government and finally it points us forward to the time when God shall be all in all It is quite needless to remark that all these things are largely taught and fully established throughout the entire canon of inspiration we do not therefore build their truth upon Joseph s history still it is edifying to find such early foreshadowings of these precious truths it proves to us the divine unity which pervades holy scripture Whether we turn to Genesis or to Ephesians to the prophets of the Old or those of the New Testament we learn the same truths ALL SCRIPTURE IS GIVEN BY INSPIRATION OF GOD FOOTNOTES twenty Joseph s wife sets forth the Church as united to Christ in his glory Moses wife presents the Church as united to Christ in his rejection twenty one The close of Jacob s career stands in most pleasing contrast with all the previous scenes of his eventful history It reminds one of a serene evening after a tempestuous day the sun which during the day had been hidden from view by clouds mists and fogs sets in majesty and brightness gilding with his beams the western sky and holding out the cheering prospect of a bright to morrow Thus is it with our aged patriarch The supplanting the bargain making the cunning the management the shifting the shuffling the unbelieving selfish fears all those dark clouds of nature and of earth seem to have passed away and he comes forth in all the calm elevation of faith to bestow blessings and impart dignities in that holy skilfulness which communion with God can alone impart Though nature s eyes are dim faith s vision is sharp He is not to be deceived as to the relative positions assigned to Ephraim and Manasseh in the counsels of God He has not like his father Isaac in Chapter xxvii to tremble very exceedingly in view of an almost fatal mistake Quite the reverse His intelligent reply to his less instructed son is I know it my son I know it The power of sense has not as in Isaac s case dimmed his spiritual vision He has been taught in the school of experience the importance of keeping close to the divine purpose and nature s influence cannot move him from thence In Chapter xlviii eleven we have a very beautiful example of the mode in which our God ever rises above all our thoughts and proves himself better than all our fears And Israel said unto Joseph I had not thought to see thy face and lo God hath showed me also thy seed To nature s view Joseph was dead whereas in God s view he was alive and seated in the highest place of authority next the throne Eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither hath it entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him one Cor ii nine Would that our souls could rise higher in their apprehension of God and his ways It is interesting to notice the way in which the titles Jacob and Israel are introduced in the close of the Book of Genesis as for example One told Jacob and said Behold thy son Joseph cometh unto thee and Israel strengthened himself and sat upon the bed Then it is immediately added And Jacob said unto Joseph God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz Now we know there is nothing in scripture without its specific meaning and hence this interchange of names contains some instruction In general it may be remarked that Jacob sets forth the depth to which God had descended Israel the height to which Jacob was raised Transcribers notes Maintained original spelling and punctuation Greek and Hebrew transliteration is enclosed in brackets i e Greek End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Notes on the
