hundred sixty six CHAPTER I A GRAPEFRUIT PRELUDE Splash The grapefruit hit her in the eye Splash His psychic wave was dashed to smithereens Oh Oh the two girls screamed in unison D the young man sitting near ejaculated For ten minutes there in the Oak Room of the Ritz Carlton he had been hurling across the narrow intervening space this mental command to the girl facing him Look here Look at me Let me see your eyes Look here For half that time she had been conscious of his insistent gaze and his message But with as much will power as he himself displayed she bent her head over her plate and sent back along his telepathic transmission this reply I won t I won t But she was weakening Sadie she said to her companion I do awfully want to look up I want to see who is looking at me so fiercely I can just feel it all through me Of course it wouldn t be proper would it Well that all depends on who is looking at you dear doesn t it If it were some horrid old man No it doesn t feel a bit like that Sadie I don t know just how to explain it really it isn t unpleasant at all Why Helen And you engaged and going to elo Hush Sadie you mustn t say that in here Somebody might but I positively cannot keep my eyes down another moment I m Then splash A vicious little jab of the spoon and there followed a disastrous geyser a grapefruit geyser With a smothered little cry of pain Helen s eyes shut tight and she groped for her napkin And to make a good job of it the Fates dragged in at that moment Helen s guardian aunt the tall and statuesque missus Elvira Burton of Omaha Neb The young man who had failed so signally in what was perhaps his maiden effort at hypnotism viciously seized all the change the waiter proffered on the little silver tray flung it back with a snarl got up and stamped out of the room He was a mighty good looking chap smartly attired and if you care for details he wore a heliotrope scarf in which there gleamed a superb black pearl for which he had paid a superb price Can you beat it he muttered as he climbed the stairs to the lobby and mingled with the throng that stood about in stiff groups idly chattering and looking as if they bored one another to the verge of desperation Can you beat it he exclaimed again fairly biting off the words So vehemently occupied was he with his chagrin and annoyance that he stamped heavily upon the pet corn of a retired rear admiral rudely bumped a Roumanian duchess kicked the pink poodle of a famous prima donna and brought up with a thud against the heroic brawn and muscle of the house detective who stood as solidly in the middle of the lobby as if he had taken root somewhere down in the foundations Can I beat what asked the house detective frigidly My but he was an angry young man and he fairly snarled at the magnificent individual he had collided with Beat a drum beat an egg beat around the bush go as far as you like beat your grandmother if you prefer The granite faced house detective was not used to that sort of treatment furthermore it distinctly galled him to be asked to beat his grandmother whom he recalled as an estimable old lady who made an odd noise when she ate soup owing to an absence of teeth What s that you said about my grandmother he said bridling Bother your grandmother shot back the insolent retort whereat the lordly house detective plucked the young man by the arm Staggerin an loony talk don t go in the Ritz he said under his breath You ve been havin too much Preposterous exclaimed the young man vainly endeavoring to shake his arm free Are you a guest of the house demanded the immaculately garbed minion of the Ritz I am so kindly remove the pair of pincers you are crushing my arm with What s your name I don t know that is I ve forgotten Now I know you need lookin after Come over here to the desk The house detective had manifested no more outward passion than a block of ice and so adroit was he in marching the young man to the desk that not an eye in the lobby was attracted to the little scene The young man was at first inclined to make a fuss about it and demand an abject apology for this untoward treatment The absurdity of his predicament however stirred his sense of humor and he was meekly docile when his captor arraigned him at the desk and addressed one of the clerks Do you know this young man mister Horton Why yes Reagan this is mister Smith why That s it Smith cried the young man How could I ever forget that name Thomas Smith isn t it mister Horton or is it James Thomas of course at least that s the way you registered mister Smith Thomas Smith and valet The clerk s eyebrows started straight up his head Thomas Smith exactly Now are you satisfied mister House Detective or do you want to go up and examine my luggage Having convinced you that I am a registered guest how would you like to have me walk a chalk line and convince you that I am sober The house detective froze up tighter than ever pivoted on his heel and walked majestically away What is the trouble mister Smith asked the clerk deferentially for he was a better student of exteriors than John Reagan twenty years a precinct detective and retired to take up the haughtier role of plain clothes man in this most fastidious of metropolitan hostelries No trouble at all old chap laughed the young man I lost my little capri and then by accident I discovered a stray member of the herd belonging to yonder Ajax Some day he s going to turn into solid marble from the dome down when you will have a most extraordinary piece of statuary on your hands By the way have there been any telephone messages for me I am expecting a very important one I will see mister Smith said the clerk briskly and began searching through the pigeonholes Yes mister Whitney Barnes called up left word he would call up again at two sharp Will you be in your room sir Do you think I ll be safe in my room asked the young man solemnly Safe exclaimed the clerk Why what do you mean sir Oh nothing only Sir Ivory Ajax seems suspicious of me and might take it into his head to come up and see if I hadn t murdered my valet That s all I m going to my room now to wait for mister Barnes s telephone call Kindly be sure that he is connected with my room There is something strange about that young fellow murmured the clerk as he watched the object of suspicion vanish into the lift Though if he is a friend of Whitney Barnes the clerk added after a pause he ought to be all right I think I ll look him up in the Social Register Which he did without enlightenment CHAPTER II mister HOGG ENTERS THE LISTS Having arrived in the grill room of the Ritz coincident with a devastating eruption of grapefruit missus Elvira Burton set out forthwith to demonstrate that her unexpected advent was likewise somewhat in the nature of a lemon Even her smile was acid as she spread out her rich sable furs and sat down at the table with her two pretty nieces I have just received a letter from mister Hogg Helen she began with a rush regardless of the anguish that was still evident in Helen s lovely grapefruit bespattered eyes A twinge of something more than mere physical pain twisted the young girl s features at the mention of the name Hogg Oh auntie she almost sobbed can t you leave mister Hogg out of my luncheon We had him last night for dinner and again this morning for breakfast Helen exclaimed missus Burton in accents of bitter reproach I just won t have him for luncheon and with all this grapefruit in my eye insisted Helen hotly It must hurt terribly sympathized missus Burton s other pretty charge then twisted her head and looked behind her What are you looking at Sadie demanded missus Burton suspiciously Sadie turned with a start and blushed furiously She started to stammer a reply when the less timid cousin came to her rescue Some ridiculous man was trying to flirt with us and we were both awfully nervous I suppose Sadie looked to see if you had frightened him off The blushing Sadie was amazed at her cousin s resourcefulness and stole a glance from under the curling fuzz of her golden bang to note the effect produced upon her august guardian and aunt missus Burton groped in her mind for some subtlety that might have been contained in her niece s remark failed at any plausible solution and then almost vindictively returned to her original line of attack Helen Burton I must insist that you listen to me I have broken an engagement for the matinee with my friend missus Hobbs Smathers of Chicago for the express purpose of communicating to you the contents of mister Hogg s letter He informs me Helen that you are treating him scandalously that you do not pay the slightest attention to his letters or even answer his telegrams Did he say he was getting thin that would be charming teased the incorrigible Helen missus Burton gasped and the color surged into her cheeks in two flaming danger signals The glance she turned upon the mischievously laughing eyes of her niece was intended to annihilate every vestige of frivolity Her ample bosom struggled in its purple velvet casement Sadie Burton actually shook in her tiny boots as she pictured her aunt in one of her hysterical outbursts right there in the midst of a host of strangers who seemed to the unsophisticated miss from Omaha to represent the very cream of New York society Even Helen was sobered by the gathering storm warnings The smile left her curving red lips and the dimples vanished All that lingered of her playful humor showed in the impish lights that danced in her expressive eyes But she was spared the storm A tiny page resplendant with myriad buttons appeared in the entrance to the Oak Room and lisped the name Mith Helen Burthon He bore in his arms a bouquet of magnificent orchids Every eye in the room focussed upon the tiny flower bearer among them the wrathful pair of missus Elvira Burton Mith Helen Burthon The rage of the older woman had somewhat cooled She managed to nod her head haughtily to the boy He came forward briskly with his precious burden of blooms and laid them on the table then right about faced with military precision and marched away Now it was Helen Burton s turn to blush and her agitation was as pretty to see as anything those who continued to stare in her direction had ever witnessed Her dimples were positive hollows from which her blushes seemed to fountain She did not reach for the bouquet though because her hand trembled so and there was actual fear in her eyes as she shrank back in her seat and regarded her aunt missus Burton was not loath to seize upon any leverage that might give her sway over her rebellious niece With a smile that was unequivocally malicious she slowly raised the bunch of orchids and turned them over The bouquet was tied with a delicate mauve satin ribbon that perfectly matched the gown worn by her niece missus Burton looked at the ribbon and then at Helen s dress There was accusation in the glance Her eyes studied the orchids They were of a peculiar rich golden brown matching the splendor of Miss Burton s hair There was conviction in the second glance She turned the bouquet over several times looking for a card There was none Now here was a mystery Could Miss Helen explain missus Burton inhaled a deep breath then said with exaggerated sweetness Helen dear who could have sent you these beautiful flowers They are positively superb He must certainly be an artist Great as was her first panic the young girl quickly rallied to her own defense She had only waited to be sure there was no card no incriminating mark of identification She leaned forward on her elbows sighed rapturously and exclaimed Aren t they exquisite Aunt El I asked you Helen dear who could have sent them There was something distinctly feline in the purring tones as the question was repeated Why isn t there any card Aunt El fenced the girl Come come my dear why keep me in suspense You can see there is no card Can it be one of the young men we met at the Grangers last night I hardly think so for it is execrably bad form to send flowers to a public dining room by a page in buttons Helen shook her head and assumed an air of great perplexity She stole a glance across the table at Sadie but that shy little cousin seemed on the verge of tears missus Burton intercepted the wireless appeal and shifted her cross questioning to Sadie She was determined to unravel the mystery She read Sadie s panic as a symptom of guilty knowledge But Sadie was loyal to the cousin and chum she adored and proved surprisingly game under fire Indeed she succeeded in breaking down her aunt s cross examination and bringing the inquest to ruins by suddenly clapping her hands and blurting Maybe mister Hogg sent them by telegraph The outrageous absurdity of the statement gave it cataclysmic force Helen embraced Sadie with her eyes and then added her own broadside That really was splendid of him Auntie El Now you can tell me all about his letter I will reserve that until later said missus Burton icily If you have finished your luncheon Helen please pay the check and we shall go CHAPTER III WHITNEY BARNES UNDER FIRE Joshua Barnes sometimes referred to in the daily press as Old Grim Barnes the mustard millionaire turned suddenly upon his son and pinioned him Why don t you get married That s just it pater why don t I replied the young man blandly Well why don t you then stormed Joshua Barnes banging his fist down upon the mahogany table It s time you did Another bang lifted the red headed office boy in the next room clear out of Deep Blood Gulch just as Derringer Dick was rescuing the beautiful damsel from the Apaches Even Miss Featherington dropped The Mystery of the Purple Room on the floor and made a wild onslaught on the keys of her typewriter Whitney Barnes smiled benevolently upon his parent and nonchalantly lighted a cigarette As I ve said before he parried easily between the puffing of smoke rings I haven t found the girl Dod rot the girl started Joshua Barnes then stopped Now you know my dear father that I couldn t treat my wife like that The trouble with you pater is that you reason from false premises Nothing of the sort choked out Barnes senior You know well enough what I mean young man You have any number of of well eligible young ladies to choose from You go everywhere and meet everybody And you spend my money like water Somebody has got to spend it spoke up the sole heir to the mustard millions cheerfully I ll tell you what I ll do pater you stop making it and I ll stop spending it That s a bargain It ll be a great lark for us both It keeps me awake nights figuring out how I m going to spend it and it keeps you awake nights puzzling over how you can make it or that is make more of it Stop thundered Joshua Barnes For once in my life Whitney Barnes I am going to have a serious talk with you If your poor mother had only lived all this wouldn t have been necessary She d have had you married off and there d be a houseful of grand children by this time and Just a moment pater did triplets or that sort of thing ever run in our family Certainly not What are you driving at Nothing nothing my father Only I was just wondering We have a pretty big house you know For a moment Joshua Barnes seemed on the verge of apoplexy but he came around quickly and moreover with a twinkle in his eye Even a life devoted to mustard has its brighter side and Old Grim Barnes was not entirely devoid of a sense of humor He was his grim old self again however when he resumed Again I insist that you be serious I intend that you shall be married within a year Otherwise I will put you to work on a salary of ten dollars a week and compel you to live on it If you persist in refusing to interest yourself in my business the business that my grandfather founded and that my father and I built up you can at least settle down and lead a respectable married life To be candid with you Whitney and Joshua Barnes s big voice suddenly softened I want to see some little grand children round me before I die I have some pride of blood my boy and I want to see our name perpetuated You have frivolled enough Whitney You are twenty four I can honestly thank God that you ve been nothing more than a fool You are not vicious Thanks awfully pater Being nothing more than a fool I suppose it is up to me to get married Very well then I will Give me your hand dad it s a bargain Whitney Barnes tossed away his cigarette and grasped his father s hand in both of his He had become intensely serious There was a depth of affection in that handclasp that neither father nor son permitted to show above the surface Yet both felt it keenly within Picking up his hat and stick the tall slim graceful young man said You have no further commands on the subject dad Do you want to pick the girl or will you leave it to the taste and sometimes good judgment of a fool Haven t you any one in mind son asked Joshua Barnes anxiously Absolutely not one pater You see the trouble is that I can t ever seem to get real chummy with a girl but what her mother has to come and camp on my trail and scare me into fits You haven t the least idea what a catch your son is Joshua Barnes Why a mother in law looks to me like something in petticoats that comes creeping up with a catlike tread carrying in one hand a net and in the other a bale hook I can t sit out two dances with a debutante before this nightmare is looking over my shoulder grinning like a gargoyle and counting up the number of millions you are going to leave me Oh bosh ejaculated Joshua Barnes It s all in your fool imagination Grow up and be a man Whitney You have given me your word and I expect you to make good And by the way son there is my old friend Charley Calker s girl just out of college I hear she s a stunner Mary Calker is a stunner dad and then a trifle But I regret to say that she is too fresh from the cloistered halls of learning You see I have been out of college three years and have managed to forget such a jolly lot that I really couldn t talk to her She d want me to make love in Latin and correspond in Greek Worse than that she understands Browning No poor Mary will have to marry a prescription clerk or a florist or something else out of the classics But don t lose heart pater I may be engaged before night By by It was a vastly more solemn Whitney Barnes who strolled out of the office of the mustard magnate and dragged his feet through the anteroom where sat Marietta Featherington and Teddie O Toole The comely Miss Featherington could scarcely believe what she saw from under her jutting puffs This good looking dandified young man with his perpetual smile and sparkling gray eyes had long been her conception of all that was noble and cultured and aristocratic He was her Viscount Reginald Vere de Vere speaking to her as from between yellow paper covers He was her prince incognito who fell in love with Lily the Lovely Laundress He had threaded the mazes of more than one of her palpitating dreams and in her innermost heart of hearts she had cherished the fond belief that one day their orbs would meet and their souls would rush together in such a head on collision as is sometimes referred to as love at first sight But in Miss Featherington s hero worship gloom had no part Her ideals never ceased to smile whether they slew or caressed and perpetually they carried themselves with a jaunty swing or a dashing stride The fact that there had been storm mutterings within the awful cave of Old Grim Barnes had never before had a depressing effect upon her hero He had always sallied forth with airy tread humming a tune or laughing with his eyes What could have happened at this fateful meeting Perhaps he had been disinherited Rapture of raptures he had confessed his love for some howling beauty of humble station had been cut off with the inevitable shilling and was now going forth to earn his bread Marietta Featherington s heart came up and throbbed in her throat as Whitney Barnes suddenly wheeled and confronted her Leaning back upon his cane he looked at her very very solemnly Miss Featherington he pronounced slowly I wish to ask you a question May I Marietta was sure that her puffs were on fire so fierce was the heat that blazed under her fair skin She concentrated all her mental forces in an effort to summon an elegant reply But all she could get out was a stifled Sure thing Thank you Miss Featherington said the young man My question is this Do you believe in soul mates That is do you judging from what you have observed and any experience you may have had believe that true love is controlled by the hand of Fate or that you yourself can take hold and guide your own footsteps in affairs of the heart Teddie O Toole had crammed Deep Blood Gulch into his hip pocket and was grinning from ear to ear Miss Featherington was positive that her puffs were all ablaze She could almost smell them burning She looked down and she looked up and she drew a long desperate sigh I believe in Fate she said with emotion that would have done honor to Sarah Bernhardt Thank you Miss Featherington said Whitney Barnes with profound respect then turned on his heel and went out into the corridor of the great office building Unconsciously he had dealt a ruthless blow and there is not a scintilla of doubt but that he was responsible for the box on the ears that made Teddie O Toole s head ring for the remainder of the day and thereby took all the flavor from the thrills he had found in Deep Blood Gulch CHAPTER IV SMILES AND TEARS Now there is no use in your arguing Sadie I love him and I have given him my promise The two cousins were alone again speeding up Fifth avenue in an automobile a long bodied foreign car that had been put at the disposal of missus Burton by the New York agent of mister Hogg The Omaha suitor for the hand of the fair Helen had also thrown in a red headed French chauffeur which is travelling a bit in the matter of chauffeurs But as he understood only automobile English it was a delightful arrangement for Helen and Sadie and permitted them absolute freedom of speech while riding behind him If I had only known him longer or had been introduced to him differently sighed Sadie But haven t I known all about him for years protested Helen Burton Of course we were only school girls when he made that wonderful rescue at Narragansett Pier Don t you remember how we rushed down to the beach to see him but got there just too late He had gone out to his yacht or something Oh it was just splendid Sadie And he is so wonderfully modest about it Why when I reminded him of his heroism he pretended to have forgotten all about it Just imagine mister Hogg forgetting a thing like that Do you know what Jabez Hogg would do under similar circumstances Sadie Burton Well I ll tell you he d hire the biggest hall in Omaha and reproduce the whole thing with moving pictures as an advertisement for his beef canneries The young girl had worked herself into a passion and was making savage little gestures with her clenched fists But what I can t understand Helen dear is why a man like Travers Gladwin should make such a mystery of himself and try to avoid introducing you to his friends I am sure persisted Sadie despite the gathering anger in her companion s eyes that Aunt Elvira would not object to him You know she is just crazy to break into the swim here in New York and the Gladwins are the very best of people I think it wouldn t take much to urge her even to throw over mister Hogg for Gladwin if you d only let her take charge of the wedding Nothing of the sort denied Helen hotly Aunt Elvira is bound on her solemn word of honor to mister Hogg She will fight for him to the last ditch though she knows I hate him Don t you think Helen said the younger girl more soberly that you are simply trying to make yourself look at it that way I know mister Hogg isn t a pretty man and he has an awful name but There is no but about it Sadie Burton I have given my word to Travers Gladwin and I am going to elope with him to night I packed my trunk this morning and gave the porter ten dollars to take it secretly to the Grand Central Station Travers told me just how to arrange it Oh there s his house now Sadie the big white one on the corner It just thrills me to go by it On our way back from Riverside Drive we must stop there I must leave word that auntie insists on our going to the opera and that I won t be able to get to him at the time we agreed Oh I do wish something would turn up and prevent it cried Sadie almost in tears You horrid little thing retorted Helen It is dreadful of you to talk like that when you know how much I care for him It isn t that I don t think you care for him returned Sadie with trembling lip It s something inside of me that warns me All this secrecy frightens me I can t understand why a man of Travers Gladwin s wealth and social position would want to do such a thing But we both have tried to tell you insisted Helen that there is an important business reason for it He didn t tell what that reason was persisted the tearfully stubborn cousin You admitted he didn t give you any definite reason at all Helen Burton stamped her foot and bit her lip By this time the big touring car was gliding through the East Drive of Central Park with the swift noiseless motion that denotes the highest development of the modern motor vehicle Fully a mile of the curving roadway had slid under the wheels of the car before Helen resumed the conversation with the sudden outburst You don t doubt for an instant Sadie that he is a gentleman Sadie made no reply His knowledge of painting and art is simply wonderful At that art sale where we met he knew every painting at a glance He didn t even have to look for the signatures You know if it hadn t been for him I would have bought that awful imitation Fragonard and just thrown away two months of my allowance Sadie Burton he is the cleverest man I ever met He has travelled everywhere and knows everything and I love him I love him I love him In proof of which the charming young woman burst into tears and took refuge in her vast muff This sentimental explosion was too much for tender hearted Sadie She gave way completely and swore not to breathe another word in opposition to the elopement And as she felt her beloved cousin s body shaken with sobs she forced herself to go into ecstasies over Travers Gladwin s manly beauty and god like intellect In her haste to soothe she went to extravagant lengths and cried And he must have looked heavenly in his bathing suit when he made that wonderful rescue Down fell Helen s muff with as much of a crash as a muff could make and she turned upon her companion the most profoundly shocked expression of a bride about to be Sadie she reproved stiffly you have gone far enough Whereupon it was Sadie s turn to seek the sanctuary of tears CHAPTER V WHITNEY BARNES TELEPHONES TO THE RITZ Glancing up into the solemn face of an unusually good looking young man who wore his silk hat at a jaunty angle and whose every detail of attire suggested that he was of that singularly blessed class who toil not neither do they spin Miss Mamie McCorkle public telephone operator in the tallest but one skyscraper below the Fulton street dead line expected to be asked to look up some number in the telephone book and be generously rewarded for the trifling exertion It wasn t any wonder then that she broke the connections of two captains of industry and one get rich quick millionaire when this was what she got Suppose my dear young lady that you had a premonition a hunch I might say that you were destined this current day of the calendar week to meet your Kismet in petticoats wouldn t it make you feel a bit hollow inside and justify you in taking your first drink before your customary hour for absorbing the same Usually a live wire at repartee Mamie McCorkle was stumped With a captain of industry swearing in each ear and the get rich quick millionaire trying to break in with his more artistic specialties in profanity she was for a moment frozen into silence When she did come to the surface she set the captains of industry down where they belonged retorted upon the get rich quick millionaire that he was no gentleman and she hoped he would inform the manager she said so and then raised her eyebrows at the interrogator who leaned against her desk If that s an invitation to lunch No I m already dated she said If you re trying to kid me ring off the line is busy All of which said the young man in the same slow sober voice is sage counsel for the frivolous I am not As you look like a very sensible young woman I put a sensible question to you Perhaps my language was vague What I meant to convey was do you think I would be justified in taking a drink at this early hour of the day to brace me for the ordeal of falling in love with an unknown affinity If your language is personal replied Miss McCorkle with a sarcastic laugh my advice is to take six drinks I m in love with a chauffeur Good said the young man brightly and may I ask if it was a sudden or a swift affair Swift snapped Miss McCorkle He ran over my stepmother then brought her home I let him in We were engaged next day Here s the ring one and one half carats white now what number do you want A thousand thanks get me the Ritz Carlton please and don t break this ten dollar bill I hate change it spoils the set of one s pockets As Whitney Barnes squeezed himself into the booth Miss McCorkle squinted one eye at the crisp bill he had laid before her and smiled There s more than one way she thought of being asked not to listen to dove talk and I like this method best The shrewd hello girl however had erred in the case of Whitney Barnes for this is the way his end of the conversation in booth No seven ran This the Ritz Yes Kindly connect me with mister Smith What Smith Newest one you got Forget the first name Thomas Smith you say Well give me Tom Hello there Trav that is Tom or do you prefer Thomas What s that Came in by way of Boston on a Cunarder What s all the row Read you were in Egypt doing the pyramids Can t explain over the wire eh Hope it isn t a divorce case they re beastly Ought to know you better than that Say what s the matter with your little angora Be serious it s no joking matter Well if it wasn t serious how could I joke about it You can t joke about a joke I m a fool I wonder where I heard that before Oh yes a few minutes ago My paternal parent said the same thing Can I meet you at your house Where is it I ought to know I don t see why you keep building it over all the time and then go way and leave it for two years at a stretch Then when you do come home you go and live under the Cut that out My glory but there is a mystery here Certainly I don t want to spoil everything Have I an engagement I should say I have Just you call up Joshua Barnes and ask for the dope on it a whole flock of engagements bunched into one large contract the biggest I ever tackled No I guess it won t prevent me from meeting you Not unless I happen to see her on the way uptown Blessed if I know her any more than you Wish I did but whoever she is she s got to be pretty awful horrible nice Have I been drinking No but you better have one ready for me Seen any of the chaps at the club What s that You gave it a wide berth This is beginning to sound like a detective novel or a breach of promise case You don t tell me Really I d never looked at myself in that light before Sure I m stuck on myself Head over heels in love with myself I m a classy little party I am and you better make the best of me while I m here Where am I going Nowhere in particular Just going to merge my individuality bite a chunk out of an apple and get kicked out of the Garden of Eden Now you re sure I m piffled No such luck Trav that is mister Smith mister Thomas Smith Shall I ask for Smith when I drop up at that little marble palace of yours No Oh Bateato will be there if you happen to be delayed How is the little son of Nippon Oh that s good Five sharp Tata Smitty old chap By Jove he s rung off with a curse CHAPTER VI OFFICER six hundred sixty six ON PATROL Michael Phelan had been two years on the force and considered himself a very fly young man He had lost something of his romantic outline during the six months he pounded the Third avenue pave past two breweries and four saloons to a block and it was at his own request made through his mother s second cousin District Leader McNaught that he had been provided with a saloonless beat on Fifth avenue A certain blue eyed raven haired nursemaid who fed a tiny millionaire with a solid gold spoon and trundled an imported perambulator along the east walk of Central Park may have had something to do with Patrolman Phelan s choice of beat but he failed to mention the fact to his mother He laid it all on the breweries and the temptations they offered Humble as was Michael Phelan s station on the force he was already famous from the wooded wastes of Staten Island to the wilds of the Bronx Even the graven featured chief inspector permitted himself to smile when the name of Michael Phelan was mentioned He was a fresh rosy cheeked greener than grass probationary cop when fame came to him all in one clap and awoke a thunderous roll of laughter throughout the city It was his first detail on the lower east side in the precinct commanded from the Eldridge street station The time was July and the day was a broiler He was sitting in the reserve room playing dominoes with the doorman and mopping his forehead with a green bandana when the captain sent for him Phelan said the captain shortly there s a lady dead without a doctor at three hundred eleven Essex street three flights up rear They ve told the Coroner s Office but all the Coroners are busy The corpse is a lone widow lady with no kin so you go up and take charge and wait for the Coroner Officer six hundred sixty six tipped his cap with military salute and set out Turning the corner into Essex street he met plain clothes man Tim Feeney who stopped him and asked him where he was bound Michael Phelan explained and then said Tim if you don t mind will you give me a tip What do I do when I get up to that flat and how long will I have to wait You ll have to wait Mike replied Tim Feeney till the Coroner gets good and ready to come When you get to the flat don t knock walk right in Then sit down by the bed and wait Be sure you keep the door shut and let no soul in till the Coroner arrives It ll be powerful hot and I m perishing o thirst now said Mike Take off your coat said Tim and send a kid for a can of beer When you hear the Coroner comin slip the can under the bed Tim Feeney went on his way with his hand over his mouth Patrolman Phelan had missed the twinkle in Tim Feeney s eye and a few minutes later found him sitting beside a bed with his coat off and a foaming can on the floor by his chair On his way up the steep narrow staircases he had met a boy and sent him for the liquid refreshment He had instructed the lad where to deliver the beer and had gone quietly in to his unpleasant vigil The door he opened led directly into the bedroom He had glanced once at the bed and then looked away with a shudder Perspiration fairly cascaded down his flaming cheeks as he tiptoed to a chair and placed it beside the bed He placed his chair at a slight angle away from the bed and then fixed his eyes on the opposite wall When he heard the tread of the boy in the hall he made a pussy footed dash for the door took in the growler shut the boy out and buried his face in the froth He was in better heart but still mighty uneasy when he wiped his mouth on the back of his fist Somewhere in the flat a clock ticked dismally Through two small open windows puffed superheated gusts of air The muffled clamor of many voices in strange tongues sifted through the windows and walls but served only to increase the awful stillness in the room Despite his efforts to the contrary Phelan stole a glance at the bed then looked away while his heart stopped beating There was a naked foot where he had seen only a sheet before Mebbe the wind blew it off he tried to tell himself but something inside him rejected the explanation and he felt an icy finger drawn up and down his spine Again he plunged his head into the capacious can and succeeded in reviving his heart action More minutes of dreadful suspense passed A leaden silence had filled the sweltering room Even the voices of the tenements had died away to a funereal murmur Battle as he did with all his will Phelan s eyes were again drawn from their fixed gaze upon the wall and what he saw this time induced a strangling sensation Three toes had distinctly wiggled He withdrew his eyes on the instant and his shaking hand reached down for the can His fingers had barely touched it when an awful shriek rent the air The shriek came from the bed and it was followed by a second yell and then by a third Michael Phelan did not open the door as he passed out It was not a very strong door and it went down like cardboard before the impact The third shriek awoke the echoes just as Officer six hundred sixty six was coasting down the stairs on the seat of his departmental trousers His departmental coat and his departmental hat were in no way connected with his precipitate transit A raging Polish woman brought these details of Michael s uniform to the Eldridge street station a little later Likewise she prefered charges against Phelan that come under the heading of conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman It was a tremendous trial in the course of which the Deputy Police Commissioner who sat in judgment barely missed having a serious stroke It was adduced in evidence that Officer six hundred sixty six had entered the wrong flat the Coroner s case being one flight up But while the whole town rocked with laughter Michael Phelan failed to see the joke and his hatred of Precinct Detective Tim Feeney never cooled That he got off with a light sentence of one day s fine did not in the least improve his humor He knew he was a marked man from that day and it was all his mother could do to urge him to stay on the force In the course of time however the sting had worn off and the young patrolman learned to smile again His hollow cheeks had filled out amazingly during the period of the brewery beat and on that late autumn day when he stepped into the pages of this narrative he looked mighty good not only to the raven haired Rosalind O Neill but to a host of other pretty nursemaids who were wheeling their aristocratic little charges up and down The Avenue Nor was Michael Phelan at all unconscious of this as he sauntered along the broad pavement and gracefully twirled his baton His chest jutted out like the breast of a pouter pigeon and he wore the solemnly self conscious expression of a peacock on parade When he came to the great white square mansion of Travers Gladwin he paused and studied it shrewdly with his eye It was one of the most important functions of his patrol to study the fronts of all unoccupied dwellings and see that every window was down and every door was closed First he looked into the areaway of the Gladwin home and then his eye travelled up the wide balustraded stoop to the ornamental bronze doors What s this he gasped in astonishment Sure I read in the papers on y this morning that Travers Gladwin was in Agypt Tis a bold thafe who ll go in the front door in broad day so here s where Mary Phelan s son makes the grand pinch he s been dreamin on this six months back and gets his picture in the papers CHAPTER VII THE LITTLE BROWN JAP Patrolman Phelan wrapped his sinewy fist about the handle of his club with a vicious grip as he proceeded cautiously up the steps The heavy bronze door had been left ajar and he squeezed through without opening it further then paused in the vestibule and listened What he heard seemed no more than the tread of a spider and the thought rushed into his head Tis one of that felt soled kind Tis tip toes for Phelan He had noted that even the inside door was open and he swiftly divined from this that the thief had left it open for his own convenience or for some other purpose connected with the mysteries of burglar alarms Inch by inch the policeman moved across the vestibule and wriggled through the door into the richly carpeted hallway It was with a distinct sense of relief that he felt his heavy boots sink noiselessly into the deep ply of a precious Daghestan rug One of Phelan s boots had a bad creak in it and he knew that the master crook who would attempt such a robbery as this would have an acute sense of hearing It was dark as a pocket down the stretch of the heavily curtained foyer save for a meagre shaft of light that came through a slightly parted pair of portieres to the left and not a dozen feet from where he stood He strained his ear toward this shaft of light until there came an unmistakable swish of sound whereupon he moved forward in short gliding steps When he reached the break in the portieres and looked in he was astonished to see a short little man with shiny black hair deftly removing the linen covers from chairs and tables and statuary The little man had his back to Phelan as the policeman stepped inside but he turned in a flash and confronted the intruder with the peculiar glazed grimness of the Japanese Well what matter ripped out the little Jap without moving a muscle That s what I come to find out retorted Phelan with accusing severity of tone How you get in here retorted the Jap in the same sharp emotionless tones I saw ye snakin in an ye didn t latch the door after yez blurted Phelan taking a step nearer the Jap and still watching him with profound suspicion What you want asked the Jap with a slight tremor of apprehension Information cried Phelan What are yez doin in here Phelan s eye swept the room for some evidence of an attempt to despoil Though he saw none he did not relinquish his attitude of suspicion The Jap seemed about to speak and then stopped As Phelan continued to glower at him he snapped out I no can tell Triumph blazed in Phelan s eyes Now he was sure he had a thief and he determined to handle the situation with all the majesty of his official person So yez can t tell what yez re doin in this house he said with fine sarcasm The Jap shook his head emphatically and returned a positive No tell Phelan balanced his club for a moment and strode toward the Jap Yez better come with me he said through compressed lips The Jap started back with a frightened exclamation You no take me to jail he uttered while his yellow features twitched with fear In a minute replied the elated officer if yez don t tell me what yez re doin here I ve been lookin out for this place while mister Gladwin was in foreign parts and You know mister Gladwin broke in the Jap excitedly No I ain t never seen him said Phelan but I know this is his house an I been keepin my eye on it fer him mister Gladwin he my boss and the Jap grinned from ear to ear This solution of the mystery never entered the policeman s head and he resented the surprise Do yez mean yez re his valley he asked vindictively refusing to relinquish his suspicion Ees and again the Jap grinned Phelan read the grin as a distinct insult to his intelligence and he pounced upon the little brown man in an even more caustic tone If yez re are mister Gladwin s valley what are ye doin here an him thousands o miles away across the ocean in Agypt an Jerusalem an the like Now it was Phelan s turn to grin as he saw the Jap shrink and turn upon him a pair of wildly alarmed eyes Come Come I m waitin fer an answer The cat had his mouse backed into a corner and mentally licked his chops I no can tell stammered the Jap desperately That s enough ripped out Officer six hundred sixty six grabbing the Jap by the shoulder and yanking him toward the doorway No no wait gasped the struggling prisoner You no say if I tell you plees Tell me first grunted Phelan releasing his grip The Jap ducked his head in every direction as if fearful that the walls had ears then said in an impressive whisper My boss mister Gladwin home Misther Gladwin home Here in New York There was both incredulity and amazement in Phelan s voice Ees bleated the Jap and his grin returned Well why didn t you say so before said Phelan angrily at which the fidgety little brown son of Nippon hastened to explain No one should know He come all in much secret He go boat to Boston No use name No one know he mister Gladwin He say Bateato me Bateato Bateato he say no tell I come home sure he say and Bateato he no tell Officer Phelan yielded to the grip of the mystery and his attitude toward the Jap changed What did he want to snake home that away fer I no know nodded Bateato Yez no know eh Well is he comin here do yez no know that He tell me come here and wait feex thees room he come here or telephone The straightforward manner of the little Jap had almost completely disarmed the policeman s suspicion but he surrendered reluctantly Did he give yez a key to get in here Phelan fired as his last shot Ees he give me all bunch keys look and Bateato produced a gold key ring with a gold tag and a number of keys attached Phelan examined it and read aloud the name Travers Gladwin engraved on the tag Handing them back to the Jap he addressed him impressively gesturing his emphasis with his baton I guess yez re all right but I ll have me eye on yez from the outside mind that and if yez re foolin me or tryin to get away with anythin Phelan snapped his lips together and with a mighty lunge plucked an imaginary prisoner out of the atmosphere and shook it ferociously Then stepping back to the doorway he shut one eye with a fierce wink and jerked out Are yez wise The profound pantomime was too much for Bateato who stared after the vanishing officer in open mouthed amazement CHAPTER VIII ART MYSTERY AND LOVE The little Jap was still posed in an attitude of bewilderment as the two outside doors slammed and Officer six hundred sixty six went down the front steps to resume the tread of his beat and the breaking of fragile hearts When he did emerge from his trance he returned to the task of getting the great room in order with the same snappy energy he had displayed when the uniformed minion of the law broke in upon him He had removed the covers from the chairs and was dusting off a great carved chest that stood against the wall to the right of the doorway when the door bell rang Bateato jumped and then waited for a second ring Stepping warily out into the hallway he looked to see if it was the grim official in blue and buttons Ha he exclaimed No more police and he shot to the door and opened it for that debonnair young gentleman who was one day to inherit the mustard millions of Old Grim Barnes Hello there Bateato Whitney Barnes greeted the little Jap cordially Did your master show up yet He no come grinned Bateato shutting the door and leading the way into the room he had been preparing for his master s arrival As Whitney Barnes stepped into the room the Jap asked Scuse me mister Barnes you see mister Gladwin No nor his double Thomas Smith of the Ritz but he asked me to meet him here at five o clock Bateato Ees sair lisped the Jap with a bob of the head then dived back to his occupation of making the long deserted room look presentable As Bateato followed his master s friend into the room he switched on the full glare of electric lights that depended from the ceiling or blazed through the shades of many lamps Whitney Barnes blinked for a moment and then started as his gaze was directed to the walls hung with masterpieces The work of Rubens Rembrandt Coret Meissonier Lely Cazzin Vegas Fragonard Reynolds and a score others of the world s greatest masters leaped across his vision as he turned from wall to wall revolving on his heel Whew he ejaculated I didn t know that Travers went in for this sort of thing He certainly is the secretive little oyster when he wants to be Still studying the portraits and landscapes and allegorical groups he voiced to Bateato a sudden thought By the way Bateato do you know what it was that brought your master back in this strange fashion and the reason for all this secrecy No sair responded the Jap Well it s damned peculiar muttered the young man to himself and proceeded on a tour about the room to examine more closely its wealth of art treasure He had been engaged in this way about five minutes when the door bell rang and Bateato cried Here mister Gladwin now How do you know that Bateato quizzed the young man absently his attention being gripped by a stunning aphrodite rising from the sea in a glory of nudity and rainbows The Jap paused a second on his way to the door and replied Cause no one know he home but mister Barnes Thees house close up much long time and mister Gladwin make papers say he in Egypt In the same breath in which he maximed this volley of words the little Jap projectiled himself from the room His deductions are marvellous said Whitney Barnes solemnly addressing a bronze bust of Philip of Macedon He turned in time to meet the brisk entrance of Travers Gladwin alias Thomas Smith of the Ritz The two shook hands warmly and looked into each other s faces with quizzical smiles They were about of an age both unusually good looking and bearing themselves with that breezy confident manner that is characteristic of young men who have been coddled in swan s down all their lives Well well well Travers Hello Whitney old boy The greeting sprang from their lips simultaneously and after he had tossed his hat and cane to his valet Travers Gladwin continued Didn t expect to see me so soon did you old scout I should say I didn t Why when I got that telegram of yours to call up Thomas Smith at the Ritz it certainly was some jar to my delicate nervous system Travers Gladwin laughed and rubbed his hands Did it though he cried Gave you a real thrill eh Exact and specific a real thrill Well you re lucky a surprise and a thrill I d give anything for a real surprise I ve hunted this little planet s four corners for one and failed to connect If you can t achieve em you seem to be in the business of manufacturing em Come along now what s all this thundering mystery I m shot to pieces with curiosity What s happened to make you come home like this Watkins replied Travers Gladwin curtly Watkins What Watkins Who s Watkins Watkins is my man I mean Watkins was my man before I found out that he was systematically robbing me Oh I remember now A jolly good servant though So he robbed you did he But they all do Yes but they don t always get found out caught with the goods as the police say I caught Watkins with the goods and sacked him But you don t mean to tell me that you came kiting home from the pyramids and the lovely Sahara desert just because this chap Watkins was dishonest said Whitney Barnes in tones of incredulity No Whitney replied Gladwin dropping into a chair and puckering his forehead with a frown Watkins was only the start of it I got rid of him six months ago But while I was on my way to Egypt I learned that Watkins and my lawyer had been in some sort of a secret correspondence before I gave Watkins the bounce What lawyer Not Old Reliable Forbes Why I thought he wore a certified halo So did I but I ve got news to the contrary and you know he has charge of everything for me keeps all my securities has a power of attorney signs checks and all that That sounds bad said Whitney Barnes sympathetically The old saint could come pretty close to ruining you Now you ve hit it assented Gladwin So I ve come home to investigate sleuthing expedition you might say Didn t want him to hear I was coming and climb out Now you ve got the answer to the gumshoe riddle My plan is to lie low and have you look him up Nothing else on foot Whitney Haven t gone into mustard or Wall street have you It was Whitney Barnes s turn to construct a frown and take on an air of intense seriousness while his friend smiled at him thinking it was one of his humorous moods Can t say I have anything definite on foot said Barnes slowly but the pater has given me a rather important commission to fulfil though not exactly in mustard Well then said Travers Gladwin with a trace of annoyance I d better call on somebody else I Nothing of the sort broke in Whitney Barnes It may fit right in with my plans It ll keep me circulating round a lot and that s just what I want that and what Bateato is bringing as the little brown man entered the room on the run bearing a silver tray decanter and glasses CHAPTER IX THE CURSE OF MILLIONS As Travers Gladwin s valet filled the tall slim glasses with the fizzing amber colored fluid which constitutes the great American highball the two friends stretched their legs and lost themselves for a few moments in aimless reverie Bateato looked from one to the other puzzled by their seriousness He clinked the glasses to rouse them and glided from the room Whitney Barnes was the first to look up and shake himself free of the sober spell that gripped him What the deuce made you skip abroad in such a hurry Travers he asked reaching for his glass Travers Gladwin sat up with a start pulled a lugubrious smile and replied Bored to death nothing interested me living the most commonplace humdrum unromantic existence imaginable Teas and dances dances and teas clubs and theatres theatres and clubs motors and yachts yachts and motors It was horrible and I can t help thinking it was all my dear old governor s fault He had no consideration for me He left you a tidy lot of millions drawled Whitney Barnes Young Gladwin drained his glass jumped to his feet and began to pace the room hands deep in his trousers pockets That was just it he flung out If he d left me nothing but a shilling or two there d be some joy in living I d have had to buckle down There s variety interest pleasure in having to make your own way in the world Whitney Barnes laughed mockingly Go out and tell that to the toiling masses he chuckled and listen to them give you the ha ha You re in a bad way old chap better see a brain specialist I know I m in a bad way Gladwin ran on fiercely but doctors can t do me any good It was all right while I was a frolicking lamb but after I got over the age of thinking myself a devil of a fellow things began to grow tame I was romantic sentimental wanted to fall in love Now you interest me Whitney Barnes interjected stiffening to attention Yes I wanted to fall in love Whitney but I couldn t get it out of my head that every girl I met had her eye on my fortune and not on me And if it wasn t the girl it was her mother and mothers that is mothers in law to be or mothers that want to be in law or what the deuce do I mean I get you Steve they re awful Go on Well I gave it up the hunt for the right girl The dickens you say I wish you hadn t told me that And I went in for art Gladwin raced on carried breathlessly on the tide of his emotions and ignoring his friend s observations I went in for these things on the walls statuary ceramics rugs and tapestries You ve got a mighty fine collection struck in Barnes Yes but I soon got tired of art I still hungered for romance I went abroad to find it I said to myself If there s a real thrill anywhere on this earth for a poor millionaire I ll try and find it make a thorough search It wasn t any use Every country I went to was the same All I could find were things my money could buy and all those things have long ceased to interest me There was only once in all the years I ve been craving a romance Hold up there Travers Gladwin you re talking like Methusaleh You ve been of age only a few years Seems centuries but as I started to say there was only once Two years ago in a trolley car right here in the midst of this heartless city Seated opposite me was a girl a blonde most beautiful hair you ever saw No use my trying to describe her eyes clearest bluest and keep right on piling up the superlatives peaches and cream complexion with a transparent down on it dimples and all that sort of thing You know the kind a goddess every inch of her Her clothes were poor and I knew by that she was honest The young man paused and gazed rapturously into space Go on go on urged Barnes Poor but honest I caught her eye once and my heart thumped could feel it beating against my cigarette case That s the real soul mate stuff go on cried Barnes Well she got off at one of the big shops I followed She went in one of the employees entrances She worked there I could see that And did you wait for her to go out to lunch No I had an engagement Next day I caught that same car but she was not on it I kept on trying and the fourth day she was on the car looking lovelier than ever When she got off the car I got off I stepped up and raised my hat Forgive me for approaching you in this impertinent manner I said but I would like to introduce myself and I handed her my card The youthful head of the house of Gladwin stopped abruptly and slid listlessly into a chair I demand to hear what she replied insisted Barnes It wasn t just what she said mused Gladwin though that was bad enough but it was the way she said it These were her exact words Go on yer fresh slob an sneak yer biscuits How does that suit you for exploding a romance Blown to powder and bits murmured Whitney Barnes sombrely Sorry you told me this never mind why but there s one thing I ve been wanting to ask you for a long time How about that girl you rescued from drowning four years ago I remember it made you quite famous at the time According to all standards of romance you should have married her Travers Gladwin looked up with a wry smile Did you ever see the lady he asked sharply No Wasn t she pretty She was a brunette You don t fancy brunettes She was a dark brunette Dark Yes from Africa That was tough luck exclaimed Barnes without cracking a smile CHAPTER X THE HEARTBEATS OF mister HOGG In a magnificently furnished apartment on Madison avenue which missus Elvira Burton had rented for New York s winter season that augustly beautiful or beautifully august lady sat writing I may say that she was writing grimly and that there was Jovian determination stamped upon her high broad forehead and indented at the corners of her tense lips She had just returned from a consultation with two matrons of the same stern fibre as herself No group of gray bearded physicians had ever weighed the fate of a patient with more attention to pathological detail than had missus Burton and her two friends weighed the fate of Helen Burton but whereas it rarely happens that pork is prescribed in a delicate case the result of that petticoated conclave was that Hogg was prescribed for the flower like ward of the leader of Omaha s socially elect While missus Burton had done most of the talking her two friends who had broken into New York s next to the top layer of society by means of the hyphens with which they coupled the names of their first and second husbands her two friends I say had managed to wedge in a word or two all in favor of Jabez Hogg The guardian of the two prettiest girls who had ever debutanted in the Nebraska metropolis emerged from that conference on fire with resolve She would marry Helen to mister Hogg thus link together the Hogg and Burton millions and thereby create an alliance that would take its place beside any in the country in the matter of bank account So confident was she of the power of her will that she did not even remove her wraps before she sat down to answer Jabez Hogg s letter Nor did she bother to ask her maid if Helen and Sadie had returned from their ride She did not care to discuss the matter with them She had decided It remained only for weaker wills to yield Beginning with a regal flourish of the pen she wrote MY DEAR mister HOGG I received this morning your courteous note begging me to persuade Helen to give you a final answer It pains me deeply that you should suffer so from her neglect after all your kindness I trust that you will forgive it on the score of her youth She is very young and her head has been turned with too much flattery She shall be yours that I can promise you When you come on for your annual slaughter house directors meeting you may bring the ring I have already given the order for the engraving of the engagement announcements and I will arrange to give a reception and dance for Helen at the Plaza I do not know how to thank you for putting your French car at our disposal It has saved us a great deal of annoyance and bother Helen has spoken often of your thoughtfulness missus Burton stayed her flying pen and grimly read the last sentence aloud It was not the strict truth as she was writing it Helen had spoken frequently of the convenience of the car but she had added that she could never ride in it without feeling that she was going to run over a pig and hear it squeal missus Burton did not waver for more than an instant however In a way of speaking she gripped her conscience by the neck strangled it and threw it into the discard Then she continued with her letter I have been looking at houses on the avenue and would suggest that you try and negotiate for the Gladwin mansion The owner lives abroad and while it is not in the market I am advised that the young man would be glad to get rid of it He is said to be living a fast life in Paris and while he was left a great fortune he would probably be glad to get the ready money I know of no finer home in New York for you to settle down in after your honeymoon Thanking you again for your constant thoughtfulness and hoping that you will now banish every doubt from your mind I remain Faithfully yours ELVIRA BURTON The smile with which missus Burton sealed this letter and delivered it to her maid was more than a smile of triumph It was a positively fiendish smile of victory CHAPTER XI GAINSBOROUGH BLUE BOY Having discounted the romantic element of his thrilling rescue at Narragansett Pier Travers Gladwin fell into a moody silence The more volatile Barnes felt the influence and strove to fight it off While he too had been set upon the trail of romance at the behest of his father he felt it was too early to indulge in pessimistic reveries so he groped for another subject with which to revive the interest of his friend I say Travers he led off rising from his chair and indicating the walls with a sweep of his hand as I remarked before you ve got a wonderful collection here Yes assented the young millionaire without animation but as I said before I soon got tired of it The pastime of collecting pictures became a burden and I was glad to get abroad and forget it Well said Barnes I guess the only thing for you to do is to go to work at something I know it grumbled Gladwin but what s the incentive I don t want any more money what I have now is the biggest sort of a nuisance Just see the trouble I m in for with my lawyer and that man Watkins though to tell you the truth I am beginning to enjoy the novelty of that The young man got up and assumed a more lively expression Do you know Whitney he ran on this travelling incognito isn t half bad They are really getting suspicious of me at the Ritz But surely some one there ought to know you Not a soul It was opened while I was abroad You know I registered as Thomas Smith and I even took a chance and went down into the grill room for lunch And there Whitney cried Gladwin with an explosive burst of enthusiasm I nearly got a thrill another one like that on the trolley car The last place you d expect it too in the midst of stiff formality and waiters so cold and haughty they might have risen from the dead I suppose this was the ravishing girl at the cigar counter said Barnes ironically Nothing of the sort never smoked a cigar in her life I mean that is well something entirely different But she was a beauty Golden bronze hair Titian never painted anything like it the bluest eyes behind the most wonderful dark lashes creamy white skin And you followed her to a cloak factory where you found Please wait till I finish Whitney I followed her nowhere though she interested me tremendously I wish you could have seen her eat Eat Particularly the grapefruit By Jove Barnes that girl certainly loves grapefruit It was fascinating I couldn t keep my eyes off of her And did she notice you quizzed Barnes raising his eyebrows She was too busy came the gloomy rejoinder I watched her steadily fairly bored her with my eyes tried to will her to look at me They say you can do that you know mental telepathy projecting thought waves or something of the sort Oh rot cried Barnes impatiently I tried that on a dog once and I ve got the scar yet But I tell you Whitney it almost worked After a time her eyelids began to flutter and the roses in her cheeks bloomed darker But just as I felt sure she would look up and see me splash the grapefruit hit her in the eye What ejaculated Whitney Barnes wheeling open mouthed and facing his friend The juice I mean Gladwin laughed ruefully and of course the spell was broken She never looked again Dash it all there s some sort of a lemon in all my romances You certainly do play in tough luck sympathized Barnes I can see that you need bucking up and I think I ve got the right kind of remedy for you Wait I ll call Bateato Whitney Barnes stepped briskly across the room and pressed a button In a twinkling the little Jap appeared Bateato said Barnes has your master any hunting clothes at the hotel Ees sair responded the Jap Plenty hotel plenty house We no time pack all clothes go sail too quick Plenty here splendid enthused Barnes Pack a bag for him Bateato this instant enough things to last a couple of weeks What s all this cut in Gladwin What are you going to do Never you mind retorted Barnes importantly you do as I say Bateato I m going to show your master some excitement He ll never get it here in town Ees sair I pack him queeck and Bateato vanished noiselessly seemingly to shoot through the doorway and up the broad staircase as if sucked up a flue But see here objected Travers Gladwin Not a word now his friend choked him off If you don t like it you don t have to stay but I m going to take you in hand and show you a time you re not used to But I don t Don t let s argue about it said Barnes lightly You called me in here to take charge of things and I m taking charge Just to change the subject tell me something about your paintings This one for instance who is that haughty looking old chap Whitney Barnes had planted himself with legs spread wide apart in front of one of the largest portraits in the room a life size painting of an aristocratic looking old man who seemed on the point of strangling in his stock Travers Gladwin turned to the painting and said with an unmistakable note of pride The original Gladwin my great grandfather Painted more than a hundred years ago by Gilbert Stuart I guess you beat me Travers the original Barnes hadn t discovered mustard a hundred years ago But I say here s a Gainsborough The Blue Boy By George that s a stunner Worth a small fortune I suppose Whitney Barnes had crossed the room and stood before the most striking looking portrait in the collection a tall handsome boy in a vividly blue costume of the Gainsborough period The owner of The Blue Boy turned around cast a fleeting glimpse at the portrait and turned away with a peculiar grimace You suppose wrong Whitney he said shortly That isn t so horribly valuable What A big painting like that by a chap famous enough to have a hat named after him That was just about the way it struck me at first answered Gladwin so I begged two old gentlemen in London to let me have it Persuaded them to part with it for a mere five hundred pounds on condition close attention Whitney that I keep the matter a secret I was delighted with my bargain until I saw the original The original Ah ha the original It was quite a shock for me to come face to face with that and realize that my Blue Boy had a streak of yellow in him That sounds exciting cried Barnes What did you do Put the case in the hands of the police Not much denied Gladwin emphatically That would have given the public a fine laugh It deceived me so I hung it up there to deceive others It got you you see But you are the only one I ve let into the secret don t repeat it will you Never promised Barnes It ll be too much of a lark to hear others rave over it Thank you acknowledged the bitten collector curtly Barnes wandered from The Blue Boy and signalled out another painting Who painted this he asked That s a Veber but do you know Whitney the more I think of it there s something about that grapefruit girl something gripping that I like these two commented Barnes There s something different about her something Who is this by inquired Barnes lost in admiration of a Meissonier A blonde What And very young and I know her smile Look here Travers what are these two worth Gladwin volplaned to earth climbed out of his sky chariot and was back in the midst of his art treasures again I beg your pardon he said hastily Which two Barnes pointed to two of the smaller pictures Guess suggested his host Five thousand Multiply it by ten then add something No really Yes really That one on the left is a Rembrandt and the other is a Corot My word they re corkers eh Yes when you know who painted them and if you happen to have the eye of a connoisseur And what in creation is this exclaimed Barnes as he stumbled against the great ornamental chest which stood against the wall just beneath the Rembrandt and Corot Oh let s get the exhibition over said Gladwin peevishly That s a treasure chest Cost me a barrel picked it up in Egypt You never picked it up in your life retorted Barnes grasping the great metal bound chest and striving vainly to lift it Anything in it he asked lifting the lid and answering himself in the negative What s the whole collection worth asked Barnes as he returned to where his friend was standing gazing ruefully at The Blue Boy Oh half a million or more I really never kept track Half a million And you go abroad and leave all these things unguarded You certainly are fond of taking chances It s a marvel they haven t been stolen before now Nonsense said Gladwin I have a burglar alarm set here and I ll wager there aren t half a dozen persons who know the Gladwin collection is hung in this house Just the same but I say Travers there s the door bell Were you expecting anybody else Gladwin glanced about him nervously No he said sharply On the contrary I didn t wish what the deuce does it mean It means some one is at the door CHAPTER XII APPROACHING A WORLD OF MYSTERY Gaston Brielle the strawberry blonde French chauffeur who piloted the big luxurious motor car Jabez Hogg of Omaha had placed at the service of missus Elvira Burton and her two charming young nieces did not have his mind entirely concentrated upon manipulating the wheel and throttle of the car as he swung around Grant s Tomb and sped southward down the Drive While his knowledge of English was confined to a few expletives of a profane nature and the mystic jargon of the garage he was nevertheless thrilled by the belief that the two mademoiselles behind him were plotting some mysterious enterprise From time to time they had unconsciously dropped their voices to the low tones commonly used by conspirators or at least that was the way Gaston had sensed it Along the silent roads of Central Park and Riverside Drive where even the taxis seemed to employ their mufflers and to resort less frequently to the warning racket of their exhausts the Frenchman had been straining his ears to listen He had heard on two occasions what he divined as a manifest sob first when the emotional Sadie gave way to tears and again when Helen was aggravated to a petulant outburst of grief Later when he heard bright laughter and gay exclamations he could hardly believe his ears He was profoundly troubled and completely bewildered a dangerous state of mind for a man who has the power of seventy horses under the pressure of his thumb Nor was his mental turmoil in the least alleviated when having turned south and being on the point of coasting down a precipitous hill he felt a touch on his shoulder and heard the elder of his two pretty passengers command him in worse French than his own poor English to go slow when he turned into Fifth avenue again and be prepared to stop Gaston knew that this was in direct violation of his orders from missus Burton but when he saw a yellow backed bill flutter down over his shoulder his quick intelligence blazed with understanding His first groping suspicions had been justified There was romance in the wind Steering easily with one hand Gaston deftly seized the bill and caused it to vanish somewhere in his great fur coat Sadie Burton had been horror stricken at this bold proffer of a bribe Likewise she was alarmed that Helen should put so much trust in Gaston who seemed to be in mortal terror of her aunt and to quake all through his body when he listened to her commands As Helen sank back beside her after letting fall the bribe the agitated Sadie whispered tremulously Are you sure you can trust him Helen If he should tell Auntie El she would surely make you a prisoner You will never get a chance to leave her side at the opera to night Gaston is a Frenchman my dear laughed Helen confidently and most Frenchmen even chauffeurs I am sure would cut their hearts out before they would oppose a barrier to the course of true love But Helen s gayety did not communicate itself to Sadie That shy miss trembled apprehensively as she sought to picture herself in Helen s place on the verge of an elopement Not that such a prospect did not have its alluring thrill even to such a shrinking maiden as the violet eyed Sadie but her fear of her aunt seemed to crush and obliterate these titillating sensations As the car shot through Seventy second street and headed for the entrance to the West Drive of Central Park she ventured another word of caution Wouldn t it be better to send a messenger to mister Gladwin s house Helen Suppose we should run into somebody there who knew auntie You ridiculously little fraid cat Helen caught her up Of course there ll be nobody there but Travers or perhaps his man or some of the other servants He has good reason for keeping very quiet now and sees absolutely nobody not even not even not even his grandmother if he has one And didn t he tell you whether or not he had a grandmother Helen gasped Sadie But Helen disdained to reply her heart suddenly filling with rapture at the prospect of an immediate meeting with her betrothed CHAPTER VIII TRAVERS GLADWIN GETS A THRILL A ring at the door bell should suggest to the ordinary mind that some person or persons clamored for admission but Whitney Barnes s announcement seemed to have difficulty in hammering its way into Travers Gladwin s gray matter and thence downward into the white matter of his brain cells What is some one at the door for he asked vacuously To see you of course snapped Barnes Nonsense exclaimed the other with annoyance The house has been closed for ages and you are the only one who knows I am home Why I Bateato skimmed in grinning like a full moon Well what is it his master asked shortly Two ladies sair Two that s good chimed in Barnes They must have got a wireless that I was here What do they want Gladwin addressed Bateato You sair replied the Jap They say you come to door one minute Two ladies to see me Are you sure Travers Gladwin was both bewildered and embarrassed Ees sair Bateato assured him Did you tell them that I was here They no ask They say Please mister Gladwin come to door Well you tell them mister Gladwin is not at home that I m out away in Egypt Ees sair and Bateato was about to skim out into the hallway again when Barnes stopped him Wait a minute Bateato what do they look like Look nice sair and Bateato s moon like grin returned in full beam You re sure asked Barnes gravely Oh fine uttered the Jap enthusiastically Young inquired Barnes Ees sair much young come in autbile I tell them you no home turning to Gladwin No wait responded Gladwin his curiosity taking fire You tell them to come in They say you come door Very well but Whitney Barnes stopped him Better see them in here Travers If they really want to see you they ll come in Ask them to come in Bateato The little Jap was gone with the speed and noiselessness of a mouse Who in heaven s name can it be whispered Travers Gladwin as Bateato could be heard lisping in the vestibule Before Whitney Barnes managed to frame a reply a swift muffled step was audible and Helen Burton stood framed in the narrow space between the portieres Her timid cousin stopped behind her staring timidly over her shoulder She was manifestly surprised and startled as she paused and regarded the two young men In point of startled surprise however Travers Gladwin s emotion matched hers He stared at her almost rudely in his amazement and involuntarily he turned to Whitney Barnes and said under his breath The grapefruit girl Whitney Barnes s lips merely framed No You don t mean it He was going to add something more when the two girls came on into the room diffidently and stood by the great carved table close together as if prepared to cling to one another in case something extraordinary happened Travers Gladwin was the first of the two young men to come to their rescue Pardon me Did you wish to see me he said with his best bow No replied Helen Burton quickly her lips trembling we want to see mister Gladwin please The young man did not recover instantly from this staggering jolt and a clock somewhere in the great hall nearby ticked a dozen strokes before he managed to mumble Well er I am Isn t he here broke in the brown haired beauty breathlessly His man just asked us to come into this room to see him What mister Gladwin did you want asked that young man incoherently Why mister Travers Gladwin exclaimed the girl indignantly the color mantling to her forehead Is there more than one Well er that is the young man turned desperately to his friend do you know mister Gladwin Do I know him cried Helen Burton and then with a hysterical little laugh as she turned to her cousin I should think I did know him I know him very very well Sadie Burton appeared both distressed and frightened and slipped limply down into one of the great chairs beside her As Travers Gladwin s features passed through a series of vacant and bewildered expressions and as the attention of Whitney Barnes seemed to be focussed with strange intensity upon the prettiness of the shy and silent Sadie anger flashed in Helen s expressive eyes as she again addressed the young man who felt as if some mysterious force had just robbed him of his identity You don t suppose she said drawing herself to the full height of her graceful figure that I would come here to see Travers Gladwin if I didn t know him do you No no no of course not sputtered the young man It was stupid of me to ask such a question Please forgive me I er Helen turned from him as if to speak to Sadie who sat with erect primness suffering from what she sensed as a strange and overpowering stroke She had permitted herself to look straight into the eyes of Whitney Barnes and hold the look for a long palpitating second While Sadie was groping in her mind for some explanation of the strange thrill Whitney Barnes had flung himself headlong into a new sensation and was determined to make the most of it so when Travers Gladwin turned to him and asked I rather think Gladwin s gone out don t you Barnes nodded and answered positively He was here only a few minutes ago This reply drew Helen s attention immediately to Barnes and taking a step forward she said eagerly Oh I hope he s here You see it s awfully important what I want to see him about Whitney Barnes nodded with extraordinary animation and turning to Gladwin impaled that young man with the query Why don t you find out if he s in While Gladwin had come up for air he was still partially drowned Turning to Helen Burton he forced an agreeable smile and said hurriedly Yes if you ll excuse me a moment I ll see but may I give him your name It was Helen s turn to recoil and stepping to where Sadie had at last got upon her feet she whispered Shall I tell him They both act so strangely Oh no Helen dear fluttered Sadie It may be some awful trap or something While this whispered conclave was going on Travers Gladwin made a frantic signal to Whitney Barnes behind his back and mumbled Try and find out what it s all about I will leave that to me said Barnes confidently Leaving her cousin s side Helen again confronted the two young men and said tremulously I d rather not give my name I know that sounds odd but for certain reasons Oh of course if you d rather not answered Gladwin If you will just say Helen ran on breathlessly that I had to come early to tell him something something about to night he ll understand and know who I am Certainly certainly said the baffled young millionaire Say that you want to see him about something that s going to happen to night Yes if you ll be so kind and Helen gave the young man a smile that furnished him the thrill he had hunted for all over the globe with a margin to boot I ll be right back he gasped spun on his heel and passed dizzily out into the hallway CHAPTER XIV THRILL BEGETS THRILL Gladwin s exit from the room served as a signal for the agile witted Barnes to strike while the iron was hot His friend had hardly vanished through the portieres when he turned to Helen with an air of easy confidence looking frankly into her eyes and said It s singular that my friend doesn t know what you referred to the object of your call and he nodded his head with a knowing smile Why do you asked Helen eagerly coming toward him Whitney s knowing smile increased in its quality of knowingness and he spoke with an inflection that was quite baffling Well he said in a confiding whisper I have an idea but he jerking his thumb over his shoulder where Travers Gladwin was last seen departing from view is Travers Gladwin s most intimate friend The astonishing character of this information served only further to confuse the beautiful Miss Burton s already obfuscated reasoning faculties and hypnotize her into that receptive condition where she was capable of believing any solemnly expressed statement Really she said with a little start of surprise Oh yes ran on the glib Barnes they are lifelong chums love each other like brothers one of those Castor and Pollox affairs you know only more so Never have any secrets from each other and all that sort of thing Helen dropped back into her chair and her brow wrinkled with perplexity That s curious she said I don t think Travers ever spoke to me about that kind of a friend The idea was just burgeoning in her mind to ask for the friend s name when Barnes hastened on Well now that is singular Are you sure that The sudden brisk return of Travers Gladwin saved Barnes from an immediate excruciating tax upon his ingenuity I m awfully sorry said Gladwin going to Helen and shaking his head regretfully but I couldn t find him Oh dear That s very provoking cried Helen He didn t say he was going out did he No I could have sworn he was here a few minutes ago spoke up Barnes turning his head away for fear his smile would suddenly get out of control Well is his man here demanded the girl Why he let you in blurted Gladwin I don t mean the Japanese You mean the butler perhaps Gladwin corrected Yes Helen answered mechanically Travers Gladwin felt it was time for Barnes to take a hand again as his mental airship was bucking badly in the invisible air currents Is Gladwin s butler here he inquired sharply frowning at Barnes No said Barnes promptly I am sorry but he is not here Gladwin communicated to Helen Well where is he cried the exasperated Helen Where is he Gladwin asked Barnes Whitney Barnes went down for the count of one but bobbed up serenely Where is he he said with a nonchalant gesture Oh he s giving a lecture on butling The bewildered Miss Burton did not catch the text of this explanation In her increasing agitation she wrung her hands in her muff and almost sobbed I m sure I don t know what to do I simply must get word to him somehow It s awfully important Whitney Barnes saw the trembling lip and the dampening eye and strove to avert a catastrophe that would probably double the difficulty of probing into the mystery Turning to Gladwin but half directing his remarks to Helen he said I ve just been telling the ladies that you and Travers are bosom pals Travers Gladwin flashed one look of amazement and then caught on Oh yes he cried we are very close to each other I couldn t begin to tell you how close And I have also hinted pursued Barnes that you never have any secrets from each other and that I felt sure that you knew all about all about a a er to night Oh of course assented Gladwin beginning to warm up to his part and feel the rich thrill of the mystery involved Yes yes of course he s told me all about to night Has he gasped Helen looking into the young man s brown eyes for confirmation feeling that she liked the eyes but uncertain that she read the confirmation Yes everything lied Gladwin now glowing with enthusiasm All this while the shy and silent Sadie had remained demurely in her chair looking from one to the other and vainly endeavoring to catch the drift of the conversation Sadie was too dainty a little soul to be possessed of real reasoning faculties The one thought that had been uppermost in her mind all day was that Helen was taking a desperate step probably embarking upon some terrible tragedy She had hungered for an opportunity to compare notes with some sturdier will than her own and the instant she heard Travers Gladwin admit that he knew all about to night she rose from her chair and asked breathlessly turning up her big appealing eyes to Travers Gladwin Then won t you oh please won t you tell her what you think of it There was something so naive and innocent in Sadie s attitude and expression that Whitney Barnes was charmed It also tickled his soul to see how thoroughly his friend was stumped So to add to Travers s confusion he chimed in Oh yes go on and tell her what you think of it I d rather not said Gladwin ponderously trying to escape from the appealing eyes But really you ought to old chap reproved Barnes It s your duty to Oh yes please do implored Sadie The victim was caught three ways Both young ladies regarded him earnestly and with looks that hung upon his words while Barnes stood to one side with a solemn long face elbow in one hand and chin gripped tightly in the other manifestly for the moment withdrawn from rescue duty There was nothing for the badgered young man to do but mentally roll up his sleeves and plunge in Well then with exaggerated sobriety if you must know I think that is when I was thinking of it or I mean what I had thought of it when I was thinking of it turning it over in my mind you know why it didn t seem to me I am afraid turning squarely on Helen what I am going to say will offend you On the contrary cried Helen flushing to her tiny pink ears if you are Travers s best friend I should like to know just what you think of it Well then said Travers Gladwin desperately if you must know the truth I don t like it There breathed Sadie overjoyed and dropped back in her chair But Helen Burton was far from pleased You don t like what she demanded Why this thing to night he groped You wouldn t say that if you knew mister Hogg the indignant girl flung out There Gladwin that s a clincher you don t know Hogg Whitney Barnes was up to his ears in clover How do you know I don t know him asked Gladwin a little wildly Why how could you said Helen accusingly How could I know mister Hogg Yes Why just go out to his pen introduce yourself and shake his tail Helen failed to see the humor of this sally and again the tears struggled for an outlet Now you re making fun of me she said turning away I think it s very unkind Travers Gladwin felt a sharp pang of remorse and hated himself for his break In his eagerness to repair the wound he stepped to the young girl s side and said with great seriousness I wouldn t hurt you in any way for the world Helen looked up at him and read the soul of sincerity and sympathy in his eyes She was both reassured and embarrassed by the intensity of his look Really she managed to murmur backing away and sitting down again The mention of mister Hogg had inflamed Whitney Barnes s curiosity and he desired to know more of that unknown Well I don t see what mister Hogg has to do with it he spoke up Why Auntie insists upon my marrying him Helen blurted this out involuntarily That s dreadful exclaimed Whitney Barnes and Helen rewarded him with a smile of gratitude CHAPTER XV HEROISM LOVE AND SOMETHING ELSE The embarrassment of both the girls had begun to wear off The two strange young men notwithstanding the unaccounted for absence of the object of Helen s quest began to appear less strange Both possessed potent attractions and undeniable magnetism The shy and shrinking Sadie was sure she liked that tall and slender young man with the easy drawl and bright humorous eyes immensely The boldness of his glances made her heart beat pleasantly To her he seemed to possess the master will and wit of the pair and she felt she could repose perfect confidence in him For her part Helen was uncertain just how to sense the situation One side of her will urged her to leave a message for her betrothed and hurry away Another strain of consciousness held her fast Travers Gladwin s psychic waves that had so utterly failed in the grill room of the Ritz may or may not have had something to do with this He felt inspired with a desire to prolong the interview indefinitely He could not recall ever having been so attracted by the charming personality of any girl as he was by this distressed maiden who was so eager to see her Travers Gladwin He was flattered even by the compliment of having the same name as the unknown As a further expression of sympathy with Helen in the matter of mister Hogg he said earnestly Do you mean to tell me that your aunt insists upon you marrying this hog Yes replied Helen passionately And he s awful and I hate him and I won t I just won t I think you re absolutely right Gladwin agreed with her Oh you do cried the delighted Helen Then turning triumphantly upon her cousin she exclaimed There But Sadie s one idea did not include mister Hogg She considered the elopement as a separate matter in which mister Hogg was in no way involved wherefore she said But you ve only known mister Gladwin two weeks I know retorted Helen but I ve loved him for four years You ve loved Travers Gladwin four years said that young man in a voice hollow with wonder And only known him two weeks cut in Whitney Barnes By Jove he must be one of those retroactive soul mates I ve loved him four years said Helen stiffly You ve loved him four years in two weeks said Barnes in the tone of one trying to do a sum I give up I can t do it Helen faced the heretic Barnes and announced impressively Ever since the time he so bravely risked his own life to save that girl It was splendid noble Travers Gladwin decided it was time to call a halt on the borrowing proclivities of the unknown double It was bad enough for some one to appropriate his name but also to take unto his bogus self the glory of the real one s heroism was too much You mean that time at Narragansett he opened Yes said Helen Four years ago when he dashed into the roaring surf Yes and fished out a cross eyed colored lady said Gladwin hotly That s just it returned Helen with flashing eyes and heaving bosom If she had been beautiful or some one dear to him it wouldn t have been half so noble Oh it was fine of him And he told you about that asked Gladwin numbed for the moment No he didn t He s much too modest I knew of it the day it happened and he has been my ideal ever since But would you believe it when I first spoke to him about it he could hardly remember it Imagine doing such a brave thing and then forgetting all about it Oh I ve forgotten lots of such things said the unrecognized hero Helen s lips curled with scorn Yes the young man was stung to go on and what Travers Gladwin did wasn t brave at all What Helen gasped She was so fat she couldn t sink derided Gladwin so I swam out to her Yes bubbled over the young man overjoyed at the opportunity of discounting his own heroism I swam out to her I told her to lie on her back and float Well she did and I You Why yes er you see I was with him He pushed her to shore Simplest thing in the world Helen rose angrily There was both indignation and reproach in her voice It s shameful to try and belittle his courage and you say you re his dearest friend She paused for a moment then went closer to the young man and said in a different tone Oh I understand you now you re saying that to try and make me change my mind But I shan t not for anybody Helen crossed the room to her cousin and gave Sadie the benefit of the look of defiance with which she had confronted Travers Gladwin Oh please please don t say that Helen cried Sadie all a flutter I know he will agree to a postponement But I don t want any postponement protested Helen I told you what I intended doing and I m going to do it Go on tell her again we d all like to hear it broke in Gladwin Helen swung around and said dramatically I m going to marry Travers Gladwin to night Travers Gladwin reeled a little where he stood met and turned from the beaming stare of Whitney Barnes As he did so Helen came very close to him laid her hand on his arm and said tremulously You are his best friend Tell me honestly don t you think I m right in wanting to marry him This was a poser but when he did summon an answer it came right out from the heart his eyes devouring the beautiful girl before him as he spoke Nothing on earth would please me so much as to have you marry Travers Gladwin and I promise you now that I am going to do everything in my power to persuade you to do it Oh I am so glad Helen thanked him A moment later she added with a perplexed smile But why did you talk about his bravery as you did Well you see the young man stopped I suppose Helen suggested brightly being so very fond of him you hated the idea of his marrying Was that it Yes but that was before I saw you I hope you are going to like his best friend just a little There was no mistaking the ardent emphasis on the last sentence and Helen studied the young man s face curiously She turned away with a blush and walked across the room CHAPTER XVI THE TORMENT OF OFFICER six hundred sixty six Meantime Officer six hundred sixty six on his aristocratic beat four blocks up and four blocks down the Fifth avenue pave was sticking to the east side of the street and vainly trying to keep his eyes to the front It was excruciating duty with the raven haired Rose wheeling her perambulator along the opposite way and keeping by way of feminine perversity on a latitudinal line with the patrolling of Michael Phelan There she was just opposite always never twisting her head an inch to give him so much as a glance or a smile It made him wild that she should discipline her eyes in that fashion while his would wander hither and yon especially yon when Rose was in that direction The daintiness of Rose in cap and apron with a big white fichu at her throat with one red cheek and the corner of the most kissable mouth on the avenue maddeningly visible soon drove all memory of the Gladwin mansion and the suspicious antics of the rat faced little heathen out of his mind His one thought was that Rose would have to cross over the way at the fall of dusk and trundle her millionaire infant charge home for its prophylactic pap There would be a bare chance for about seven or ten words with Rose But what was he going to say For one hundred and nine days running his days off inclusive Michael Phelan had intercepted Rose at that particular corner and begged her to name the day The best he ever got was a smile and a flash of two laughing eyes followed by the sally Show me five hundred dollars in the bank Michael Phelan and I ll talk business And why didn t Michael Phelan save up five hundred dollars out of the more than one hundred dollars a month the city paid him for his services Rose didn t get a quarter of that and she had already saved three hundred dollars besides which she sent a one pound note home to Ireland every month The reason was this Michael Phelan turned in his wages each month to his mother and out of what she allowed him to spend he couldn t have saved five hundred dollars in five hundred years at least not to his way of thinking The trouble was that Rose had more than an inkling of this and it galled her to think that her gallant brass buttoned cop should permit himself to be still harnessed to his mother s apron strings Yes down in the invisible depths of Rose s heart she was very fond of the faithful and long suffering Michael but even so she couldn t bring herself to marry a milksop who was likely to make her play second fiddle to his mother And when Rose once made up her mind she was as grimly determined as she was pretty The sun had swung down behind the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the trees that bordered the Park wall had begun to trace their shadows on the marble fronts of the mansions across the way when Rose suddenly wheeled the gig containing Master Croesus and walked demurely toward Officer six hundred sixty six Michael Phelan blushed till he could feel his back hair singeing but he stopped stock still and waited Rose gave no sign until she was within half a dozen feet of him Then she looked up pertly and exclaimed Why if it ain t Michael Phelan It is Rose an with the same question pantin on his lips broke out the young man his bosom surging and his heart rapping under his shield And what is that same question mister Phelan asked the tantalizing Rose Officer six hundred sixty six choked with emotion Will ye name the day d d d ar He stopped and looked round about him fearfully for Sergeant McGinnis was due on his rounds and Sergeant McGinnis though married had an eye like a hawk for a pretty girl and a tongue like an adder for a patrolman caught sparking Rose s eyes flashed and her lips drew taut She started forward but turned her head to face Phelan as she walked away I ll give you an answer Michael she said in parting when ye may set up your own home for your own That was all Phelan heard and possibly all that the young woman uttered for just then Master Croesus set up a bawl that was most common and vulgar in its utter lack of restraint There could be no more to the interview that day with young Master Croesus in such vociferous mood so Officer six hundred sixty six turned away with a heaving sigh and plodded dolefully along on his beat CHAPTER XVII TRAVERS GLADWIN IS CONSIDERABLY JARRED Taking time out to sense the bruised condition of your heart isn t a whole lot different from taking time out to recover from a jolt received in the prize ring Having released that impassioned sentence I hope you are going to like his best friend just a little young mister Gladwin felt a trifle groggy Until he had spoken he hadn t realized just how badly his cardiac equipment was being shot to pieces by the naked god s ruthless archery The fact that the case should have appeared hopeless only fanned the flame of his ardor He had looked into the depths of two vividly blue eyes and there read his destiny So he told himself fiercely whereupon in the Rooseveltian phrase he cast his hat into the ring He cared no more for obstacles than a runaway horse His very boredom of the past few years had stored up vast reserves of energy within him waiting only for that psychological thrill to light the fuse As Helen Burton turned from him with the uncomfortable feeling of one who has received a vague danger signal he paused only a moment before he again strode to her side He was about to speak when she took the lead from him and looking up at one of the masterpieces on the wall said Oh this is his wonderful collection of paintings He told me all about them It was what the gentlemen pugilists would call a cross counter impinging upon the supersensitive maxillary muscles It certainly jarred the owner of that wonderful collection and caused him to turn with an expression of astonishment to Whitney Barnes But that young man was intensely occupied in a vain endeavor to draw more than a monosyllable from the shrinking Sadie Burton He missed the look and went doggedly ahead with his own task Helen Burton repeated her remark that he had told her all about his paintings Oh has he responded Gladwin dully Yes and they are worth a fortune cried the girl He simply adores pictures Yes doesn t he though assented the young man in the same vacuous tones And we are going to take the most valuable away with us to night Here was information to jar Jove on high Olympus Travers Gladwin came stark awake with a new and vital interest There was glowing life in his voice as he said So you are going to take the pictures with you on your honeymoon Yes indeed we are Won t that be nice was the best Gladwin could do for he was trying to think along a dozen different lines at the same time We will be gone for ever so long you know volunteered Helen Are you going to take his collection of miniatures the young man asked in unconscious admiration of the colossal nerve of the gentleman who had so nonchalantly appropriated his name Miniatures asked Helen wonderingly Yes of course ran on Gladwin and the china and the family plate nearly two hundred years old Why I don t think he ever mentioned the miniatures or or That is singular broke in Gladwin striving to conceal the sarcasm that crept into his voice Strange he overlooked the china plate and miniatures I don t understand it do you and he turned to Barnes who had caught the last of the dialogue and shifted his immediate mental interest from the shy Sadie No I really don t old man said Barnes Do let me show you the miniatures Gladwin addressed Helen upon a sudden inspiration That will be splendid cried Helen I adore miniatures They are just in the next room said Gladwin leading the way to a door to the left of the great onyx fireplace As she followed Helen called to her cousin Come along Sadie this will be a treat But the next moment she was alone with Travers Gladwin in the long narrow room two windows of which protected by steel lattice work on the inside looked out on a side street The girl did not notice that as the young man preceded her he reached his hand under the screening portiere and touched a spring that noiselessly swung open the heavy mahogany door and switched on half a dozen clusters of lights Neither did she notice that Sadie had failed to follow her as her eyes fairly popped with wonder at the treasures presented to her gaze On one side of the room there was a long row of tables and cabinets and almost at every step there was an antique chest On the tables there were huddled in artistic disorder scores upon scores of gold and silver vessels and utensils of every conceivable design and workmanship Each cabinet contained a collection of exquisite china or rare ceramics On the walls above was the most notable collection of miniatures in America Travers Gladwin waited for the young girl to have finished her first outburst of admiration Then he said softly I suppose you know that five generations of Gladwins have been collecting these few trinkets He never even mentioned them gasped the girl Why the paintings are nothing to these I wouldn t say that chuckled Gladwin It would take a deal of this gold and silver junk to buy a Rembrandt or a Corot There are a couple of Cellini medallions though just below that miniature of Madame de Pompadour that a good many collectors would sell their souls to possess Perhaps he was preserving all this as a surprise for me whispered the awed Miss Burton It is just like him I am afraid he will be awfully disappointed now that you have shown them to me Or mayhap he has forgotten all about them said Gladwin in a tone that caused his companion to start and color with quick anger You know that is not true she said warmly You know that Travers Gladwin is just mad about art How can you say such a thing and in such a sarcastic tone of voice Well the young man defended himself inwardly chuckling you know how his memory lapsed in regard to that heroic affair at Narragansett Helen Burton turned and faced him with flashing eyes That was entirely different It simply showed that he was not a braggart that he was different from other men The words were meant to lash and sting but the passion with which they were said served so to vivify the loveliness of the young girl that Travers Gladwin could only gaze at her in speechless admiration When her glance fell before the homage of his regard he took hold of himself and apologized on the ground that he had been joking Then he made the rounds of the treasure room pointing out and giving the history of each precious family heirloom or art object with an encyclopedic knowledge that should have caused his companion to wonder how he knew so much Several times he slipped in the pronoun I hoping that this might have some effect in waking Helen from the obsession that any other than he could be the real Travers Gladwin But alas for his subtle efforts the hints and innuendoes fell on deaf ears She accepted his fund of information as a second hand version exclaiming once What a splendid memory you have Then he gave it up as a hopeless case and led the way back into the other room CHAPTER XVIII SADIE BECOMES A CONSPIRATOR Ah Be careful Don t go out there was the warning that had stopped Sadie Burton in full flight for the treasure room into which her cousin and Travers Gladwin had vanished She was more than half way to the door in obedience to Helen s command when Whitney Barnes spoke He was sitting on the arm of one of the great upholstered chairs in a gracefully negligent attitude twirling his gold key chain about his finger He spoke softly but with a mysterious emphasis that took hold and held the retreating miss fast in her tracks She turned with a frightened Why Because I would be all alone he said solemnly Then as Sadie took another hurried step forward Oh no you wouldn t desert me you wouldn t be so cruel How would you like to have some one desert you This mystic remark caused Sadie to turn around and take a step toward him She said timidly I don t understand Then I ll tell you he said getting on his feet and going toward her No no objected Sadie and began to back away The young man stopped and said in his most reassuring tones Fear not I am quite harmless I assure you Now I can see that you are in trouble is that not so Oh yes Sadie admitted delighted at this new turn in his attitude Her first disturbing suspicion had been that he wanted to flirt You see I m right he pursued I would like to help you Would you she breathed with increasing confidence Of course I would he said earnestly whereat Sadie lost all fear Then we must hurry if we are to stop it she said in a dramatic whisper Stop it stop what The heir of Old Grim Barnes had launched the belief that he was about to start something There wasn t any stop in the vocabulary of his thoughts at that minute Why the elopement ejaculated Sadie exploding a little bomb that brought Whitney Barnes down out of the clouds Yes of course to be sure the elopement I d forgotten he raced on Let me look at you No you must not turn away I must look at you that s the only way I can help you If he had to take a hand in the business of preventing an elopement he was going to combine that business with pleasure You are sure you want me to help you he asked Yes so awfully much she cried Then I must look at you look at you very closely he said with the utmost seriousness I don t understand murmured Sadie both pleased and frightened by his intense scrutiny I ll show you said Barnes Stand very still with your arms at your side there my but she s a picture I ve found out the first thing I read it in your eyes What in a stifled whisper You don t approve of this elopement Oh no Sadie had yielded her eyes as if hypnotized There I told you so exulted Barnes You want to stop the elopement but you don t know how to do it Yes that s perfectly true confessed the spellbound Sadie Shall I tell you how to stop it Yes please do Then sit down He motioned to a chair three feet from where he stood The victim of this his first excursion into the fields of mesmerism tripped with bird like steps to the chair and sat down Barnes went easily toward her and sat down on the arm He was as solemn about it as if his every move were part of a ritual Now please take off your glove the left one he commanded softly Sadie obeyed mechanically Barnes went on Before deciding upon what you should do I d like to know definitely about you if you don t mind What do you want me to tell you asked Sadie with a brave effort to keep her voice from running off into little tremors Nothing replied the seer faced Barnes What I want to discover you may not even know yourself Allow me to look at your hand please Sadie yielded her hand with shy reluctance allowing the young man to hold only the tips of her fingers Whitney Barnes bent his frowning eyes over the fluttering little hand studied the palm for a long second then exclaimed suddenly By Jove This is extraordinary Sadie started but her curiosity was greater than her fear What she asked excitedly Really wonderful Barnes kept it up What Sadie repeated in the same little gasp See that line He had taken possession of the whole hand now and pointed with a long ominous forefinger to the centre of the palm Which line inquired Sadie eagerly getting her head very close to his as she pried into the plump practically lineless palm That one said Barnes impressively No Don t you see that it starts almost at your wrist Now I see Yes What of it Why it runs way round the bump or that is the bump of Venus What does that mean asked Sadie innocently Oh a lot You are very affectionate and extremely shy Wonderful exclaimed Sadie amazed at the young man s stupendous skill Now here s a cunning little line he pursued That shows something too Does it show how to stop the elopement asked Sadie ingenuously but making no effort to withdraw her hand Yes and it shows that you and your friend are He paused to allow Sadie to fill the gap and she did Cousins and we live with Auntie and we ve been in New York a month And your cousin hasn t known Gladwin long Only two weeks Sadie was really awed That s right two weeks and she met him at the He said to himself that here was a little game that beat any other known sport to flinders Illustration NOW HERE S A CUNNING LITTLE LINE HE PURSUED THAT SHOWS SOMETHING TOO At a sale of old pictures and art objects said Sadie supremely confident that he was reading her mind A sale of pictures of course Barnes led her on Yes she was bidding on a picture and he whispered to her that it was a copy a fraud and not to buy it That was the way they got acquainted But he wouldn t let her tell auntie anything about him Just a moment cried Barnes Here s a bit of good luck I d almost overlooked that line Sadie was on fire with curiosity and looked eagerly into his eyes You meet a dark man and he prevents the elopement Perhaps that s you exclaimed the delighted girl withdrawing her hand and jumping to her feet I m sure it is said Barnes nodding his head Oh I m so glad But wait said Barnes going very close to her Please pay attention to every word I say Do all you can to get your cousin to change her mind then if she won t tell your aunt But don t tell her until the last minute and but here s your cousin CHAPTER XIX HELEN LEAVES AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE Helen Burton and Travers Gladwin were almost at the door leading from the treasure room when the young man stopped and confronted the girl whose eyes were still bright with the anger he had kindled in them He smiled rather sheepishly as he said Suppose I were to tell you that I am Travers Gladwin and that the other Travers Gladwin with whom you think you are in love is not Travers Gladwin at all Her lip curled and she regarded him scornfully But she said nothing He went on into the other room holding back the portiere for her to follow Why don t you answer my question he insisted as she passed him It is much too silly she said sharply Then in a different tone to her cousin who still stood by Whitney Barnes with her color coming and going by turns Oh Sadie why didn t you come with us Travers has the most wonderful things Then you are not going to answer my question Travers Gladwin asked again I said it was much too silly the girl returned with increasing vehemence Gladwin came forward and explained to Barnes and Sadie I have been asking Miss er I ve been asking how she d take to the idea of my being Travers Gladwin Helen was now thoroughly aroused as she turned Why do you persist in asking such a question I was wondering he said quickly whether you were in love with the man or the name Have I given you the impression she began haughtily scarcely able to control her anger Yes you have he said warmly and with all the dramatic emphasis he could command I am afraid you were thinking more of that rescue at Narragansett and your desire to be free of poor mister Hogg than you were of of my poor friend This insult was more than she could endure She turned her back to address Whitney Barnes Shall you be here when Travers returns she said imperiously I am sure to see him before I leave responded the young man And would you be kind enough to give him a message for me She had gathered up her fur piece and muff and was moving toward the door Delighted said Barnes with a deferential bow Thank you so much I want you to tell him that I cannot avoid the opera to night that I have simply got to go but that I ll get away as soon as I can and come to him directly from there But you can t do that interposed Sadie in a voice that thrilled with alarm But I am going to do that cried Helen her face aflame and her head held high And now we must go I d no idea we d stayed so long Good by and thank you She had taken a step toward the entrance to the hallway when Gladwin strode forward You didn t say good by to me he said in an injured tone Then with a sudden vehemence But I am glad you didn t for we are going to meet again I suppose we shall if you are here when I return she said coldly and without looking at him When you return he said in quick surprise Yes when I come back here to night in the same disdainful snubbing tones You re going to meet Travers here to night he queried in palpable unbelief Yes I am He wanted me to meet him at the station but I insisted on coming here And what time was it Travers wanted you to meet him here I d almost forgotten At half past ten answered Helen taken off her guard and submitting unconsciously to his cross examination Oh yes at half past ten he repeated That s right But you pointedly addressing Barnes must tell him I may be late I will acquiesced Barnes a trifle bewildered I hope you will be very late cut in Gladwin What do you mean she caught him up I mean you have no idea what a mad thing you are going to do Please she began icily Don t be angry he pleaded I m saying this for your good I don t care to hear it But you ve got to hear it he cried To leave your aunt and run off with a man you hardly know why you must be mad even to think of it How dare you speak to me in this way If ever a young lady s fur was up as the saying is such was the case with the enraged Helen Burton If her eyes had been weapons to slay Travers Gladwin would have been annihilated at a glance But he stuck doggedly to his guns Well somebody ought to speak to you he ran on Can t you understand that this man is no good that he must be a scoundrel to ask you to do such a thing that Stop I forbid you to say any more to say such horrible cowardly things about him behind his back You who claimed to be his dearest friend Her anger was suddenly checked by a thought that flashed in her mind Only a few minutes ago you said you were glad I was going to marry mister Gladwin and that you would do everything in your power to help And I jolly well meant it he acquiesced with a low bow You meant it Then how could you oh and she started suddenly from him why didn t I see it before You ve been drinking Come Sadie Barnes turned away with an uncontrollable snicker Gladwin was stunned As he saw her leaving him he made a last desperate effort But just a moment Please allow me to explain I said I wanted you to marry Travers Gladwin because I am I don t care why you said it she flung at him because I don t think you know what you are saying She fairly sailed through the portieres leaving the young man staring after her in a state of utter mental collapse The little cousin had listened to this impassioned dialogue in the attitude of a frightened bird standing first on one foot and then on the other struggling with all her small nervous force to hold back the tears As Helen disappeared a sob escaped her and she ran forward Barnes started after her Oh Miss Sadie just one word Oh don t please don t she wailed over her shoulder But won t you let me call on you just once he pleaded in real distress Sadie stopped gave him one frightened glance smiled through her tears and burst out I shall be delighted Then she was gone and a moment later the door slammed CHAPTER XX MICHAEL PHELAN TO THE RESCUE The slamming of the front door of the Gladwin mansion struck upon the two young men as a numbing shock They stood looking at each other with eyes that saw not and with expressions of idiotic vacancy Within the span of a brief half hour they had been swept along on a rushing tide of emotions They had been thrilled and mystified mystified and thrilled Nor was there any relief in the reaction There was more mystery and more thrill ahead that demanded immediate action Naturally the bulk of the thrill was heaped upon Travers Gladwin He was not only fiercely convinced that he had fallen desperately in love but the unknown beauty who had kindled this passion had revealed that she was coming that night to his home to meet and elope with a villain and an impostor Here was a situation to scatter the wits of a Napoleon It was no wonder that for a few moments his thoughts flattened themselves against an impassable barrier Whitney Barnes was the first to revive and speak Now what do you think of that he drew out with a long breath I haven t begun to think yet Gladwin managed to stammer I m in no condition to think I m stunned And you ve travelled all over the universe in search of a thrill eh Now you ve got one you don t know what to do with it While Gladwin was groping for a reply to this thrust Bateato breezed in with a swift sidelong rush carrying a bulging portmanteau Bag all packed sair announced the little Jap standing at attention Take it back I m not going now said Gladwin gruffly Bateato s entrance had nipped another idea in the bud You no go said the Jap in surprise No go take back unpack Ees sair scuse me and Bateato started off with his usual noiseless rush Hold on Gladwin checked him Wait a minute Don t unpack it Leave it in the hall I may want it at a minute s notice Ees sair and the wondering valet steamed out into the hallway and vanished What are you going to do now asked Barnes lighting a cigarette and offering one to his friend Gladwin took a turn about the room puffing nervously at the cigarette Coming to a sudden stop he faced Barnes and reeled off in a quick volley I m going to marry that girl I ve been all over the world seen all kinds of em and right here in my own house I find the one the only one on the verge of eloping with a bogus me But I m going to expose that man whoever he is I m going to rescue her from him For yourself Yes for myself and I m going to put him where he can never annoy her any more How the deuce are you going to do all this asked Barnes planking himself down into a chair I don t know said the other but I m going to move the whole Western Hemisphere to do it if necessary Rather a large contract drawled Barnes But I say Travers if that fellow is going to steal your pictures it sort of sizes up as a case for the police Of course agreed Gladwin I was just thinking of that Where s that man of mine Bateato Bateato Bateato responded with the swift obedience of a jinn rising from a miraculous bottle Ees sair and the little son of Nippon stood stiffly at attention Ladies run off in autbile he volunteered as his master hesitated Never mind that I want you to find a policeman commanded Gladwin Pleesman where I find him asked Bateato in alarm recalling his uncomfortable experience with Officer six hundred sixty six Try a saloon said Gladwin And when you ve found him bring him

none	none	Ladies steal something ventured the Jap starting for the door Autbile go fast like winds Some one is going to try and steal something replied the young man We must see that they don t Hurry now Ees sair Scuse me and Bateato vanished That s the way to do it Barnes enthused rubbing his hands Get a policeman in here and when the other mister Gladwin shows up nab him Then this marriage can t come off without the aid of a prison chaplain The excitement that for an instant had transfigured Travers Gladwin suddenly left him A look of dismay spread over his features By Jove Barnes he cried We can t do this Why not asked Barnes Why Because it would make a tremendous scandal I m not going to have my future wife mixed up in any public hoorah for the newspapers Think of it her name in the papers coupled with the name of a crook Her picture on one side and a Rogues Gallery photograph on the other Impossible The police must know nothing about it I don t follow you said Barnes What are you going to do kill him and stuff him in that chest He probably deserves it but it would he an awfully unpleasant thing to have around the house Shut up Let me think cut in Gladwin Then he added with swift inspiration Now I ve got it I ll wait outside for her to come and warn her of her danger You stay in here and be on the lookout for the man Whitney Barnes threw up his hands and ejaculated Good night He made as if to start for the door No no Whitney cried Gladwin we must see this thing through together You wouldn t want this sweet young innocent girl connected with a sensational robbery would you No Barnes agreed soberly neither would I want any robber s bullets connected with me You re a coward blurted Gladwin hotly You bet I am acquiesced Barnes and I m alive to tell it Likewise I may have some marriage plans of my own But keep your hair on Travers Let us do some real thinking unaccustomed as we are to it and see if we cannot devise some safer plan What plan is there groaned Gladwin Let us think concentrate suggested Barnes posing himself with his elbow on one hand and his forehead supported on the fingers of the other Gladwin unconsciously fell into the same pose and so they stood side by side with their backs to the hallway Thought of anything Barnes broke the silence Not a thing retorted Gladwin peevishly A broken legged minute had crawled by when Barnes spoke again I ve got it What Gladwin asked uninspired Simplest thing in the world Why didn t I think of it before Somehow I don t think it s going to be any good muttered Gladwin without relinquishing his thoughtful pose Listen said Barnes impressively Go straight to the aunt and tell her the whole thing Gladwin whirled around and gripped his friend s hand By Jove you re right Whitney We can make a lot of excuses for her youth and innocence and all that I didn t think you had it in you Come on we ll go together Barnes s face fell and he stammered But where does she live Where does she live Don t you know No It was Gladwin s turn to throw up his hands And don t you even know her name No Then how in blazes were you going to call on that girl By thunder I forgot all about getting her address admitted the crestfallen Barnes Gladwin uttered a mirthless laugh and said with sarcastic scorn Oh yes you had a fine plan I might have suspected as much Pile it on pile it on growled Barnes I guess the pater has me sized up about right But we must do something the police will know nothing about urged Gladwin Let s concentrate again Maybe a real idea will break out Again the two young men wrinkled their brows in profound absorption They succeeded so well in their effort at concentration that neither was aware of the precipitate entry of Bateato and Michael Phelan both of whom had sprinted a distance of two blocks Phelan was puffing like a tugboat and stopped at the threshold of the room to catch his breath He had prepared his mind for all manner of excitement and had burst in upon a tomb like silence to be greeted by two inscrutable backs What s this he panted Eden Musee or a prayer meetin Barnes glanced over his shoulder and frowned Keep quiet he said We re thinking Gladwin strove to invent an excuse for getting rid of the policeman What do you want he bluffed as if amazed at the sudden invasion What do I want shrilled Officer six hundred sixty six I come to find out what youse want I don t want anything said the young man with exaggerated politeness Thank you very much but I don t want anything Good evening Good evening echoed Barnes with another glance over his shoulder Michael Phelan turned purple He hadn t indulged in the most exhausting sprint in six months to be made sport of Which one of youse sent for me he rasped out The two young men pointed to each other which only served to fan the flame of Phelan s wrath Is one of youse mister Gladwin he gurgled They repeated the pantomime until Gladwin caught the fire in Phelan s eye and decided that it would be better to temporize I am mister Gladwin he bowed Phelan measured him from the ground up as he filled his lungs for another outburst Why did yez send for me he demanded savagely This here little Japanaze come runnin wild eyed down me beat an says there s two women been robbin the house What s all this monkey business Bateato is mistaken said Gladwin forcing a laugh No sir cried the Jap excitedly Ladies run off quick in big autbile Now wait that s enough Gladwin stopped him You tell me find plece persisted the Jap who saw the terrible wrath of Michael Phelan about to flash upon him That s enough Gladwin sought to shut him up You say they steal I go saloon Don t talk any more Don t speak again Go back to the hotel and wait for me I ll send for you when I want you Stop Not another word Bateato gripped his mouth with his fingers and stumbled out of the room Avoiding the still glowering eye of Officer six hundred sixty six Travers Gladwin turned to Barnes and attempted to say casually When Bateato gets an idea into his head there is no use arguing with him There is only one thing to do don t let him speak The young man started to hum a tune and strolled toward the heavily curtained window that looked out on Fifth avenue CHAPTER XXI TRAVERS GLADWIN GOES IN SEARCH OF HIMSELF Policeman Michael Phelan was at first undecided whether to pursue the departing Bateato and arrest him as a suspicious person or to remain on the scene of mystery and get to the bottom of what was going forward He chose the latter plan upon the inspiration that if he arrested a millionaire he would get his name in the paper and Rose might read of it and come to some realization of the immensity of his official dignity He was further urged to this course by the insolent nonchalance of the two young men They weren t paying any more attention to him than they were to the inanimate sticks of furniture in the room Well what did yez send fer me fer he broke out again hurling the words at Travers Gladwin s back I thought you might like a drink replied that young man turning slowly and smiling upon the enraged bluecoat I never touch it shot back Phelan an that s no answer to me question Gladwin stared at Phelan steadily a moment his smile vanishing As he measured the officer s height and build an idea came to him His face lighted as he exclaimed I ve got a great idea Officer I want you to do me a little favor How would you like to make five hundred dollars If he had said four hundred dollars or even four hundred and fifty the effect would not have been half so great upon Michael Phelan The mention of an even five hundred dollars though was the open sesame to the very depths of his emotions Five hundred dollars represented the talisman that would lead him safe through Purgatory into the land of sweet enchantments The fires of his wrath were instantly cooled and he said feebly Are yez tryin to bribe me Not at all sergeant said the young man gravely I ain t no sergeant Phelan retorted All right lieutenant laughed Gladwin his good humor increasing as his sudden idea took shape in his mind Don t call me lieutenant said Phelan with a return of temper Well it s this way captain Nix on the promotion stuff shot back Phelan the consciousness returning that he was being kidded I m patrolman and me name is Michael Phelan and I m onto me job mind that No offense officer Gladwin hurried on I m sure you re onto your job No one could look at you and doubt that but I ll give you five hundred dollars if you ll lend me your uniform for awhile Fi fi uni say what kind of a game are youse up to Two big events in Phelan s life had blazed their films upon his memory in a blinding flash First there was Rose and then there was that nightmare of a Coroner s case when he had fled hatless and coatless down the stairs of a reeking east side tenement pursued by the yells of a shrieking corpse It s no game it s a joke replied Gladwin Whitney Barnes who had been listening eagerly and had sensed Gladwin s inspiration chimed in Yes officer it s a joke Yez are offering me five hundred dollars for a joke said the flabbergasted Phelan That s it returned Gladwin I want to take your place I want to become stepping forward to read the number on Phelan s shield Officer six hundred sixty six for a little while Phelan couldn t believe his ears Stepping to one side he said behind his hand to Barnes This feller s off his dip Don t he know that if I lent him me uniform it d be me finish That s all right spoke up Gladwin I ll guarantee to protect you No one will ever know about it You ll never make five hundred so easy again S s say stammered Phelan what s this all about Well I ve found out that a thief is going to break in here to night A thief gasped the policeman Yes just for a joke you know A thief going to break in here for a joke yelled Phelan Now I know you re batty Not a regular thief the young man corrected hastily He s a friend of mine and I want to be waiting in your uniform when he comes I want to nab him The joke will be on him then you know All very simple you see added Barnes Simple as no I don t see snarled Phelan The two of yez is bugs But you will see went on Gladwin if you ll let me explain In order to be a policeman I ve got to have a uniform haven t I Of course he has urged Barnes And yez are offering me five hundred dollars for a joke Phelan dropped his arms limply at his side and permitted his eyes to bulge ad lib That s it cried Gladwin I assure you it is nothing serious or criminal I just want your uniform long enough to catch my friend and I ll give you five hundred dollars for lending it to me It s too big a risk panted Phelan producing an elaborate bandana and mopping his brow I won t do it It was manifest that Officer six hundred sixty six was sorely tempted To goad him further Travers Gladwin produced a little roll of yellow backed bills from his pocket Fluttering the bills deftly he stripped off one engraved with an M in one corner and five hundred in the other He turned it about several ways so that Phelan could study it from all angles Then he fluttered it before Whitney Barnes and said Say Barnes there s something really handsome about these yellow backs isn t there Notice how that five and those two naughts are engraved And it s amazing how much a slip of paper like this will buy This was too much for Phelan He reached for the bill and grabbed it stuffed it into his trousers pocket and began unbuttoning his coat Suddenly he stopped Say he sputtered S pose there should be a robbery on my beat That would be fine said Gladwin I d be a credit to you Or a murder Better still Oh the risk is awful groaned Phelan He started to button up his coat again when Rose s taunt came back to him This time the tempter delivered a vital blow and he tore off his uniform coat and passed it to the young man Gladwin slipped it on over his other clothes It fitted snugly It just happened that the suit he wore was dark blue and his trousers matched accurately Now the bonnet he said reaching for the uniform cap and removing it from Phelan s head And now officer your sword He grasped the proffered belt and buckled it on with a flourish making as natty a figure of a cub policeman as one would want to meet Phelan stood looking on dumbly his face a study in conflicting emotions Barnes s admiration of his friend s nerve was beyond power of words When Gladwin started for the doorway however he called after him Hey there Travers where are you going On duty he responded cheerily And by the way Whitney give mister Phelan that tray and decanter and see that he goes down into the kitchen and stays there until my return You remain on guard up here I ll look after the outside So long mates Hold on Phelan called out feebly I d like to know what the divvil it all means I m fair hypnotized It means said Gladwin pausing and turning his head that I m going outside to wait for myself and if I find myself I ll arrest myself if both myself and I have to go to jail for it Now do you get me No I ll be damned if I do gurgled Phelan but the words had scarcely passed his lips when the departmental guise of Officer six hundred sixty six vanished from sight and the front door slammed with a bang CHAPTER XXII A MILLIONAIRE POLICEMAN ON PATROL Travers Gladwin went bounding down the steps of his own pretentious marble dwelling with an airy buoyancy that would have caused Sergt McGinnis to turn mental back handsprings had he happened to be going by on his rounds But fortunately McGinnis had passed on his inspection tour shortly before Michael Phelan had been summoned by Bateato For three hours at least Officer six hundred sixty six would be supreme on his beat While the McGinnis contingency had never entered young Gladwin s mind it did suddenly occur to him as he strolled jauntily along that he had neglected to ask Phelan to define the circumscribed limits of his post What if he should happen to butt into another patrolman Certain exposure and all his plans would go flui Then there was the danger of being recognized by some of his neighbors and friends Ah it came to him in a twinkling A disguise Here goes he said aloud I ll jump a taxi and see if I can hunt up a hair store The time was seven P M with the inky darkness of night blanketing the city so far as inky darkness can blanket a metropolis The thoroughfare on which the young man stood was a long lane of dazzle wherefore the nocturnal shadows offered no concealment He cast his eyes up and down the avenue in search of a tramp motor hack cruising in search of a fare He had only a moment or two to wait before one of the bright yellow variety came racketing along He stuck up his hand and waved his baton at the driver There was a crunching of brakes and the taxi hove to and warped into the curb The chauffeur had the countenance of a pirate but his grin was rather reassuring Say me friend began the young man in an effort to assume Michael Phelan s brogue do you know the way to a hair store A what the chauffeur shot back while his grin went inside A hair store I want a bit of a disguise fer my features whiskers false hair or the like Did ye stop me to kid me snarled the chauffeur Ye don t need to think cause you got on a bull s uniform ye can hurl the harpoon into me Or if it s a drink ye re wantin reach in under the seat an there s a flask If ye meant hair oil why didn t ye say it Thanks but tis no drink I m afther said the young man Tis a ride to a hair store an here s a tin spot fer yer trouble It was the way Travers Gladwin handled the skirts of his coat in getting at his money that convinced the wise chauffeur that he had no real policeman to deal with His grin came back and looped up behind at either ear I getcher Steve he broke out reaching for the bill If it s disguises ye re after hop inside an I ll tool youse over to Mme Flynn s on Avenue A To demonstrate to his uniformed fare that speed laws in the greater city of New York fail to impose any manner of hamper upon the charioteering of the motor driven hack the chauffeur of this canary colored taxi scampered across town at a forty mile an hour clip during which Patrolman Gladwin failed to familiarize himself with the quality of the cab s cushions But it was not a long ride and there was some breath left in him when the cab came to a crashing stop The young man was on the point of opening the door when a voice stopped him Kape inside ye boob an pull the blinds down There s coppers on every corner Now what is it ye want in the way o whiskers or hair Ye can slip me the change through the crack What s the prevailin style asked Gladwin with a laugh Are they wearin brown beards They are not mumbled the chauffeur I guess a wee bit mustache an a black wig will do ye an if ye want I ll get ye a pair of furry eyebrows Fine cried the young man poking a twenty dollars bill out through the crack in the door and don t be long The door slammed and a great stillness clapped down broken only by the running of the taximeter which seemed to be equipped with a motor of its own The millionaire cop sat back luxuriously and inhaled a deep breath Gad he exclaimed to himself I m really beginning to live Nothing but thrills for four hours and more and larger ones coming Presently the chauffeur returned opened the door a few inches and shoved in a small package Ye ll have to paste em on in the dark he said Or ye can light a match Ye ll find a wee mirror in the bundle Now where ll I drive yez Back to me fixed post said Gladwin only take it easy while I put me face on straight If ye don t git it on straighter nor your brogue chuckled the chauffeur it ll not decave a blind man In another instant the return journey was under way at reduced speed Travers Gladwin first tried on the wig It was three sizes too large and he had to discard it Next he had some trouble in deciding which was the mustache and which the eyebrows He had burned his fingers pretty badly before he made the selection and likewise he had singed one of the eyebrows But he managed to plaster them all on before the cab stopped and after one glance in the little mirror he was confident the disguise would answer When he stepped out of the taxi at almost the very spot where he had boarded it he felt that a big weight had been lifted from his shoulders How do you like me he asked the chauffeur gayly Is it an improvement I wouldn t say yis nor no to that said the chauffeur but tiz a disguise an that s what ye were wantin Thim eyebrows is grand Thanks laughed Officer six hundred sixty six an here s a wan hundred dollar bill which asks ye to forget me uniform me number an me face Tiz done agreed the chauffeur tucking away the bill on y take a tip from a wise gink an keep deep in the shadders An whin ye pinch your frind don t let him holler too loud The yellow taxi was gone with a rush leaving Gladwin to wonder at the amazingly shrewd guess of its pilot When I pinch me frind he murmured Twas just what I said to Phelan Why He was gazing after the taxicab when from the opposite direction there suddenly rolled into view a vast touring car with a familiar figure at the wheel and alongside the familiar figure a very pretty girl The car was barely rolling along while its two occupants were talking earnestly their heads as close together as was possible under the circumstances Johnny Parkinson as I m alive uttered Travers Gladwin Me old college chum and as per usual making love Yis me grinning chauffeur frind here s where we make a pinch an test Mme Flynn s eyebrows Officer do your duty Out he stepped into the roadway and raised his nightstick The big car came to a sudden stop and the two occupants stared angrily at the cause of the interruption I arrest yez in the name o the law cried Patrolman Gladwin scowling so fiercely that one of the eyebrows was in danger What s that snorted the young aristocrat You re me pris ner said Gladwin easily I arrest ye fer breaking the speed laws racin on the aven oo It s an outrage cried the pretty passenger We were scarcely crawling Johnny You must be joking officer said Johnny Parkinson not very belligerently for he had a bad record for speeding and wasn t sure that some earlier offense was not involved I m not jokin replied Gladwin walking to the door of the tonneau and opening it and ye ll oblige me by drivin to the police station He got in and lolled back cozily in the cushions Johnny Parkinson let in the clutch and rolled northward This was the strangest pinch of his experience and he didn t know just what to make of it After he had gone a few blocks he turned on his captor passenger and said Which station shall I drive to I m sure there must be some mistake There s no mistake responded Gladwin fairly screaming with joy inside at the bewildered and frightened look of his friend As for police stations take your pick I ain t particular Drive round the block a couple o times an make up your mind Johnny Parkinson turned the first corner and then turned again into Madison avenue Gladwin could hear the couple on the front seat whispering excitedly the girl almost in hysterics You ve simply got to do something Johnny she was saying You know if we get our names in the paper father will be furious Remember what he said about the last time you were arrested for speeding Running along Madison avenue Johnny Parkinson slowed down turned again to the uniform in the back seat and said tremulously Can t we compromise this Officer I Not on the aven oo mister Parkinson You ve got too bad a record But if ye ll run the machine over into Central Park where there ain t so many sergeants roamin round we might effict a sittlemint A smile of great gladness illuminated the features of Johnny Parkinson He let in the clutch with a bang and it was only a matter of seconds before the ninety horsepower car glided in through the Seventy second street entrance to Central Park and swung into the dark reaches of the East Drive Slowing down again the young man at the wheel turned and said anxiously The smallest I ve got is a century and I really need some of that That s aisy rejoined Gladwin Sure n I change hundred dollar bills ivry day Slip me the paper an here s a fifty which is lettin ye off aisy seein ye re an ould offinder The transfer of bills was made swiftly whereupon Gladwin commanded Now run me back to me peg post an drop me off on y take it slow an gradual or I might have to pinch yez again A few minutes later Gladwin heard the young girl say passionately Oh Johnny how could you give him the money He s no better than a thief I hope you ve taken his number It wouldn t do any good dearest said Johnny sadly They re all in together and I d only get the worst of it But did you notice Phyllis that he looks a lot like Travers Gladwin Impossible retorted the girl Travers Gladwin is good looking and this man s nothing but an Irish monster The girl was about to speak again when she was sure she heard muffled laughter behind her Then the car sped on into the avenue and just missed colliding with a Fifth avenue motor bus Officer six hundred sixty six was put down a block from his own home and resumed the patrolling of the immediate precincts of the Gladwin mansion His only parting salute from Johnny Parkinson s car was a flashing glance of contempt from the girl whose identity he strove in vain to place CHAPTER XXIII OLD GRIM BARNES GETS A THRILL The precipitate departure of Travers Gladwin left Whitney Barnes and the shirt sleeved Michael Phelan staring blankly at each other The unfrocked policeman was anything but an imposing figure and the contortions of distress in his rubicund countenance were grotesque enough to kindle the sense of humor in a far less volatile mind than that of Whitney Barnes His smile came to the surface and spread out in full blossom But it failed to find reflection in the features of missus Phelan s son What the divvil are ye grinnin at snarled Phelan Ye wouldn t see no fun in it if it mint your job an your pension an your silf respect Now what is it all about There you have me officer responded the young man lightly The riddle is dark on all four sides You and I are in the same boat guardians of the castle against the mysterious foe While you guard the moat from the kitchen I will operate the portcullis Talk sinse will yez hissed Phelan What in blazes has moats an portcollars to do with it Only in a way of speaking laughed Barnes But calm yourself mister Phelan my friend is both wise and discreet He will do no dishonor to your cloth and together we will see that you suffer no material damage in this life I am unable to explain further without uttering more confusion so kindly take yonder tray down into the kitchen That little door on the extreme right I believe opens the way to the lower regions I am sure Bateato left the lights on May the blessed saints presairve ye if it s a trap ye re riggin fer Michael Phelan breathed that gentleman shaking his head dubiously Tis not a step I ll go down into that kitchen till yez lead me the way and if there s any more ravin maniacs down in them quarters I warn ye it s shootin I ll be after doin And Phelan patted the bulge in his hip pocket as he swung around Barnes led the way through the long narrow corridor to the rear of the house while Phelan followed muttering and grumbling every inch of the way There was no further conversation between them while they investigated the elaborate quarters below stairs and at last Phelan ceased his mutterings and accepted from Barnes an armful of cook books with which to regale himself until he was summoned to resume his uniform Returning to the big silent rooms above Whitney Barnes was utterly at a loss how to occupy himself The thundering stillness got on his nerves and he found himself thinking of a dozen different things at once But as idea pursued idea the image of the shy and winsome Sadie persisted in intervening So he dropped Travers Gladwin or rather the two Travers Gladwins Helen Phelan and all the others from his mind and gave himself up to the beatific contemplation of the picture that was most soothing to his spirits For a while he lolled back in one of the great chairs shut his eyes and revolved pleasant visions Suddenly he thought of his father and sprang to his feet By Jove I ll break the news to the pater he cried There s a telephone somewhere in this house and I ll call him up at his club He fairly danced out into the hallway switching on lights wherever he could find a button to press Presently he located the phone in a secluded alcove and slumped down on a divan with the instrument in his lap As a matter of fixed routine it happened that this particular hour found Joshua Barnes mustard magnate settled down to his cigar and coffee in which he found immense comfort after a hearty meal To be disturbed at this most luxurious moment of the day was to a man of his temperament about as pleasant a sensation as being stung by a rattlesnake He sent the club attendant back to the phone with a savage growl and the message to his son to call him up in an hour or to come to the club in person The attendant crept back with the report that Barnes junior insisted that there could be no delay that he had a vastly important matter to report on Old Grim Barnes flung down his cigar gulped his coffee till he choked and stamped off to the telephone booth Well he bellowed That you pater sorry to disturb you but Of course it s important and no damn nonsense about it I No I haven t been arrested and am not in a police station Then what the devil No devil nothing of the sort On the contrary quite the opposite I ve called you up to report progress You know better than that dad I ve only had two drinks I d better take four more

m an ass a blankety blank ass Just wait till you see her I met her up at Travers Gladwin s and Travers is in Egypt No yes of course he is but The final outburst of paternal expletive fairly hurled Whitney Barnes from the phone There by thunder He s rung off in a rage There s the ungrateful parent for you he muttered as he made his way back to Gladwin s drawing room Here I ve gone and broken my neck to fall in love for him and that s all the thanks I get for it Well I ll marry her in spite of him if he doesn t leave me a dollar I could starve in a garret with her and if I got too dreadfully hungry I could eat her Hi ho but say mister Whitney Barnes you had better switch off some of these lights This house isn t supposed to be occupied He left just one heavily shaded bronze lamp abeam Then he carefully drew all the curtains across the windows and tiptoed about the room with the air of a sinister conspirator He stopped in front of the great mysterious looking chest to one side of the entrance to the hallway lifted the heavy lid and looked in Here s where we will put our dead he said with a lugubrious grin let down the lid softly and crossed abruptly to the roomiest and coziest chair beside the curtained window After another sweeping glance about the room he stretched his arms and yawned Reckon I better sleep off that jag the pater presented me over the wire he chuckled and down he slid into the soft upholstery raising his long legs upon another chair and sighing with deep contentment His eyes roved about the room for a moment when he smiled suddenly and quoted Why let the stricken deer go weep The hart ungalled play For some must watch while some must sleep So runs the world away And upon the suggestion of the immortal bard he chose the sleeper s end of it and passed away CHAPTER XXIV AUNTIE TAKES THE TRAIL Mix a tablespoonful of corn starch with a quarter of a cupful of water Stir this into a cupful of boiling water and boil for two minutes then add the juice and rind of a lemon and a cupful of sugar and cook three minutes longer Beat an egg very light and pour the boiling mixture over it Return to the fire and cook a minute longer stirring all the while a most tasty lemon sauce T ell wit these limon sauces exploded Michael Phelan hurling the book across the room and bounding from his chair Sure n I ll niver be able to look a limon in the face agin Limon limon limon these blame books are filled wit em Tis a limon I am mesilf an all fer a limon colored bill But I ll not stand it a minute longer shut down into this tomb wit nothin but mice fer comp ny Wurra Wurra Rose O Neil but your blue eyes an your black hair an your divilish smiles have spelled me finish Phelan wrung his hands and took a turn around the room Now and again he stopped and shook his fist at the ceiling and at last beside himself he made a rush for the door that led to the stairway Opening a crack he listened Nothing but heavy silence beat down on him from above and he shivered He looked back into the kitchen and his eye fell on the pile of cookbooks With a muttered oath he flung himself through the doorway and crept upstairs He had to feel his way through the narrow slit of a corridor above and it was with an immense sigh of relief that he opened the door and stepped into the great drawing room he had left In the dim light of the one glowing lamp he made out Whitney Barnes deep in the embrace of a great chair and sonorously asleep So that s the way he s kapin watch hissed Phelan through his teeth as he fairly pounced across the room First he seized the young man s feet and threw them from their resting place to the floor exclaiming as he did so Here you wake up Yes dear mumbled the young man in his sleep I could abide with you always Don t yez be afther dearin me snarled Phelan Wake up Barnes opened his eyes and asked thickly Wassa masser What are yez doin there cried Phelan What am I doing here rejoined Barnes now wide awake and getting on his feet Why I m keeping watch at the window on guard as it were On guard is it snorted Phelan On guard an snorin like a bazoo Tis a fine night watchman ye d make But say hain t ye seen nothin o mister Gladwin since Now I told you Officer returned Barnes severely that I would let you know just as soon as he returned I have been keeping guard here and no one could enter the house without my knowing it You will kindly return to the kitchen and wait An you got no word from him asked Phelan in manifest distress No with emphasis Oh my oh my complained Phelan bitterly Sure this is the worst muddle I ever got mesilf into The sergeant will find him in that uniform sure It ll cost me me job that s what it will How late is it now Barnes consulted his watch Five minutes past ten Howly Moses If I ever get out of this scrape I pity the mon that offers me money fer the lind o me uniform agin I ll grab him by the A sharp ring at the doorbell cut him short and wrote another chapter of tragedy in his countenance Hello there s some one at the door spoke up Barnes You d better go and see who it is Officer Me gurgled Phelan Me an walk into the arms o Sergeant McGinnis Let em stay out whoever it is or yez go yersilf All right said Barnes and in case it should be your friend McGinnis you better go and hide in the kitchen like a brave officer I ll let you know when it s time to come out Phelan did not budge as Barnes left the room but stood muttering to himself How the divvil did I iver let mesilf in fer this thing I dunno That s what love does to yez a plague on all women If Helen Helen where are you cried a shrill feminine voice that seemed to clutch the very heart of Michael Phelan with a grip of ice Howly murther What s that he breathed backing away from the door Help Murder Police was borne in on him in even more agonized tones and before he could move another step missus Elvira Burton burst into the room flushed and wild eyed in the throes of one of her famous fits of hysterics Phelan took a backward leap as she came toward him and she yelled Stop stop Where s my niece With his eyes almost out on his cheeks Phelan managed to articulate What ma am You know what I mean don t deny it missus Burton shrilled I don t know what yez re talkin about protested Phelan backing toward the doorway that led to the kitchen The hysterical woman stopped struggling for breath When she could speak again she said fiercely Who are you I I Phelan began Tell me who you are or I ll have you arrested I ll call the police Oh for the love of hiven don t call the police begged Phelan still backing toward the door Then tell me what you are doing here I ll answer no questions cried Phelan With a desperate backward leap he gained the narrow doorway behind and vanished He pulled the door shut and clung to the knob hearing the muffled demand hurled at him Here Come back here Helen Helen I want my niece Oh Helen come to auntie Then Barnes and the other pretty ward of the distraught missus Burton entered the room The young man had stopped Sadie in the hallway to ask a few questions and endeavored to soothe the frightened girl He had taken possession of her hand again and still held it as he led her to the door of the drawing room They did not attempt to enter until after the precipitate disappearance of Michael Phelan As missus Burton stood looking helplessly at the closed door her ample bosom heaving and her breath coming in short hysterical gasps Barnes was whispering to Sadie Ah Miss Sadie I can t tell you how overjoyed I am at seeing you again And so that s your auntie fancy that chap refusing to meet her Why That was as far as he got Auntie suddenly wheeled round and caught sight of him Ah Gladwin she screamed and made a rush for him With all his characteristic aplomb and insouciance Whitney Barnes was unable to face such a rush with any degree of calmness No no a mistake he retorted and sought to sidestep missus Burton was too quick for him and seized his arm in an iron grip Where is Helen What have you done with her she demanded in the same wild tones I I I d d don t know stammered Barnes You have hidden her somewhere and you must give her up stormed the woman You re a scoundrel you re a kidnapper you re a wretch She flung Barnes from her with all her strength and he slammed against the wall She was about to charge upon him again when Sadie rushed between them Oh auntie she cried This is not mister Gladwin Of course he isn t chimed in Barnes trying to shake himself together again He isn t mister Gladwin at all Then who are you cried missus Burton Oh he s some one else Sadie assured her Yes you bet I am continued Barnes striving his best to appear his usual jaunty self I m some one else entirely different I I m not Gladwin in the least What are you doing here shot out missus Burton Ah that s it he responded I m on guard keeping watch I knew it I knew it and the shrill voice rose to a plangent pitch again You have hidden her away Helen Helen Now now now my dear lady broke in Barnes soothingly I m not your dear lady she flashed on him My dear auntie missus Burton s hysteria was becoming contagious I beg your pardon he added hastily your niece Miss Helen is not here I ve been watching for hours and she s not here no one is here That shirt sleeved man is here and you re here But auntie he s a friend of mister Gladwin s interposed Sadie Ah ha I knew it screamed missus Burton He s in the plot And again she plunged for him crying You re his friend you re helping him to steal my niece But you shan t I ll prevent it I ll search the house Come Sadie Barnes dodged skilfully and permitted missus Burton to pass out into the hallway Sadie was about to follow when the young man stopped her But I must go with auntie Sadie objected Never mind auntie now I want to tell you about your cousin Then you ve seen her No But you know where she is No Then what can you tell me about her Everything Sit down please Remember you asked me to help you and I promised to do so missus Burton had managed to switch on the lights in the big reception room back of the hallway and was searching behind curtains under books behind pictures and in innumerable other places after the manner of hysterical women I said I would help you you know ran on Barnes Yes and Sadie looked up into his eyes confidently Do you know why I promised No Why did you Barnes bent down toward her and said with all the ardor he could command Because from the moment I saw you I became your slave When I saw how distressed you were about your cousin this evening my heart went out to you the instant you left I decided to act and I ve been acting ever since Oh how kind what have you done I ve watched Watched Yes watched You don t understand that but it s a very serious matter If you only knew how serious this whole thing is you d realize how I am trying to help you and the risk I am taking Oh how noble of you How brave you are and if missus Burton had waited another moment before returning to the room she would have had another case for hysterics on her hands entirely separate and independent of Helen s elopement I can t find her I don t believe she s in the house wailed missus Burton Barnes regarded her dumbly for a moment and then said slowly and ponderously My dear lady I assure you that she is not in the house If you ll only listen a moment I won t listen missus Burton snapped him up Sadie jumped to her feet and rallied to Barnes s defense But auntie this gentleman has been doing everything he can to help us everything He s been watching Watching Watching what demanded auntie suspiciously Ah that s it What What haven t I been watching for hours cried Barnes But what have you been watching for missus Burton shrilled For hours What I mean for yours and Miss Sadie s sake and now if you ll wait here and watch with me Now I see it all stormed missus Burton shaking her hand at Barnes wrathfully You want to keep us here Helen and that scoundrel have gone and you want to prevent our following them No auntie he s trying to help us sobbed Sadie He s lying to you child said missus Burton shooting vindictive glances at Barnes Don t you know he s a friend of that wretch Gladwin But they can t hoodwink me I know what to do now Helen is not of age I ll swear out a warrant I ll have him arrested for abduction a State prison offense No no no implored Barnes in real alarm you must not do that That will make the whole thing public and that is just what Gladwin is trying to avoid Don t you suppose I know that sneered missus Burton He s probably a bigamist He may have a dozen wives living the beast But won t you understand insisted Barnes He s trying to save her privately Now what are you talking about missus Burton regarded him as if she had suddenly realized he was a raving maniac And by way of justifying her inspiration he stumbled on blindly I don t know you see it s this way Gladwin and I only found it out this afternoon quite by accident And we decided to save her That s enough stop cried missus Burton You re talking all this nonsense to detain us But I won t stay a minute longer Come Sadie we will go to the police station I ll never rest until I have that monster in jail And with another dagger glance at Barnes she swept her niece and herself out of the room and out of the house to the waiting automobile Barnes gripped his forehead in both hands to steady his reeling brain Isn t that just like a woman he complained After explaining explicitly she s going to have him arrested But by Jove I must find Travers and warn him that the police are on his track Seizing his hat and stick he rushed out into the night just in time to see missus Burton s or rather Jabez Hogg s big car glide away from the curb and shoot down the avenue like a vast projectile CHAPTER XXV PHELAN MEETS HIS UNIFORM AGAIN About the time the Gladwin mansion was ringing with the shrill staccato outbursts of missus Elvira Burton the owner of that luxurious dwelling was leaning against the Central Park wall a few blocks away engaged in earnest conversation with a small boy You ought to be in bed the young man was saying severely looking down at the lad and noting how thinly he was clad and yet how little he appeared to suffer from the sting of the chill night air Bed nuttin responded the boy curtly I m lookin fer me dog Did yez seen him go by he s a t oroughbred an lost one ear battlin with a bull Oh so you re her brother then laughed Gladwin Who s brudder asked the boy suspiciously May s said Gladwin or I should say the brother of Miss May Henny Hully gee ejaculated the boy Did dat kid skin out too after me an the old man tellin her to stay in bed an shut up her bellerin Yes said Gladwin and the young lady with my aid found the valuable animal you are searching for a black dog with a white spot over the right eye and no tail Hully gee cried the boy ecstatically She found him eh Well who d a t ought it an me lookin fer him tree hours Where did she find him officer His name s Mike named after me old man s boss what bites nails We found him in the park in company with a disreputable friend said Gladwin A yaller mut asked the boy with a contemptuous emphasis on the mut Dat s the janitor s dog an he s nottin but a tramp I wisht he d fall in de river an get et by a catfish I wouldn t wish him all that hard luck laughed Gladwin for he had a large bone he was sharing with Mike I was watching them over the park wall when May came along I sent them all and the bone home in a taxicab In a which ejaculated the boy while his eyes popped In a taxi said Gladwin lightly Aw say and the little chap s jaw fell now I know you re kiddin Where d May git the price of a taxi an Oh I arranged all that the uniformed mystery explained reassuringly and if you d like I ll call one for you You look pretty tired I guess you ve walked a good many miles on the trail of Mike The youngster tried to speak but could not The very thought of a ride in a taxicab froze his brain Gladwin took him by the hand and led him to the curb Now would you prefer a yellow or a red one he asked There s all kinds going by Yaller cried the boy I likes them best They had only a moment to wait when one of the mystic yellow hue cruised round a corner and came toward them Gladwin hailed it and the chauffeur stopped with a wondering look at the pair Gladwin had a bill ready in his hand and passed it up to the chauffeur Take this boy over to No two hundred eighty seven East Eightieth street commanded Gladwin and whatever you ve got left out of the tenspot above what the meter registers split the change with the boy And as for you son patting the urchin on the head you keep your eye peeled on the meter Gee Will I responded the boy and as Gladwin opened the door he hopped in and took up a perch where he could best observe the fascinating operations of the register The chauffeur a bullet headed cross eyed individual squinted at the bill half a dozen times before he stowed it away in his pocket and set the meter Then he made a swift fierce scrutiny of Travers Gladwin s face shook his head swallowed a mouthful of oaths threw in the clutch and spurted diagonally for the cross street As he vanished the uniformed similitude of Officer six hundred sixty six consulted his watch made out that it was almost ten point thirty and strode rapidly in the direction of his home He wore a smile that was fairly refulgent Wouldn t have missed this night patrol for a hundred thousand he said inwardly and they say that the life of a patrolman is a monotonous drudgery Arriving at the stoop of his home he reconnoitered the avenue in both directions and then looked up at the black windows of the house A sudden lull had come upon the neighborhood and there seemed not a soul stirring He sped lightly up the stoop and let himself in He was surprised to find the lights burning brilliantly in the drawing room and no sign of Barnes The heavy curtains he saw were carefully arranged to prevent the merest ray of light from showing outside He took the further precaution however of turning off all but the single globe in one lamp He speculated on the disappearance of Barnes until he heard a stealthy step approaching through the corridor that led to the kitchen Without noise he glided to the window and concealed himself behind the curtains He had scarcely hidden himself when the hinged panel that answered for a door opened slowly and the countenance of Michael Phelan protruded itself into the room The Phelan shoulders and embonpoint still in negligee followed Taking a cautious step forward he uttered behind his hand Pst Pst Hey youse there There was no answer and Phelan worked his head round like a wary weazel muttering Who was that woman I wonder She must have took that Slim Jim away with her Musha Musha If they should call the police Bad cess to that feller an his five hundred dollar bill Murther Murther I m done fer Travers Gladwin had stepped out of the folds of the curtain Hey there he blurted What are youse up to Howly Saint Pathrick I m gone now sure groaned Phelan and trembled where he stood Come come Officer six hundred sixty six laughed Gladwin I m only your ghost Phelan exhaled a tremendous sigh of relief The Lord be praised if it ain t yez he exclaimed delightedly But where did ye get that disguise At a hair store Madam Flynn s on Avenue A do you like it laughed the young man I didn t want any of my friends or neighbors to recognize me you know But fer the love o heaven where have yez been all the time asked Phelan sinking into a chair and breathing hard Patrolling my beat I mean your beat returned the young man and keeping my eye out for my friend the burglar Oh I ve had quite a party When I got hungry I sent to the Plaza for lunch and sat on the park wall and ate it And by the way I saw a friend of mine coming along in an automobile and I arrested him for speeding What Phelan exploded jumping to his feet and turning white as his boiled shirt Yes nabbed him for breaking the speed limit Gladwin nodded leaning back against a table and lighting a cigarette Fer fer fer breakin the speed limit fer fer yez made an arrest Exactly He was going so slow he deserved to be arrested and what s more he was making love to a pretty girl without shame I got in and told him to drive me to the station Phelan threw up his hands with a groan An did yez take him to the station How could I chuckled Gladwin I didn t know where it was that is your station so I told him most any would do We rode about a bit and as he didn t seem anxious to be locked up I compromised for fifty dollars It was really quite simple Phelan and if I d only had more time I might have got back that five hundred Illustration GIVE ME ME UNIFORM AN LET ME GIT OUT OF HERE You ve lost me me job that s what you ve done moaned Phelan while his brain reeled with pictures of police headquarters trial rooms and ruthless commissioners Come give me me uniform he cried with a sudden accession of passion What s that asked the young man quickly his grin vanishing Me uniform rasped Phelan with a rush toward the young man Give me me uniform an let me git out of here Gladwin dodged around the table protesting No no not yet The burglar that is my friend will be here any moment Your friend Phelan stopped again a prey to bewilderment Yes yes I explained all that before The one I m playing the joke on You don t suppose I m going to take it off now do you Yez can bet your life yez are roared Phelan with another savage rush round the table I ve had enough of this an too much Now just a minute pleaded Gladwin I assure you everything is all right and I m not going to leave the house again If anything happens so you need your uniform I ll be right here where you can get it I m not going to leave the house Tell me where s Barnes Who said Phelan more calmly and pausing in his pursuit My friend the one I left here I dunno there was a ring at the bell here a while ago and in come a wild woman and Great Scott I hope my friend wasn t scared off If that fellow was to meet her here at ten point thirty why it s after that now Here Phelan quick help me put these covers on the chairs and things Over there in the corner back of the chest He mustn t know that anybody s been here Hurry man hurry we haven t a second to spare Phelan submitted to the breathless commands as if he were hypnotized puffing and blowing like a porpoise as he struggled to slip the linen covers over the chairs Gladwin worked at top speed too and just as he was covering the great chest he gave a start and held up his hand Sh he whispered There s a motor stopping outside You go down into the kitchen and be ready to come up if you hear me whistle But ye ll promise yez won t leave the house with them clothes gasped Phelan No no certainly not Be quick now I ll switch off this light and step out on the balcony Close that door tight after you and be sure you switch out the lights in the back hall Gladwin only waited for the disappearance of Phelan and the soft closing of the door when he plunged the room into darkness He could hear the click of a key in the front door lock as he groped his way to the window curtains and pressed back into the semi circular recess that led out onto a window balcony As he did so he unlatched the heavily grilled balcony window drew out his penknife and slit a peephole in the curtain CHAPTER XXVI GLADWIN MEETS HIMSELF Standing as stiff and immovable as if he had been turned to stone Travers Gladwin peered with one eye through the narrow aperture he had slashed in the heavy brocade portiere Still gazing into inky darkness he could hear the cautious tread of two persons His senses told him that one of the visitors was a heavy sure footed man and that the other was of lighter build and nervously wary His deductions ceased instantly as a flash of light crossed his vision For a moment the concealed watcher saw nothing save the incisive ray of light that cut like a knife thrust through the darkness then as he followed the shaft of light to its source he made out the silhouette of a man in evening dress a white shirt front square shoulders that branched off into the nothingness of the cloaking shadows and a handsome sharp profile that lost itself in the gloom of a silk hat He also made out a cane from which the flashlight beamed It was a new device to the experience of Travers Gladwin and he watched it with the same fascination that a man is wont to manifest in the gleam of a revolver muzzle that suddenly protrudes itself from the mysterious depths of night The wielder of this smart burglar s implement did not move as he gashed the darkness with the ray of light and to Gladwin he seemed inordinately calm His companion was somewhere behind him groping and did not come into the picture until suddenly he found the push button in the wall and switched on the full glare of the electroliers suspended from the ceiling Gladwin saw and recognized He drew in a deep breath of surprise It was Watkins the thieving butler he had discharged in London His attention did not linger on this familiar soft shuffling tool of the master thief however but snapped back to the big good looking young man with the branching shoulders and erect confident carriage Used as he was to immaculate exteriors Travers Gladwin had never seen a better groomed man He had never seen a man with a quicker eye and more unconscious grace of movement It was no wonder that bitter envy gnawed his heart for a little while as there rose again before him the picture of that bewilderingly pretty girl and her passionate insistence that she would elope with Travers Gladwin in spite of any and all obstacles That underneath all these splendid sheathings the man had the mean spirit of a deceiver and a robber never entered the young man s head But presently things began to happen with such avalanching rapidity of action that there was not even a second to spare for speculation upon the vast gap between their social positions The lights had hardly been switched on before the big fellow put the sharp query to his companion Watkins is this room just as you left it when you went away with mister Gladwin I don t know sir replied Watkins with characteristic deference of tone Bateato the Jap closed the house H m said the other laying his cane and hat on a table and drawing from the pocket of his light overcoat a blue print diagram of the house Casting his eyes about the room he unfolded the diagram and pointed to it nodding his head behind him for Watkins to come and look We re in this room now he said easily Yes sir Out that way is the corridor to the kitchen He pointed to the panel like door which a few minutes before had swallowed the very much undressed Officer six hundred sixty six Yes sir And there s no other way out save through the front door or by way of this balcony behind those curtains No sir And still running his finger over the diagram on the floor above are Gladwin s apartments Yes sir at the head of the stairs first door to the left H m very good slipping the diagram back into his pocket and lifting his eyes to the great portrait of the ancestral Gladwin Ah he exclaimed suddenly and with palpable relish that s a Stuart Is that the great grandfather Watkins Yes sir responded Watkins without any of his companion s enthusiasm H m with the same grim emphasis and off came the overcoat to be carelessly tossed across his hat and stick His eye fell upon the great antique chest by the wall He lifted the lid to inspect its void interior Glancing up above it he motioned to Watkins and said Here help me get this out of the way Watkins glided to one end of the chest and together they hauled it clear of the wall This done he addressed Watkins as if he were but a creature to command I can manage alone in here but I want to be ready to leave by the time Miss Burton arrives You go outside and wait in the car and keep a sharp lookout Watkins bowed himself out with his stereotyped Yes sir and the door clicked gently after him The now lone invader returned to his interested survey of the paintings that covered the walls turning easily on his heel until his line of vision embraced The Blue Boy From his difficult peephole Travers Gladwin could see the sharp stern features wrinkle with smiles before the intruder laughed lightly and breathed with seeming great enjoyment Ha The Blue Boy The smile went out as swiftly as it had come and was replaced by an utterly different expression as he swung about and visualized the Rembrandt on the wall above where the great empty chest had stood There was reverence and quick admiration in every feature as he bowed and exclaimed with a long sigh Rembrandt Rembrandt God to paint like that The emotions of this remarkable young man came and went with the quickness of his eye While still in the act of outpouring his admiration he whipped from the tail of his dress coat a flat fold of a dozen or more sheets of wrapping paper shook them out and laid them on the lid of the chest With another swift gesture he produced a knife sprang the thin gleaming blade and walked up to the Rembrandt He raised the knife to the canvas with the ease of a practiced hand when he heard a movement behind him and turned his head Travers Gladwin had stepped from the sheltering screen of portieres and stopped abruptly Whatever shock this sudden apparition of a uniformed policeman was to the man caught in the act of cutting a priceless canvas from its frame he managed to conceal by taking tight grip of every muscle in his body His eyes revealed nothing There was no rush of color to or from his face His first change of expression was to smile Dropping the arm that poised the knife he let himself down easily from tiptoe and turned squarely to Gladwin Good evening Officer he said without a tremor showing his teeth in as engaging a smile as Travers Gladwin had ever looked upon Evenin said Gladwin shortly with an admirable affectation of Phelan s brogue Do you find something on the balcony that interests you said the other slowly still holding his smile and his amazingly confident bearing You climbed up there to enjoy the moonlight perhaps he added even more softly gaining reassurance from the wooden expression that Gladwin had forced upon his features No not the moonlight responded the uniformed similitude of Officer six hundred sixty six the other light I seen em go on This house has been closed for months Oh yes to be sure the other shrugged You re most alert Officer right on the job as they say I congratulate you I ve been watching this house ever since mister Gladwin went away said Gladwin slowly unable to make up his mind whether to call Phelan or to continue the intensely interesting dialogue His visitor decided the situation for him by coolly lighting a cigar taking a few deliberate puffs and turning it over in his fingers to inspect it as if it were the only object worth attention in the room Gladwin read this elaborate by play for what it was worth an effort to decide just how best to play his part and was pleasantly thrilled with the realization that he himself was so well disguised in the uniform of Officer six hundred sixty six So he clung to his own role and forgot Michael Phelan H m said the invader reflectively That s very good of you Officer Let me offer you this as a slight token of my appreciation His left hand slid into his trousers pocket and brought up a roll of bills His nonchalance was a perfect mask as he stripped off one of the bills and held it out carelessly to Gladwin On his part Gladwin s expression was superbly blank as he reached for the bill pocketed it and said with his purring brogue Thank ye sorr And might I ask who ye are H m that s good chuckled the other now thoroughly master of himself and utterly confident Now who do you suppose Officer would come to the front door unlock it walk in and turn up the lights a thief They do sometimes said Gladwin cocking his head to one side with an air of owlish wisdom The other raised his eyebrows to express surprise Do they really he drawled You amaze me Officer I ve always supposed they broke in somehow and used dark lanterns Not always said Gladwin obstinately The big man shrugged his shoulders contemptuously puffed his cigar for a moment and said indulgently Well I m sorry Officer to deprive you of the pleasure you would evidently derive in catching a thief and making an arrest Now with a light laugh who might you imagine I was Well if I wasn t sure mister Gladwin was across the Atlantic I d imagine that yez were mister Gladwin himself This was said with such laborious canniness that the thief made haste to discover just how the land lay Oh so you re sure mister Gladwin is abroad eh Well I see be the papers A real hearty laugh escaped this time and he added brightly Well mister Policeman I ll tell you something to help you make a good shrewd guess Mr Gladwin is not abroad Then yez are mister Gladwin sorr cried the young man eagerly as if delighted at the discovery The other leaned back against the table crossed one foot over the other and said musingly You found me out Officer I must admit it Permit me to thank you again for looking out for my house and if you don t mind I ll double this little reward Again the roll of bills came out and another twenty dollars gold certificate was gathered in by Officer six hundred sixty six who grinned as he took it Thank ye sorr The gesture with which this second benefaction was bestowed was a gesture of dismissal and the bestower set off on an easy saunter about the room humming a tune Officer six hundred sixty six did not move and after a moment the other casually remarked You don t seem to be in any hurry to get back to your post officer No sorr I ain t in no hurry Have a cigar then and one was offered with the same assumption of good natured indifference that had accompanied the tender of the bribes Gladwin accepted the cigar took off his cap dropped it in and returned the cap to his head The thief was puzzled for a moment until it occurred to him that it would suit his purpose best to have this thick skulled copper in his company rather than have him go outside and discuss the matter with a more shrewd superior Therefore he said quickly Oh officer could you be spared off your rounds for say an hour Why yes sorr I think so Well I want you to do me a favor I ll pay you well for it What is it You look to me like a chap who could keep a secret That s part o me trade Good Well then I m expecting a call from a lady Oh I see sorr and Gladwin forced another fatuous grin No you don t see said the other impressively This lady is my fiancee Well that s your business sorr Gladwin was beginning to enjoy the battle hugely You don t understand explained the thief I m about to be married Oh yez are about to be married with a slight wince Yes I m going to be married to night secretly Is that so Well I can t help yez about that can I Oh yes you can because I want it kept quiet on the lady s account Well I ll help you keep it quiet on the lady s account with an emphasis that got away from him but was misinterpreted Good and out came the roll of bills again and another yellow boy was slipped into the greedy palm of Officer six hundred sixty six Thank you sorr But what can I do sorr I ll show you later on In the mean time help me take the covers off this furniture and make the place look habitable Hurry now for I haven t much time That s the idea brisk Switch on the hall lights you can find the button Then go upstairs and straighten my room Gladwin stopped in his activities as if he had run against a wall Your room sorr Yes at the head of the stairs first door to the left Then come back here and help me pack CHAPTER XXVII MISADVENTURES OF WHITNEY BARNES Just as it had not occurred to Travers Gladwin to ask Michael Phelan to define the limits of his beat along Fifth avenue so it happened that Whitney Barnes went forth in search of his friend without even the vaguest notion of where he might be found It is doubtful if young mister Barnes knew what a policeman s beat was Certainly he did not conceive of it as a restricted territory He had gone about six blocks at his best stride eagerly scanning both sides of the avenue before the thought came into his mind that he might be going in the wrong direction and that he might keep on indefinitely to the Staten Island ferry and obtain never a glimpse of the borrowed uniform of Officer six hundred sixty six But I must warn the chap he thought fiercely or there will be the very deuce and all to pay Whitney slowed down came to a full stop and was meditatively chewing the head of his cane when an automobile halted at the curb A head thrust itself out of a window of the limousine and a musical voice asked Why mister Barnes what are you doing here Whitney Barnes guiltily jumped and barely missed swallowing his cane Volplaning to earth he looked for the source of this dismaying interruption He recognized with a start one of the past season s debutantes whose mamma had spread a maze of traps and labyrinths for him Miss Sybil Hawker Sponge of New York Newport Tuxedo and Lenox Before he could even stutter a reply a motor footman had leaped down from the box and opened the door of the limousine Miss Hawker Sponge fluttered out contrived her most winning smile and repeated Why mister Barnes what are you doing here Her big doll eyes rolled a double circuit of coquetry and slanted off with a suggestive glance at the massive doorway of the Hawker Sponge mansion one of the most aristocratically mortgaged dwellings in America It is rather late for a call she gushed suddenly but I know mamma Impossible cried Barnes That is I beg your pardon I should be charmed but the fact is I was looking for a friend I mean a policeman Er you haven t seen a good looking policeman going by have you Miss Sybil All the coquetry in Miss Hawker Sponge s eyes went into stony eclipse You are looking for a policeman friend mister Barnes she said icily gathering up her skirts and beginning to back away I hope you find him She gave him her back with the abruptness of a slap in the face In another moment he was again a lone wayfarer in the bleak night wilderness of out of doors Fifth avenue Indubitably he had committed a hideous breach of good manners and could never expect forgiveness from Miss Hawker Sponge She had really invited him into her home and he had preferred to hunt for a policeman friend Yet the tragedy of it was so grotesquely funny that Whitney Barnes laughed and in laughing dismissed Miss Hawker Sponge from his mind He must find Travers Gladwin and off he went at another burst of speed He covered about three blocks without pause A second and far more sensational interruption came from a side street and again of the feminine gender It was a tall weird looking figure wound in a black shawl and it bumped squarely into Whitney Barnes and brought him up sharply spinning on one foot Before he stopped spinning he felt himself seized by the arm Without warning a bundle was thrust into his arms and he had to clutch it In another instant the weird figure had fled up the avenue turned a corner and vanished Instantly the bundle that Whitney Barnes held awkwardly and painfully as if it were a firebrand emitted an anguished wail If that wasn t a pretty pickle for Whitney Barnes His cane had clattered to the pavement and he did not dare stoop to pick it up The anguish from the bundle he held increased terrifically in volume He could feel beads of perspiration running down his face What in desperation was he going to do with that awful bundle He knew intuitively that the tall shawled figure would never return My God he cried I ll be arrested as the father of it and what will Sadie say to that It was no wonder that the son and heir of Old Grim Barnes sweated It wasn t perspiration One doesn t perspire in such awful straits one sweats like a navvy It seemed ages before he could form the impulse to move in any direction for any definite purpose He was on the point of making up his mind to lay the bundle on the doorstep when he sensed a heavy step from behind and was paralyzed by the gruff ejaculation Well I ll be damned Barnes twisted his head and beheld a big deep chested policeman a haughty domineering policeman who showed in every inch of him that the gods had anointed him above the mere ranks of mortal patrolmen Take it take it cried Barnes extending the bundle toward the uniformed presence It s not mine he almost shrieked A woman gave it to me and I have a very important engagement and must hurry Sergeant McGinnis for twas none other drew back and waved the bundle from him Just a minute my young friend he spoke through one side of his large mouth You ll hold that infant till its mother comes or you ll go with me to the police station and tell your story to the captain But I can t wait wailed Barnes I ve got to find a policeman A policeman eh Well here s one for you and a sergeant at that I mean a friend It s horribly important I ll give you anything you ask if you ll only take this howling bundle None o that young feller McGinnis snapped him up You ll give me nothing and you ll come sharp and straight to the station Now I know there s something back o this But I haven t time Barnes objected It s most horribly important that I should find Chop it Chop it You ll come with me and you ll lug that infant If you won t come quiet I ll slip the nippers on you Barnes realized the hopelessness of the situation and looked about him wildly Stop that taxicab officer he urged as he saw one of the vehicles approaching I can t walk like this I ll pay the fare I ll pay everything McGinnis consented to this arrangement The taxicab stopped A few minutes later it bore the sergeant his prisoner and the still howling infant to the threshold of the East Eighty eighth street police station McGinnis consented to carry the infant as they got out and once inside the station lost no time in turning it over to the matron Hello McGinnis said Lieut Einstein from the desk what s all this McGinnis explained in a few crisp sentences Is the captain in Lieutenant he asked This young fellow is after trying to bribe me Barnes protested that such a thought had never entered his head I simply told him he declared hotly that I had an important engagement Looking for a policeman he says For a friend I may have said policeman I may have said anything in such a beastly situation I am sure that when the captain hears me he will understand immediately That may be true sir said the lieutenant politely but the captain is out at present and won t be back till after midnight If you want to you can sit in the back room and wait for him Further protestations were unavailing With a sigh of despair Barnes permitted himself to be led to the back room where he dropped down on a chair and looked savagely about him The room was empty and there was nothing to gaze at save four blank walls and a black cat sitting in a corner idly washing its paws Now and then a door opened a face peered in and the door shut again Somewhere a clock ticked dolefully An hour passed while the young man sought in vain to enchain his incoherent thoughts He could think of nothing vividly He could recall nothing at all Whenever the wail of that infant the matron was caring for reached him he writhed and ground his teeth In this sad plight he remained until a door near him opened and a man in plain clothes came stealthily in He walked straight to Barnes bent down and whispered If you ve got a hundred dollar bill about you drop it onto the floor and walk out The lieutenant won t see you The individual turned on his heel and went out the way he had come He did not shut the door tightly behind him Barnes felt that an eye was watching through the slit so he lost no time in jumping to his feet getting his money out of his wallet and dropping two one hundred dollar bills on the floor This done he jammed the wallet back in his pocket picked up his cane and gloves and opened the door through which he had entered the room He started warily forward with his eyes straight ahead He could feel that the lieutenant who sat behind the high railed off desk was the only person in the room and he could hear the scratch of his busy pen Gaining the street entrance he drew an immense sigh of relief opened it eagerly and fairly leaped outside to the steps As the door shut behind him he thought he heard a sudden explosive laugh but it meant nothing to him as he hurried along blindly increasing his pace at every stride At the corner of Third avenue he stopped and consulted his watch It was midnight CHAPTER XXVIII AN INSTANCE OF EPIC NERVE Travers Gladwin scaled the great staircase three steps at a time Stumbling against a divan he threw himself across it and lay for a few moments stretched on his back with every muscle relaxed He felt as if he had been buffeted by mighty tempests and overwhelmed by cataclysms His head throbbed with fever and he felt a sickening emptiness inside How was he going to avert the catastrophe of an elopement and at the same time save himself and that charming young girl from a shrieking scandal There didn t seem any coherent solution If Whitney Barnes had only remained with him at least to lend him moral courage Where had the confounded ass gone Why didn t he return A fine friend in need was he There was no time to unravel his perplexities and lay any definite plan He must act taking his cue as it was presented to him by the racing events of the moment He got up from the divan and rushed downstairs He cleared the last landing with a momentum that slid him across the polished floor of the hallway after the manner of small boys who slide on ice He fairly coasted into the room but his precipitate intrusion did not in the least disturb his visitor During Gladwin s brief absence that supernaturally composed individual had cut the Rembrandt from the frame and laid it on one of the sheets of wrapping paper he had spread out on the chest He had also cut out a Manet a Corot and a Vegas all small canvases and hung them over the back of a chair As the owner of these masterpieces skidded into the room the thief was taking down a Meissonier frame and all fondling it tenderly and feasting his eyes on the superb wealth of detail and the rich crimson and scarlet pigments in the tiny oblong within the heavy gilt mounting Ah Officer you are back he said easily as Gladwin staggered against a table and gripped it for support The methodical despoiler did not so much as turn his head as he placed the Meissonier on the chest and deftly cut out the canvas His back was still squared to the flabbergasted young man as he continued Come get busy Officer if you are going to help me Take down that picture over there on the right He pointed and went on wrapping up the immensely valuable plunder Gladwin got up on a chair and reached for one of the least noteworthy of his collection No no not that one said the thief sharply the one above an old Dutch painting that had cost a round ten thousand dollars The young man took it down gingerly biting his lips and cursing inwardly That s it he was rewarded bring it here Gladwin managed to cross the room with an appearance of stolid indifference and as he handed the picture to the collector he said haltingly I take it these pictures is worth a lot of money sorr You re right I take it said the other with a laugh beginning at once to slash out the canvas Yes sorr I mean you take it said Gladwin viciously The wrathful emphasis missed its mark The collector was humming to himself and working with masterful deftness Now that woman s head to the left he commanded as soon as he had disposed of the Dutch masterpiece And be quick about it You move as if you were in a trance Gladwin saw that he was to take down his only Rubens wherefore he deliberately reached for another painting The Blue Boy No not that thing exclaimed the collector Why what s the matter with this one sorr snapped back Gladwin It s a fake said the other contemptuously I paid two old frauds five hundred pounds for that thing in London a couple of years ago it s absolutely worthless from the standpoint of art Gladwin looked at him in open mouthed amazement and slid from the chair to the floor How had this astounding person come by the secret of The Blue Boy There was a positive awe in Gladwin s gaze as he sized up the big man again from his shining patent leather shoes to his piercing eyes and broad intellectual forehead He fairly jumped when the command was repeated to take down the Rubens and hand it to him As he handed it over he stammered I don t think much of this one sorr You don t said the other in pitying disgust Well it s a Rubens worth forty thousand dollars if it s worth a cent Yez don t tell me Gladwin managed to articulate Indicating the full length portrait of the ancestral Gladwin he added Who is that old fellow over there sorr Kindly don t refer to the subject of that portrait as fellow the other caught him up That is my great grandfather painted by Gilbert Charles Stuart more than a century ago You monumental liar was on Gladwin s lips He managed to stifle the outburst and ask Are yez goin to take all these pictures away with yez to night Oh no not all of them was the careless reply Only the best ones How unspeakably kind of him thought the unregarded victim If yez wanted the others he said with fine sarcasm I could pack em up afther ye re gone an sind thim to yez That might be a good idea Officer I ll think it over the pilferer thanked him Then he went on with his task of taking the back out of the mounting of the Rubens showing that he did not trust his knife with such an ancient and priceless canvas Gladwin was thinking up another ironic opening when the door bell rang He jumped and cried If that s the lady sorr I ll go and let her in No you wait here the other objected She might be frightened at the sight of a policeman you stay here I ll let her in myself and he strode swiftly out into the hallway CHAPTER XXIX IN WHICH THE HERO IS KEPT ON THE HOP Travers Gladwin watched the big handsome mis presentiment of himself disappear into the hallway with every nerve at full strain As he heard the door open then a delighted feminine cry and the unmistakable subtle sound of an embrace he ground his finger nails into his palms and bit his lips Every fibre of him burned with jealous hatred of this impostor If there had been only more of the brute left in the Gladwin strain undoubtedly there would have been a sensational clash between the two men for the benefit of the beautiful young girl who Gladwin strove to acknowledge was the helpless pawn of circumstances But the refinements of blood rob the physical man of his savage resources and impose a serious hamper upon his primordial impulses Helen came into the room with the thief s arm about her waist while Gladwin stood dumbly at attention his features hardened and inscrutable At sight of his uniform and failing to recognize him in his disguise the girl turned pale and uttered a frightened exclamation Don t be alarmed dear the man at her side reassured her smiling down upon her this is only officer He looked up with a laughing expression of inquiry Murphy sorr responded Gladwin through tightly compressed lips Yes the pretender nodded quickly Murphy Officer Murphy my dear looks after my house when I m away He is one of the city s best little watchmen and he is going to see that everything is made safe and secure after we have gone Helen breathed an exclamation of relief but the fright in her eyes lingered as the unconscious feeling struck in that the attitude of the policeman seemed more than a trifle strained She carried a little grip in one hand which the bogus Gladwin took from her and handed to the real Gladwin nodding significantly for him to leave the room Turning to Helen he said But why did you bring the bag dear My man told me he found your trunk at the Grand Central Station Yes Helen answered but auntie insisted that I go to the opera so I had to pack my travelling dress I slipped out of the opera during the entre act and went home to change my gown I was so frightened and in such a dreadful state of nerves that I couldn t A shudder ran through her and she seemed on the point of breaking down when the man with whom she had chosen to elope drew her to him and said with what had every expression of genuine tenderness There there dear Calm yourself Why you re trembling like a leaf There is nothing to be frightened about now She yielded to his embrace and he bent down his head to kiss her on the lips Whatever he projected in the nature of an enduring osculation was spoiled as Gladwin dropped the bag to the floor with a crash The man looked up angrily and the girl gave a frightened cry What s the matter with you officer the thief shot at him Excuse me sorr said Gladwin with mock humility turning away his head to hide his emotions As the girl shrank from his arms the thief switched his attention from Officer six hundred sixty six and led her to a chair resuming his gentle tones He pressed her to sit down saying I am just packing up some pictures I shan t keep you waiting long Now that s good you re getting calmer You re all right now aren t you Ye es Travers dear she responded with an effort looking into his face I shan t break down she went on with a nervous laugh I m stronger than I look I ve made my mind up to it The trouble is that my heart won t behave It s beating terribly just feel it He was about to place his hand on her heart when Gladwin was seized with a paroxysm of coughing The thief straightened up and turned scowlingly upon the young man Say what s the matter with you McCarthy Murphy sorr Gladwin retorted Me throat tickled me Well returned the other sharply if you would move around as I told you your throat wouldn t tickle you Get something to pack these paintings in There isn t anything in this room go upstairs and get a trunk I don t know where there is none sorr Gladwin objected Well look around for one a small empty trunk and be quick about it He spoke with crackling emphasis Stung to the quick by the overbearing insolence of this command it required a prodigious effort for the young man to control his voice He said with difficulty I was thinking sorr suppose the trunk is full The thief squared his broad shoulders and walked threateningly toward Gladwin He stopped directly in front of the young man and said through his teeth slowly and deliberately and without raising his voice If the trunks are full now listen carefully because I want you to understand this if the trunks are full then empty one Do you get my meaning Take the fullness out of it and after you have done that and there is nothing more left in it then bring it down here Now do you think you get my idea clearly Yes sorr said Gladwin dully feeling that there was no way out of the situation for the moment save to obey Strive as he might he could not wholly shake off the influence of this splendid big animal s dominating will power And if it affected him that way he didn t wonder at the spell the man had cast upon the impressionable and sentimental Helen He left the room with a sudden spurt and swiftly mounted the stairs the chief object of his haste being to prevent an extended interview in his absence and a resumption of tender dialogue He had scarcely gone when the spurious Gladwin turned again to the girl with his most engaging smile and softest tones You see dear with a sweeping gesture that included his work of spoilation I am taking your advice packing only the most valuable ones I am afraid Travers said Helen rising from her chair and coming toward him with all her impulsive love and confidence restored that I am giving you a lot of trouble Trouble he cried with the gushing effusiveness of a matinee idol You re bringing a great joy into my life He took her hand and caressed it adding with the true lover s frown of perplexity But are you going to be happy dear That s what you must think of now before it is too late It was a magnificent bluff and carried with deadly aim The girl stopped him passionately We must not stop to talk about that now there isn t time We must hurry dear and get away before auntie finds out and comes after me Do you think she ll come here he asked slowly while his forehead wrinkled I am afraid Sadie will tell her Sadie your cousin H m He made no effort to conceal that he was thinking rapidly Perhaps you d rather postpone it after all Travers she said quickly while the color rushed to her cheeks and her lips trembled If you only thought it best I d like to tell auntie what I m going to do No he retorted We can t do that we ve gone over all this before It must be this way or not at all Which is it to be I ve given you my word you know she said under her breath That s my brave little girl he cried with a burst of feeling reaching out his arm to embrace her Crash Bang Biff Slam Bam There burst into the room Officer six hundred sixty six entangled in the lid and straps of an empty trunk It was a steamer trunk and not very heavy but Travers Gladwin was far from adept in baggage smashing He had wasted so much time in hunting for the trunk that he had sought to make up for the delay by executing what resembled an aeroplane descent At the final twist of the staircase the trunk had mastered him and charged with him into the room As he lay sprawled on the floor with a foolish grin on his face the discomfited lover turned on him with a voice of fury Officer what the deuce is the matter with you The intense savagery of his tone made the girl shrink away from him and turn pale He managed to cover his break so quickly with a forced laugh and an effort to assist Gladwin to his feet that her fear was only momentary In the last stage of his downward flight Gladwin glimpsed that he had dropped in barely in time to spoil another touching scene With a grin of sheer delight he asked Where ll I put the trunk sorr Put it there The self styled Gladwin pointed to the right of the chest and set to work to gather up his few hundred thousand dollars worth of pelf He was about to place the flat packages in the trunk when he turned to Helen and asked Do you see any others that you d like me to take dear Oh you know best she replied Only I should think that you would take some of the miniatures The miniatures he asked raising his eyebrows Yes said the girl They are the loveliest I ve ever seen and they ll hardly take up any room at all If we are going to be away such a long time I think it would be safer to take them It was palpable to Travers Gladwin that the big chap had received a psychic jolt for his hand trembled a little as he laid down the canvases on the top of the chest and addressed the girl I didn t know you d seen the miniatures Oh yes when I was here this afternoon He took this between the eyes without flinching His voice was marvellously steady as he said I didn t know you were here this afternoon You didn t she asked in a puzzled tone How funny You d just gone out when I called but two of your friends were here and one of them showed me the miniatures and china and plate and lots of things Why I left a message for you about the opera didn t they tell you The girl stood with her back to Gladwin and the man she addressed slowly turned his head and glanced over her head with a keen flashing look of inquiry Gladwin lifted his chin a little and met the look without change of expression Didn t they tell you Travers the girl repeated Yes yes they told me he said hastily still maintaining his fixed gaze upon Gladwin There was barely an instant s pause before he spoke Officer kindly go up to my room and see if you can find a bag and pack enough things to last a week or two Yes sorr Gladwin flung out of the room He started noisily up the stairs until he saw that the thief had turned his back to him whereat he vaulted the banister and dropped lightly upon a divan in a recessed niche that could not be seen from the room he left The moment Gladwin vanished the thief turned to Helen and asked sharply What time did you see my friends here A little after five replied the girl recoiling slightly with a look of dismay for there was a new raw edge to the sharpness of his tone Did you tell them about the elopement he said less harshly but with a scarcely veiled eagerness Why they knew all about it Helen hastened to reply searching his face apprehensively Knew about it he mused fairly grinding his brows together under the pressure of his agitated thoughts What did you tell them he queried steadily measuring her fresh young beauty and vowing to himself that whatever struggle impended he was going through with it to the limit of his resources That we were to meet here she answered with increasing fear That we were to meet here he repeated Yes at half past ten oh was it something I shouldn t have told them she cried coming toward him Once more Officer six hundred sixty six snapped the tension He had wriggled around the staircase and found the suitcase Bateato had packed and left for him Hating to play the role of an eavesdropper any longer than necessary he made a flying start and burst into the room CHAPTER XXX GLADWIN COMES OUT OF HIS SHELL What the The spurious aristocrat and art collector suppressed his torrid exclamation The impulse moved him to seize the uniformed butter in and pitch him through the nearest window He was big and powerful enough to do it too In the furious glance he got Travers Gladwin read a warning that in an earlier stage of his career would have made him feel mighty uncomfortable Now he liked the smell of danger and met the message of wrath without a flicker What s that you ve got there the thief having mastered himself asked pointing to the grip Tis the bag you asked for sorr drawled Gladwin I told you to pack it said the other sharply All packed sorr Hunting clothes shirts ties socks He looked up with a boyish grin and the big chap was stumped for a moment The thief said slowly Now take it up to my room and unpack it It was his turn to grin What sorr asked the dismayed Gladwin I shan t want these things after all came the velvety rejoinder Unpack it carefully and bring it back here And kindly be more careful of the stairs when you come down one step at a time please Now what are you waiting for Gladwin withdrew reluctantly stealing a glance at Helen as he sidled through the curtained doorway Her eyes never left the face of the man she thought she loved but whose character was being swiftly revealed to her in a new light That resourceful individual waited only for the blue uniform to pass through the portieres when he sprang forward and reached out on both sides for the heavy mahogany folding doors He brought them together swiftly and softly then ripped down the portieres from the pole flinging one to the left of the door and the other across the chest Now listen Helen he cried seizing her roughly by the shoulder It may be that we will have to get out of here in a hurry W w w hy what s the matter she stammered wincing at the crushing grip of his hand He replied with a swift rush of words that fairly stunned her Your aunt may find it out and try to stop us Now I shall be on the lookout but I want you to do everything I tell you I ll see if the coast is clear in case we have to go out the back way In the meantime I want you to wrap these pictures for me I wouldn t ask you dear only we haven t a minute to wait He darted across the room and opened the narrow door that led into the backstairs corridor Helen stared stupidly after him until he disappeared and then turned toward the chest and went to work wrapping up the precious canvases like one in a trance She had scarcely started when the folding doors opened noiselessly and Bateato stuck in his head Fearing that some harm had come to his master the little Jap had left the Ritz and sprinted all the way to the Gladwin mansion He was breathless and wild eyed yet he had entered the house as silently as a breath of air Peeking into the room Bateato noted the ripped down portieres and devastated picture frames His Oriental mind told him but one thing robbery Seized with a violent spasm of loyalty to his master he brushed into the room and exclaimed Whatz thees Oh hell damn Helen was in too good training by this time to swoon though she wanted to She started back in alarm and exclaimed Oh how you startled me Bateato circled round her like an enraged rat You no fool me I know you tief you steal picture I get pleece much pleece whole big lot pleece quick He headed for the door Helen pursued him crying See here Wait a minute You don t understand mister Gladwin The Jap was gone and the hall door slammed after him before she had reached the folding doors In another instant Travers Gladwin who had been making a vain hunt for a revolver in the upper part of the house came flying down the stairs and assailed the frightened girl with another overwhelming shock Seeing she was alone he threw himself into the breach headlong Miss Helen just a moment I ve been waiting for a chance to speak to you You must get away from here at once Do you understand at once Don t waste time talking go quick while you have a chance You mustn t be mixed up in what s coming The girl felt that her heart would burst with its palpitations of fear but she was incapable of flight Her limbs seemed like leaden weights Some force working without the zone of her mental control made her stammer W w ho are you Listen the young man raced on and you must believe what I say this man you came here to meet and elope with is not Travers Gladwin at all She expressed her horrified disbelief in a frozen stare It s true he pursued passionately He s an imposter The real Travers Gladwin you met here this afternoon He was I that is I was he I mean I am Travers Gladwin only I ve got this uniform on now It is only on your account that I have not caused his arrest and a sensation I can t have you mixed up in a nasty scandal I want to save you don t you see I do but I can t wait much longer I don t believe what you are saying I can t believe it Oh it s too horrible sobbed Helen clinging to a fragment of her shattered idol as a drowning man clings to a straw Gladwin was on the point of resuming his appeal when he sensed a heavy tread He had divined that the picture thief had left the room to reconnoitre emergency exits or to learn whether or not the house was surrounded He had hoped that he might run into Michael Phelan but did not stop to puzzle out why this had not happened Backing to the door he whispered He s coming question him That s all I ask I ll be waiting to see that you get out in safety trust me He wriggled backward and disappeared through the folding doors CHAPTER XXXI A VISIT TO THE EXILED PHELAN But where oh where was the exiled Phelan when the bogus Gladwin went on his backstairs investigation Puzzled as he was by the fast moving events of the night stripped of the uniform of his authority still his police instincts should have warned him of this new character in his dream Michael Phelan however was busy busy in a way one little would suppose As the gentlemanly outlaw entered the kitchen Phelan was standing on the tubs of the adjoining laundry his face almost glued to the window pane and his eyes uplifted to the fourth story rear window of a house diagonally opposite through which he could observe a pantomime that thrilled him It was late well past bedtime even for the aristocratic precincts of New York Yet there was going on behind that brilliantly lighted window a one man drama strangely and grotesquely wide awake A first casual glance had conveyed the impression to Phelan that a tragedy was being enacted before his eyes that murder was being done with fiendish brutality and he Phelan powerless to intervene The seeming murderer was a man of amazing obesity a red faced man with a bull neck and enormous shoulders clad in pink striped pajamas and a tasselled nightcap of flaming red Back and forth the rotund giant swayed with something in his arms something which he crushed in his fists and brutally shook something which he held off at arm s length and hammered with ruthless blows The murtherin baste ejaculated Phelan as he switched off the one light he had been reading by and darted into the next room to get a better view from the summit of the kitchen tubs Suddenly the mountain of flesh and the debile victim that he was ruthlessly manhandling disappeared from view For several long thundering seconds the petrified Phelan could see nothing save a dancing crimson tassel the tassel attached to the nightcap Surely a mighty struggle was going on on the floor Phelan did not hear the light step upon the kitchen stair or the stealthy tread of the big man in evening dress as he pussy footed his way to the kitchen door leading out into the back yard and found that it was easily opened Every sentient nerve in Michael Phelan s being was concentrated in his eyes at that moment and it is highly doubtful if he would have heard a fife and drum corps in full blare enter the kitchen He heard nothing and saw nothing below that upward focal angle The man Phelan should have heard flashed the light in his cane only at infrequent intervals He did not aim its bright revealing beam into the half open door of the adjoining laundry and he was as unconscious of the proximity of Phelan as that unfrocked or de uniformed officer was of the invader He returned to Miss Helen Burton in complete ignorance of the fact that the lower regions of the dwelling were otherwise than empty But the second he re entered the room he saw the girl was strangely agitated and that she feared to look at him Laying down his cane he crossed the room to her side and said in his softest tones Well you haven t got on very fast in your packing have you dear Helen was leaning against the back of a chair feeling she was surely going to topple over in a swoon Summoning all her reserve of nerve power she strove to reply naturally No I I didn t quite understand how to pack He was at her side now and seized both her hands Why Helen what s the matter Your hands are cold as ice He spoke warmly and tenderly while at the same time his eyes were everywhere about the room and he was listening with the wary alertness of a rodent There was more than a little of the rat in the soul inclosed in this splendid envelope It s nothing only I m faint she said tremulously That policeman has been talking to you hasn t he he said quietly Yes he has she blurted with a catch in her throat Did he tell you who he was He measured out each word and conveyed the sense Did he tell you who he pretended to be Yes the girl responded scarcely above a whisper He took her by the shoulders and turned her squarely toward him looking down into her face with frowning eyes Now Helen I want you to tell me the truth the truth you understand I shall know it even if you don t Who did he say he was A feeling of repugnance took possession of the girl and she shook herself free and stood back Her body had warmed into life again and she looked steadily into his eyes as she answered Travers Gladwin He needed all his great bulk of flesh and steel fibred nerve to fend off this shock Not the remotest fancy had crossed his mind that Travers Gladwin might be in New York It was with a palpably forced laugh that he ejaculated Travers Gladwin Oh he did eh The girl had read more than he imagined the sudden contraction of his features and dilation of his eyes had revealed I want you to tell me the truth you must she said passionately Who are you A man who loves you he let go impulsively The desire to possess her had sprung uppermost in his mind again But are you the man you pretended to be are you Travers Gladwin she insisted compelled against her convictions to grope for a forlorn hope And if I were not he cried with all the dramatic intensity he could bring to voice If instead of being the son of a millionaire a pampered molly coddle who never earned a dollar in his life suppose I were a man who had to fight every inch of the way He stopped His alert ear had caught a sound in the hallway He sped noiselessly to the folding door and forced one back revealing Officer Murphy Come in he said threateningly and Gladwin came in a little way Where s that bag said the thief with a glare and a suggestive movement with his hands What bag sorr said Gladwin feeling that for the moment discretion was the better part of valor The one you brought in here You told me to unpack it sorr It s upstairs sorr Go and get it Go now and don t waste time Gladwin went determined this time that he must arm himself with some weapon even if it were one of the rusted old bowie knives of his grandfather that ornamented the wall of his den He estimated accurately that he would prove a poor weak reed in the hands of that Hercules in evening dress and while the thought of a knife sickened him he was impelled to seek one As he mounted the stairs the thief strode to the table near the window and gathered up Helen s opera cloak and handed it to her Now go quickly he urged my car is just across the street There is no time to argue your absurd suspicions No I shan t go retorted Helen accepting the cloak and backing away So you believe that man he asked reproachfully I am afraid I do she said firmly Then I ll show you mighty quick you re wrong he cried as a crowning bluff He s probably some spy sent by your aunt I ll get my man in here and will have him arrested after you and I have gone Wait here I shan t be a moment As the door slammed after him Helen ran to the window and then back to the door She was now terribly alarmed on another score She feared to go out and she feared to remain in the house She feared physically feared violence Travers Gladwin had found the bowie knife and slipped it into his trousers pocket Then he had gone down the stairs on the run As he entered the room and saw that the man had gone he said Is he running away and without his pictures or his hat and coat What s his game I wonder He s coming back he says my aunt sent you here said Helen but less afraid at his return to the room Never mind what he says Gladwin returned gesturing excitedly You must go home now To morrow you can learn the truth But if I go out he ll be sure to see me she protested Gladwin looked about him and thought a moment Do you see that little alcove back of the stairs he said quickly pointing Helen crossed the room and nodded Well hide in there he commanded The curtains will conceal you If he and his man come back I ll get them in this room then I ll press this button see He indicated a button and added That rings a buzzer you can hear it from the alcove and then slip out the front door The girl paused but an instant then fled to the place of shelter

none	none	IN WHICH BLUFF IS TRUMPS 
2156_25563_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Having disposed of the girl for the moment Travers Gladwin decided it was time to call Michael Phelan to his assistance 
2156_25563_000004_000001	train-clean-360	There was no telling what this amazing crook might do now 
2156_25563_000004_000002	train-clean-360	He was too much for him That a thief and impostor could possess such superhuman nerve had never occurred to his untutored mind 
2156_25563_000004_000003	train-clean-360	He was a perfect dub to have let the situation reach such a stage of complexity though the one thought uppermost in his mind was to save Helen from public ridicule and contempt 
none	none	He had reasoned it out that just the uniform of Officer six hundred sixty six would serve him almost as a magician s wand 
2156_25563_000005_000001	train-clean-360	He had almost counted on the thief taking one craven look at his constabulary disguise and then leaping through the window fleeing like a wolf in the night he Travers Gladwin remaining a veritable hero of romance to sooth and console Helen and gently break the news to her that she had been the dupe of an unscrupulous criminal 
2156_25563_000005_000002	train-clean-360	Instead of which he ground his teeth went to the little panel door and shouted Phelan s name 
none	none	missus Phelan s son came a running 
2156_25563_000007_000000	train-clean-360	He had been on his way 
none	none	The vast girthed individual in the pink striped pajamas and tasselled nightcap had accomplished his awful purpose but the climax had been anti climax and Phelan had ground his teeth in rage 
2156_25563_000008_000000	train-clean-360	He had been on the point of bursting through the window and somehow scrambling aloft to the rescue of that helpless being who was being ground and wrenched and pounded by that porcine monster when the monster suddenly rose to view again with a dumb bell in each hand 
none	none	The jaw of Officer six hundred sixty six slowly dropped as he watched the manipulation of the dumb bells 
2156_25563_000009_000001	train-clean-360	There was no passion in the stodgy movements of the great paddy arms 
2156_25563_000009_000002	train-clean-360	Even so far away as he was Phelan could see that the man puffed and blew and that his vigor was slowly waning 
2156_25563_000009_000003	train-clean-360	Then suddenly the huge man stooped and held up in plain view a dangling wrestling dummy 
2156_25563_000010_000000	train-clean-360	The lone watcher swallowed a savage oath 
none	none	Sure twas exercisin an not murther he was doin Phelan hissed through his teeth 
2156_25563_000012_000000	train-clean-360	His anger was white hot 
2156_25563_000012_000001	train-clean-360	Again he had been the victim of delusion and had wasted heroic emotions on a stuffed dummy that served merely as an inanimate instrument in a course of anti fat calisthenics 
none	none	Every nerve in Phelan s body was fairly a bristle as he made his way upstairs and burst into the great drawing room and picture gallery Fer the love o hivin he cried give me me uniform and let me out o here
2156_25563_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 Here s your uniform I ve had enough of it replied Gladwin throwing him the coat and cap and get into it quick 
2156_25563_000015_000001	train-clean-360	There s work for you right in this house 
2156_25563_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 There is not nor play neither snapped Phelan 
none	none	I ve got to go out and chase up a drunk or throw a faint or git run over or somethin desperate to square mesilf with the captain 
2156_25563_000016_000002	train-clean-360	I m an hour overdue at the station 
2156_25563_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 You ll square yourself with the captain all right if you just do what I tell you said Gladwin eagerly helping him on with his coat and pushing him toward the window recess 
none	none	You go right in there behind those curtains and wait till I call you 
2156_25563_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Phelan took one look at the young man s face and muttered as he obeyed 
2156_25563_000018_000001	train-clean-360	 This must be a hell of a joke 
none	none	And just then the thief breezed in again jerking back on his heels as he caught sight of Gladwin sans uniform sans moustache and sans eyebrows 
2156_25563_000019_000001	train-clean-360	But a glance at that young man meant volumes and there was no limit to his spontaneous resources 
2156_25563_000019_000002	train-clean-360	He summoned a laugh and jerked out 
2156_25563_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh so you ve resigned from the force 
2156_25563_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes retorted Gladwin and let me tell you that this little excursion of yours has gone far enough 
2156_25563_000021_000001	train-clean-360	I ll give you one chance get away from here as quickly as you can 
2156_25563_000022_000000	train-clean-360	The big fellow curled one corner of his lip in a contemptuous smile then glanced about him quickly and asked 
2156_25563_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Where s the young lady 
2156_25563_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Never mind the young lady Gladwin flung back at him 
2156_25563_000024_000001	train-clean-360	 It was only on her account that I let you go as far as this 
2156_25563_000024_000002	train-clean-360	Now get out and keep away from that young lady and drop my name 
none	none	The sneering smile returned and balancing himself easily as he looked down on Gladwin he said
2156_25563_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Easy son easy 
2156_25563_000026_000001	train-clean-360	I don t like to have little boys talk to me like that and turning to the doorway behind him he beckoned 
2156_25563_000026_000002	train-clean-360	The obedient Watkins sidled in and stopped with head averted from Gladwin who started with surprise at seeing him 
2156_25563_000027_000000	train-clean-360	Stepping forward and making sure there could be no mistake Gladwin turned to the thief and exclaimed 
none	none	Oh now I understand how you knew all about my house 
2156_25563_000028_000001	train-clean-360	This is what I get for not sending this man to jail where he belonged 
2156_25563_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t bother with him Watkins snarled the big fellow as he noted his companion s complexion run through three shades of yellow 
2156_25563_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 There s no time to bother with him he went on and reaching out he caught Travers Gladwin by the shoulder and whirled him half way across the room 
2156_25563_000031_000000	train-clean-360	The young man spun half a dozen times as he reeled across the carpet and he had to use both hands to stop himself against a big onyx table As he pulled himself up standing he saw that Watkins had lifted the trunk on his shoulders and was headed for the hallway 
2156_25563_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Phelan he gasped out 
none	none	Here quick Officer six hundred sixty six came out with the snort and rush of a bull
2156_25563_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 Stop that man cried the thief pointing to Watkins he s trying to get out of here with a trunkful of pictures 
2156_25563_000035_000000	train-clean-360	The man s hair trigger mind had thought this out before Phelan was half way round the table 
2156_25563_000035_000001	train-clean-360	One lightning glance at the thickness of the patrolman s neck and the general contour of his rubicund countenance had translated to him the sort of man he had to deal with 
none	none	Here here put down that trunk spluttered Phelan brandishing his club at Watkins 
2156_25563_000036_000001	train-clean-360	Watkins dropped the trunk and at a signal from his companion was gone 
2156_25563_000036_000002	train-clean-360	Swiftly and silently as he vanished he could not have been half way to the door before the thief urged Phelan 
2156_25563_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Quick go after that man he s a thief 
2156_25563_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Stop Phelan cried Gladwin who had begun to see through the pantomime 
2156_25563_000038_000001	train-clean-360	 They re both thieves 
2156_25563_000039_000000	train-clean-360	Phelan tried to run four ways at once 
none	none	W w what he gurgled
2156_25563_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 It s a trick to get you out of the house said Gladwin with his eyes on the big man who was calmly smiling and who had fully made up his mind on a magnificent game of bluff 
2156_25563_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 What the blazes kind of a joke is this blurted Phelan looking from one to the other in utter bewilderment 
2156_25563_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 You ll find it s no joke officer said the bogus Gladwin sharply not if he gets away 
2156_25563_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 You ll find it s not so funny yourself cut in the real Gladwin Then to Phelan Arrest this man Phelan 
2156_25563_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 Do you mean it asked the astonished Phelan sizing up the thief as the highest example of aristocratic elegance he had ever seen in the flesh 
none	none	Of course I mean it Gladwin shot back
2156_25563_000046_000001	train-clean-360	 Look out for him there he goes for the window 
2156_25563_000047_000000	train-clean-360	The thief had started in that direction but his purpose was not escape 
2156_25563_000047_000001	train-clean-360	The idea had flashed upon him that Helen might be concealed there 
none	none	Phelan headed him off whereupon the thief said severely in a tone that was far more convincing that Gladwin s most passionate sincerity
2156_25563_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Now be careful officer or you ll get yourself into a lot of trouble 
none	none	Don t let him bluff you Phelan cautioned Gladwin
2156_25563_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 You bet your life I won t Phelan answered though he was already bluffed 
none	none	I ll stick close to yez he faltered inching uncertainly toward the thief 
2156_25563_000051_000000	train-clean-360	He had come close enough for that astute individual to make out that he wore the same uniform young Gladwin had been masquerading in and he made capital of this on the instant 
2156_25563_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 How do you think it is going to look he said impressively if I prove that you ve tried to help a band of thieves rob this house 
none	none	A band of thieves Phelan s jaw dropped wide open He s lying to you cried Gladwin
2156_25563_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 I said a band of thieves insisted the thief 
2156_25563_000055_000001	train-clean-360	 Why he s got his pals hidden all over the house 
2156_25563_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 I tell you he s lying to you Gladwin cut in frantically seeing that Phelan was falling under the spell of the big man s superb bluff and at the same time remembering Helen and pressing the button in the wall to warn her that the time had come for her to flee 
none	none	We re the only ones in this house Gladwin pursued as Phelan gave him the benefit of his pop eyes before he yielded them again to the stronger will
2156_25563_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 Then they ve all escaped said the thief easily thrusting his hands in his pockets to help out his appearance of imperturbability 
2156_25563_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 You let one go out Phelan and there were two others beside this one 
none	none	The buttons on Phelan s coat were fairly undulating with the emotions that stirred within him 
2156_25563_000060_000001	train-clean-360	In his seething gray matter there stirred the remembrance that Bateato had told him that women were robbing the house 
2156_25563_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 You mean the women he said ignoring Gladwin and addressing the thief 
2156_25563_000061_000001	train-clean-360	 I remember when the little Japanaze called me oft me beat he said there was women crooks here too 
2156_25563_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 He s lying to you Phelan persisted Gladwin though with less vehemence a great feeling of relief having visited him in the belief that Helen had made her escape 
2156_25563_000062_000001	train-clean-360	 You can have the whole place searched just as soon as you ve got this man where he can t get away 
none	none	There are no women here This last declaration had scarcely passed his lips when a woman s voice raised in hysterical protest was audible in the hallway CHAPTER XXXIII BATEATO SUMMONS BIG MUCH POLICE A vitagraph film of Bateato s journey to and from the police station would consist of a series of dark brown blurs If you have ever noticed a mouse in full flight you will have some idea of how that Jap ran He knew where the police station was too for he had been there once when his brother Itchi Comia was arrested for assaulting a Russian peddler If the little Jap had only coursed through another street things might have gone somewhat differently in the Gladwin household for he would have encountered Whitney Barnes hurrying in the opposite direction and that young man would very likely have prevented him from going to the station But there was absolutely no obstacle in Bateato s way until he reached the station house and the only obstacle he encountered there was a serious impediment in his speech Police Captain Stone had returned to barracks a few minutes after the departure of Barnes and a few minutes before the arrival of Bateato He was standing beside the lieutenant s chair when the Jap sped in and he seemed almost interested for a police captain at the extraordinary manifestations of emotion in Bateato s countenance All pleece quick robbers thieves ladies began Bateato then paused and made wild jabs above his head with his hands Crazy as a nut said the lieutenant in an undertone to the captain and the captain nodded All pictures thieves steal ladies was Bateato s second instalment and the captain and lieutenant looked at each other and shook their heads Big much pleece shrieked Bateato made some more motions with his hands and rushed out into the street It s Jap whiskey said the captain musingly utterly unimpressed He isn t crazy That Jap whiskey s awful stuff They licked the Russian army on it He ll run it off If you ever see a Jap runnin you ll know what s the matter Bateato ran a block and then stopped Hell damn he exploded I no tell where house He ran back to the station and burst in again with even more precipitation I no tell house he rattled off mister Gladwin Travers Gladwin Big lot white house Fifth avenue eighty eighty eighty Quick thieves ladies and he was gone again before Captain Stone could remove his cigar from his face The captain looked at the lieutenant and the lieutenant looked at the captain Maybe he ain t drunk Captain ventured the lieutenant There s that Gladwin house on the books It s marked closed and there s a note about a million dollar collection of paintings The captain thought a moment and then burst into action Call the reserves and get the patrol wagon he shouted I remember that Jap I guess there s something doing I ll go myself As the reserves were all asleep and the horses had to be hitched to the patrol wagon Bateato had a big start of his big much pleece Notwithstanding the breathless condition in which he had arrived at the station house his return journey was accomplished at his dizziest speed Also he arrived back at the house way in advance of Whitney Barnes There was a reason Wearing a frock coat and a silk hat and carrying a cane of course he called it stick one is hardly equipped for marathoning And if you must know more Whitney s small clothes were too fashionably tight to permit of more than a swift heel and toe action At this he was doing admirably in his passionate haste to return and warn his friend Gladwin when another woman came into his life and appealed for succor Three in one evening when he was perfectly satisfied to stop at one the bewitching Sadie No three was of an entirely different type from No one and No two and happily for Whitney there was no yowling bundle this time merely a cat and a silent cat at that She was a plump little woman and rather comely and she was intensely excited for the cat in the case was hers and the cat was up the only tree on that street east of Central Park At the foot of the tree sat a large bulldog gazing fixedly up at the cat Whitney Barnes was so occupied with his heel and toe pace that he did not descry the woman or the dog or the tree or the cat until the woman seized him by the arm and cried You must save my darling Zaza from that dog Then she tailed off into hysterical sobs but did not release her grip Madam I m in great haste retorted Barnes striving to wriggle free from her grip I would advise you to call a policeman There is no policeman sobbed the distressed mistress of Zaza Oh you m m m must s s s save my Z z z z z z z z z aza Oo oo Then Barnes glimpsed the dog and its fang filled grin as it stared up at the cat You don t expect me to tackle that dog he asked backing away and making another effort to free himself Shoot him do anything to him insisted the distressed female Oo oo oo he kills cats Do something quick or I must scream Whitney Barnes would have welcomed an open manhole to vanish into If that woman screamed and held fast to him till the police came it would be just as bad as the baby case But if he tackled the dog he would probably go to the hospital and be afflicted with hydrophobia and all sorts of things Calm yourself my dear woman he said frantically The dog cannot climb the tree and your cat is perfectly safe Are y y y you s s s sure she moaned Then grabbing him tighter But you must not leave me In case the dog should go up that tree you must attack it with your cane I promise panted Barnes if you will only release your grip on my arm Your finger nails are tearing the flesh I w w w will not hold you so tight she consented but I must hold on to you till somebody comes Oh look at that brute He is biting the tree He But the sudden clangor of a patrol wagon and the hammering of steel shod hoofs on the cobbles caused the owner of Zaza both to cease her shrill lamentations and let go of Whitney Barnes s arm The patrol wagon was rolling down behind them at a furious pace while its gong rent the stillness of the night as a warning to all crooks and criminals to beware and to scurry to shelter It is the New York brass band method of thief hunting and if that patrol wagon gong hadn t broken before the vehicle had crossed Madison avenue the destinies of several prominent personages might have been seriously hampered in their headlong fling That gong kept blaring its clang of warning long enough to frighten off the dog and restore Whitney Barnes to freedom and once released from the bruising grip of that distraught little woman he turned his back upon Zaza s fate and ran he ran so long as he considered it feasible to maintain the integrity of his trousers That is he ran not quite a block then dropped back to his heel and toe exercise and swiftly ate up the distance that separated him from Travers Gladwin s home CHAPTER XXXIV PHELAN LOSES HIS BRIBE It was merely a coincidence that Bateato should drag Helen back into the room just as Gladwin had gone on record with the declaration There are no women here but it was a sufficiently dramatic coincidence to jar from Officer No six hundred sixty six the exclamation Where the divil are they all springin from Bateato had come up with Helen as she was descending the stoop had seized her by the wrist and almost swung her off her feet as he swept her back into the house and rounded her up before the three men dumb with fright and barely able to stand Still gripping her wrist Bateato let go the Maxim volley You tief She try get away but Bateato catch fast she tief I see steal all pictures she Bateato you idiot his master hurled at him with a menacing gesture that caused the little Jap to drop the girl s hand and jump back Didn t I tell you to stay at the hotel continued Gladwin fiercely for the moment ignoring both Phelan and the thief Yes but I fraid much late you no come Bateato come back see girl steal all pictures The little Jap had fallen into Phelan s state of blind bewilderment Shut up his master snapped him up walking up to him with an eat em alive expression And now listen I don t want you to say anything more understand Not a word to anybody about anything Not a syllable I no spick bleated the Jap See that you don t not a single word if you do I ll skin you Never in the three years he had served the young man had Bateato seen him in anything like this savage state of mind I spick no more for noting not nobody quick he promised and his hand clasped over his mouth like a vise Having corked Bateato in this wise Gladwin turned to Helen who stood as if rooted to the floor staring straight ahead of her Don t be frightened he said gently Everything is all right He took her arm to reassure her and then spoke to Phelan who had been making a vain effort to solve the mix up and didn t feel quite sure that he wasn t bewitched Now Phelan said Gladwin I ll explain the thing I wish to God ye would said Phelan from the bottom of his heart This lady s being here is all right and she isn t connected with this affair in any way I ll prove that to you readily enough Well go ahead And Phelan crossed his eyes in an effort to include in the focus both Gladwin and the thief de luxe whose splendidly groomed appearance impressed him the more On his part the thief was leaning carelessly against a cabinet looking on with the expression of one both amused and bored What he had noticed most was that Helen kept her eyes averted from him as if she feared to look at him and that she had palpably transferred her allegiance to Gladwin When she had recovered some of her self control she followed that young man s words eagerly and obeyed his slightest signal I will explain to you Phelan as soon as I see this young lady started for home Gladwin ran on and proceeded with Helen toward the entrance to the hallway Hold on Yez ll not leave this room Phelan stopped them his suspicions again in a state of conflagration But I only want I don t care what yez want Phelan snorted blocking the way Yez ll stay here Oh well just as you say returned the young man desperately but I will have to ask my man to escort this lady out and put her in a taxicab Bateato Bad Pertaters ll stay where he is Phelan was visibly swelling with the majesty of the law You re very disagreeable Gladwin charged him then to Helen I m awfully sorry I cannot go with you but I think you can find the way yourself Just go out through the hall and She ll stay right here with the rest o yez was Phelan s ultimatum as he squared himself in the doorway with the heroic bearing of a bridge defending Horatius The only member of that tense little tableau who really had anything to fear from the spectre of the law embodied in the person of Officer six hundred sixty six had waited for Gladwin to play his poor hand and conceiving that this was the psychological moment sauntered across the room and said with easy assurance Officer if there s anything further you want of me you ll have to be quick Yez ll wait here too till I can communicate with headquarters Phelan gave him back not liking the tone of command Then hurry up because it won t go well with you if I am detained Now don t yez threaten me exploded Phelan I m doin me duty by the book Threaten you Why I can show you that you have been helping to rob my house This was a new current of thought a sudden inspiration but this peer of bluffers managed to crowd a volume of accusation in the slow emphasis with which he said it Your house gasped Phelan rocked clear off the firm base he had scarcely planted himself on What do ye mean who are yez Who do you suppose I am Travers Gladwin of course Even the fear numbed Helen Burton was startled into animation by this amazingly nervy declaration and half rose from the chair she had been guided to and forced into by Gladwin when she seemed on the verge of swooning at Phelan s refusal to permit her to depart Phelan expressed wonder and alarm in every feature and his arms flopped limply at his side as he muttered Travers Gladwin youse Don t listen to him Phelan cried Gladwin Shut up Phelan turned on him When I came home to night the thief pressed his advantage this man was here robbing my house dressed in your uniform yes and you yourself were helping him But I didn t know whined the distressed Phelan yielding himself utterly to the toils of the master prevaricator I don t think you did it intentionally but why did you do it the thief let him down with a little less severity of emphasis He said he wanted to play a joke He he Oh don t be an idiot Phelan interposed Gladwin putting his foot in it at the wrong time and receiving as his reward from the policeman a savage Close your face Oh playing a joke was he said the thief smiling And did he offer you money Now no evasion you had better tell me Yes sir gulped Phelan with murder in one eye for the real Gladwin and craven apology in the other for the impostor And you took it sharply Yes sir Oh officer Shame Shame in tones of shocked reproach Let me see what he gave you come now it s your only chance Phelan hesitated gulped some more and at last produced the bill The thief took it from his trembling but unresisting hand unfurled it turned it over held it up close to his eyes and suddenly laughed Well you certainly are easy counterfeit What roared Phelan and Travers Gladwin joined him in the exclamation Will you swear that man gave you this bill cut in the thief sharply snatching out a pencil and marking the gold certificate across the corner I will sorr shouted Phelan I will an Very well Now you see this mark in the corner will you be able to identify it Yes sorr Phelan was fairly grovelling Good said the thief and nonchalantly shoved the bill into his waistcoat pocket See here Phelan protested Gladwin Kape your mouth shut I d just like to take wan punch at yez Phelan meant it and took a step toward Gladwin when the thief stopped him and asked Now officer is there anything I can do for you Thank you mister Gladwin I got to get the patrol wagon here some way If Bateato had entered into an inflexible contract with himself not to utter another syllable before the break of day at least he might have eased Phelan s mind on that score and informed him that something ominously like a patrol wagon was rounding the corner at that moment And if the art collector had not been so keenly amused at his facile conquest of the gullible bluecoat his alert ears might have warned him to say something entirely different from this I d call the wagon for you officer only I m afraid these people might overpower you and get away with that trunk of pictures You see what a nice mess they ve been making of my picture gallery Why if I hadn t happened in to night they would have walked off with half a million dollars worth of paintings You call the wagon mister Gladwin returned Phelan grimly I kin handle the lot of o them an ten more like them All right officer but be very careful I shan t be long And turning with a mocking bow to Travers Gladwin he sauntered out into the hallway and walked into the arms of Police Captain Stone and ten reserves CHAPTER XXXV BATEATO KEEPS HIS PROMISE Although the escaping thief was brushed back into the room rather rudely and Travers Gladwin cried out as he caught sight of the uniformed officer and his men By Jove captain I m glad you ve come the consummate bluffer did not bat an eyelash or manifest the merest symptom of fear stepping easily to one side and watching for the coming of his cue with feline alertness For a moment Captain Stone devoted himself only to the distribution of his men posting them at all the windows and doors When he was satisfied that every avenue of escape was covered he turned to Phelan with the sharp query What s all this Phelan I caught them trying to get away with mister Gladwin s Yes it was by the luckiest chance broke in Travers Gladwin Is this mister Gladwin the captain stopped him curtly No the other one captain replied Phelan indicating the thief whereupon that gentleman bowed Why captain I m the real Gladwin started again You ve done well here Phelan the captain complimented him ignoring the young millionaire Thank ye sorr blushed Phelan I should say he has done well The thief came forward with an approving nod toward the now ecstatic Officer six hundred sixty six If it hadn t been for him pursued the thief these thieves would have carried off my pictures I would suggest captain that he be properly rewarded Thank ye sorr Phelan s voice shook with gratitude I ll see that he gets full credit in my report said Captain Stone stiffly Now Phelan you go to the station for the patrol wagon I sent it back as one of the horses threw a shoe and got a bad fall Tell the driver to get another horse at Murphy s stable and hurry back Yes sorr Phelan went out walking on air and humming to himself Sergt Michael Phelan no less utterly forgetful of the sorry plight he was in not a half hour before Travers Gladwin was almost beside himself with chagrin Again he made an impassioned plea to be heard Now see here Captain I am Travers Gladwin Oh you are eh sneered the captain scarcely deigning to look at him Well we ll see about that Where is the little Jap who notified me of this Bateato had concealed himself behind a heavy piece of furniture and was yanked out into the open by a burly policeman Here you growled the captain shaking his hand at the Jap you re mister Gladwin s servant you said which one of these men is your master Bateato locked his teeth together and refused even to smile Which is your master Answer me demanded Captain Stone The poor little devil is frightened to death interposed the thief with a commiserating nod toward the Jap He was playing his bluff to the limit What scared him like that asked the captain Oh this gang here some of the others got away threatened to kill him Now look here Captain broke in Gladwin making furious yet vain gestures at Bateato Silence Captain Stone cut him off again I admire this chap s nerve Captain laughed the thief It s monumental He very nearly succeeded in bluffing Officer Phelan but I guess you can take care of him all right I must hurry off and get an expert to repair the damage done to these valuable paintings Of course you ll leave a man or two on guard Once more he gathered up his stick and overcoat and once more his exit was blocked this time by Whitney Barnes It was only natural for that young man to misread the situation and conceive that missus Elvira Burton had succeeded in her object of arresting his friend So he blurted breathlessly By Jove Travers I see I m too late I ve been all over the city trying to warn you I knew the police were on your track Who the devil are you Captain Stone cut in on him Another of the gang responded the thief promptly He s got some story trumped up that he thinks will get him off Well we ll let him tell it then and you indicating the thief had better wait and hear it There was something in the thief s manner that had fired a spark of suspicion in the officer s mind Not a word about the girl Travers managed to whisper to Barnes in the moment Captain Stone had turned to address the thief I won t Barnes was replying when the Captain flung round on him Stop that whispering and come over here where I can get a good look at you Which one of these men is the real Gladwin He is of course Barnes nodded toward his friend The truth of the situation had at last dawned upon him The thief smiled at Captain Stone and shook his head as if in compliment of the nerve of some criminals H m said the captain turning to Barnes again And when did you find out that there was some one else who claimed to be Travers Gladwin Why replied Barnes briskly when Gladwin and I were here together this afternoon The doorbell rang and two His friend shook a vigorous warning Barnes stopped Yes and two what Well you see the doorbell rang Yes you said that snapped Captain Stone The doorbell rang and two Yes and two minutes after that it rang again rang in an extraordinary kind of way you know as if whoever was ringing it was ringing it because because they wanted to come in come in in a hurry you see Well I went to the door Why did you go to the door demanded Captain Stone Well you see the bell rang Don t go back to that again Why did you go to the door Well I can t at this minute remember exactly but I m under the impression I went to to find out who was ringing the bell just like that as it were That s enough of you snorted Captain Stone Ryan to one of his men take this one and slip the nippers on him See here Captain I can explain this Travers Gladwin essayed again as he saw his friend struggling in the grip of a blue coated giant and spluttering his protests against being handcuffed You can t explain anything to me was the best he got from Captain Stone During this spirited dialogue the thief had gone to the side of Helen Burton who had remained motionless where she had risen from her chair playing the part of a helpless victim in the seemingly hopeless tangle Now then Helen he said to her in his old tone of endearment we can go You see where this impostor stands With you no There was no mistaking the uncompromising emphasis of her denial Captain Stone set out to distribute his prisoners motioning to one policeman to take care of Gladwin and to another to look after the Jap who would be needed as a witness He came last to Helen just as she had repulsed the man she was to have eloped with that night Captain Stone had had experience enough with women to be able to distinguish between types He was on the point of ordering another of his men to take charge of Helen when he paused and studied her more closely His men were starting for the door with their prisoners when he signalled them to stop Wait he said I wish to question this lady He turned to Helen when there came swiftly into the room Lieutenant Detective Kearney of the Central Office Kearney was every inch a Central Office man and had been long enough at Headquarters to lose the heavy bovine set of the man who pounds the pavement A strapping big fellow with graying hair and a pair of round bullet eyes that searched you with needle points his very appearance was sufficient corroboration of all the thrilling stories the newspapers printed of his skill and courage Hello Kearney What do you want Captain Stone addressed him as he stopped in the doorway and surveyed the remarkable scene before him I m looking for Travers Gladwin replied the detective shortly I m Travers Gladwin spoke up the thief easily but holding his head so that Kearney could see only the profile That s my name exclaimed Travers Gladwin in the same breath with the impostor Kearney looked from one to the other fairly pistolling his scrutiny Oh both of you named Travers Gladwin he asked with a puzzled expression That one s a fake interposed Captain Stone pointing to the real Gladwin This nodding toward the impostor is the real Travers Gladwin Kearney s face showed no more expression than if it had been cut for a cameo but when the thief asked him with perfect self command What can I do for you he came on into the room and stopped directly in front of him I have a warrant for your arrest he said abruptly and stuck his hand in his pocket for the document My arrest For what said the thief with a beautifully feigned amazement and a little laugh of incredulity Cradle snatching abduction jerked out Kearney unfolding the paper That is rich laughed the thief I got the warrant from Kearney stopped and his little bullet eyes went to work on the thief from the ground up He was measuring every inch of the man with an eye that had been trained for years to keep tabs on a multitude of marked and measured men Would you mind coming over here a step or two closer mister Gladwin he said tensely The thief stepped toward him and directly under the electrolier while the others in the room stood like statues looking on As Kearney continued his searching examination of the unflinching and still smiling man whose head was on a level with his and whose body was every inch as big and well set up Captain Stone broke in nervously What is it Kearney I think there s some mistake sir said the detective grimly Are you sure this man is Travers Gladwin You seem to be in some doubt about it said the thief dropping his thumbs in the pockets of his waistcoat and raising his chin a little Whatever was going on inside him his eyes were twinkling with amusement I am Kearney retorted then to Captain Stone What is this case Captain Picture robbery Picture robbery I was sure of it You ve made a mistake Captain I know this man The sentences came out like a succession of pistol shots while his eyes never left the face of the thief I know you he attacked the smile again It was a bullet proof smile and never wavered Well who is he interrupted the real Travers Gladwin eagerly He s the greatest picture expert in the world You flatter me said the thief with a bow and a side glance at Helen Burton who was gazing at him as if both fascinated and repelled You admit it then said Kearney roughly unable to disguise the triumph he felt at this identification of a man he had never seen before I am not so egotistical the other bowed but I will go along with you with pleasure and see what you are able to prove Are you sure about this Kearney asked Captain Stone still doubting and hating to admit he had been led into an egregious blunder Certain retorted the detective He s been fooling them on the other side for several years but they nearly got him in Scotland Yard two months ago I got a full report on him from his straight eyebrows and gray eyes down to the cut of his vest with picture and measurement attached His real name is Alf Wilson there were a hundred men on his trail but he made a getaway I don t suppose there s any use trying to deny all this now said Wilson without the slightest change of tone shoving his hands into his trousers pockets and lifting his head in contemplation of the pictures on the wall Not the slightest returned the detective snatching a pair of handcuffs from his coat pocket Wait just a moment officer interrupted Travers Gladwin I d like to ask this man one question Delighted cried the picture expert turning and showing all his teeth in a mocking smile Travers Gladwin pointed to the portrait of The Blue Boy How did you know I bought that picture in London upon certain misrepresentations I was the man behind the gun think it over He swung round to face the spurious Gainsborough As he did so something caught his eye and he moved toward the portrait Gladwin followed and inquired But you not only knew it was a fake but when I bought it and what I paid for it I knew about it came the jaunty reply because I painted it He moved another step nearer the painting as Gladwin gasped Yes he went on lightly running his hand along the bottom of the frame according to this gentleman and he nodded over his shoulder to Kearney who had kept pace with him backing to cover the doorway your Blue Boy was painted by the greatest picture expert in the world As the last word came laughingly from his lips the room was plunged in darkness CHAPTER XXXVI REPARTEE AND A REVOLVER MUZZLE The inky blackness fell upon the room with palpable suddenness like a blinding flash numbing for a moment the senses of all who had been taken by surprise The reflex of the shock was manifested in a very babel of incoherent shouts jostlings and stumblings and sharp collisions with the furniture Turn up the lights shouted Captain Stone amid the tumult Travers Gladwin made a blind dive toward the wall and stumbled headlong over the great antique chest which stood to one side of where he and the thief had stood contemplating The Blue Boy In stumbling against the chest he felt something that was a revelation to him by the time he found the switch button and brought back a flood of light Quick men cover the doors don t let any one get out yelled Captain Stone pivoting on his heel as his eyes vainly sought the picture expert He s gone cried Kearney Yes up the stairs I hear him yelled Gladwin There are two back stairways and the roof There are two basement exits post your men out there and down through that hallway on the left the panel door that leads to the kitchen Barnes you and Bateato take the young lady up to my study quick I ll look after this room The most remarkable thing about it was that every command the young man shouted was obeyed Even Kearney was fooled and rushed headlong up the stairs followed by two policemen and Barnes who was yelling Hey come back here and unlock me How can I hunt that chap with these handcuffs on He might as well have appealed to the moon Bateato fairly dragged Helen up the stairs after him and guided her to the magnificently furnished study and den to the right of the staircase when he switched on the lights and became furiously active in the interest of the young girl s comfort Captain Stone had rushed out into the street and posted men on the stoop and at the basement exits then followed by the last lone patrolman of his squad he darted through the alley at the side of the mansion which led to the rear yard The emptying of the room was accomplished in a few seconds whereupon Gladwin hastened to the doorway reached for the folding doors and hauled them to fastening the latch Next he shut the door to the kitchen hallway and fastened that when with a sigh of relief he walked to the long carved oak table that flanked the window hoisted himself on it produced his gold cigarette case took out a cigarette set fire to it snapped the case and returned it to his pocket While he inhaled a deep breath of stimulating smoke his eyes were fixed upon the great chest directly in front of him He was sitting easily on the table kicking his legs and he continued just in that attitude when the lid of the chest lifted a few inches and a small brilliantly nickelled revolver came out and covered him I m waiting for yez Misther Gladwin chuckled the young man By some strange psychologic freak he was not in the least dismayed by the ominous menace of that shining muzzle which gradually came further out as the arm and head of the picture expert followed it Once the thief had glimpsed the young man and made out that they had the room to themselves he came out of the chest as lightly and noiselessly as he had enveloped himself in it But his smile was gone now and in its place there was the wariness of the hunted animal Still covering Gladwin and surveying the room he said in low level tones If you move it ll be the last act of your life McGinty Murphy sorr purred Gladwin his face abeam I like your nerve young un I ve been taking lessons from the man who invented nerve Well you don t seem anxious to give the alarm said Wilson toying with the little automatic and turning it over in the expanse of his palm No I m afraid it might make you nervous Might make me so nervous that this gun would go off eh A shadow of the old smile came back as he went stealthily to the door and listened You seem to enjoy smoking said the peer of art collectors turning his back to Gladwin Don t you Yes Have you time to smoke a cigar Is it a good one I don t know it s the one you gave me while I was Officer six hundred sixty six Gladwin tossed the cigar to the thief who caught it deftly and inserted it between his lips And here s some more of your possessions added the young man drawing out the bribe money he had accepted while he masqueraded in the officer s uniform Thanks said Wilson as he caught the money and here s your little yellow boy though I wish that intellectual giant of a cop were here so I could hire his uniform for a bit You amaze me by your generosity murmured Gladwin as he pocketed the five hundred dollars bill Oh said the other easily while he again listened at the door I m not a regular crook I m in the picture business Still if you kept that bill it might help you get better accommodations when you reach Sing Sing If I don t need it till then I won t need it for a long long time You mean you think you re going to escape Gladwin slid down from the table and leaned against it making no effort to conceal the admiration he experienced for this man s superhuman aplomb And with guards all around the house and policemen tearing thirty rooms apart upstairs and camping on the roof scuttle yes and more coming maybe I venture to hope so chuckled the other I admit it s close enough to be interesting Well I ll say one thing for you the young millionaire said earnestly you re the coolest chap I ever hope to meet You re a marvel Built to order to work in story books eh Well to be candid with you McGinty there are times when I m not so cool as I look I m almost human Those cops will finish their work soon then they ll come in here Gladwin warned him I m listening for them said Wilson softly putting his ear to the door again Just because your pistol prevents me from calling them now don t think This gun isn t stopping you came the short reply If you wanted to call them you d take a chance I ve found that out in the last hundred seconds or so Thank you for the compliment but I Well I ll prove it the thief intervened and tossed the gun to Gladwin who caught it as if it were something hot Go ahead and call them How do you know I wouldn t call them the young man asked examining the automatic and finding it empty Don t be a child shrugged the other You closed these doors and you butted in about the Blue Boy just as that Central Office owl produced his jewelry Yes and you stumbled against the chest and knew that I was in it But I say asked Gladwin abruptly How did you come to use my name It wasn t safe to use mine and when I met Miss that girl your name was in my mind I borrowed it That s the thing I can t forgive you for said Gladwin regretfully to deceive her as you did That was rotten I don t care for your opinion on that said the picture expert warmly How can a man like you understand a man like me It can t be done We re further apart than the poles But you must see Wilson that s the name isn t it It will do for the nonce kind sir But you must see that the game is up If you take my advice you won t even try to escape Then I won t take your advice said Wilson softly But all these policemen know you re a big prize If they find you and you break for it they ll shoot and shoot to kill if necessary The thief flung round on him and his face was suddenly drawn and serious Death my dear Gladwin is the very least of my troubles if it will only come like that By Jove I like you and I hope you escape I know you do said Wilson shaking his head but not altogether on my account You re thinking of her the girl You don t want it to be known that she was going to marry me To be frank yes They re coming now Quick Do something The thief seized from the floor one of the portieres he had torn down to wrap the canvases in wound it about him and darted behind the curtains that screened the window As he vanished Gladwin went to the door and heard the voice of his friend Whitney Barnes demanding admission CHAPTER XXXVII HANDCUFFS AND LOVE Helen Burton could not have found a cozier place to faint in than that ultra luxurious den of Travers Gladwin Every chair and divan in the place invited one to swoon within its folds The young man had ordered his decorator to provide him with a chamber wherein stiffness and formality would be impossible unless one stood erect The decorator had spent money with a lavish hand upon Spanish leathers and silken stuffs from the near East and the Orient and he had laid these trappings over the softest of swan s down Once you sank upon them you could not help a sensation of utter peace and relaxation That final and irrevocable blasting of her ideal was a shock upon many shocks that the young girl had experienced within the course of a few hours and that she reached the den on her feet was due more to Bateato s strength and agility than to any nervous or physical force within her slender body The little Jap had fairly flown up the stairs with her in such fashion that she had no distinct recollection of her feet touching any stable surface Then he had turned a sharp corner while she seemed to stream behind him like a fluttering pennant and next she had felt herself sink into a soft delicious embrace when her senses left her and she seemed to drop pleasantly through fathomless space It was a great crimson chair embroidered with yellow poppies into which Bateato had dropped his burden then switched on a myriad of tiny lamps suspended from the ceiling by slim chains of different lengths or gleaming from dark niches and embrasures in the tapestry hung walls All these subdued and colored lights mingled to produce a wonderfully soft and reposeful effect and when at last Helen opened her eyes and her swoon had been of only a few minutes duration she was sure that the setting was a dream and half expected some impossible creature of phantasmagoria to rise from the floor and address her Then she felt an intermittent draught upon her cheek and looked up to see Whitney Barnes fanning her with an elaborate contrivance of peacock feathers that was alleged to have once done duty in the harem of Abdul Hamid one time Sultan of Turkey She was not sure at first that this strange looking being who fanned her in such an amazing fashion was the young friend of the real Travers Gladwin who had appeared on the scene from time to time during that fateful afternoon for his features were far from being in repose Positive torture was written on his clean cut boyish face as he wielded that fast fan in his handcuffed hands as if it were a task imposed upon him by some evil spirit Certainly there was no grace in the savage gestures of his arms as his wrists twisted and writhed in their shackles but he stuck to his task desperately now and then hissing over his shoulder at Bateato to learn why in thunder he didn t find smelling salts or whiskey or brandy or something with which to restore the young lady to consciousness And on his part Bateato was racing about like a scared mouse diving into mysterious chests and cabinets or under divans or climbing up the walls to explore recessed shelves His activities were confined to that one chamber for a big implacable policeman stood at the entrance with orders to keep his eye on the young woman and the Jap and see that they did not escape or attempt to assist the vanished picture expert in concealing himself or getting away As Helen s dazed faculties gradually resumed their normal activities and she realized that Whitney Barnes was a reality the humor of the situation suddenly struck her fancy and she smiled She was smiling with eyes and lips when young Barnes turned back his head from another reproach of Bateato and looked to see how she was coming on Thank heaven he exclaimed I thought you were dead I wanted to go out for a doctor but these confounded policemen wouldn t let me yes and they wouldn t unlock me Have I fanned enough I m pretty well tuckered out and these feathers get in one s nose so Then this is an extraordinary kind of a fan they use them in harems or something of the sort and I ve never fanned in harems Please stop then laughed Helen and I m a thousand times obliged to you If I could only have a glass of water I think I would be myself again Bateato had at last pried into a cabinet that contained a decanter of brandy and strange looking Moorish goblets and from some curtained enclosure he obtained cold water from a faucet A sip of the potent brandy and draught of water brought the color back to the girl s cheeks and the light to her eyes The change was so reassuring that Whitney Barnes actually beamed and for a few moments dropped all thought of his handcuffs My but you are beautiful he said impulsively I don t blame Travers for going daffy in the Ritz and do you know your eyes are exactly like your cousin s Helen laughed in spite of herself at the young man s headlong gush of words then became suddenly serious We haven t time to talk about eyes now she said soberly You must assist me in telling these policemen how I brought this terrible embarrassment upon mister Gladwin Nothing of the sort retorted Barnes He wouldn t hear of it He d cut off both his arms before he d allow your name to be dragged into such a sensation And I d add mine too willingly with these bracelets on them But that detective said he had a warrant for mister Gladwin for eloping with me cried Helen blushing scarlet And you know Yes I know you re going to weep or faint or something else Tell me about your cousin she s not m m married Sadie married ejaculated Helen Why she s deathly afraid of men She s the most timid little thing in the world Good cried Barnes enthusiastically These handcuffs are not half bad now you tell me that Why what do you mean asked Helen her eyes twinkling Oh nothing said Barnes trying to look unconcerned She s very young he added quickly A year younger than I am said Helen mischievously There was something positively fascinating about the intense seriousness that had fallen upon the nervous features of Whitney Barnes She s not too young to marry was his next query N no Helen hesitated though I suppose you d have to ask Auntie Well you didn t have to do that he said in alarm Oh I beg your pardon he added quickly please forgive me You are forgiven said Helen with a catch in her breath then resolutely but that is all over with It wasn t really real only a bad dream Of course it wasn t real sympathized Barnes That fellow just hypnotized you and my eye but he s a wonderful looking chap sort of a Hercules and Adonis all thrown into one But to get back to Sadie I m going to marry her You are Helen half started from her chair Be calm be calm and he waved her down with his shackled hands When I say I m going to marry her I merely state a fond belief I have been cherishing since m m well since a very long time ago to day or yesterday for to day is to morrow by this time you know Now don t stop me I say I am going to marry your cousin because I believe in Destiny with a big D Do you I did said Helen grimly but now I don t Oh yes you do Barnes breezed on You may not think that you believe you do but you really do and I wouldn t be a bit surprised if the destiny you thought out as far as the name goes Travers Gladwin I mean comes true after all But to come back to Sadie and my Destiny I have really got to marry her orders from headquarters Orders from headquarters gasped Helen Exactly My governor that is my dad that is the pater wrung a promise from me issued a command a ukase an ultimatum said Whitney Barnes you go right out and get married and bring home a lot of grand children No that wasn t it exactly now let me think a moment Yes I ve got it he said You ve simply got to marry and settle down or I ll turn you out into the street Wasn t that enough to take the wind out of you when you d never given the idea of marriage a thought Simply bowled me over At first I refused point blank but when I saw how cut up the poor old dad was about it I shook his hand and said Pater done I ll go right out and find a wife And I did What said Helen faintly You went right out and got married No no no my dear cousin I simply found Sadie And have you asked her Not surely while we were here this afternoon Oh I saw her later when she came to night with your aunt while your aunt was searching all over the place for you Not that I really asked her then but we looked at each other you know and I think we liked each other and that s a big start I just know we ll get married we re soul mates There isn t any doubt of it Well it strikes me said Helen severely that you re a trifle conceited Indeed I am was his startling response You ve got to be in love If you don t think you re pretty fine how are you going to convince anybody else that you are But you ll have to excuse me for a moment these bracelets are cutting my wrists to pieces I must find that man who locked me up You must stay here till I come back I won t be a minute and the young man darted out of the room with a ludicrous diving motion of his arms as he parted the heavy crimson silk hangings at the doorway and caromed against the big policeman on guard CHAPTER XXXVIII KEARNEY MEETS HIS MATCH There was no turning Whitney Barnes away with a soft answer His appeals for admission were rising to a strident pitch when his friend opened the door and yanked him in Have you seen him demanded Barnes looking about wildly No Gladwin returned I think he escaped Oh I don t mean the robber Johnny complained Barnes shaking out his handcuffed wrists I mean the damned idiot who locked these things on me He s searching the house said Gladwin smiling at his friend s tragic earnestness Detective Kearney came into the room alert as a race horse We ve been through the house from cellar to roof he spat out while his eyes searched every corner of the room I say look here said Barnes can you unlock me No Kearney would not even look at him Confound it somebody ought to unlock me exclaimed the frantic Barnes This is the most annoying position I was ever in in my life My valet even couldn t undress me with these things on What s out that way asked Kearney pointing to the panel door that opened upon the backstairs hallway Kitchen said Gladwin going to the door and opening it Oh yes said Kearney the captain s back there But look here detective cried Barnes again who was that inordinate ass who locked me up Ryan said Kearney freezing a smile as it formed on his lips Where is he On the roof What the deuce is he doing on the roof Searching it Well stormed Barnes I ll go up there and if he don t unlock me I ll push him off He dashed out of the room and up the stairs Funny thing where that man got to mister Gladwin mused the Central Office man with a keen glance from under his heavy eyebrows Yes those chaps are clever aren t they returned the young man with affected unconcern I suppose he s miles away by this time I don t think he s gone very far rejoined Kearney his voice bristling with suspicion He couldn t have got away without the men outside seeing him We ve got the block surrounded now He s here in this house mister Gladwin I guess you know that I don t know anything of the kind Gladwin denied with a trifle too much emphasis A policeman appeared in the doorway and Kearney called to him Ryan I thought you were on the roof Sergeant Burke sent me down responded Ryan We ve got the roofs covered both way Did you see the man you put the bracelets on asked Kearney No replied Ryan but I heard a lot of noise going up one of the back stairways You better go and find him urged Travers Gladwin He s in an awful state No countermanded Kearney never mind him now But you re wasting time here persisted Gladwin I can look after this room Oh no you can t Kearney flashed back Why not Because you re under arrest I was after you when I happened to find the other fellow I haven t any idea you ll try and escape mister Gladwin but a warrant is a warrant and duty s duty But that warrant wasn t meant for me No Kearney s eyes widened with surprise Was the girl running off with that crook he asked quickly No Gladwin corrected realizing his break Then you better go along with Ryan Ryan you take him upstairs and sit by him till I send for you See here the young man began to splutter as the giant Ryan seized him and walked him on air out of the room and up the stairs Kearney went to the folding doors and shut them He s in this room somewhere muttered the detective going to the portieres that curtained the window leading out to the balcony He was almost touching Wilson when the latter suddenly enveloped him in the portiere he had wrapped around himself and hurled the big detective to the floor As Kearney was untangling himself Wilson darted between the portieres glanced out the window and saw that a leap from the balcony would land him in the arms of three patrolmen He shook open the window and then shrank back into the far corner of the embrasure Kearney was on his feet again and sprang out to the balcony He came out this way he yelled to the men below Did he jump off Kearney darted back into the room looked everywhere ran to the folding doors and flung them open Then he looked back at the panel door noticed that it was ajar and dived for it He s hiding somewhere in this black alley he said with an oath and disappeared A moment later Wilson peeked out and re entered the room He had scarcely left his place of concealment when Officer No six hundred sixty six burst in Oh there ye are mister Gladwin said Phelan with a lovely grin Yes I m here nodded Wilson I just come back with another bunch of cops said Phelan but I hear the crook got away He s a smooth snake fer ye No I think he s still in the house laughed Wilson and I d like to have you get the credit of catching him Phelan You go outside and report to the captain then come back here Maybe I can help you find him Thank ye sorr said Phelan obeying the suggestion Here comes another one breathed the thief hearing a heavy tread and crossing the room to the big ornamental fireplace which had never known a spark or speck of soot There was a mammoth opening in the chimney and Wilson vanished up it as Kearney plunged back into the room As the detective entered through the panel door Watkins in full chauffeur regalia appeared from the hallway Well who sent you Kearney pounced on him I don t know Watkins returned Some man Gladwin I think is the name I was sent here for a lady Well you sit out in the hall and wait snapped Kearney who again proceeded to explore the room muttering and cursing The voice of Travers Gladwin in heated argument upstairs with Officer Ryan became audible I ll settle that fresh kid Kearney ejaculated and made a break for the stairs His departure was Wilson s cue to let himself down from the chimney He signalled Watkins who was sitting in the hall Watkins glided in By George exclaimed Wilson we are going it some in here You certainly are taking big chances butting in I didn t think you had the nerve It s a hundred to one against me but I ve beaten bigger odds than that You get up that chimney and I ll plant myself in the chest Quick they re coming down again Watkins went up the chimney with the sinuous speed of a snake and the picture expert went into the chest with the agility of a wolf spider ducking into its trap They were coming from all directions this time Gladwin down the stairs about fourteen jumps ahead of Kearney proclaiming that he would telephone his lawyer and that he could put up five million dollars in bonds for bail if need be Phelan was coming through the front door and Captain Stone through the hallway from the kitchen Glimpsing Gladwin Phelan made a flying dive for him yelling I got him I got him They rolled on the floor in a heap Have you got him Phelan cried Captain Stone rushing through the room and into the hallway I have sorr responded Phelan proudly getting to his feet and pulling up his captive What the devil s this bawled Captain Stone recognizing Gladwin The thief sorr responded Phelan The thief hell That s mister Gladwin W w w what stuttered Phelan Once again he entered into a condition of complete mental paralysis Has he hurt you sir asked the captain solicitously noticing that Gladwin s face was writhing Nothing mortal winced the young man What s the matter with you Phelan the captain jumped on him Have you been drunk to day No sorr gurgled Phelan I Don t try to stop me officer I ve come for my niece crashed the shrill voice of missus Elvira Burton She had seized a dramatic moment for her re entry CHAPTER XXXIX PILING ON PHELAN S AGONY missus Burton would have arrived much earlier into the midst of the maelstrom of events at the Gladwin mansion had not Fate in the shape of a tire blowout intervened She had set out from Police Headquarters with Detective Kearney as a passenger and she had urged her red headed chauffeur to pay not the slightest heed to speed laws or any other laws He had obeyed with such enthusiasm that the blowout had occurred at the intersection of Fifth avenue and Forty second street Late as the hour was there was a large crowd gathered to hear the society leader of Omaha deliver a lecture in strange French and caustic English Kearney had transshipped to a taxicab which accounted for his earlier arrival Who s in charge here cried missus Burton sweeping into the room with all sails set and drawing to the storm I am replied Captain Stone none too pleasantly as the gold lorgnettes were waved under his nose Well I came for my niece produce her at once insisted the panting woman You ll have to wait a few minutes answered Captain Stone grimly We re otherwise engaged at present But I have a warrant I ve ordered mister Gladwin s arrest she shrilled We ll attend to that later snapped the captain We re looking for a thief who broke in here to night A thief exclaimed missus Burton Well I saw him What asked the amazed officer Yes when I was here before and there he is now only he s got a policeman s uniform on missus Burton pointed an accusing finger at Michael Phelan who proceeded to turn livid You saw that man here before asked the wondering captain Yes He was in his shirt sleeves and when he saw me he ran away to hide Are you sure about this asked Captain Stone slowly turning and scowling at the condemned Phelan I should say I am declared the relentless missus Burton How could I ever forget that face C c c captain I I I w w want to explain chattered Phelan There ll be time enough for that the captain checked him For the present you camp right here in this room Don t you budge an inch from it That thief is somewhere in this house and we ve got to find him Give me my niece first cried missus Burton Captain Stone ignored the request and shouted to Kearney and the three men who had followed him into the room Come we are wasting time This house must be searched again and searched thoroughly I don t believe you have half done it Lead the way Kearney we ll begin on the next floor As they went out Sadie Burton timidly approached Whitney Barnes who was still making the rounds of every policeman in the house and pleading to be unlocked How do you do what is the matter she said timidly looking up into Barnes s distressed face I don t do at all replied Barnes tragically folding his arms in an effort to conceal the handcuffs Why you seem to have a chill Sadie sympathized with real concern in her voice I should say I have gasped Barnes a most awful chill But it may pass off Excuse me here s a new policeman I haven t asked yet The young man crossed the room to Phelan Have you got a key to these infernal shackles he asked while Sadie looked wonderingly after him I ve got a key to nothin growled Phelan Don t talk to me I d like to kill some of yez Barnes retreated backing into missus Burton who turned and seized him Do you know where my niece is she demanded Oh yes she s here only you re breaking my arm Where is she and where is that fiend Gladwin Oh the fiend Gladwin just went upstairs to her She s upstairs asleep Asleep Oh I don t know go up and find her that is I beg your pardon I ll lead the way come Miss Sadie The handcuffed youth led the procession up the stairs leaving Officer six hundred sixty six as solitary sentinel in the great drawing room and picture gallery Well I guess I m dished fer fair groaned Phelan as he mournfully surveyed the deserted room and allowed his eyes to rest on the portrait of a woman who looked out at him from mischievous blue eyes An all fer a pair o them eyes he added wistfully Tis tough He might have gone on at some length with this doleful soliloquy had not a hand suddenly closed over his mouth with the grip of a steel trap Alf Wilson had come out of the chest as noiselessly as he had originally entered it and good fortune favored him to the extent of placing Phelan with his back to him while his troubled mind was steeped in a mixture of love and despair As the thief pounced upon the ill fated Officer six hundred sixty six he uttered Pst Pst Watkins That sinuous individual writhed out of the fireplace and came to his assistance Get his elbows and put your knee in his back instructed the thief while I reach for my ether gun Thank God Here it is in my pocket Phelan struggled in a fruitless effort to tear himself free but Wilson s grip was the grip of unyielding withes of steel and the slim and wiry Watkins was just as muscular for his weight It was the task of a moment for the picture expert to bring round the little silver device he called his ether gun Phelan was gasping for breath through his nostrils and Wilson had only to press the bulb once or twice before the policeman s muscles relaxed and he fell limply into Watkins s arms That ll hold him for ten minutes at least breathed Wilson That s right Watkins prop him up while I get his belt and coat off then into the chest Phelan was completely insensible but his weight and the squareness of his bulk made it a strenuous task to support him and at the same time remove his coat Only a man of Wilson s size and prodigious strength could have accomplished the feat in anything like the time required and both he and Watkins were purple and breathless when they lowered the again unfrocked Officer six hundred sixty six into the chest and piled portieres and a small Persian rug on top of him While Watkins held up the lid the thief tore off his claw hammer coat and stuffed that down into the chest In another instant he had forced his shoulders into the uniform coat donned the cap and buckled on the belt Now break for it Watkins he gasped fighting the buttons into the buttonholes Take it easy out the front door I ll go out on the balcony and call down to the men in the street that it s all right Start the engine in the car and keep it going till I can make my getaway Now Watkins vanished out the door at the psychological moment Captain Stone and Kearney were coming down the stairs engaged in earnest conversation So engrossed were they when they entered the room that they failed to notice the absence of Officer six hundred sixty six whose uniform was strutting on the balcony while he himself lay anaesthetized in the chest How could he have been hiding in those portieres Kearney Captain Stone was saying I looked through them before I left the room I don t know how Captain replied Kearney but he was and Gladwin knew it You re sure of that Positive I say captain do you know where mister Ryan is intervened the roving Barnes who seemed to have bobbed up from nowhere in particular with Sadie in his train He may be in the cellar and he may be on the roof snapped the captain Don t bother me now But I must bother you by Jove persisted the frantic Barnes I demand that you send that man to unlock me I m not a prisoner or that sort of thing Captain Stone ignored him addressing Kearney Well if he isn t out now he can t get out without an airship Still we had better search some more below stairs Where s that man Phelan gone Look out on the balcony Kearney Kearney stepped to the curtains pulled them back dropped them and nodded He s out there Very well let s go down into the cellar and work up There isn t a room in the house now that isn t guarded But dammit Captain exploded Barnes again rattling his handcuffs Don t annoy me can t you see I m busy was all the satisfaction he got as the captain and the Central Office man left the room Sadie came forward shyly as the policemen left Did you find out where he is she asked anxiously In the cellar or on the roof When I get to the roof he is in the cellar and when I reach the cellar he is on the roof He s more elusive than a ghost Whoever are you talking about cried Sadie mister Ryan of course But I don t mean mister Ryan I mean the chauffeur who came for Helen I heard mister Kearney speaking about him upstairs Oh there s a chauffeur after her too said Barnes enigmatically Yes and wasn t it fortunate that the police arrived just in time to save her The police sniffed Barnes in disgust A lot they had to do with saving her Didn t they really They did not They bungled the whole thing up horribly Why they d have brought in a parson to marry them if it hadn t been Barnes managed to blush Then who did prevent the elopement asked Sadie eagerly I can t get a word out of Helen on account of Auntie El Can t you guess said Barnes mysteriously looking down upon her with a sudden return of ardor Oh did you do it and Sadie looked up at him from under her lashes Didn t I tell you I d do it swelled Barnes Sadie thanked him with her wonderfully expressive eyes Oh it was nothing shrugged Barnes You re the nicest man I ever met blurted Sadie with astounding frankness Do you mean that cried Barnes rapturously Indeed I mean it admitted Sadie timidly backing away from his burning glances Then you won t mind my saying said Barnes fervently that you re the nicest ma I mean girl I ever met Why would you believe it confound it here s that man Gladwin again Please come upstairs and I ll finish handcuffs or no handcuffs CHAPTER XL STRIKING WHILE THE IRON IS HOT As Travers Gladwin skimmed up the stairs to warn Helen of the arrival of her aunt he was thinking on four sides of his brain at the same time and revolving together so many lightning plans that the result was a good deal of a jumble In consequence he was wild eyed out of breath and more than a trifle incoherent when he parted the crimson curtains of the den and precipitately entered Your aunt he began as he checked his momentum and stopped against a table beside which Miss Burton was seated but don t get up and don t be frightened She need never know I ll take the blame for everything I am the Travers Gladwin you were going to elope with and I ll go to jail if necessary He paused for breath while Helen rose from her chair and protested Impossible mister Gladwin I Nothing of the sort the young man stopped her It is perfectly possible and I only wish that I were the man you had chosen to elope with I d elope with you now in a minute aunt or no aunt You must not talk that way cried the young girl her face aflame You are only saying this out of politeness a sense of chivalry and while I appreciate all you are doing for me I could not accept any such sacrifice Sacrifice he retorted with increasing ardor Call it blessing call it heavenly boon call it the pinnacle of my desire the apogee of my hopes call it anything in the world but sacrifice Oh you must not talk to me this way exclaimed the girl sinking back into her chair and covering her face with her hands But I certainly must the young man reeled on It is the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth It has come upon me like a stroke of lightning it may not seem reasonable it may not seem sane I can t help that It is here inside of me Stop Helen interposed again her voice faint and tremulous You are taking advantage of my helpless situation Why you hardly know me she added with a swift change of tone as if she had made a sudden discovery Taking her hands from her face she looked up at him through widening eyes misty with tears The young man bit his lip and turned his head away Pardon me he said bitterly after a moment s pause I had not thought of it in that light It does seem as if I were taking advantage of you He looked at her steadily a moment until she dropped her eyes Can you think I am that sort of a man he asked abruptly and the tenseness of his voice made her glance up at him again Helen made another remarkable discovery that he had fine eyes and a splendid mouth and nose Can you think I am that sort of a man he repeated slowly forcing her to continue to yield her eyes to his earnest regard No no Helen returned hastily I did not mean it that way only I cannot quite understand it You never saw me till a few hours ago and then and then I was engaged She paused and shuddered But that was a case of hypnotism burst out the young man letting himself go again He is a marvelous man I wish I had half of his strength of will and and good looks It is past belief that he is what he is with all his talents his appearance and his magnificent courage If it is in my power the police shall not reach him At first my only object was to save you from the dreadful position of becoming the wife of such a man and also from the scandal that must have followed if your elopement were discovered and he were arrested But now I must confess that the man compels my admiration and that I want to see him free for his own sake And he is still in the house said Helen anxiously Yes yes and here comes your aunt Now I pray you let me take the brunt of this storm I will ask nothing more of you I am Travers Gladwin and we were to have eloped do you promise For here she is Yes Helen whispered and then the storm burst So here you are at last Helen Burton came the first roll of thunder from the doorway It was not as terrifying a rumble as it might have been had not the statuesque and tightly laced missus Burton lost a good deal of breath in coming up the stairs She came on into the room with tragic step followed by Whitney Barnes and Sadie the latter keeping very close to Barnes as if she feared that her cousin would cover her with reproaches for having revealed the secret of the projected elopement Calm yourself madam calm yourself began Travers Gladwin as he stepped between her and her niece And who are you pray asked the majestic woman haughtily I am to blame for it all he cried I am Travers Gladwin What You are Travers Gladwin You are the wretch who sought to steal off in the dead of night with my niece and ward You You missus Burton looked unutterable threats and maledictions Travers Gladwin could not resist a smile which he hid by bowing low and stammering I must humbly confess to being myself and plead guilty of the crime of falling passionately in love with your niece I Helen rose quickly to her feet and confronted her aunt There was fire in the young girl s eye as she said Aunt Ella it is all a mistake this Now Helen Gladwin turned and took the young girl s hand please let me explain You promised She promised what flared missus Burton She foolishly promised to elope with me said Gladwin sweetly but when she got here and thought of the shock and grief that her dear aunt might suffer she suddenly changed her mind I had everything arranged car waiting parson waiting marriage license in my pocket everything You see madam I am the only guilty party Your niece was the innocent victim of my wiles missus Burton looked from one to the other in complete bewilderment Helen could only blush and look confused The immensity of Gladwin s lie struck her dumb Sadie was staring at him in open mouthed amazement Even Whitney Barnes blinked his eyes and forgot his handcuffs Travers Gladwin met missus Burton s frowning and perplexed stare with a fatuous smile At last she turned to Whitney Barnes and asked Is he telling the truth Illustration HE S ALMOST AS MADLY IN LOVE WITH HER AS I AM Oh yes said Barnes readily and if it hadn t been for me he might have kidnapped her He s almost as madly in love with her as I am you will have to excuse me a moment I think I see that man Ryan The shackled young man suddenly darted out of the room followed by Sadie who seemed irresistibly drawn in his wake missus Burton looked after them helplessly A suspicion suddenly flashed in her brain and she turned back to Gladwin I feel sure that you are deceiving me she charged him and that that other young man is Travers Gladwin You can t tell me that his wrists were not handcuffed for I just saw them You are entirely mistaken Gladwin returned soberly If you will kindly step out into the music room I will show you a modest portrait of myself that was painted three years ago by an eminent American artist Helen you will pardon us for just a moment and he turned with a broad smile that won him a smile in return for the humor of the situation had gradually beaten down whatever other emotions stirred in the girl s breast Like one reluctantly led in a dream missus Burton allowed Gladwin to escort her into the music room outside and conduct her to a painting that hung in an obscure corner of the room Do you think it flatters me he asked as she regarded it dumbly She looked at him curiously and then back at the portrait then shook her head and muttered There s a mystery here somewhere You are all banded together in a conspiracy I do not know whom to believe But it has gone far enough We will go back to Omaha to morrow I had no idea New York was such a terrible place Why are all these policemen running about Mainly in your interest responded Gladwin quickly but if you will consent not to send me to jail I will get them out of the house and keep the unhappy termination of my romance out of the newspapers Of course it must not get in the newspapers cried the horrified missus Burton Then madam if you will go back to Helen and promise not to be too hard with her I will attend to it Was your father s name Edwin Gladwin asked missus Burton looking at him with a swift change of expression as he led her back to the room he called his den Yes said the young man but if you will excuse me I will endeavor to get rid of all these policemen He suddenly darted from her and descended the stairs CHAPTER XLI THE ESCAPE While he had not the slightest notion where the picture expert had managed to conceal himself during his own enforced absence from the scene of the chase Travers Gladwin was confident that the man was capable of outwitting an army of the sort of man hunters who were swarming within and without the aristocratic premises When he caught sight of Whitney Barnes and Sadie in a tender confab that was just about to frond out into the full foliage of a romantic climax it was on his tongue to bid them carry their hearts upstairs and string them together in a more secluded spot They beat him to his own suggestion and were gone before he could utter a syllable He had the great drawing room and picture gallery to himself and was scanning every corner of it when a voice punctuated the silence Ah mister Gladwin The young man turned quickly and saw what he at first mistook for a uniformed constable emerge from the portieres that screened the window Well if it isn t he began in gaping surprise Murphy sorr only a tighter fit Wilson stepped through the curtains twirling his club So you are six hundred sixty six now eh Gladwin blurted And Phelan The gentleman who belongs in this tight fitting frock Oh he s still about And you managed to bribe him Not exactly that mister Gladwin say I persuaded him My hat is off to you again exclaimed the young man but don t waste any time You can get away easily in that uniform quick and good luck I never hurry in these cases returned the thief with an air of calm indifference You see I have an idea that the Captain and Kearney are waiting for me at the front door for they made a loud declaration that they were going to search the cellar I have had similar experiences my young friend But they won t leave the front door and they may burst in here at any moment protested Gladwin But they will leave the front door when I want them to said the other softly By jove you re a wonderful chap I ve got to be to keep out of jail It s a shame that you misdirect your energies and genius said the young man earnestly But you must acknowledge that I work hard for what I get Yes I do And I really love pictures For themselves H m yes for themselves Travers Gladwin stood frowning at the floor for a moment then looked up quickly See here then you ve worked mighty hard for my pictures and I m going to give you a few of the best of them Here And Gladwin stepped over to the corner of the room where the trunk had been dropped and picked up a bundle of canvases The picture expert wore a broad grin as the young man came toward him He waved aside the proffered bundle and said Those are not the best of them Just a minute He reached behind him and pulled down from under his belted coat a similar carefully rolled bundle These are the gems of your collection he said grimly offering the slim roll of canvases I can t keep them now you ve been too white about this whole thing I couldn t even accept The Blue Boy Gladwin refused to accept the paintings and the thief laid them down on the table Stepping closer to the young man he bent down and said low and earnestly When a man goes wrong Gladwin and the going leans against the lines of least resistance it s easier to keep on going than to stop and switch off into the hard and narrow path He is always hoping that something will take hold of him and set him right and that hope usually involves a woman I ve been dreaming lately that I wanted something to set me going in the right direction but it seems that you have beaten me to that or are on the fair road to do it The trouble is that I have forgotten how to go about a clean thing cleanly I m mighty sorry but Gladwin started But you re also mighty glad I shall always remember you Wilson and here s my hand on it that I shall always be willing to help you up and out of the the The muck supplied the thief accepting Gladwin s hand and gripping it However we are wasting time and keeping the ladies up till an unconscionable hour If you will get your little Jap down here without making a noise about it I can use him and bid you good night Gladwin went warily out into the hallway reconnoitered the front door and vestibule then went to the stairway and uttered a short sharp whistle Bateato came down as if on winged feet and halted as if turned to stone between the big man in the uniform of Officer six hundred sixty six and his master Come here said Wilson and plucked the Jap by the arm Bateato trembled with apprehension Would you like to catch the thief the picture expert asked him Ees sair Bateato looked at his master who nodded reassuringly Well the thief is in your master s room said Wilson impressively Go up there and bang on the door take that poker out of the fireplace and make all the noise you can Do you understand me Ees sair and Bateato s long lost grin returned I make bang bang Yes and yell Police quick quick quick catch thief Ees sair big much pleece come and tief run Bateato run too and pleece find all empty Good hurry and Wilson gave the Jap an unnecessary push toward the fireplace for the little Oriental fairly flew on his errand A moment later there burst upon the stillness of the mansion a frightful uproar The noise was distinctly audible in the street as Wilson had slipped to the door and opened it then concealed himself behind a curtain It was only a matter of seconds before Captain Stone Kearney and the entire outside patrol rushed in and piled up the stairs Travers Gladwin had not stirred from where he stood in the drawing room when Bateato got his instructions He was intensely excited and feared that some slip might spoil this inspired plan Good by came a muffled hail from the hallway Then there was silence both within and without Gad I hope he makes it cried the young man and rushed to the window He had hardly reached there when the stillness was punctured by a crash of shifting gears and the racket of a sixty horsepower engine thrown into sudden furious action He s gone Gladwin breathed as he saw a touring car hurl itself athwart his vision He recognized his former servant Watkins at the wheel CHAPTER XLII MICHAEL PHELAN S PREDICAMENT It was as if a great burden had been removed from his shoulders Leaving the window and stepping back into the room Travers Gladwin stretched his arms above his head and exhaled a long breath of satisfaction Now I can sit down and await developments he said to himself slipping into a chair and stretching out his legs and it will only remain for Michael Phelan to turn up or to fail to turn up and the mystery of the escape is explained Poor Phelan he must be a terrific simpleton and I suppose I am partly to bla His gaze had wandered to the great chest the lid of which was distinctly rising Before Gladwin could jump to his feet the lid was thrown back and there sat the subject of his soliloquy in his shirt sleeves jerking his head about like a jack in the box Where in blazes am I he groaned as his eyes made out Travers Gladwin You seem to be in the chest replied the young man covering his mouth with his hand Howly murther me uniform is gone again exploded Phelan struggling to his feet and examining his shirt sleeves as if he feared he were the victim of witchcraft He climbed out of the chest and turned a vindictive glance upon Gladwin who composed his features and said Not guilty this time Officer Phelan stared at him stupidly for a second and then let his arms and shoulders go limp He was a lugubriously pathetic figure as he turned up his eyes and muttered Now I remember they took it off me and drugged me an rammed me into the chest Wurra Wurra I m a goner now for shure Gladwin was about to speak when there was a run of feet on the stairs and in burst Captain Stone and Detective Kearney At the sight of Phelan the captain recoiled and his jaw dropped Kearney likewise regarded him in blank astonishment Where s your uniform Phelan roared Captain Stone when he could get his breath They took it off me drugged me an half murthered me eight of em whined Phelan Eight of em yelled the captain There was only one of them you numskull I hope to croak if there wasn t two of em with the stren th of eight rejoined Phelan wiping his dripping forehead and rolling his eyes An they chloroformed me an stuffed me into the chest You can ask mister Gladwin If you let that thief escape in your uniform Mike Phelan stormed the infuriated captain I ll break you to morrow And as for you mister Gladwin if you had a hand in this Calm yourself captain returned the young man I am unable to claim the honor I just happened in here as mister Phelan was coming out of the chest Why did that Jap make such a thundering racket upstairs broke in Kearney The whole thing looks to me like a frame up Travers Gladwin shrugged his shoulders and said easily Considering the number of policemen on the job does it not also take on the aspect of a slip up It would make rather amusing reading in the newspapers but if you prefer gentlemen we can let the matter drop right here Captain Stone and Kearney looked at each other and found no comfort in each other s countenances Even though he got away with one hundred thousand dollars worth of my paintings slipping out from under your very noses Gladwin pressed his advantage I may for the sake of avoiding notoriety decide that it is best to keep the thing quiet Of course it is in your power to compel publicity Not against your wishes sir said Captain Stone meekly And you mister Kearney smiled the young man looking up into the frowning visage of the much advertised Central Office man Captain Stone is my superior officer said Kearney shortly through compressed lips Very well then Captain Gladwin ran on we will just drop the incident from our minds You will oblige me by calling off your men at once Captain Stone bowed and left the room followed by Kearney Well Phelan said Gladwin turning to that distressed individual the evening s entertainment seems at an end Tis a divvil of an intertainment fer me I ll be broke to morrer Oh no Phelan and the young man walked over and patted him on the shoulder not broke you ll resign A swell chance I ve got to resign with no shield to turn in It ll break the heart of me poor ould mother There were tears in Michael Phelan s voice and his woe begone expression was pitiable Young Gladwin hastened to cheer him up I will take it upon myself to see that you are honorably discharged Phelan I can almost swear that a little note to Captain Stone with an inclosure of say four figures will put through your resignation But I ll be out of a job won t I flared Phelan Not for a minute I am going to give you a job for life What Yes and at twice the salary you were getting I m going to appoint you my private watchman to guard my picture gallery Sure an this ain t one o your jokes Phelan asked with a dismal effort to summon a grin Indeed it is not and here is that five hundred dollar bill you so foolishly surrendered to my friend the picture expert Now as all your fellow officers seem to have departed you can begin your duties by going upstairs and telling the ladies that the blockade has been raised By the time Michael Phelan got the crisp saffron bill tucked away in his jeans he was in full and glorious grin and made for the stairway with an agility that was a distinct revelation of hidden resources A few minutes later missus Burton entered the room followed by her two nieces As her now calmer eye took in the room and the empty picture frames missus Burton exclaimed Whatever have you been doing here Some of my canvases need cleaning was the ready response with a wink at Whitney Barnes who was hovering about Sadie so I took the most valuable ones out of the frames to send them to the cleaners missus Burton swallowed the fib and began a tour of inspection of the room Your father collected some of these didn t he she said after a pause Your father and my father were very good friends I remember not so long ago hearing him tell of that portrait of your ancestor indicating the Stuart Now I like this one a Gainsborough isn t it She had stopped in front of The Blue Boy Do you like that one cried the young man It s charming gushed missus Burton It s yours Mine Why I couldn t think of it Please do me the honor of accepting it After what has occurred to night Why I missus Burton couldn t take her eyes from the picture and seemed thrilled with an ecstasy of admiration I will have it packed and shipped to you to morrow missus Burton wheeled upon him with an expression that fairly took him to her arms You dear generous boy she cried if Helen had only confided in me here is my card come to me to morrow and we will have a family conference I Auntie interposed Helen in alarm I will take charge of all the wedding arrangements ran on Auntie fairly bubbling over Come early in the afternoon mister Gladwin I must get my girls to bed Good night come girls missus Burton started for the door and Helen lingered behind Oh whatever shall I do she whispered to Gladwin Whatever your heart dictates he whispered in reply And did he escape came the frightened query as she dropped her eyes and blushed Yes and they will never get him Thank you She gave him her hand for a moment and was gone CHAPTER XLIII THE CIRCUMVENTION OF AUNTIE Sadie sat up with a start and rubbed her eyes All right Nanette she said sleepily I m awake The trim rosy cheeked maid smiled and swiftly left the room She had deposited one armful of fluffy things on a chair beside Sadie s bed and another armful of fluffy things on a chair beside Helen s bed She had also performed other mysterious little offices noiselessly before going to the side of Sadie s bed And sleeping like an innocent babe said the comely Nanette to herself with a depth of affection in her tone Then she bent down and called in Sadie s ear Ten o clock Miss Sadie She had to repeat the whispered call several times before Sadie s eyelids fluttered and she stirred into life The maid had vanished by the time the younger of the two sleeping beauties had removed the cobwebs from her eyes The twin rosewood beds lay side by side enveloped by the transparent silken hangings of a single canopy The room was exquisitely done in pink and everywhere were evidences that the two lucky mortals who slumbered therein were coddled and pampered to the limit of modern luxury Sadie s robe de nuit as the fashion magazines put it was a creation of laces and ribbons and mighty becoming She had admitted this to herself as she surveyed her reflection in the tall oval mirror only five hours before She admitted it again as she hopped out of bed and confronted herself in the same mirror Then she turned and ran quickly to the side of Helen s bed She bent down and kissed her cousin Get up Helen Sadie urged as the blue eyes reluctantly opened Get up and dress dear we haven t much time Much time for what asked Helen sitting up and going through the ceremony of rubbing her eyes Much time before Auntie wakes A roseate blush spread up from the ribbons at Sadie s throat to the roots of her fair hair Helen s eyes were wide open now and she looked at her cousin in frowning puzzlement And mister Hogg is expected said Sadie with swift inspiration Whatever are you driving at asked Helen Are you anxious to greet mister Hogg pouted Sadie No was the vehement response Then we must be out when he comes and I have an important engagement at eleven Helen shot two little pink feet out of the covers and planked them down on the velvety rug Whom have you an engagement with Sadie Burton she asked with breathless eagerness I have an engagement to elope This time Sadie turned her head to hide her blushes Helen seemed actually paralyzed There was an intense pause before Sadie wheeled round flung her head defiantly and said with more fire than she had ever in her life displayed With mister Whitney Barnes and you are going to assist me you and mister Gladwin You cannot be serious Sadie said the older cousin slowly I am though was the passionate rejoinder Nanette and I packed my steamer trunk after you and Auntie went to bed Hurry now Helen dear for we must be at the Little Church Around the Corner at eleven o clock I am going to wear my gray travelling dress and you your brown Why you dreadful little minx you cried Helen If you are poking fun at me I will never forgive you I am not poking fun retorted Sadie with the same ardor and almost in tears It is all planned and arranged Whitney promised to have everything ready at the church including Travers Gladwin He said he couldn t wait another minute after eleven o clock that the suspense would kill him and he was so terribly in earnest about it that I believe him You goose exclaimed Helen but now she was smiling and there was a happy light in her eyes Do you mean to tell me Sadie Burton she added that you fell in love with that young man in a few hours you the man hater Y y yes admitted Sadie her cheeks again on fire And a man you don t know anything about a perfect stranger This brought the fire into the timid miss s eyes and she returned warmly I know everything about him Helen Burton his whole family history and he is only obeying orders in rushing the ceremony Obeying orders Yes his father commanded him to marry me at once and if he doesn t obey he will be disinherited and have to become a plumber or something to make a living His father is Joshua Barnes the mustard king you must have heard of him When I told Auntie who he was she almost collapsed and said something about Joshua Barnes buying and selling twenty hogs I suppose she meant Jabez Hogg Why I never heard of such a thing Sadie mister Barnes could not have been serious His father never saw you in his life Oh but he telephoned his father all about it before he proposed to me He was sure I would say yes He is a wonderful mind reader and believes in mysteries and Fate He said the minute he saw me he knew I was his Fate Once more the modest Sadie was in a state bordering on conflagration Helen s eye sobered as she looked at and beyond Sadie That was the very thing Travers Gladwin I mean the real one said to me she mused He did Yes and the way things have turned out it would seem Helen stopped and covered her face with her hands Sadie ran to her and put her arms about her You are going to help us aren t you Helen dear said Sadie tremulously I would tell Auntie about it only she would want a tremendous wedding and all that Whitney and I both hate big weddings I am too timid and he is too nervous says he might swallow the ring and choke to death You will now Helen darling There was a little sob in Sadie s voice and Helen surrendered You are doing a very rash thing Sadie Helen lectured striving to draw her brows into an expression of impressive solemnity My own terrible experience should have been a lesson to you a warning a But it was Whitney Barnes who saved you Helen cried Sadie exultantly You owe it all to him and that is why I began to love him Nonsense retorted Helen sharply mister Barnes had nothing whatever to do with it All he did was to get himself handcuffed and run about absurdly trying to be unlocked But he was on watch and planned and planned Sadie defended her hero Sadie Burton I say that Whitney Barnes had nothing whatever to do with it He was merely an instrument Travers Gladwin did it all I owe everything to him everything He would have gone to jail for me sacrificed all his wonderful paintings oh Sadie it was wonderful of him It was Sadie who was thunderstruck now by the ardor in her cousin s voice Her amazement soon gave way to a beaming smile and she mumbled as she turned to her dressing table I do believe she is in love with him CHAPTER XLIV MISS FEATHERINGTON S SHATTERED DREAM Marietta Featherington couldn t seem to concentrate her mind upon that thirteenth chapter of Lily the Lovely Laundress The handsome rat catcher had just beaten the aristocratic villain to a pulp and would have finished the job neatly and thoroughly had not Lily raised her lovely fair hand and cried with the imperiousness of an empress Pause Giovanni Pause He may have a mother Ordinarily Miss Featherington would have raced through the pages hungrily avidly Not so on this fair November afternoon Whether it was the mince pie and melted cheese she had partaken of a bare hour before or whether it was the even more so than usual grumpy mood of her employer Joshua Barnes she could not tell Perhaps it was neither She refused to analyze it Whatever the cause she felt heavy and wistful and sad From time to time the emotional Miss Featherington allowed Whitney Barnes to flit through the corridors of her imagination He had walked heavily through her dreams the night before His strange words of yesterday had strangely moved her Desperately she had striven to solve the mystery Were they words of love If so how would Old Grim Barnes accept the declaration from his son s lips that he loved the humble though yes though beautiful stenographer lady of the Barnes Mustard Company Limited Miss Featherington had half expected to walk into Joshua Barnes s presence that morning and meet with a torrent of abuse She had rehearsed a cold and haughty retort But her employer had greeted her with a gruff Good morning and an expression that was equivalent to a smile Alas the prince had not spoken Marietta pounded out forty two letters containing references to as many different kinds of assorted and selected mustard before she succeeded in dismissing the heir to the mustard millions from her romantic thoughts and creating a new hero in his stead The new hero some way fell down and she picked up Lily the Lovely Laundress But even the Lovely Lily failed to thrill and she laid the book aside A long sigh was escaping from the depressed maiden s bosom when the door of the anteroom opened and who should enter but Whitney Barnes Marietta swallowed her sigh and clasped her hand over her palpitating heart The young man was not alone however and he did not deign Miss Featherington a glance as he held the door open and cried Come in children The children were none other than Helen and Sadie and Travers Gladwin Nor did they deign Miss Featherington a glance as they assembled in a little group talking in hushed tones and punctuating their talk with suppressed laughter By the time Whitney Barnes did turn to Marietta that young lady s nose was elevated to an excruciating angle so much so that she was unable to fulfill her desire to sniff There was cold hauteur in her stare as she met the smile of Whitney Barnes and replied to his query Yes mister Barnes your father is in and alone Thank you Miss Featherington cried the young man gaily and an instant later the little party of four had vanished behind a mahogany portal Joshua Barnes was bent over his desk writing as the door opened noiselessly and the four young people entered When he looked up his son Travers Gladwin and Helen were lined up beside his chair the two young men smiling sheepishly and the girls blushing crimson and looking down at the floor Hello Pater opened Whitney Barnes you remember Travers Gladwin This is missus Gladwin a bride of sixty seven minutes Old Grim Barnes was on his feet in an instant with a gallant bow to Helen and a hearty handshake for the bridegroom For a second or two he failed to descry Sadie who as per rehearsal was hidden behind the two young men As with a look of surprise he spied her Helen drew Sadie to her and managed to stammer And this is my cousin Sadie mister Barnes Sadie dropped a timid courtesy her face on fire How do you do Miss er Joshua Barnes was feasting his eyes on Sadie s shy beauty and smiling benignly I didn t catch the name he added turning to Helen B b b she began when Whitney Barnes came to her rescue Barnes pater missus Sadie that is missus Whitney Barnes a bride of seventy seven minutes Whitney Barnes beamed upon his father and put his arm about the old gentleman s shoulders to support him How do you like my choice dad isn t she a darling Why don t you ask to kiss the bride Joshua Barnes breathed with difficulty for a moment and his eyes blinked Slowly he looked for confirmation in the faces of the newlywed Gladwins and when they both nodded and smiled he returned his glance to Sadie who had turned very pale and was beginning to tremble The mustard king shook off his son s arm and gathered Sadie to him with a bear hug He kissed her ten times in succession and then let her down in his chair and patted her shoulder Joshua Barnes was so happy that tears glistened in his eyes He continued to look at Sadie for a long moment before he turned to his son and gulped Whitney Barnes you scoundrel have you been keeping this from me Why no dad came the laughing answer I telephoned you about it last night and you called me For the first time in my life I made a mistake Whitney Barnes his father checked him and you both have my blessing a thousandfold provided you will take me in as a boarder Done exclaimed Whitney Barnes THE END Popular
