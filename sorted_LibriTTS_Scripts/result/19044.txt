3923_181420_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 MOST NOBLE VICE CHANCELLOR AND YOU EMINENT PROCTORS 
3923_181420_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 A citizen of Britain is before you once a student in this University now better known to the people of the New World than to our own 
3923_181420_000022_000001	train-clean-360	This is the man who fifteen years ago went to the coast of Labrador to succor with medical aid the solitary fishermen of the northern sea in executing which service he despised the perils of the ocean which are there most terrible in order to bring comfort and light to the wretched and sorrowing 
3923_181420_000022_000002	train-clean-360	Thus up to the measure of human ability he seems to follow if it is right to say it of any one in the footsteps of Christ Himself as a truly Christian man 
3923_181420_000022_000003	train-clean-360	Rightly then we praise him by whose praise not he alone but our University also is honored 
none	none	I present to you Wilfred Thomason Grenfell that he may be admitted to the degree of Doctor in Medicine HONORIS CAUSA Thus may be rendered the Latin address when in May nineteen oh seven for the first time in its history the University of Oxford conferred the honorary degree in medicine 
3923_181420_000023_000001	train-clean-360	With these fitting words was presented a man whose simple faith has been the motive power of his works to whom pain and weariness of flesh have called no stay since there was discouragement never to whom personal danger has counted as nothing since fear is incomprehensible 
3923_181420_000023_000002	train-clean-360	 As the Lord wills whether for wreck or service I am about His business On November ninth of the preceding year the King of England gave one of his Birthday Honors to the same man making him a Companion of saint Michael and saint George C M G 
none	none	Wilfred Thomason Grenfell second son of the reverend 
3923_181420_000024_000001	train-clean-360	Algernon Sydney Grenfell and Jane Georgiana Hutchinson was born on the twenty eighth day of February eighteen hundred and sixty five at Mostyn House School Parkgate by Chester England of an ancestry which laid a firm foundation for his career and in surroundings which fitted him for it 
3923_181420_000024_000002	train-clean-360	On both sides of his inheritance have been exhibited the courage patience persistence and fighting and teaching qualities which are exemplified in his own abilities to command to administer and to uplift 
3923_181420_000025_000000	train-clean-360	On his father s side were the Grenvilles who made good account of themselves in such cause as they approved among them Basil Grenville commander of the Royalist Cornish Army killed at Lansdown in sixteen forty three in defence of King Charles 
3923_181420_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Four wheels to Charles s wain Grenville Trevanion Slanning Godolphin slain 
3923_181420_000027_000000	train-clean-360	There was also Sir Richard Grenville immortalized by Tennyson in The Revenge and John Pascoe Grenville the right hand man of Admiral Cochrane who boarded the Spanish admiral s ship the Esmeralda on the port side while Cochrane came up on the starboard when together they made short work of the capture 
3923_181420_000027_000001	train-clean-360	Nor has the strain died out as is demonstrated in the present generation by many of doctor Grenfell s cousins among them General Francis Wallace Grenfell Lord Kilvey and by doctor Grenfell himself on the Labrador in the fight against disease and disaster and distress along a stormy and uncharted coast 
3923_181420_000028_000000	train-clean-360	On his mother s side four of her brothers were generals or colonels in the trying times of service in India 
3923_181420_000028_000001	train-clean-360	The eldest fought with distinction throughout the Indian Mutiny and in the defence of Lucknow and another commanded the crack cavalry regiment the Guides at Peshawar and fell fighting in one of the turbulent North of India wars 
3923_181420_000029_000000	train-clean-360	Of teachers there was doctor Grenfell s paternal grandfather the reverend Algernon Grenfell the second of three brothers house master at Rugby under Arnold and a fine classical scholar whose elder and younger brothers each felt the ancestral call of the sea and became admirals with brave records of daring and success 
3923_181420_000030_000000	train-clean-360	doctor Grenfell s father after a brilliant career at Rugby School and at Balliol College Oxford became assistant master at Repton and later when he married head master of Mostyn House School a position which he resigned in eighteen eighty two to become Chaplain of the London Hospital 
3923_181420_000030_000001	train-clean-360	 He was a man of much learning with a keen interest in science a remarkable eloquence and a fervent evangelistic faith 
3923_181420_000031_000000	train-clean-360	Mostyn House School still stands enlarged and modernized in the charge of doctor Grenfell s elder brother and in it his mother is still the real head and controlling genius 
3923_181420_000032_000000	train-clean-360	Parkgate at one time a seaport of renown when Liverpool was still unimportant and later a seaside health resort to which came the fashion and beauty of England had fallen through the silting of the estuary and the broadening of the Sands of Dee to the level of a hamlet in the time of doctor Grenfell s boyhood 
3923_181420_000032_000001	train-clean-360	The broad stretch of seaward trending sand with its interlacing rivulets of fresh and brackish water made a tempting though treacherous playground alluring alike in the varied forms of life it harbored and in the adventure which whetted exploration 
3923_181420_000032_000002	train-clean-360	Thither came Charles Kingsley Canon of Chester who married a Grenfell and who coupled his verse with scientific study and made geological excursions to the river s mouth with the then Master of Mostyn House School 
3923_181420_000032_000003	train-clean-360	In these excursions the youthful Wilfred was a participant and therein he learned some of his first lessons in that accuracy of observation essential to his later life work 
none	none	Here in this trained but untrammeled boyhood with an inherited incentive to labor and an educated thirst for knowledge away from the thrall of crowded communities close to the wild places of nature with the sea always beckoning and a rocking boat as familiar as the land it is small wonder that there grew the fashioning of the purpose of a man dimly at first conceived in a home in which all both of tradition and of teaching bred faith reverence and the sense of thanksgiving in usefulness 
3923_181420_000034_000000	train-clean-360	From the school days at Parkgate came the step to Marlborough College where three years were marked by earnest study both in books and in play for the one gained a scholarship and the other an enduring interest in Rugby football 
3923_181420_000034_000001	train-clean-360	Matriculating later at the University of London Grenfell entered the London Hospital and there laid not only the foundation of his medical education but that of his friendship with Sir Frederick Treves renowned surgeon and daring sailor and master mariner as well 
3923_181420_000034_000002	train-clean-360	With plenty of work to the fore as a hospital interne the ruling spirit still asserted itself and the young doctor became an inspiration among the waifs of the teeming city he was one of the founders of the great Lads Brigades which have done much good and fostered more in the example that they have set for allied activities 
3923_181420_000034_000003	train-clean-360	Nor were the needs of his own bodily machine neglected football rowing and the tennis court kept him in condition and his athletics served to strengthen his appeals to the London boys whom he enrolled in the brigades 
3923_181420_000034_000004	train-clean-360	He founded the inter hospital rowing club at Putney and rowed in the first inter hospital race he played on the Varsity football team and won the throwing the hammer at the sports 
3923_181420_000035_000000	train-clean-360	A couple of terms at Queen s College Oxford followed the London experience but here the conditions were too easy and luxurious for one who by both inheritance and training had within him the incentive to the strenuous life 
3923_181420_000035_000001	train-clean-360	Need called misery appealed the message of life of hope and of salvation awaited and the young doctor turned from Oxford to the medical mission work in which his record stands among the foremost for its effectiveness and for the spirituality of its purpose 
3923_181420_000036_000000	train-clean-360	Seeking some way in which he could satisfy his medical aspirations as well as his desire for adventure and for definite Christian work he appealed to Sir Frederick Treves a member of the Council of the Royal National Mission to Deep Sea Fishermen who suggested his joining the staff of the mission and establishing a medical mission to the fishermen of the North Sea 
3923_181420_000036_000001	train-clean-360	The conditions of the life were onerous the existing traffic in spirituous liquors and in all other demoralizing influences had to be fought step by step prejudice and evil habit had to be overcome and to be replaced by better knowledge and better desire there was room for both fighting and teaching and the medical mission won its way 
3923_181420_000036_000002	train-clean-360	 When you set out to commend your gospel to men who don t want it there s only one way to go about it to do something for them that they ll be sure to understand 
none	none	The message of love that was made flesh and dwelt amongst men must be reincarnate in our lives if it is to be received to day Thus came about the outfitting of the Albert hospital ship to carry the message and the help by cruising among the fleets on the fishing grounds and the organization of the Deep Sea Mission when this work was done when the fight had gone out of it doctor Grenfell looked for another field for yet another need and found it on that barren and inhospitable coast the Labrador whose only harvest field is the sea Six hundred miles of almost barren rock with outlying uncharted ledges worn smooth by ice else still more vessels would have found wreckage there a scant constant population of hardy fishermen and their families pious and God fearing most of them but largely at the mercy of the local traders who took their pay in fish for the bare necessities of living with a large account always on the trader s side with such medical aid and ministration as came only occasionally by the infrequent mail boat and not at all in the long winter months when the coast was firm beset with ice to such a place came doctor Grenfell in eighteen ninety two to cast in his lot with its inhabitants to live there so long as he should to die there were it God s will As it stands to day the Mission to Deep Sea Fishermen which doctor Grenfell represents administers and animates on the Labrador coast not only brings hope new courage and spiritual comfort to an isolated people in a desolate land but cares for the sick and injured in its four hospitals and dispensary provides house visitation by means of dog sledge journeys covering hundreds of miles in a year teaches wholesome and righteous living conducts cooeperative stores provides for orphans and for families bereft of the bread winners by accidents of the sea encourages thrift and administers justice and adds to the wage earning capacity and therefore food obtaining power by operating a sawmill a schooner building yard and other productive industries 
3923_181420_000039_000000	train-clean-360	To accomplish this to make of the scattered settlements a united and independent people to safeguard their future by such measures as the establishment of a Seamen s Institute at saint John s Newfoundland and the insurance of communication with the outside world and to raise by personal solicitation the money needed for these enterprises requires an unusual personality 
none	none	Faith courage insight foresight the power to win and the ability to command all of these and more of like qualities are embodied and portrayed in doctor Grenfell CLARENCE JOHN BLAKE ADRIFT ON AN ICE PAN It was Easter Sunday at saint Anthony in the year nineteen oh eight but with us in northern Newfoundland still winter Everything was covered with snow and ice I was walking back after morning service when a boy came running over from the hospital with the news that a large team of dogs had come from sixty miles to the southward to get a doctor on a very urgent case It was that of a young man on whom we had operated about a fortnight before for an acute bone disease in the thigh The people had allowed the wound to close the poisoned matter had accumulated and we thought we should have to remove the leg There was obviously therefore no time to be lost So having packed up the necessary instruments dressings and drugs and having fitted out the dog sleigh with my best dogs I started at once the messengers following me with their team My team was an especially good one On many a long journey they had stood by me and pulled me out of difficulties by their sagacity and endurance To a lover of his dogs as every Christian man must be each one had become almost as precious as a child to its mother They were beautiful beasts Brin the cleverest leader on the coast Doc a large gentle beast the backbone of the team for power Spy a wiry powerful black and white dog Moody a lop eared black and tan in his third season a plodder that never looked behind him Watch the youngster of the team long legged and speedy with great liquid eyes and a Gordon setter coat Sue a large dark Eskimo the image of a great black wolf with her sharp pointed and perpendicular ears for she harked back to her wild ancestry Jerry a large roan colored slut the quickest of all my dogs on her feet and so affectionate that her overtures of joy had often sent me sprawling on my back Jack a jet black gentle natured dog more like a retriever that always ran next the sledge and never looked back but everlastingly pulled straight ahead running always with his nose to the ground Illustration THE SETTLEMENT AT saint ANTHONY It was late in April when there is always the risk of getting wet through the ice so that I was carefully prepared with spare outfit which included a change of garments snow shoes rifle compass axe and oilskin overclothes The messengers were anxious that their team should travel back with mine for they were slow at best and needed a lead My dogs however being a powerful team could not be held back and though I managed to wait twice for their sleigh I had reached a village about twenty miles on the journey before nightfall and had fed the dogs and was gathering a few people for prayers when they caught me up During the night the wind shifted to the northeast which brought in fog and rain softened the snow and made travelling very bad besides heaving a heavy sea into the bay Our drive next morning would be somewhat over forty miles the first ten miles on an arm of the sea on salt water ice Illustration ON A JOURNEY In order not to be separated too long from my friends I sent them ahead two hours before me appointing a rendezvous in a log tilt that we have built in the woods as a halfway house There is no one living on all that long coast line and to provide against accidents which have happened more than once we built this hut to keep dry clothing food and drugs in The first rain of the year was falling when I started and I was obliged to keep on what we call the ballicaters or ice barricades much farther up the bay than I had expected The sea of the night before had smashed the ponderous covering of ice right to the landwash There were great gaping chasms between the enormous blocks which we call pans and half a mile out it was all clear water An island three miles out had preserved a bridge of ice however and by crossing a few cracks I managed to reach it From the island it was four miles across to a rocky promontory a course that would be several miles shorter than going round the shore Here as far as the eye could reach the ice seemed good though it was very rough Obviously it had been smashed up by the sea and then packed in again by the strong wind from the northeast and I thought it had frozen together solid All went well till I was about a quarter of a mile from the landing point Then the wind suddenly fell and I noticed that I was travelling over loose sish which was like porridge and probably many feet deep By stabbing down I could drive my whip handle through the thin coating of young ice that was floating on it The sish ice consists of the tiny fragments where the large pans have been pounding together on the heaving sea like the stones of Freya s grinding mill So quickly did the wind now come off shore and so quickly did the packed slob relieved of the wind pressure run abroad that already I could not see one pan larger than ten feet square moreover the ice was loosening so rapidly that I saw that retreat was absolutely impossible Neither was there any way to get off the little pan I was surveying from There was not a moment to lose I tore off my oilskins threw myself on my hands and knees by the side of the komatik to give a larger base to hold and shouted to my team to go ahead for the shore Before we had gone twenty yards the dogs got frightened hesitated for a moment and the komatik instantly sank into the slob It was necessary then for the dogs to pull much harder so that they now began to sink in also Earlier in the season the father of the very boy I was going to operate on had been drowned in this same way his dogs tangling their traces around him in the slob This flashed into my mind and I managed to loosen my sheath knife scramble forward find the traces in the water and cut them holding on to the leader s trace wound round my wrist Illustration TRAVELLING ON BROKEN ICE Being in the water I could see no piece of ice that would bear anything up But there was as it happened a piece of snow frozen together like a large snowball about twenty five yards away near where my leading dog Brin was wallowing in the slob Upon this he very shortly climbed his long trace of ten fathoms almost reaching there before he went into the water This dog has weird black markings on his face giving him the appearance of wearing a perpetual grin After climbing out on the snow as if it were the most natural position in the world he deliberately shook the ice and water from his long coat and then turned round to look for me As he sat perched up there out of the water he seemed to be grinning with satisfaction The other dogs were hopelessly bogged Indeed we were like flies in treacle Gradually I hauled myself along the line that was still tied to my wrist till without any warning the dog turned round and slipped out of his harness and then once more turned his grinning face to where I was struggling It was impossible to make any progress through the sish ice by swimming so I lay there and thought all would soon be over only wondering if any one would ever know how it happened There was no particular horror attached to it and in fact I began to feel drowsy as if I could easily go to sleep when suddenly I saw the trace of another big dog that had himself gone through before he reached the pan and though he was close to it was quite unable to force his way out Along this I hauled myself using him as a bow anchor but much bothered by the other dogs as I passed them one of which got on my shoulder pushing me farther down into the ice There was only a yard or so more when I had passed my living anchor and soon I lay with my dogs around me on the little piece of slob ice I had to help them on to it working them through the lane that I had made Illustration PART OF doctor GRENFELL S TEAM The piece of ice we were on was so small it was obvious we must soon all be drowned if we remained upon it as it drifted seaward into more open water If we were to save our lives no time was to be lost When I stood up I could see about twenty yards away a larger pan floating amidst the sish like a great flat raft and if we could get on to it we should postpone at least for a time the death that already seemed almost inevitable It was impossible to reach it without a life line as I had already learned to my cost and the next problem was how to get one there Marvellous to relate when I had first fallen through after I had cut the dogs adrift without any hope left of saving myself I had not let my knife sink but had fastened it by two half hitches to the back of one of the dogs To my great joy there it was still and shortly I was at work cutting all the sealskin traces still hanging from the dogs harnesses and splicing them together into one long line These I divided and fastened to the backs of my two leaders tying the near ends round my two wrists I then pointed out to Brin the pan I wanted to reach and tried my best to make them go ahead giving them the full length of my lines from two coils My long sealskin moccasins reaching to my thigh were full of ice and water These I took off and tied separately on the dogs backs My coat hat gloves and overalls I had already lost At first nothing would induce the two dogs to move and though I threw them off the pan two or three times they struggled back upon it which perhaps was only natural because as soon as they fell through they could see nowhere else to make for To me however this seemed to spell the end Fortunately I had with me a small black spaniel almost a featherweight with large furry paws called Jack who acts as my mascot and incidentally as my retriever This at once flashed into my mind and I felt I had still one more chance for life So I spoke to him and showed him the direction and then threw a piece of ice toward the desired goal Without a moment s hesitation he made a dash for it and to my great joy got there safely the tough scale of sea ice carrying his weight bravely At once I shouted to him to lie down and this too he immediately did looking like a little black fuzz ball on the white setting My leaders could now see him seated there on the new piece of floe and when once more I threw them off they understood what I wanted and fought their way to where they saw the spaniel carrying with them the line that gave me the one chance for my life The other dogs followed them and after painful struggling all got out again except one Taking all the run that I could get on my little pan I made a dive slithering with the impetus along the surface till once more I sank through After a long fight however I was able to haul myself by the long traces on to this new pan having taken care beforehand to tie the harnesses to which I was holding under the dogs bellies so that they could not slip them off But alas the pan I was now on was not large enough to bear us and was already beginning to sink so this process had to be repeated immediately I now realized that though we had been working toward the shore we had been losing ground all the time for the off shore wind had already driven us a hundred yards farther out But the widening gap kept full of the pounded ice through which no man could possibly go I had decided I would rather stake my chances on a long swim even than perish by inches on the floe as there was no likelihood whatever of being seen and rescued But keenly though I watched not a streak even of clear water appeared the interminable sish rising from below and filling every gap as it appeared We were now resting on a piece of ice about ten by twelve feet which as I found when I came to examine it was not ice at all but simply snow covered slob frozen into a mass and I feared it would very soon break up in the general turmoil of the heavy sea which was increasing as the ice drove off shore before the wind At first we drifted in the direction of a rocky point on which a heavy surf was breaking Here I thought once again to swim ashore But suddenly we struck a rock A large piece broke off the already small pan and what was left swung round in the backwash and started right out to sea There was nothing for it now but to hope for a rescue Alas there was little possibility of being seen As I have already mentioned no one lives around this big bay My only hope was that the other komatik knowing I was alone and had failed to keep my tryst would perhaps come back to look for me This however as it proved they did not do The westerly wind was rising all the time our coldest wind at this time of the year coming as it does over the Gulf ice It was tantalizing as I stood with next to nothing on the wind going through me and every stitch soaked in ice water to see my well stocked komatik some fifty yards away It was still above water with food hot tea in a thermos bottle dry clothing matches wood and everything on it for making a fire to attract attention It is easy to see a dark object on the ice in the daytime for the gorgeous whiteness shows off the least thing But the tops of bushes and large pieces of kelp have often deceived those looking out Moreover within our memory no man has been thus adrift on the bay ice The chances were about one in a thousand that I should be seen at all and if I were seen I should probably be mistaken for some piece of refuse To keep from freezing I cut off my long moccasins down to the feet strung out some line split the legs and made a kind of jacket which protected my back from the wind down as far as the waist I have this jacket still and my friends assure me it would make a good Sunday garment I had not drifted more than half a mile before I saw my poor komatik disappear through the ice which was every minute loosening up into the small pans that it consisted of and it seemed like a friend gone and one more tie with home and safety lost To the northward about a mile distant lay the mainland along which I had passed so merrily in the morning only it seemed a few moments before By mid day I had passed the island to which I had crossed on the ice bridge I could see that the bridge was gone now If I could reach the island I should only be marooned and destined to die of starvation But there was little chance of that for I was rapidly driving into the ever widening bay Illustration doctor GRENFELL AND JACK WITH THE JACKET MADE FROM MOCCASINS It was scarcely safe to move on my small ice raft for fear of breaking it Yet I saw I must have the skins of some of my dogs of which I had eight on the pan if I was to live the night out There was now some three to five miles between me and the north side of the bay There immense pans of Arctic ice surging to and fro on the heavy ground seas were thundering into the cliffs like medieval battering rams It was evident that even if seen I could hope for no help from that quarter before night No boat could live through the surf Unwinding the sealskin traces from my waist round which I had wound them to keep the dogs from eating them I made a slip knot passed it over the first dog s head tied it round my foot close to his neck threw him on his back and stabbed him in the heart Poor beast I loved him like a friend a beautiful dog but we could not all hope to live In fact I had no hope any of us would at that time but it seemed better to die fighting In spite of my care the struggling dog bit me rather badly in the leg I suppose my numb hands prevented my holding his throat as I could ordinarily do Moreover I must hold the knife in the wound to the end as blood on the fur would freeze solid and make the skin useless In this way I sacrificed two more large dogs receiving only one more bite though I fully expected that the pan I was on would break up in the struggle The other dogs who were licking their coats and trying to get dry apparently took no notice of the fate of their comrades but I was very careful to prevent the dying dogs crying out for the noise of fighting would probably have been followed by the rest attacking the down dog and that was too close to me to be pleasant A short shrift seemed to me better than a long one and I envied the dead dogs whose troubles were over so quickly Indeed I came to balance in my mind whether if once I passed into the open sea it would not be better by far to use my faithful knife on myself than to die by inches There seemed no hardship in the thought I seemed fully to sympathize with the Japanese view of hara kiri Working however saved me from philosophizing By the time I had skinned these dogs and with my knife and some of the harness had strung the skins together I was ten miles on my way and it was getting dark Away to the northward I could see a single light in the little village where I had slept the night before where I had received the kindly hospitality of the simple fishermen in whose comfortable homes I have spent many a night I could not help but think of them sitting down to tea with no idea that there was any one watching them for I had told them not to expect me back for three days Meanwhile I had frayed out a small piece of rope into oakum and mixed it with fat from the intestines of my dogs Alas my match box which was always chained to me had leaked and my matches were in pulp Had I been able to make a light it would have looked so unearthly out there on the sea that I felt sure they would see me But that chance was now cut off However I kept the matches hoping that I might dry them if I lived through the night While working at the dogs about every five minutes I would stand up and wave my hands toward the land I had no flag and I could not spare my shirt for wet as it was it was better than nothing in that freezing wind and anyhow it was already nearly dark Unfortunately the coves in among the cliffs are so placed that only for a very narrow space can the people in any house see the sea Indeed most of them cannot see it at all so that I could not in the least expect any one to see me even supposing it had been daylight Not daring to take any snow from the surface of my pan to break the wind with I piled up the carcasses of my dogs With my skin rug I could now sit down without getting soaked During these hours I had continually taken off all my clothes wrung them out swung them one by one in the wind and put on first one and then the other inside hoping that what heat there was in my body would thus serve to dry them In this I had been fairly successful My feet gave me most trouble for they immediately got wet again because my thin moccasins were easily soaked through on the snow I suddenly thought of the way in which the Lapps who tend our reindeer manage for dry socks They carry grass with them which they ravel up and pad into their shoes Into this they put their feet and then pack the rest with more grass tying up the top with a binder The ropes of the harness for our dogs are carefully sewed all over with two layers of flannel in order to make them soft against the dogs sides So as soon as I could sit down I started with my trusty knife to rip up the flannel Though my fingers were more or less frozen I was able also to ravel out the rope put it into my shoes and use my wet socks inside my knickerbockers where though damp they served to break the wind Then tying the narrow strips of flannel together I bound up the top of the moccasins Lapp fashion and carried the bandage on up over my knee making a ragged though most excellent puttee As to the garments I wore I had opened recently a box of football clothes I had not seen for twenty years I had found my old Oxford University football running shorts and a pair of Richmond Football Club red yellow and black stockings exactly as I wore them twenty years ago These with a flannel shirt and sweater vest were now all I had left Coat hat gloves oilskins everything else were gone and I stood there in that odd costume exactly as I stood twenty years ago on a football field reminding me of the little girl of a friend who when told she was dying asked to be dressed in her Sunday frock to go to heaven in My costume being very light dried all the quicker until afternoon Then nothing would dry anymore everything freezing stiff It had been an ideal costume to struggle through the slob ice I really believe the conventional garments missionaries are supposed to affect would have been fatal My occupation till what seemed like midnight was unravelling rope and with this I padded out my knickers inside and my shirt as well though it was a clumsy job for I could not see what I was doing Now getting my largest dog Doc as big as a wolf and weighing ninety two pounds I made him lie down so that I could cuddle round him I then wrapped the three skins around me arranging them so that I could lie on one edge while the other came just over my shoulders and head My own breath collecting inside the newly flayed skin must have had a soporific effect for I was soon fast asleep One hand I had kept warm against the curled up dog but the other being gloveless had frozen and I suddenly awoke shivering enough I thought to break my fragile pan What I took at first to be the sun was just rising but I soon found it was the moon and then I knew it was about half past twelve The dog was having an excellent time He hadn t been cuddled so warm all winter and he resented my moving with low growls till he found it wasn t another dog Illustration DOC The wind was steadily driving me now toward the open sea and I could expect short of a miracle nothing but death out there Somehow one scarcely felt justified in praying for a miracle But we have learned down here to pray for things we want and anyhow just at that moment the miracle occurred The wind fell off suddenly and came with a light air from the southward and then dropped stark calm The ice was now all abroad which I was sorry for for there was a big safe pan not twenty yards away from me If I could have got on that I might have killed my other dogs when the time came and with their coats I could hope to hold out for two or three days more and with the food and drink their bodies would offer me need not at least die of hunger or thirst To tell the truth they were so big and strong I was half afraid to tackle them with only a sheath knife on my small and unstable raft But it was now freezing hard I knew the calm water between us would form into cakes and I had to recognize that the chance of getting near enough to escape on to it was gone If on the other hand the whole bay froze solid again I had yet another possible chance For my pan would hold together longer and I should be opposite another village called Goose Cove at daylight and might possibly be seen from there I knew that the komatiks there would be starting at daybreak over the hills for a parade of Orangemen about twenty miles away Possibly therefore I might be seen as they climbed the hills So I lay down and went to sleep again It seems impossible to say how long one sleeps but I woke with a sudden thought in my mind that I must have a flag but again I had no pole and no flag However I set to work in the dark to disarticulate the legs of my dead dogs which were now frozen stiff and which were all that offered a chance of carrying anything like a distress signal Cold as it was I determined to sacrifice my shirt for that purpose with the first streak of daylight It took a long time in the dark to get the legs off and when I had patiently marled them together with old harness rope and the remains of the skin traces it was the heaviest and crookedest flag pole it has ever been my lot to see I had had no food from six o clock the morning before when I had eaten porridge and bread and butter I had however a rubber band which I had been wearing instead of one of my garters and I chewed that for twenty four hours It saved me from thirst and hunger oddly enough It was not possible to get a drink from my pan for it was far too salty But anyhow that thought did not distress me much for as from time to time I heard the cracking and grinding of the newly formed slob it seemed that my devoted boat must inevitably soon go to pieces At last the sun rose and the time came for the sacrifice of my shirt So I stripped and much to my surprise found it not half so cold as I had anticipated I now re formed my dog skins with the raw side out so that they made a kind of coat quite rivalling Joseph s But with the rising of the sun the frost came out of the joints of my dogs legs and the friction caused by waving it made my flag pole almost tie itself in knots Still I could raise it three or four feet above my head which was very important Now however I found that instead of being as far out at sea as I had reckoned I had drifted back in a northwesterly direction and was off some cliffs known as Ireland Head Near these there was a little village looking seaward whence I should certainly have been seen But as I had myself earlier in the winter been night bound at this place I had learnt there was not a single soul living there at all this winter The people had all as usual migrated to the winter houses up the bay where they get together for schooling and social purposes I soon found it was impossible to keep waving so heavy a flag all the time and yet I dared not sit down for that might be the exact moment some one would be in a position to see me from the hills The only thing in my mind was how long I could stand up and how long go on waving that pole at the cliffs Once or twice I thought I saw men against their snowy faces which I judged were about five and a half miles from me but they were only trees Once also I thought I saw a boat approaching A glittering object kept appearing and disappearing on the water but it was only a small piece of ice sparkling in the sun as it rose on the surface I think that the rocking of my cradle up and down on the waves had helped me to sleep for I felt as well as ever I did in my life and with the hope of a long sunny day I felt sure I was good to last another twenty four hours if my boat would hold out and not rot under the sun s rays Each time I sat down to rest my big dog Doc came and kissed my face and then walked to the edge of the ice pan returning again to where I was huddled up as if to say Why don t you come along Surely it is time to start The other dogs also were now moving about very restlessly occasionally trying to satisfy their hunger by gnawing at the dead bodies of their brothers I determined at mid day to kill a big Eskimo dog and drink his blood as I had read only a few days before in Farthest North of doctor Nansen s doing that is if I survived the battle with him I could not help feeling even then my ludicrous position and I thought if ever I got ashore again I should have to laugh at myself standing hour after hour waving my shirt at those lofty cliffs which seemed to assume a kind of sardonic grin so that I could almost imagine they were laughing at me At times I could not help thinking of the good breakfast that my colleagues were enjoying at the back of those same cliffs and of the snug fire and the comfortable room which we call our study I can honestly say that from first to last not a single sensation of fear entered my mind even when I was struggling in the slob ice Somehow it did not seem unnatural I had been through the ice half a dozen times before For the most part I felt very sleepy and the idea was then very strong in my mind that I should soon reach the solution of the mysteries that I had been preaching about for so many years Only the previous night Easter Sunday at prayers in the cottage we had been discussing the fact that the soul was entirely separate from the body that Christ s idea of the body as the temple in which the soul dwells is so amply borne out by modern science We had talked of thoughts from that admirable book Brain and Personality by doctor Thompson of New York and also of the same subject in the light of a recent operation performed at the Johns Hopkins Hospital by doctor Harvey Cushing The doctor had removed from a man s brain two large cystic tumors without giving the man an anaesthetic and the patient had kept up a running conversation with him all the while the doctor s fingers were working in his brain It had seemed such a striking proof that ourselves and our bodies are two absolutely different things Our eternal life has always been with me a matter of faith It seems to me one of those problems that must always be a mystery to knowledge But my own faith in this matter had been so untroubled that it seemed now almost natural to be leaving through this portal of death from an ice pan In many ways also I could see how a death of this kind might be of value to the particular work that I am engaged in Except for my friends I had nothing I could think of to regret whatever Certainly I should like to have told them the story But then one does not carry folios of paper in running shorts which have no pockets and all my writing gear had gone by the board with the komatik I could still see a testimonial to myself some distance away in my khaki overalls which I had left on another pan in the struggle of the night before They seemed a kind of company and would possibly be picked up and suggest the true story Running through my head all the time quite unbidden were the words of the old hymn My God my Father while I stray Far from my home on life s dark way Oh teach me from my heart to say Thy will be done It is a hymn we hardly ever sing out here and it was an unconscious memory of my boyhood days It was a perfect morning a cobalt sky an ultramarine sea a golden sun an almost wasteful extravagance of crimson over hills of purest snow which caught a reflected glow from rock and crag Between me and the hills lay miles of rough ice and long veins of thin black slob that had formed during the night For the foreground there was my poor gruesome pan bobbing up and down on the edge of the open sea stained with blood and littered with carcasses and debris It was smaller than last night and I noticed also that the new ice from the water melted under the dogs bodies had been formed at the expense of its thickness Five dogs myself in colored football costume and a bloody dogskin cloak with a gay flannel shirt on a pole of frozen dogs legs completed the picture The sun was almost hot by now and I was conscious of a surplus of heat in my skin coat I began to look longingly at one of my remaining dogs for an appetite will rise even on an ice pan and that made me think of fire So once again I inspected my matches Alas the heads were in paste all but three or four blue top wax ones These I now laid out to dry while I searched about on my snow pan to see if I could get a piece of transparent ice to make a burning glass For I was pretty sure that with all the unravelled tow I had stuffed into my leggings and with the fat of my dogs I could make smoke enough to be seen if only I could get a light I had found a piece which I thought would do and had gone back to wave my flag which I did every two minutes when I suddenly thought I saw again the glitter of an oar It did not seem possible however for it must be remembered it was not water which lay between me and the land but slob ice which a mile or two inside me was very heavy Even if people had seen me I did not think they could get through though I knew that the whole shore would then be trying Moreover there was no smoke rising on the land to give me hope that I had been seen There had been no gun flashes in the night and I felt sure that had any one seen me there would have been a bonfire on every hill to encourage me to keep going So I gave it up and went on with my work But the next time I went back to my flag the glitter seemed very distinct and though it kept disappearing as it rose and fell on the surface I kept my eyes strained upon it for my dark spectacles had been lost and I was partly snowblind I waved my flag as high as I could raise it broadside on At last beside the glint of the white oar I made out the black streak of the hull I knew that if the pan held on for another hour I should be all right With that strange perversity of the human intellect the first thing I thought of was what trophies I could carry with my luggage from the pan and I pictured the dog bone flagstaff adorning my study The dogs actually ate it afterwards I thought of preserving my ragged puttees with our collection of curiosities I lost no time now at the burning glass My whole mind was devoted to making sure I should be seen and I moved about as much as I dared on the raft waving my sorry token aloft At last there could be no doubt about it the boat was getting nearer and nearer I could see that my rescuers were frantically waving and when they came within shouting distance I heard some one cry out Don t get excited Keep on the pan where you are They were infinitely more excited than I Already to me it seemed just as natural now to be saved as half an hour before it had seemed inevitable I should be lost and had my rescuers only known as I did the sensation of a bath in that ice when you could not dry yourself afterwards they need not have expected me to follow the example of the apostle Peter and throw myself into the water As the man in the bow leaped from the boat on to my ice raft and grasped both my hands in his not a word was uttered I could see in his face the strong emotions he was trying hard to force back though in spite of himself tears trickled down his cheeks It was the same with each of the others of my rescuers nor was there any reason to be ashamed of them These were not the emblems of weak sentimentality but the evidences of the realization of the deepest and noblest emotion of which the human heart is capable the vision that God has use for us his creatures the sense of that supreme joy of the Christ the joy of unselfish service After the hand shake and swallowing a cup of warm tea that had been thoughtfully packed in a bottle we hoisted in my remaining dogs and started for home To drive the boat home there were not only five Newfoundland fishermen at the oars but five men with Newfoundland muscles in their backs and five as brave hearts as ever beat in the bodies of human beings So slowly but steadily we forged through to the shore now jumping out on to larger pans and forcing them apart with the oars now hauling the boat out and dragging her over when the jam of ice packed tightly in by the rising wind was impossible to get through otherwise My first question when at last we found our tongues was How ever did you happen to be out in the boat in this ice To my astonishment they told me that the previous night four men had been away on a long headland cutting out some dead harp seals that they had killed in the fall and left to freeze up in a rough wooden store they had built there and that as they were leaving for home my pan of ice had drifted out clear of Hare Island and one of them with his keen fisherman s eyes had seen something unusual They at once returned to their village saying there was something alive drifting out to sea on the floe ice But their report had been discredited for the people thought that it could be only the top of some tree All the time I had been driving along I knew that there was one man on that coast who had a good spy glass He tells me he instantly got up in the midst of his supper on hearing the news and hurried over the cliffs to the lookout carrying his trusty spy glass with him Immediately dark as it was he saw that without any doubt there was a man out on the ice Indeed he saw me wave my hands every now and again towards the shore By a very easy process of reasoning on so uninhabited a shore he at once knew who it was though some of the men argued that it must be some one else Little had I thought as night was closing in that away on that snowy hilltop lay a man with a telescope patiently searching those miles of ice for me Hastily they rushed back to the village and at once went down to try to launch a boat but that proved to be impossible Miles of ice lay between them and me the heavy sea was hurling great blocks on the landwash and night was already falling the wind blowing hard on shore The whole village was aroused and messengers were despatched at once along the coast and lookouts told off to all the favorable points so that while I considered myself a laughing stock bowing with my flag to those unresponsive cliffs there were really many eyes watching me One man told me that with his glass he distinctly saw me waving the shirt flag There was little slumber that night in the villages and even the men told me there were few dry eyes as they thought of the impossibility of saving me from perishing We are not given to weeping overmuch on this shore but there are tears that do a man honor Before daybreak this fine volunteer crew had been gotten together The boat with such a force behind it of will power would I believe have gone through anything And after seeing the heavy breakers through which we were guided loaded with their heavy ice battering rams when at last we ran through the harbor mouth with the boat on our return I knew well what wives and children had been thinking of when they saw their loved ones put out Only two years ago I remember a fisherman s wife watching her husband and three sons take out a boat to bring in a stranger that was showing flags for a pilot But the boat and its occupants have not yet come back Every soul in the village was on the beach as we neared the shore Every soul was waiting to shake hands when I landed Even with the grip that one after another gave me some no longer trying to keep back the tears I did not find out my hands were frost burnt a fact I have not been slow to appreciate since however I must have been a weird sight as I stepped ashore tied up in rags stuffed out with oakum wrapped in the bloody skins of dogs with no hat coat or gloves besides and only a pair of short knickers It must have seemed to some as if it were the old man of the sea coming ashore But no time was wasted before a pot of tea was exactly where I wanted it to be and some hot stew was locating itself where I had intended an hour before the blood of one of my remaining dogs should have gone Rigged out in the warm garments that fishermen wear I started with a large team as hard as I could race for the hospital for I had learnt that the news had gone over that I was lost It was soon painfully impressed upon me that I could not much enjoy the ride for I had to be hauled like a log up the hills my feet being frost burnt so that I could not walk Had I guessed this before going into the house I might have avoided much trouble It is time to bring this egotistic narrative to an end Jack lies curled up by my feet while I write this short account Brin is once again leading and lording it over his fellows Doc and the other survivors are not forgotten now that we have again returned to the less romantic episodes of a mission hospital life There stands in our hallway a bronze tablet to the memory of three noble dogs Moody Watch and Spy whose lives were given for mine on the ice In my home in England my brother has placed a duplicate tablet and has added these words Not one of them is forgotten before your Father which is in heaven And this I most fully believe to be true The boy whose life I was intent on saving was brought to the hospital a day or two later in a boat the ice having cleared off the coast not to return for that season He was operated on successfully and is even now on the high road to recovery We all love life I was glad to be back once more with possibly a new lease of it before me I had learned on the pan many things but chiefly that the one cause for regret when we look back on a life which we think is closed forever will be the fact that we have wasted its opportunities As I went to sleep that first night there still rang in my ears the same verse of the old hymn which had been my companion on the ice Thy will not mine O Lord Illustration MEMORIAL TABLET AT saint ANTHONY S HOSPITAL NEWFOUNDLAND TO THE MEMORY OF THREE NOBLE DOGS MOODY WATCH SPY WHOSE LIVES WERE GIVEN FOR MINE ON THE ICE April twenty first nineteen oh eight WILFRED GRENFELL saint ANTHONY APPENDIX One of doctor Grenfell s volunteer helpers Miss Luther of Providence R I contributes the following account of the rescue as recited in the Newfoundland vernacular by one of the rescuing party One day about a week after doctor Grenfell s return says Miss Luther two men came in from Griquet fifteen miles away They had walked all that distance though the trail was heavy with soft snow and they often sank to their waists and waded through brooks and ponds We just felt we must see the doctor and tell him what t would a meant to us if he d been lost Perhaps nothing but the doctor s own tale could be more graphic than what was told by George Andrews one of the crew who rescued him THE RESCUERS STORY It was wonderfu bad weather that Monday mornin Th doctor was to Lock s Cove None o we thought o is startin out I don t think th doctor hisself thought o goin at first an then e sent th two men on ahead for to meet us at th tilt an said like s e was goin after all Twas even when us knew e was on th ice George Davis seen un first E went to th cliff to look for seal It was after sunset an half dark but e thought e saw somethin on th ice an e ran for George Read an e got is spy glass an made out a man an dogs on a pan an knowed it war th doctor It was too dark fur we t go t un but us never slept at all all night I couldn sleep Us watched th wind an knew if it didn blow too hard us could get un though e was then three mile off a ready So us waited for th daylight No one said who was goin out in th boat Un ud say Is you goin An another Is you I didn say but I knowed what I d do As soon as twas light us went to th cliff wi th spy glass to see if us could see un but thar warn t nothin in sight Us know by the wind whar t look fur un an us launched th boat George Read an is two sons an George Davis what seen un first an me was th crew George Read was skipper man an th rest was just youngsters The sun was warm you mind twas a fine mornin an us started in our shirt an braces fur us knowed thar d be hard work to do I knowed thar was a chance o not comin back at all but it didn make no difference I knowed I d as good a chance as any an twa for th doctor an is life s worth many an somehow I couldn let a man go out like dat wi out tryin fur un an I think us all felt th same Us ad a good strong boat an four oars an took a hot kettle o tea an food for a week for us thought u d ave t go far an p rhaps lose th boat an ave t walk ashore un th ice I din ope to find the doctor alive an kept lookin for a sign of un on th pans Twa no easy gettin to th pans wi a big sea runnin Th big pans ud sometimes heave together an near crush th boat an sometimes us ad t git out an haul her over th ice t th water again Then us come t th slob ice where th pan ad ground together an twas all thick an that was worse n any Us saw th doctor about twenty minutes afore us got t un E was wavin is flag an I seen im E was on a pan no bigger n this flor an I dunno what ever kep un fro goin abroad for twasn t ice twas packed snow Th pan was away from even th slob floatin by hisself an th open water all roun an twas just across fro Goose Cove an outside o that there d been no hope I think th way th pan held together was on account o th dogs bodies meltin it an t froze hard durin th night E was level with th water an th sea washin over us all th time When us got near un it didn seem like twas th doctor E looked so old an is face such a queer color E was very solemn like when us took un an th dogs on th boat No un felt like sayin much an e ardly said nothin till us gave un some tea an loaf an then e talked I s pose e was sort o faint like Th first thing e said was how wonderfu sorry e was o gettin into such a mess an givin we th trouble o comin out for un Us tol un not to think o that us was glad to do it for un an e d done it for any one o we many times over if e ad th chance an so e would An then e fretted about th b y e was goin to see it bein too late to reach un an us tol un is life was worth so much more n th b y fur e could save others an th b y couldn But e still fretted E ad ripped th dog harnesses an stuffed th oakum in th legs o is pants to keep un warm E showed it to we An e cut off th tops o is boots to keep th draught from is back E must a worked ard all night E said e droled off once or twice but th night seemed wonderfu long Us took un off th pan at about half past seven an ad a ard fight gettin in th sea still runnin igh E said e was proud to see us comin for un and so e might for it grew wonderfu cold in th day and th sea so igh the pan couldn a lived outside E wouldn stop when us got ashore but must go right on an when e ad dry clothes an was a bit warm us sent un to saint Anthony with a team Th next night an for nights after I couldn sleep I d keep seein that man standin on th ice an I d be sorter half awake like sayin But not th doctor Sure not th doctor There was silence for a few moments and George Andrews looked out across the blue harbor to the sea E sent us watches an spy glasses said he an pictures o hisself that one o you took o un made large an in a frame George Read an me ad th watches an th others ad th spy glasses Ere s th watch It as In memory o April
