particular paper edition We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance of the official release dates leaving time for better editing Please note neither this list nor its contents are final till midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at Midnight Central Time of the last day of the stated month

first week of the next month Since our ftp program has a bug in it that scrambles the date tried to fix and failed a look at the file size will have to do but we will try to see a new copy has at least one byte more or less Information about Project Gutenberg one page We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work The time it takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hours to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright searched and analyzed the copyright letters written et cetera This projected audience is one hundred million readers If our value per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce two dollars million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty six text files per month or four hundred thirty two more Etexts in nineteen ninety nine for a total of two thousand If these reach just ten of the computerized population then the total should reach over two hundred billion Etexts given away this year The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext Files by December thirty one two thousand one ten thousand x one hundred million one Trillion This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers which is only five of the present number of computer users At our revised rates of production we will reach only one third of that goal by the end of two thousand one or about three thousand three hundred thirty three Etexts unless we manage to get some real funding currently our funding is mostly from Michael Hart s salary at Carnegie Mellon University and an assortment of sporadic gifts this salary is only good for a few more years so we are looking for something to replace it as we don t want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person We need your donations more than ever

none	none	words and phrases exhibiting an extraordinary vividness of descriptive and imaginative power yet often set in a seemingly whimsical or even rugged frame They are here published as they were written with very few and superficial changes although it is fair to say that the titles have been assigned almost invariably by the editors In many cases these verses will seem to the reader like poetry torn up by the roots with rain and dew and earth still clinging to them giving a freshness and a fragrance not otherwise to be conveyed In other cases as in the few poems of shipwreck or of mental conflict we can only wonder at the gift of vivid imagination by which this recluse woman can delineate by a few touches the very crises of physical or mental struggle And sometimes again we catch glimpses of a lyric strain sustained perhaps but for a line or two at a time and making the reader regret its sudden cessation But the main quality of these poems is that of extraordinary grasp and insight uttered with an uneven vigor sometimes exasperating seemingly wayward but really unsought and inevitable After all when a thought takes one s breath away a lesson on grammar seems an impertinence As Ruskin wrote in his earlier and better days No weight nor mass nor beauty of execution can outweigh one grain or fragment of thought Thomas Wentworth Higginson TRANSCRIBER S NOTE As is well documented Emily Dickinson s poems were edited in these early editions by her friends better to fit the conventions of the times In particular her dashes often small enough to appear as dots became commas and semi colons In the second series of poems published a facsimile of her handwritten poem which her editors titled Renunciation is given and I here transcribe that manuscript as faithfully as I can showing underlined words thus There came a day at Summer s full Entirely for me I thought that such were for the Saints Where Resurrections be The sun as common went abroad The flowers accustomed blew As if no soul that solstice passed Which maketh all things new The time was scarce profaned by speech The falling of a word Was needless as at Sacrament The Wardrobe of our Lord Each was to each the sealed church Permitted to commune this time Lest we too awkward show At Supper of the Lamb The hours slid fast as hours will Clutched tight by greedy hands So faces on two Decks look back Bound to opposing lands And so when all the time had leaked Without external sound Each bound the other s Crucifix We gave no other bond Sufficient troth that we shall rise Deposed at length the Grave To that new marriage Justified through Calvaries of

240_160593_000092_000000	train-clean-360	THE WIFE 
none	none	She rose to his requirement dropped The playthings of her life To take the honorable work Of woman and of wife If aught she missed in her new day Of amplitude or awe Or first prospective or the gold In using wore away It lay unmentioned as the sea Develops pearl and weed But only to himself is known The fathoms they abide XVIII APOTHEOSIS Come slowly Eden Lips unused to thee Bashful sip thy jasmines As the fainting bee Reaching late his flower Round her chamber hums Counts his nectars enters And is lost in balms III NATURE I New feet within my garden go New fingers stir the sod A troubadour upon the elm Betrays the solitude New children play upon the green New weary sleep below And still the pensive spring returns And still the punctual snow II MAY FLOWER Pink small and punctual Aromatic low Covert in April Candid in May Dear to the moss Known by the knoll Next to the robin In every human soul Bold little beauty Bedecked with thee Nature forswears Antiquity III WHY THE murmur of a bee A witchcraft yieldeth me If any ask me why T were easier to die Than tell The red upon the hill Taketh away my will If anybody sneer Take care for God is here That s all The breaking of the day Addeth to my degree If any ask me how Artist who drew me so Must tell IV Perhaps you d like to buy a flower But I could never sell If you would like to borrow Until the daffodil Unties her yellow bonnet Beneath the village door Until the bees from clover rows Their hock and sherry draw Why I will lend until just then But not an hour more V The pedigree of honey Does not concern the bee A clover any time to him Is aristocracy VI A SERVICE OF SONG Some keep the Sabbath going to church I keep it staying at home With a bobolink for a chorister And an orchard for a dome Some keep the Sabbath in surplice I just wear my wings And instead of tolling the bell for church Our little sexton sings God preaches a noted clergyman And the sermon is never long So instead of getting to heaven at last I m going all along VII The bee is not afraid of me I know the butterfly The pretty people in the woods Receive me cordially The brooks laugh louder when I come The breezes madder play Wherefore mine eyes thy silver mists Wherefore O summer s day VIII SUMMER S ARMIES Some rainbow coming from the fair Some vision of the world Cashmere I confidently see Or else a peacock s purple train Feather by feather on the plain Fritters itself away The dreamy butterflies bestir Lethargic pools resume the whir Of last year s sundered tune From some old fortress on the sun Baronial bees march one by one In murmuring platoon The robins stand as thick to day As flakes of snow stood yesterday On fence and roof and twig The orchis binds her feather on For her old lover Don the Sun Revisiting the bog Without commander countless still The regiment of wood and hill In bright detachment stand Behold Whose multitudes are these The children of whose turbaned seas Or what Circassian land IX THE GRASS The grass so little has to do A sphere of simple green With only butterflies to brood And bees to entertain And stir all day to pretty tunes The breezes fetch along And hold the sunshine in its lap And bow to everything And thread the dews all night like pearls And make itself so fine A duchess were too common For such a noticing And even when it dies to pass In odors so divine As lowly spices gone to sleep Or amulets of pine And then to dwell in sovereign barns And dream the days away The grass so little has to do I wish I were the hay X A little road not made of man Enabled of the eye Accessible to thill of bee Or cart of butterfly If town it have beyond itself T is that I cannot say I only sigh no vehicle Bears me along that way XI SUMMER SHOWER A drop fell on the apple tree Another on the roof A half a dozen kissed the eaves And made the gables laugh A few went out to help the brook That went to help the sea Myself conjectured Were they pearls What necklaces could be The dust replaced in hoisted roads The birds jocoser sung The sunshine threw his hat away The orchards spangles hung The breezes brought dejected lutes And bathed them in the glee The East put out a single flag And signed the fete away XII PSALM OF THE DAY A something in a summer s day As sIow her flambeaux burn away Which solemnizes me A something in a summer s noon An azure depth a wordless tune Transcending ecstasy And still within a summer s night A something so transporting bright I clap my hands to see Then veil my too inspecting face Lest such a subtle shimmering grace Flutter too far for me The wizard fingers never rest The purple brook within the breast Still chafes its narrow bed Still rears the East her amber flag Guides still the sun along the crag His caravan of red Like flowers that heard the tale of dews But never deemed the dripping prize Awaited their low brows Or bees that thought the summer s name Some rumor of delirium No summer could for them Or Arctic creature dimly stirred By tropic hint some travelled bird Imported to the wood Or wind s bright signal to the ear Making that homely and severe Contented known before The heaven unexpected came To lives that thought their worshipping A too presumptuous psalm XIII THE SEA OF SUNSET This is the land the sunset washes These are the banks of the Yellow Sea Where it rose or whither it rushes These are the western mystery Night after night her purple traffic Strews the landing with opal bales Merchantmen poise upon horizons Dip and vanish with fairy sails XIV PURPLE CLOVER There is a flower that bees prefer And butterflies desire To gain the purple democrat The humming birds aspire And whatsoever insect pass A honey bears away Proportioned to his several dearth And her capacity Her face is rounder than the moon And ruddier than the gown Of orchis in the pasture Or rhododendron worn She doth not wait for June Before the world is green Her sturdy little countenance Against the wind is seen Contending with the grass Near kinsman to herself For privilege of sod and sun Sweet litigants for life And when the hills are full And newer fashions blow Doth not retract a single spice For pang of jealousy Her public is the noon Her providence the sun Her progress by the bee proclaimed In sovereign swerveless tune The bravest of the host Surrendering the last Nor even of defeat aware When cancelled by the frost XV THE BEE Like trains of cars on tracks of plush I hear the level bee A jar across the flowers goes Their velvet masonry Withstands until the sweet assault Their chivalry consumes While he victorious tilts away To vanquish other blooms His feet are shod with gauze His helmet is of gold His breast a single onyx With chrysoprase inlaid His labor is a chant His idleness a tune Oh for a bee s experience Of clovers and of noon XVI Presentiment is that long shadow on the lawn Indicative that suns go down The notice to the startled grass That darkness is about to pass XVII As children bid the guest good night And then reluctant turn My flowers raise their pretty lips Then put their nightgowns on As children caper when they wake Merry that it is morn My flowers from a hundred cribs Will peep and prance again XVIII Angels in the early morning May be seen the dews among Stooping plucking smiling flying Do the buds to them belong Angels when the sun is hottest May be seen the sands among Stooping plucking sighing flying Parched the flowers they bear along XIX So bashful when I spied her So pretty so ashamed So hidden in her leaflets Lest anybody find So breathless till I passed her So helpless when I turned And bore her struggling blushing Her simple haunts beyond For whom I robbed the dingle For whom betrayed the dell Many will doubtless ask me But I shall never tell XX TWO WORLDS It makes no difference abroad The seasons fit the same The mornings blossom into noons And split their pods of flame Wild flowers kindle in the woods The brooks brag all the day No blackbird bates his jargoning For passing Calvary Auto da fe and judgment Are nothing to the bee His separation from his rose To him seems misery XXI THE MOUNTAIN The mountain sat upon the plain In his eternal chair His observation omnifold His inquest everywhere The seasons prayed around his knees Like children round a sire Grandfather of the days is he Of dawn the ancestor XXII A DAY I ll tell you how the sun rose A ribbon at a time The steeples swam in amethyst The news like squirrels ran The hills untied their bonnets The bobolinks begun Then I said softly to myself That must have been the sun But how he set I know not There seemed a purple stile Which little yellow boys and girls Were climbing all the while Till when they reached the other side A dominie in gray Put gently up the evening bars And led the flock away XXIII The butterfiy s assumption gown In chrysoprase apartments hung This afternoon put on How condescending to descend And be of buttercups the friend In a New England town XXIV THE WIND Of all the sounds despatched abroad There s not a charge to me Like that old measure in the boughs That phraseless melody The wind does working like a hand Whose fingers brush the sky Then quiver down with tufts of tune Permitted gods and me When winds go round and round in bands And thrum upon the door And birds take places overhead To bear them orchestra I crave him grace of summer boughs If such an outcast be He never heard that fleshless chant Rise solemn in the tree As if some caravan of sound On deserts in the sky Had broken rank Then knit and passed In seamless company XXV DEATH AND LIFE Apparently with no surprise To any happy flower The frost beheads it at its play In accidental power The blond assassin passes on The sun proceeds unmoved To measure off another day For an approving God XXVI T WAS later when the summer went Than when the cricket came And yet we knew that gentle clock Meant nought but going home T was sooner when the cricket went Than when the winter came Yet that pathetic pendulum Keeps esoteric time XXVII INDIAN SUMMER These are the days when birds come back A very few a bird or two To take a backward look These are the days when skies put on The old old sophistries of June A blue and gold mistake Oh fraud that cannot cheat the bee Almost thy plausibility Induces my belief Till ranks of seeds their witness bear And softly through the altered air Hurries a timid leaf Oh sacrament of summer days Oh last communion in the haze Permit a child to join Thy sacred emblems to partake Thy consecrated bread to break Taste thine immortal wine XXVIII AUTUMN The morns are meeker than they were The nuts are getting brown The berry s cheek is plumper The rose is out of town The maple wears a gayer scarf The field a scarlet gown Lest I should be old fashioned I ll put a trinket on XXIX BECLOUDED The sky is low the clouds are mean A travelling flake of snow Across a barn or through a rut Debates if it will go A narrow wind complains all day How some one treated him Nature like us is sometimes caught Without her diadem XXX THE HEMLOCK I think the hemlock likes to stand Upon a marge of snow It suits his own austerity And satisfies an awe That men must slake in wilderness Or in the desert cloy An instinct for the hoar the bald Lapland s necessity The hemlock s nature thrives on cold The gnash of northern winds Is sweetest nutriment to him His best Norwegian wines To satin races he is nought But children on the Don Beneath his tabernacles play And Dnieper wrestlers run XXXI There s a certain slant of light On winter afternoons That oppresses like the weight Of cathedral tunes Heavenly hurt it gives us We can find no scar But internal difference Where the meanings are None may teach it anything T is the seal despair An imperial affliction Sent us of the air When it comes the landscape listens Shadows hold their breath When it goes t is like the distance On the look of death IV TIME AND ETERNITY I One dignity delays for all One mitred afternoon None can avoid this purple None evade this crown Coach it insures and footmen Chamber and state and throng Bells also in the village As we ride grand along What dignified attendants What service when we pause How loyally at parting Their hundred hats they raise How pomp surpassing ermine When simple you and I Present our meek escutcheon And claim the rank to die II TOO LATE Delayed till she had ceased to know Delayed till in its vest of snow Her loving bosom lay An hour behind the fleeting breath Later by just an hour than death Oh lagging yesterday Could she have guessed that it would be Could but a crier of the glee Have climbed the distant hill Had not the bliss so slow a pace Who knows but this surrendered face Were undefeated still Oh if there may departing be Any forgot by victory In her imperial round Show them this meek apparelled thing That could not stop to be a king Doubtful if it be crowned III ASTRA CASTRA Departed to the judgment A mighty afternoon Great clouds like ushers leaning Creation looking on The flesh surrendered cancelled The bodiless begun Two worlds like audiences disperse And leave the soul alone IV Safe in their alabaster chambers Untouched by morning and untouched by noon Sleep the meek members of the resurrection Rafter of satin and roof of stone Light laughs the breeze in her castle of sunshine Babbles the bee in a stolid ear Pipe the sweet birds in ignorant cadence Ah what sagacity perished here Grand go the years in the crescent above them Worlds scoop their arcs and firmaments row Diadems drop and Doges surrender Soundless as dots on a disk of snow V On this long storm the rainbow rose On this late morn the sun The clouds like listless elephants Horizons straggled down The birds rose smiling in their nests The gales indeed were done Alas how heedless were the eyes On whom the summer shone The quiet nonchalance of death No daybreak can bestir The slow archangel s syllables Must awaken her VI FROM THE CHRYSALIS My cocoon tightens colors tease I m feeling for the air A dim capacity for wings Degrades the dress I wear A power of butterfly must be The aptitude to fly Meadows of majesty concedes And easy sweeps of sky So I must baffle at the hint And cipher at the sign And make much blunder if at last I take the clew divine VII SETTING SAIL Exultation is the going Of an inland soul to sea Past the houses past the headlands Into deep eternity Bred as we among the mountains Can the sailor understand The divine intoxication Of the first league out from land VIII Look back on time with kindly eyes He doubtless did his best How softly sinks his trembling sun In human nature s west IX A train went through a burial gate A bird broke forth and sang And trilled and quivered and shook his throat Till all the churchyard rang And then adjusted his little notes And bowed and sang again Doubtless he thought it meet of him To say good by to men X I died for beauty but was scarce Adjusted in the tomb When one who died for truth was lain In an adjoining room He questioned softly why I failed For beauty I replied And I for truth the two are one We brethren are he said And so as kinsmen met a night We talked between the rooms Until the moss had reached our lips And covered up our names XI TROUBLED ABOUT MANY THINGS How many times these low feet staggered Only the soldered mouth can tell Try can you stir the awful rivet Try can you lift the hasps of steel Stroke the cool forehead hot so often Lift if you can the listless hair Handle the adamantine fingers Never a thimble more shall wear Buzz the dull flies on the chamber window Brave shines the sun through the freckled pane Fearless the cobweb swings from the ceiling Indolent housewife in daisies lain XII REAL I like a look of agony Because I know it s true Men do not sham convulsion Nor simulate a throe The eyes glaze once and that is death Impossible to feign The beads upon the forehead By homely anguish strung XIII THE FUNERAL That short potential stir That each can make but once That bustle so illustrious T is almost consequence Is the eclat of death Oh thou unknown renown That not a beggar would accept Had he the power to spurn XIV I went to thank her But she slept Her bed a funnelled stone With nosegays at the head and foot That travellers had thrown Who went to thank her But she slept T was short to cross the sea To look upon her like alive But turning back t was slow XV I ve seen a dying eye Run round and round a room In search of something as it seemed Then cloudier become And then obscure with fog And then be soldered down Without disclosing what it be T were blessed to have seen XVI REFUGE The clouds their backs together laid The north begun to push The forests galloped till they fell The lightning skipped like mice The thunder crumbled like a stuff How good to be safe in tombs Where nature s temper cannot reach Nor vengeance ever comes XVII I never saw a moor I never saw the sea Yet know I how the heather looks And what a wave must be I never spoke with God Nor visited in heaven Yet certain am I of the spot As if the chart were given XVIII PLAYMATES God permits industrious angels Afternoons to play I met one forgot my school mates All for him straightway God calls home the angels promptly At the setting sun I missed mine How dreary marbles After playing Crown XIX To know just how he suffered would be dear To know if any human eyes were near To whom he could intrust his wavering gaze Until it settled firm on Paradise To know if he was patient part content Was dying as he thought or different Was it a pleasant day to die And did the sunshine face his way What was his furthest mind of home or God Or what the distant say At news that he ceased human nature On such a day And wishes had he any Just his sigh accented Had been legible to me And was he confident until Ill fluttered out in everlasting well And if he spoke what name was best What first What one broke off with At the drowsiest Was he afraid or tranquil Might he know How conscious consciousness could grow Till love that was and love too blest to be Meet and the junction be Eternity XX The last night that she lived It was a common night Except the dying this to us Made nature different We noticed smallest things Things overlooked before By this great light upon our minds Italicized as t were That others could exist While she must finish quite A jealousy for her arose So nearly infinite We waited while she passed It was a narrow time Too jostled were our souls to speak At length the notice came She mentioned and forgot Then lightly as a reed Bent to the water shivered scarce Consented and was dead And we we placed the hair And drew the head erect And then an awful leisure was Our faith to regulate XXI THE FIRST LESSON Not in this world to see his face Sounds long until I read the place Where this is said to be But just the primer to a life Unopened rare upon the shelf Clasped yet to him and me And yet my primer suits me so I would not choose a book to know Than that be sweeter wise Might some one else so learned be And leave me just my A B C Himself could have the skies XXII The bustle in a house The morning after death Is solemnest of industries Enacted upon earth The sweeping up the heart And putting love away We shall not want to use again Until eternity XXIII I reason earth is short And anguish absolute And many hurt But what of that I reason we could die The best vitality Cannot excel decay But what of that I reason that in heaven Somehow it will be even Some new equation given But what of that XXIV Afraid Of whom am I afraid Not death for who is he The porter of my father s lodge As much abasheth me Of life T were odd I fear a thing That comprehendeth me In one or more existences At Deity s decree Of resurrection Is the east Afraid to trust the morn With her fastidious forehead As soon impeach my crown XXV DYING The sun kept setting setting still No hue of afternoon Upon the village I perceived From house to house t was noon The dusk kept dropping dropping still No dew upon the grass But only on my forehead stopped And wandered in my face My feet kept drowsing drowsing still My fingers were awake Yet why so little sound myself Unto my seeming make How well I knew the light before I could not see it now T is dying I am doing but I m not afraid to know XXVI Two swimmers wrestled on the spar Until the morning sun When one turned smiling to the land O God the other one The stray ships passing spied a face Upon the waters borne With eyes in death still begging raised And hands beseeching thrown XXVII THE CHARIOT Because I could not stop for Death He kindly stopped for me The carriage held but just ourselves And Immortality We slowly drove he knew no haste And I had put away My labor and my leisure too For his civility We passed the school where children played Their lessons scarcely done We passed the fields of gazing grain We passed the setting sun We paused before a house that seemed A swelling of the ground The roof was scarcely visible The cornice but a mound Since then t is centuries but each Feels shorter than the day I first surmised the horses heads Were toward eternity XXVIII She went as quiet as the dew From a familiar flower Not like the dew did she return At the accustomed hour She dropt as softly as a star From out my summer s eve Less skilful than Leverrier It s sorer to believe XXIX RESURGAM At last to be identified At last the lamps upon thy side The rest of life to see Past midnight past the morning star Past sunrise Ah what leagues there are Between our feet and day XXX Except to heaven she is nought Except for angels lone Except to some wide wandering bee A flower superfluous blown Except for winds provincial Except by butterflies Unnoticed as a single dew That on the acre lies The smallest housewife in the grass Yet take her from the lawn And somebody has lost the face That made existence home XXXI Death is a dialogue between The spirit and the dust Dissolve says Death The Spirit Sir I have another trust Death doubts it argues from the ground The Spirit turns away Just laying off for evidence An overcoat of clay XXXII It was too late for man But early yet for God Creation impotent to help But prayer remained our side How excellent the heaven When earth cannot be had How hospitable then the face Of our old neighbor God XXXIII ALONG THE POTOMAC When I was small a woman died To day her only boy Went up from the Potomac His face all victory To look at her how slowly The seasons must have turned Till bullets clipt an angle And he passed quickly round If pride shall be in Paradise I never can decide Of their imperial conduct No person testified But proud in apparition That woman and her boy Pass back and forth before my brain As ever in the sky XXXIV The daisy follows soft the sun And when his golden walk is done Sits shyly at his feet He waking finds the flower near Wherefore marauder art thou here Because sir love is sweet We are the flower Thou the sun Forgive us if as days decline We nearer steal to Thee Enamoured of the parting west The peace the flight the amethyst Night s possibility XXXV EMANCIPATION No rack can torture me My soul s at liberty Behind this mortal bone There knits a bolder one You cannot prick with saw Nor rend with scymitar Two bodies therefore be Bind one and one will flee The eagle of his nest No easier divest And gain the sky Than mayest thou Except thyself may be Thine enemy Captivity is consciousness So s liberty XXXVI LOST I lost a world the other day Has anybody found You ll know it by the row of stars Around its forehead bound A rich man might not notice it Yet to my frugal eye Of more esteem than ducats Oh find it sir for me XXXVII If I should n t be alive When the robins come Give the one in red cravat A memorial crumb If I could n t thank you Being just asleep You will know I m trying With my granite lip XXXVIII Sleep is supposed to be By souls of sanity The shutting of the eye Sleep is the station grand Down which on either hand The hosts of witness stand Morn is supposed to be By people of degree The breaking of the day Morning has not occurred That shall aurora be East of eternity One with the banner gay One in the red array That is the break of day XXXIX I shall know why when time is over And I have ceased to wonder why Christ will explain each separate anguish In the fair schoolroom of the sky He will tell me what Peter promised And I for wonder at his woe I shall forget the drop of anguish That scalds me now that scalds me now XL I never lost as much but twice And that was in the sod Twice have I stood a beggar Before the door of God Angels twice descending Reimbursed my store Burglar banker father I am poor once more End of Project Gutenberg s Etext of Poems Series one by Emily Dickinson
