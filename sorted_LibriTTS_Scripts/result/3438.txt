5911-48574-0001	train-other-500	being in the slave brokers mart he saw a woman exposed for sale with a little maid of wonderful beauty and grace on her arm So he beckoned to the broker and asked him How much for this woman and her daughter He answered Fifty dinars
5911-48574-0002	train-other-500	Quoth Al Rabi a Write the contract of sale and take the money and give it to her owner Then he gave the broker the price and his brokerage and taking the woman and her child carried them to his house
5911-48574-0003	train-other-500	Now when the daughter of his uncle who was his wife saw the slave she said to her husband O my cousin what is this damsel He replied Of a truth I bought her for the sake of the little one on her arm
5911-48574-0004	train-other-500	for know that when she groweth up there will not be her like for beauty either in the land of the Arabs or the Ajams His wife remarked Right was thy rede

5911-48574-0005	train-other-500	What is thy name She replied O my lady

5911-48574-0007	train-other-500	and quoth he Whatso thou chooses so she said Then let us call her Naomi and he rejoined Good is thy device The little Naomi was reared with Al Rabi a s son Ni amah
none	none	 in one cradle so to speak till the twain reached the age of ten and each grew handsomer than the other and the boy used to address her O my sister and she O my brother till they came to that age when Al Rabi a said to Ni amah O my son Naomi is not thy sister but thy slave I bought her in thy name whilst thou wast yet in the cradle so call her no more sister from this day forth Quoth Ni amah 
5911-48574-0008	train-other-500	If that be so I will take her to wife Then he went to his mother and told her of this and she said to him O my son she is thy handmaid So he wedded and went in unto Naomi and loved her
none	none	 and two FN four years passed over them whilst in this condition nor was there in all Cufa a fairer girl than Naomi or a sweeter or a more graceful As she grew up she learnt the Koran and read works of science and excelled in music and playing upon all kinds of instruments and in the beauty of her singing she surpassed all the folk of her time Now one day as she sat with her husband in the wine chamber she took the lute tightened the strings and sang these two couplets While thou rt my lord

none	none	 Recourse I never need to Amru or Zayd FN five Nor aught save thee if way to me grow strait Ni amah was charmed with these verses and said to her By my life O Naomi sing to us with the tambourine and other instruments So she sang these couplets to a lively measure 
5911-48574-0010	train-other-500	By His life who holds my guiding rein I swear I ll meet on love ground parlous foe nor care
none	none	 Good sooth I ll vex revilers thee obey 
5911-48574-0011	train-other-500	And quit my slumbers and all joy forswear And for thy love I ll dig in vitals mine A grave nor shall my vitals weet tis there And Ni amah exclaimed
5911-48574-0012	train-other-500	Heaven favoured art thou O Naomi But whilst they led thus the most joyous life behold
none	none	 Al Hajjaj FN six the Viceroy of Cufa said to himself 
5911-48574-0013	train-other-500	Needs must I contrive to take this girl named Naomi and send her to the Commander of the Faithful Abd al Malik bin Marwan for he hath not in his palace her like for beauty and sweet singing So
5911-48574-0014	train-other-500	he summoned an old woman of the duennas of his wives and said to her Go to the house of Al Rabi a and foregather with the girl Naomi and combine means to carry her off for her like is not to be found on the face of the earth
none	none	 She promised to do his bidding the next morning she donned the woollen clothes of a devotee and hung around her neck a rosary of beads by the thousand 
5911-48574-0015	train-other-500	and henting in hand a staff and a leather water bottle of Yamani manufacture And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say
none	none	 When it was the Two Hundred and Thirty eighth Night 
5735-48575-0000	train-other-500	She said It hath reached me O auspicious King
none	none	 that the old woman promised to do the bidding of Al Hajjaj and whenas it was morning she donned the woollen clothes of a devotee FN seven and hung around her neck a rosary of beads by the thousand and hent in hand a staff and a leather water bottle of Yamani manufacture and fared forth crying Glory be to Allah Praised be Allah There is no god but the God Allah is Most Great There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great Nor did she leave off her lauds and her groaning in prayer whilst her heart was full of guile and wiles till she came to the house of Ni amah bin al Rabi a at the hour of noon prayer and knocked at the door 
5911-48574-0016	train-other-500	The doorkeeper opened and said to her What dost thou want Quoth she I am a poor pious woman whom the time of noon prayer hath overtaken
none	none	 and fief would I pray in this blessed place Answered the porter 
5911-48574-0017	train-other-500	O old woman this is no mosque nor oratory but the house of Ni amah son of al Rabi a
none	none	 She replied I know there is neither cathedral mosque nor oratory like the house of Ni amah bin al Rabi a 
5911-48574-0018	train-other-500	I am a chamberwoman of the palace of the Prince of True Believers and am come out for worship and the visitation of Holy Places But the porter rejoined Thou canst not enter
5911-48574-0019	train-other-500	and many words passed between them till at last she caught hold and hung to him saying
none	none	 Shall the like of me be denied admission to the house of Ni amah bin al Rabi a I who have free access to the houses of Emirs and Grandees Anon out came Ni amah and hearing their loud language laughed and bade the old woman enter after him So she followed him into the presence of Naomi whom she saluted after the godliest and goodliest fashion and when she looked on her she was confounded at her exceeding seemliness 
5911-48574-0020	train-other-500	and said to her O my lady
none	none	 I commend thee to the safeguard of Allah who made thee and thy lord fellows in beauty and loveliness Then she stood up in the prayer niche and betook herself to inclination and prostration and prayer till day departed and night darkened and starkened when Naomi said to her O my mother rest thy legs and feet awhile 
5911-48574-0021	train-other-500	Replied the old woman O my lady whoso seeketh the world to come let him weary him in this world and whoso wearieth not himself in this world shall not attain the dwellings of the just in the world to come
5911-48574-0022	train-other-500	Then Naomi brought her food and said to her Eat of my bread and pray Heaven to accept my penitence and to have mercy on me But she cried
none	none	 O my lady I am fasting 
5911-48574-0023	train-other-500	As for thee thou art but a girl and it befitteth thee to eat and drink and make merry Allah be indulgent to thee for the Almighty saith All shall be punished except him
none	none	 who shall repent and believe and shall work a righteous work FN eight So Naomi continued sitting with the old woman in talk and presently said to Ni amah O my lord conjure this ancient dame to sojourn with us awhile 
5911-48574-0024	train-other-500	for piety and devotion are imprinted on her countenance Quoth he Set apart for her a chamber where she may say her prayers and suffer no one to go in to her peradventure Allah extolled and exalted be He shall prosper us
none	none	 by the blessing of her presence and never separate us So the old woman passed her night in praying and reciting the Koran and when Allah caused the morn to dawn 
5911-48574-0025	train-other-500	she went in to Ni amah and Naomi and giving them good morning said to them I
none	none	 pray Allah have you in His holy keeping 
5911-48574-0026	train-other-500	Quoth Naomi Whither away O my mother My lord hath bidden me set apart for thee a chamber where thou mayst seclude thee for thy devotions Replied the old woman
none	none	 Allah give him long life and continue His favour to you both But I would have you charge the doorkeeper not to stay my coming in to you and Inshallah I will go the round of the Holy Places and pray for you two at the end of my devotions every day and night 
5911-48574-0027	train-other-500	Then she went out whilst Naomi wept for parting with her knowing not the cause of her coming
none	none	 and returned to Al Hajjaj who said to her 
5911-48574-0028	train-other-500	As thou do my bidding soon thou shalt have of me abundant good Quoth she I ask of thee a full month and quoth he Take the month
none	none	 Thereupon the old hag fell to daily visiting Ni amah s house and frequented his slave wife Naomi 
5285-48598-0013	train-other-500	And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say
5911-48574-0029	train-other-500	and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Thirty ninth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the old hag fell to visiting daily Ni amah s house and frequenting his slave wife
5911-48574-0030	train-other-500	Naomi and both ceased not to honour her and she used to go in to them morning and evening and all in the house respected her till one day being alone with Naomi she said to her O my lady
none	none	 by Allah when I go to the Holy Places I will pray for thee and I only wish thou wert with me that thou mightest look on the Elders of the Faith who resort thither and they should pray for thee according to thy desire 
5911-48574-0031	train-other-500	Naomi cried I conjure thee by Allah take me with thee and she replied Ask leave of thy mother in law and I will take thee So Naomi said to her husband s mother
5911-48574-0032	train-other-500	O my lady ask my master to let us go forth me and thee one day with this my old mother to prayer and worship with the Fakirs in the Holy Places
none	none	 Now when Ni amah came in and sat down 
5911-48574-0033	train-other-500	the old woman went up to him and would have kissed his hand but he forbade her
none	none	 so she invoked blessings FN nine on him and left the house Next day she came again in the absence of Ni amah and she addressed Naomi saying We prayed for thee yesterday but arise now and divert thyself and return ere thy lord come home So Naomi said to her mother in law 
5911-48574-0034	train-other-500	I beseech thee for Allah s sake give me leave to go with this pious woman that I may sight the saints of Allah in the Holy Places and return speedily ere my lord come back Quoth Ni amah s mother I fear lest thy lord know
none	none	 but said the old woman By Allah I will not let her take seat on the floor 
5911-48574-0035	train-other-500	no she shall look
none	none	 standing on her feet and not tarry So she took the damsel by guile and carrying her to Al Hajjaj s palace told him of her coming after placing her in a lonely chamber whereupon he went in to her and looking upon her saw her to be the loveliest of the people of the day 
5911-48574-0036	train-other-500	never had he beheld her like Now when Naomi caught sight of him she veiled her face from him but he left her not till he had called his Chamberlain whom he commanded to take fifty horsemen
5911-48574-0037	train-other-500	and he bade him mount the damsel on a swift dromedary and bear her to Damascus and there deliver her to the Commander of the Faithful Abd al Malik bin Marwan Moreover he gave him a letter for the Caliph saying Bear him this letter
5911-48574-0038	train-other-500	and bring me his answer and hasten thy return to me So the Chamberlain without losing time took the damsel and she tearful for separation from her lord and setting out with her on a dromedary gave not over journeying till he reached Damascus
5911-48574-0039	train-other-500	There he sought audience of the Commander of the Faithful and when it was granted the Chamberlain delivered the damsel and reported the circumstance The Caliph appointed her a separate apartment and going into his Harim said to his wife
none	none	 Al Hajjaj hath bought me a slave girl of the daughters of the Kings of Cufa FN ten for ten thousand dinars and hath sent me this letter 
5911-48574-0040	train-other-500	And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Fortieth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King
5911-48574-0041	train-other-500	that when the Caliph acquainted his wife with the story of the slave girl she said to him
none	none	 Allah increase to thee His favour 
5911-48574-0042	train-other-500	Then the Caliph s sister went in to the supposed slave girl and when she saw her she said
none	none	 By Allah not unlucky is the man who hath thee in his house 
5911-48574-0043	train-other-500	were thy cost an hundred thousand dinars And Naomi replied O fair of face what King s palace is this and what is the city She answered This is the city of Damascus and this is the palace of my brother the Commander of the Faithful
none	none	 Abd al Malik bin Marwan FN eleven Then she resumed Didst thou not know all this Naomi said By Allah O my lady I had no knowledge of it when the other asked And he who sold thee and took thy price 
5911-48574-0044	train-other-500	did he not tell thee that the Caliph had bought thee Now when Naomi heard these words she shed tears and said to herself Verily I have been tricked and the trick hath succeeded adding to herself If I speak none will credit me
5911-48574-0045	train-other-500	so I will hold my peace and take patience for I know that the relief of Allah is near Then she bent her head for shame and indeed her cheeks were tanned by the journey and the sun
5911-48574-0046	train-other-500	So the Caliph s sister left her that day and returned to her on the morrow with clothes and necklaces of jewels and dressed her after which the Caliph came in to her and sat down by her side and his sister said to him
5911-48574-0047	train-other-500	Look on this handmaid in whom Allah hath conjoined every perfection of beauty and loveliness So he said to Naomi Draw back the veil from thy face but she would not unveil and he beheld not her face
5911-48574-0048	train-other-500	However he saw her wrists and love of her entered his heart and he said to his sister I will not go in unto her for three days till she be cheered by thy converse Then he arose and left her
5911-48574-0049	train-other-500	but Naomi ceased not to brood over her case and sigh for her separation from her master Ni amah till she fell sick of a fever during the night and ate not nor drank and her favour faded and her charms were changed
5911-48574-0050	train-other-500	They told the Caliph of this and her condition grieved him so he visited her with physicians and men of skill but none could come at a cure for her This is how it fared with her but as regards Ni amah
5911-48574-0051	train-other-500	when he returned home he sat down on his bed and cried Ho Naomi But she answered not so he rose in haste and called out yet none came to him as all the women in the house had hidden themselves for fear of him
5911-48574-0052	train-other-500	Then he went out to his mother whom he found sitting with her cheek on her hand and said to her O my mother where is Naomi She answered O my son she is with one who is worthier than I to be trusted with her namely the devout old woman
5911-48574-0053	train-other-500	she went forth with her to visit devotionally the Fakirs and return Quoth Ni amah Since when hath this been her habit and at what hour went she forth Quoth his mother She went out early in the morning

5911-48574-0054	train-other-500	and she answered O my son twas she persuaded me
none	none	 There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great exclaimed Ni amah 
5911-48574-0055	train-other-500	and going forth from his home in a state of distraction he repaired to the Captain of the Watch to whom said he Doss thou play tricks upon me and steal my slave girl away from my house I will assuredly complain of thee to the Commander of the Faithful
5911-48574-0056	train-other-500	Said the Chief of Police Who hath taken her and Ni amah replied An old woman of such and such a mien

5911-48574-0057	train-other-500	Hither with him and when he stood before him enquired What be thy business Said Ni amah Such and such things have befallen me and the Governor said Bring me the Chief of Police and we will commend him to seek for the old woman
5911-48574-0058	train-other-500	Now he knew that the Chief of Police was acquainted with her so when he came he said to him

5735-48575-0002	train-other-500	Then he turned to Ni amah and said to him And thy slave girl return not I will give thee ten slave girls from my house and ten from that of the Chief of Police And he again bade the Captain of the Watch Go and seek for the girl
5735-48575-0003	train-other-500	So he went out and Ni amah returned home full of trouble and despairing of life for he had now reached the age of fourteen and there was yet no hair on his side cheeks So he wept and lamented and shut himself up from his household
5735-48575-0004	train-other-500	and ceased not to weep and lament he and his mother till the morning when his father came in to him and said
none	none	 O my son of a truth Al Hajjaj hath put a cheat upon the damsel and hath taken her 
5735-48575-0005	train-other-500	but from hour to hour Allah giveth relief However grief redoubled on Ni amah so that he knew not what he said nor knew he who came in to him and he fell sick for three months his charms were changed his father despaired of him
5735-48575-0006	train-other-500	and the physicians visited him and said There is no remedy for him save the damsel Now as his father was sitting one day behold he heard tell of a skillful Persian physician
none	none	 whom the folk gave out for perfect in medicine and astrology and geomancy 
5735-48575-0007	train-other-500	So Al Rabi a sent for him and seating him by his side entreated him with honour and said to him Look into my son s case

5735-48575-0008	train-other-500	then he laughed and turning to his father said
none	none	 Thy son s sole ailment is one of the heart FN twelve He replied 
5735-48575-0009	train-other-500	Thou sayest sooth O sage but apply thy skill to his state and case and acquaint me with the whole thereof and hide naught from me of his condition Quoth the Persian Of a truth he is enamoured of a slave girl
5735-48575-0010	train-other-500	and this slave girl is either in Bassorah or Damascus and there is no remedy for him but reunion with her Said Al Rabi a
none	none	 An thou bring them together thou shalt live all thy life in wealth and delight 
5735-48575-0011	train-other-500	Answered the Persian In good sooth this be an easy matter and soon brought about and he turned to Ni amah and said to him No hurt shall befall thee so be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear Then quoth he to Al Rabi a
none	none	 Bring me out four thousand dinars of your money so he gave them to him and he added 
5735-48575-0012	train-other-500	I wish to carry thy son with me to Damascus and Almighty Allah willing I will not return thence but with the damsel Then he turned to the youth and asked What is thy name and he answered Ni amah Quoth the Persian
none	none	 O Ni amah sit up and be of good heart for Allah will reunite thee with the damsel 
5735-48575-0013	train-other-500	And when he sat up the leach continued Be of good cheer for we set out for Damascus this very day put thy trust in the Lord and eat and drink and be cheerful so as to fortify thyself for travel

none	none	 and he took of Al Rabi a in all the sum of ten thousand dinars 
5735-48575-0015	train-other-500	together with horses and camels and beasts of burden and other requisites Then Ni amah farewelled his father and mother and journeyed with the physician to Aleppo They could find no news of Naomi there so they fared on to Damascus
none	none	 where they abode three days after which the Persian took a shop 
5735-48575-0016	train-other-500	and he adorned even the shelves with vessels of costly porcelain with covers of silver and with gildings and stuffs of price Moreover he set before himself vases and flagons of glass
5735-48575-0017	train-other-500	full of all manner of ointments and ups and he surrounded them with cups of crystal and placing astrolabe and geomantic tablet facing him he donned a physician s habit and took his seat in the shop
5735-48575-0018	train-other-500	Then he set Ni amah standing before him clad in a shirt and gown of silk and girding his middle with a silken kerchief gold embroidered
none	none	 said to him 
5735-48575-0019	train-other-500	O Ni amah henceforth thou art my son so call me naught but sire and I will call thee naught but son And he replied I hear and I obey
none	none	 Thereupon the people of Damascus flocked to the Persian s shop 
5735-48575-0020	train-other-500	that they might gaze on the youth s goodliness and the beauty of the shop
none	none	 and its contents whilst the physician spoke to Ni amah in Persian 
5735-48575-0021	train-other-500	and he answered him in the same tongue for he knew the language after the wont of the sons of the notables So that Persian doctor soon became known among the townsfolk and they began to acquaint him with their ailments and he to prescribe for them remedies
none	none	 Moreover they brought him the water of the sick in phials FN thirteen and he would test it and say 
5735-48575-0022	train-other-500	He whose water this is is suffering from such and such a disease and the patient would declare Verily this physician sayeth sooth So he continued to do the occasions of the folk
none	none	 and they to flock to him till his fame spread throughout the city and into the houses of the great 
5735-48575-0023	train-other-500	Now one day as he sat in his shop

5735-48575-0024	train-other-500	with jewels and stopping before the Persian s shop drew rein and beckoned him saying Take my hand He took her hand and she alighted and asked him
none	none	 Art thou the Persian physician from Irak Yes answered he and she said Know that I have a sick daughter Then she brought out to him a phial and the Persian looked at it and said to her 
5735-48575-0025	train-other-500	O my mistress tell me thy daughter s name that I may calculate her horoscope and learn the hour in which it will befit her to drink medicine She replied
none	none	 O my brother the Persian FN fourteen her name is Naomi 
5735-48575-0026	train-other-500	And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Forty second Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the Persian heard the name of Naomi
5735-48575-0027	train-other-500	he fell to calculating and writing on his hand and presently said O my lady I cannot prescribe a medicine for her till I know what country woman she is because of the difference of climate
none	none	 so tell me in what land she was brought up and what is her age 
5735-48575-0028	train-other-500	The old woman replied She is fourteen years old and she was brought up in Cufa of Irak He asked And how long hath she sojourned in this country
none	none	 But a few months answered she Now when Ni amah heard the old woman s words and recognised the name of his slave girl his heart fluttered and he was like to faint 
5735-48575-0029	train-other-500	Then said the Persian Such and such medicines will suit her case and the old woman rejoined
none	none	 Then make them up and give me what thou hast mentioned with the blessing of Almighty Allah 
5735-48575-0030	train-other-500	So saying she threw upon the shop board ten gold pieces and he looked at Ni amah and bade him prepare the necessary drugs whereupon she also looked at the youth and exclaimed Allah have thee in his keeping O my son
none	none	 Verily she favoureth thee in age and mien Then said she to the physician 
5735-48575-0031	train-other-500	O my brother the Persian is this thy slave or thy son He is my son answered he So Ni amah put up the medicine and placing it in a little box took a piece of paper
none	none	 and wrote thereon these two couplets FN fifteen If Naomi bless me with a single glance Let Su ada sue and Juml joy to They said Forget her twenty such thou lieutenant find 
5735-48575-0032	train-other-500	But none is like her I will not forget He pressed the paper into the box and sealing it up wrote upon the cover the following words in Cufic characters I am Ni amah of al Rabi a of Cufa
5735-48575-0033	train-other-500	Then he set it before the old woman who took it and bade them farewell and returned to the Caliph s palace and when she went up with the drugs to the damsel she placed the little box of medicine at her feet saying O my lady
5735-48575-0034	train-other-500	know that there is lately come to our town a Persian physician than whom I never saw a more skilful nor a better versed in matters of malady I told him thy name after showing him the water bottle
5735-48575-0035	train-other-500	and forthwith he knew thine ailment and prescribed a remedy Then he bade his son make thee up this medicine and there is not in Damascus a comelier or a seemlier youth than this lad of his
none	none	 nor hath anyone a shop the like of his shop 
5735-48575-0036	train-other-500	So Naomi took the box and seeing the names of her lord and his father written on the cover changed colour and said to herself Doubtless the owner of this shop is come in search of me So she said to the old woman
none	none	 Describe to me this youth 
5735-48575-0037	train-other-500	Answered the old woman His name is Ni amah he hath a mole on his right eyebrow is richly clad and is perfectly handsome Cried Naomi Give me the medicine whereon be the blessing and help of Almighty Allah
5735-48575-0038	train-other-500	So she drank off the potion and
none	none	 she laughing and said Indeed it is a blessed medicine Then she sought in the box and finding the paper 
5735-48575-0039	train-other-500	opened it read it understood it and knew that this was indeed her lord whereas her heart was solaced and she rejoiced Now when the old woman saw her laughing she exclaimed This is indeed a blessed day and Naomi said
5735-48575-0040	train-other-500	O nurse I have a mind for something to eat and drink The old woman said to the serving women
none	none	 Bring a tray of dainty viands for your mistress whereupon they set food before her and she sat down to eat And behold in came the Caliph who seeing her sitting at meat rejoiced and the old woman said to him 
5735-48575-0041	train-other-500	O Commander of the Faithful I give thee joy of thy hand maid Naomi s recovery And the cause is that there is lately come to this our city a physician than whom I never saw a better versed in diseases and their remedies
5735-48575-0042	train-other-500	I fetched her medicine from him and she hath drunken of it
none	none	 but once and is restored to health Quoth he Take a thousand dinars and apply thyself to her treatment till she be completely recovered 
5735-48575-0043	train-other-500	And he went away rejoicing in the damsel s recovery whilst the old woman betook herself to the Persian s house and delivered the thousand dinars giving him to know that she was become the Caliph s slave and also handing him a letter which Naomi had written
5735-48575-0044	train-other-500	He took it and gave the letter to Ni amah who at first sight knew her hand and fell down in a swoon When he revived he opened the letter and found these words written therein
5735-48575-0045	train-other-500	From the slave despoiled of her Ni amah her delight her whose reason hath been beguiled and who is parted from the core of her heart But afterwards of a truth thy letter hath reached me and hath broadened my breast and solaced my soul
5735-48575-0046	train-other-500	even as saith the poet Thy note came long lost hungers wrote that note Till drop they sweetest scents for what they wrote Twas Moses to his mother s arms restored
none	none	 Twas Jacob s eye sight cured by Joseph s coat FN sixteen When Ni amah read these verses his eyes ran over with tears and the old woman said to him What maketh thee to weep O 
5735-48575-0047	train-other-500	my son Allah never cause thine eye to shed tears Cried the Persian O my lady how should my son not weep seeing that this is his slave girl and he her lord
5735-48575-0048	train-other-500	Ni amah son of al Rabi a of Cufa and her health dependeth on her seeing him for naught aileth her but loving him And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say
5735-48575-0049	train-other-500	When it was the Two Hundred and Forty third Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Persian cried out to the old woman How shall my son not weep seeing that this is his slave girl
5735-48575-0050	train-other-500	and he her lord Ni amah son of al Rabi a of Cufa and the health of this damsel dependeth on her seeing him and naught aileth her but loving him
5735-48575-0051	train-other-500	So do thou O my lady take these thousand dinars to thyself and thou shalt have of me yet more than this only look on us with eyes of rush for we know not how to bring this affair to a happy end
5735-48575-0052	train-other-500	save through thee Then she said to Ni amah Say art thou indeed her lord He replied Yes and she rejoined Thou sayest sooth
none	none	 for she ceaseth not continually to name thee 
5735-48575-0053	train-other-500	Then he told her all that had passed from first to last and she said O youth
none	none	 thou shalt owe thy reunion with her to none but myself 
5735-48575-0054	train-other-500	So she mounted and at once returning to Naomi looked in her face and laughed saying
none	none	 It is just O my daughter that thou weep and fall sick for thy separation from thy master Ni amah son of Al Rabi a of Cufa 
5735-48575-0055	train-other-500	Quoth Naomi Verily the veil hath been withdrawn for thee and the truth revealed to thee Rejoined the old woman Be of good cheer and take heart for I will assuredly bring you together though it cost me my life
5735-48575-0056	train-other-500	Then she returned to Ni amah and said to him I went to thy slave girl and conversed with her
none	none	 and I find that she longeth for thee yet more than thou for her for although the Commander of the Faithful is minded to become intimate with her 
5735-48575-0057	train-other-500	she refuseth herself to him But if thou be stout of purpose and firm of heart I will bring you together and venture my life for you and play some trick
none	none	 and make shift to carry thee into the Caliph s palace 
5735-48575-0058	train-other-500	where thou shalt meet her for she cannot come forth And Ni amah answered Allah requite thee with good Then she took leave of him and went back to Naomi and said Thy lord is indeed dying of love for thee and would
5735-48575-0059	train-other-500	fain see thee and foregather with thee What sayest thou Naomi replied And I too am longing for his sight and dying for his love Whereupon the old woman took a parcel of women s clothes and ornaments and
5735-48575-0060	train-other-500	repairing to Ni amah said to him Come with me into some place apart So he brought her into the room behind the shop where she stained his hands and decked his wrists and plaited his hair
none	none	 after which she clad him in a slave girl s habit and adorned him after the fairest fashion of woman s adornment 
5735-48575-0061	train-other-500	till he was as one of the Houris of the Garden of Heaven and when she saw him thus she exclaimed
none	none	 Blessed be Allah best of Creators By Allah thou art handsomer than the damsel FN seventeen Now walk with thy left shoulder forwards and thy right well behind and sway thy hips from side to side FN eighteen So he walked before her as she bade him and when she saw he had caught the trick of woman s gait she said to him Expect me tomorrow night and Allah willing I will take and carry thee to the palace But when thou seest the Chamberlains and the Eunuchs be bold and bow thy head and speak not with any for I will prevent their speech and with Allah is success Accordingly when the morning dawned she returned and carrying him to the palace entered before him and he after her step by step The Chamberlain would have stopped his entering but the old woman said to him O most ill omened of slaves this is the handmaid of Naomi the Caliph s favourite How durst thou stay her when she would enter Then said she Come in O damsel and the old woman went in and they ceased not faring on till they drew near the door leading to the inner piazza of the palace when she said to him O Ni amah hearten thyself and take courage and enter and turn to the left then count five doors and pass through the sixth for it is that of the place prepared for thee Fear nothing and if any speak to thee answer not neither stop Then she went up with him to the door and the Chamberlain there on guard accosted her saying What damsel is this And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Forty fourth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the Chamberlain accosted the old woman saying What damsel is this quoth the ancient dame Our lady hath a mind to buy her and he rejoined None may enter save by leave of the Commander of the Faithful so do thou go back with her I can not let her pass for thus am I commanded Replied the old woman O Chief Chamberlain use thy reason Thou knowest that Naomi the Caliph s slave girl of whom he is enamoured is but now restored to health and the Commander of the Faithful hardly yet crediteth her recovery She is minded to buy this hand maid so oppose thou not her entrance lest haply it come to Naomi s knowledge and she be wroth with thee and suffer a relapse and this cause thy head to be cut off Then said she to Ni amah Enter O damsel pay no heed to what he saith and tell not the Queen consort that her Chamberlain opposed thine entrance So Ni amah bowed his head and entered the palace and would have turned to the left but mistook the direction and walked to his right and meaning to count five doors and enter the sixth he counted six and entering the seventh found himself in a place whose floor was carpeted with brocade and whose walls were hung with curtains of gold embroidered silk And therein stood censers of aloes wood and ambergris and strong scented musk and at the upper end was a couch bespread with cloth of gold on which he seated himself marvelling at the magnificence he saw and knowing not what was written for him in the Secret Purpose As he sat musing on his case the Caliph s sister followed by her handmaid came in upon him and seeing the youth seated there took him for a slave girl and accosted him and said Who art thou O damsel and what is thy case and who brought thee hither He made no reply and was silent when she continued O damsel if thou be one of my brother s concubines and he be wroth with thee I will intercede with him for thee and get thee grace But he answered her not a word so she said to her slave girl Stand at the door and let none enter Then she went up to Ni amah and looking at him was amazed at his beauty and said to him O lady tell me who thou art and what is thy name and how thou camest here for I have never seen thee in our palace Still he answered not whereat she was angered and putting her hand to his bosom found no breasts and would have unveiled him that she might know who he was but he said to her O my lady I am thy slave and I cast myself on thy protection do thou protect me She said No harm shall come to thee but tell me who thou art and who brought thee into this my apartment Answered he O Princess I am known as Ni amah bin al Rabi a of Cufa and I have ventured my life for the sake of my slave girl Naomi whom Al Hajjaj took by sleight and sent hither Said she Fear not no harm shall befall thee then calling her maid she said to her Go to Naomi s chamber and send her to me Meanwhile the old woman went to Naomi s bedroom and said to her Hath thy lord come to thee No by Allah answered Naomi and the other said Belike he hath gone astray and entered some chamber other than thine and lost himself So Naomi cried There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great Our last hour is come and we are all lost And while they were sitting and sadly enough pondering their case in came the Princess s handmaid and saluting Naomi said to her My lady biddeth thee to her banquet I hear and I obey answered the damsel and the old woman said Belike thy lord is with the Caliph s sister and the veil of secrecy hath been rent So Naomi at once sprang up and betook herself to the Princess who said to her Here is thy lord sitting with me it seemeth he hath mistaken the place but please Allah neither thou nor he has any cause for fear When Naomi heard these words she took heart of grace and went up to Ni amah and her lord when he saw her And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Forty fifth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Ni amah saw his handmaid Naomi he rose to meet her and strained her to his bosom and both fell to the ground fainting As soon as they came to themselves the Caliph s sister said to them Sit ye down and take we counsel for your deliverance from this your strait And they answered O our lady we hear and obey it is thine to command Quoth she By Allah no harm shall befall you from us Then she bade her handmaids bring meat and drink which was done and they sat down and ate till they had enough after which they sat drinking Then the cup went round amongst them and their cares ceased from them but Ni amah said Would I knew how this will end The Princess asked O Ni amah dost thou love thy slave Naomi and he answered Of a truth it is my passion for her which hath brought me to this state of peril for my life Then said she to the damsel O Naomi dost thou love thy lord Ni amah and she replied O my lady it is the love of him which hath wasted my body and brought me to evil case Rejoined the Princess By Allah since ye love each other thus may he not be who would part you Be of good cheer and keep your eyes cool and clear At this they both rejoiced and Naomi called for a lute and when they brought it she took it and tuned it and played a lively measure which enchanted the hearers and after the prelude sang these couplets When the slanderers cared but to part us twain We owed no blood debt could raise their ire And they poured in our ears all the din of war And aid failed and friends when my want was dire I fought them hard with mine eyes and tears With breath and sword with the stream and fire Then Naomi gave the lute to her master Ni amah saying Sing thou to us some verse So he took it and playing a lively measure intoned these couplets Full Moon if unfreckled would favour thee And Sun uneclipsed would reflect thy blee I wonder but love is of wonders full And ardour and passion and ecstasy How short the way to my love I fare Which from her faring so long I see Now when he had made an end of his song Naomi filled the cup and gave it to him and he took it and drank it off then she filled again and gave the cup to the Caliph s sister who also emptied it after which the Princess in her turn took the lute and tightened the strings and tuned it and sang these two couplets Grief cark and care in my heart reside And the fires of love in my breast My wasted form to all eyes shows clear For Desire my body hath mortified Then she filled the cup and gave it to Naomi who drank it off and taking the lute sang these two couplets O to whom I gave soul which thou tortures And in vain I d recover from fair Unfaith Do grant thy favours my care to cure Ere I die for this be my latest breath And they ceased not to sing verses and drink to the sweet sound of the strings full of mirth and merriment and joy and jollity till behold in came the Commander of the Faithful Now when they saw him they rose and kissed the ground before him and he seeing Naomi with the lute in her hand said to her O Naomi praised be Allah who hath done away from thee sickness and suffering Then he looked at Ni amah who was still disguised as a woman and said to the Princess O my sister what damsel is this by Naomi s side She replied O Commander of the Faithful thou hast here a handmaid one of thy concubines and the bosom friend of Naomi who will neither eat nor drink without her And she repeated the words of the poet Two contraries and both concur in opposite charms And charms so contraried by contrast lovelier show Quoth the Caliph By Allah Omnipotent verily she is as handsome as Naomi and to morrow I will appoint her a separate chamber beside that of her friend and send her furniture and stuffs and all that befitteth her in honour of Naomi Then the Princess called for food and set it before her brother who ate and made himself at home in their place and company Then filling a cup he signed to Naomi to sing so she took the lute after draining two of them and sang these two couplets Since my toper friend in my hand hath given Three cups that brim and bubble e er since I ve trailed my skirts throughout night for pride As tho Prince of the Faithful I were thy Prince The Prince of True Believers was delighted and filling another cup gave it to Naomi and bade her sing again so after draining the cup and sweeping the strings she sang as follows O most noble of men in this time and stound Of whom none may boast he is equal found O matchless in greatness of soul and gifts O thou Chief O thou King amongst all renowned Lord who dealest large boons to the Lords of Earth Whom thou vexest not nor dost hold them bound The Lord preserve thee and spoil thy foes And ne er cease thy lot with good Fortune crowned Now when the Caliph heard these couplets he exclaimed By Allah good By Allah excellent Verily the Lord hath been copious FN nineteen to thee O Naomi How clever is thy tongue and how dear is thy speech And they ceased not their mirth and good cheer till midnight when the Caliph s sister said to him Give ear O Commander of the Faithful to a tale I have read in books of a certain man of rank And what is this tale quoth he Quoth she Know O Prince of the Faithful that there lived once in the city of Cufa a youth called Ni amah son of Al Rabi a and he had a slave girl whom he loved and who loved him They had been reared in one bed but when they grew up and mutual love get hold of them Fortune smote them with her calamities and Time the tyrant brought upon them his adversity and decreed separation unto them Thereupon designing and slanderous folk enticed her by sleight forth of his house and stealing her away from his home sold her to one of the Kings for ten thousand dinars Now the girl loved her lord even as he loved her so he left kith and kin and house and home and the gifts of fortune and set out to search for her and when she was found he devised means to gain access to her And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Forty sixth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Caliph s sister said And Ni amah ceased not absenting himself from his kith and kin and patrial stead that he might gain access to his handmaid and he incurred every peril and lavished his life till he gained access to her and her name was Naomi like this slave girl But the interview was short they had not been long in company when in came the King who had bought her of her kidnapper and hastily ordered them to be slain without doing justice by his own soul and delaying to enquire into the matter before the command was carried out Now what sayest thou O Commander of the Faithful of this King s wrongous conduct Answered the Caliph This was indeed a strange thing it behoved that King to pardon when he had the power to punish and he ought to have regarded three things in their favour The first was that they loved each other the second that they were in his house and in his grasp and the third that it befitteth a King to be deliberate in judging and ordering between folk and how much more so in cases where he himself is concerned Wherefore this King thus did an unkingly deed Then said his sister O my brother by the King of the heavens and the earth I conjure thee bid Naomi sing and hearken to that she shall sing So he said O Naomi sing to me whereupon she played a lively measure and sang these couplets Beguiled us Fortune who her guile displays Smiting the heart bequeathing thoughts that craze And parting lovers whom she made to meet Till tears in torrent either cheek displays They were and I was and my life was glad While Fortune often joyed to join our ways I will pour tear flood will rain gouts of blood Thy loss bemoaning through the nights and days Now when the Commander of the Faithful heard this verse he was moved to great delight and his sister said to him O my brother whoso decideth in aught against himself him it behoveth to abide by it and do according to his word and thou hast judged against thyself by this judgement Then said she O Ni amah stand up and do thou likewise up stand O Naomi So they stood up and she continued O Prince of True Believers she who standeth before thee is Naomi the stolen whom Al Hajjaj bin Yusuf al Sakafi kidnapped and sent to thee falsely pretending in his letter to thee that he had bought her for ten thousand gold pieces And this other who standeth before thee is her lord Ni amah son of Al Rabi a and I beseech thee by the honour of thy pious forebears and by Hamzah and Ukayl and Abbas FN twenty to pardon them both and overlook their offence and bestow them one on the other that thou mayst win rich reward in the next world of thy just dealing with them for they are under thy hand and verily they have eaten of thy meat and drunken of thy drink and behold I make intercession for them and beg of thee the boon of their blood Thereupon quoth the Caliph Thou speakest sooth I did indeed give judgement as thou sayst and I am not one to pass sentence and to revoke it Then said he O Naomi say be this thy lord And she answered Even so O Commander of the Faithful Then quoth he No harm shall befall you I give you each to other adding to the young man O Ni amah who told thee where she was and taught thee how to get at this place He replied O Commander of the Faithful hearken to my tale and give ear to my history for by the virtue of thy pious forefathers I will hide nothing from thee And he told him all that had passed between himself and the Persian physician and the old nurse and how she had brought him into the palace and he had mistaken the doors whereat the Caliph wondered with exceeding wonder and said Fetch me the Persian So they brought him into the presence and he was made one of his chief officers Moreover the King bestowed on him robes of honour and ordered him a handsome present saying When a man hath shown like this man such artful management it behoveth us to make him one of our chief officers The Caliph also loaded Ni amah and Naomi with gifts and honours and rewarded the old nurse and they abode with him seven days in joy and content and all delight of life when Ni amah craved leave to return to Cufa with his slave girl The Caliph gave them permission and they departed and arrived in due course at Cufa where Ni amah was restored to his father and mother and they abode in all the joys and jollities of life till there came to them the Destroyer of delights and the Sunderer of societies Now when Amjad and As ad heard from Bahram this story they marvelled with extreme marvel and said By Allah this is indeed a rare tale And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Forty seventh Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Amjad and As ad heard this story from Bahram the Magian who had become a Moslem they marvelled with extreme marvel and thus passed that night and when the next morning dawned they mounted and riding to the palace sought an audience of the King who granted it and received them with high honour Now as they were sitting together talking of a sudden they heard the towns folk crying aloud and shouting to one another and calling for help and the Chamberlain came in to the King and said to him Some King hath encamped before the city he and his host with arms and weapons displayed and we know not their object and aim The King took counsel with his Wazir Amjad and his brother As ad and Amjad said I will go out to him and learn the cause of his coming So he took horse and riding forth from the city repaired to the stranger s camp where he found the King and with him a mighty many and mounted Mamelukes When the guards saw him they knew him for an envoy from the King of the city so they took him and brought him before their Sultan Then Amjad kissed the ground before him but lo the King was a Queen who was veiled with a mouth veil and she said to Amjad Know that I have no design on this your city and that I am come hither only in quest of a beardless slave of mine whom if I find with you I will do you no harm but if I find him not then shall there befall sore onslaught between me and you Asked Amjad O Queen what like is thy slave and what is his story and what may be his name Said she His name is As ad and my name is Marjanah and this slave came to my town in company of Bahram a Magian who refused to sell him to me so I took him by force but his master fell upon him by night and bore him away by stealth and he is of such and such a favour When Amjad heard that he knew it was indeed his brother As ad whom she sought and said to her O Queen of the age Alhamdolillah praised be Allah who hath brought us relief Verily this slave whom thou seekest is my brother Then he told her their story and all that had befallen them in the land of exile and acquainted her with the cause of their departure from the Islands of Ebony whereat she marvelled and rejoiced to have found As ad So she bestowed a dress of honour upon Amjad and he returned forthright to the King and told him what had passed at which they all rejoiced and the King went forth with Amjad and As ad to meet Queen Marjanah When they were admitted to her presence and sat down to converse with her and were thus pleasantly engaged behold a dust cloud rose and flew and grew till it walled the view And after a while it lifted and showed beneath it an army dight for victory in numbers like the swelling sea armed and armoured cap a pie who making for the city encompassed it around as the ring encompasseth the little finger FN twenty one and a bared brand was in every hand When Amjad and As ad saw this they exclaimed Verily to Allah we belong and to Him we shall return What is this mighty host Doubtless these are enemies and except we agree with this Queen Marjanah to fight them they will take the town from us and slay us There is no resource for us but to go out to them and see who they are So Amjad arose and took horse and passed through the city gate to Queen Marjanah s camp but when he reached the approaching army he found it to be that of his grand sire King Ghayur father of his mother Queen Budur And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Forty eighth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Amjad reached the approaching host he found it to be that of his grandsire Lord of the Isles and the Seas and the Seven Castles and when he went into the presence he kissed the ground between his hands and delivered to him the message Quoth the King My name is King Ghayur and I come wayfaring in quest of my daughter Budur whom fortune hath taken from me for she left me and returned not to me nor have I heard any tidings of her or of her husband Kamar al Zaman Have ye any news of them When Amjad heard this he hung his head towards the ground for a while in thought till he felt assured that this King was none other than his grandfather his mother s father where upon he raised his head and kissing ground before him told him that he was the son of his daughter Budur on hearing which Ghayur threw himself upon him and they both fell a weeping FN twenty two Then said Ghayur Praised be Allah O my son for safety since I have foregathered with thee and Amjad told him that his daughter Budur was safe and sound and her husband Kamar al Zaman likewise and acquainted him that both abode in a city called the City of Ebony Moreover he related to him how his father being wroth with him and his brother had commended that both be put to death but that his treasurer had taken pity on them and let them go with their lives Quoth King Ghayur I will go back with thee and thy brother to your father and make your peace with him So Amjad kissed the ground before him in huge delight and the King bestowed a dress of honour upon him after which he returned smiling to the King of the City of the Magians and told him what he had learnt from King Ghayur whereat he wondered with exceeding wonder Then he despatched guest gifts of sheep and horses and camels and forage and so forth to King Ghayur and did the like by Queen Marjanah and both of them told her what chanced whereupon quoth she I too will accompany you with my troops and will do my endeavour to make this peace Meanwhile behold there arose another dust cloud and flew and grew till it walled the view and blackened the day s bright hue and under it they heard shouts and cries and neighing of steeds and beheld sword glance and the glint of levelled lance When this new host drew near the city and saw the two other armies they beat their drums and the King of the Magians exclaimed This is indeed naught but a blessed day Praised be Allah who hath made us of accord with these two armies and if it be His will He shall give us peace with yon other as well Then said he to Amjad and As ad Fare forth and fetch us news of these troops for they are a mighty host never saw I a mightier So they opened the city gates which the King had shut for fear of the beleaguering armies and Amjad and As ad went forth and coming to the new host found that it was indeed a mighty many But as soon as they came to it behold they knew that it was the army of the King of the Ebony Islands wherein was their father King Kamar al Zaman in person Now when they looked upon him they kissed ground and wept but when he beheld them he threw himself upon them weeping with sore weeping and strained them to his breast for a full hour Then he excused himself to them and told them what desolation he had suffered for their loss and exile and they acquainted him with King Ghayur s arrival whereupon he mounted with his chief officers and taking with him his two sons proceeded to that King s camp As they drew near one of the Princes rode forward and informed King Ghayur of Kamar al Zaman s coming whereupon he came out to meet him and they joined company marvelling at these things and how they had chanced to foregather in that place Then the townsfolk made them banquets of all manner of meats and sweetmeats and presented to them horses and camels and fodder and other guest gifts and all that the troops needed And while this was doing behold yet another cloud of dust arose and flew till it walled the view whilst earth trembled with the tramp of steed and tabors sounded like stormy winds After a while the dust lifted and discovered an army clad in coats of mail and armed cap a pie but all were in black garb and in their midst rode a very old man whose beard flowed down over his breast and he also was clad in black When the King of the city and the city folk saw this great host he said to the other Kings Praised be Allah by whose omnipotent command ye are met here all in one day and have proved all known one to the other But what vast and victorious army is this which hemmeth in the whole land like a wall They answered Have no fear of them we are three Kings each with a great army and if they be enemies we will join thee in doing battle with them were they three times as many as they now are Meanwhile up came an envoy from the approaching host making for the city So they brought him before Kamar al Zaman King Ghayur Queen Marjanah and the King of the city and he kissed the ground and said My liege lord cometh from Persia land for many years ago he lost his son and he is seeking him in all countries If he find him with you well and good but if he find him not there will be war between him and you and he will waste your city Rejoined Kamar al Zaman It shall not come to that but how is thy master called in Ajam land Answered the envoy He is called King Shahriman lord of the Khalidan Islands and he hath levied these troops in the lands traversed by him whilst seeking his son No vv when Kamar al Zaman heard these words he cried out with a great cry and fell down in a fainting fit which lasted a long while and anon coming to himself he wept bitter tears and said to Amjad and As ad Go ye O my sons with the herald salute your grandfather and my father King Shahriman and give him glad tidings of me for he mourneth my loss and even to the present time he weareth black raiment for my sake Then he told the other Kings all that had befallen him in the days of his youth at which they wondered and going down with him from the city repaired to his father whom he saluted and they embraced and fell to the ground senseless for excess of joy And when they revived after a while Kamar al Zaman acquainted his father with all his adventures and the other Kings saluted Shahriman Then after having married Marjanah to As ad they sent her back to her kingdom charging her not to cease correspondence with them so she took leave and went her way Moreover they married Amjad to Bostan Bahram s daughter and they all set out for the City of Ebony And when they arrived there Kamar al Zaman went in to his father in law King Armanus and told him all that had befallen him and how he had found his sons whereat Armanus rejoiced and gave him joy of his safe return Then King Ghayur went in to his daughter Queen Budur FN twenty three and saluted her and quenched his longing for her company and they all abode a full month s space in the City of Ebony after which the King and his daughter returned to their own country And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Forty ninth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that King Ghayur set out with his daughter and his host for his own land and they took with them Amjad and returned home by easy marches And when Ghayur was settled again in his kingdom he made his grandson King in his stead and as to Kamar al Zaman he also made As ad king in his room over the capital of the Ebony Islands with the consent of his grandfather King Armanus and set out himself with his father King Shahriman till the two made the Islands of Khalidan Then the lieges decorated the city in their honour and they ceased not to beat the drums for glad tidings a whole month nor did Kamar al Zaman leave to govern in his father s place till there overtook them the Destroyer of delights and the Sunderer of societies and Allah knoweth all things Quoth King Shahryar O Shahrazad this is indeed a most wonderful tale And she answered O King it is not more wonderful than that of ALA AL DIN ABU AL SHAMAT FN twenty four What is that asked he and she said It hath reached me that there lived in times of yore and years and ages long gone before a merchant of Cairo FN twenty five named Shams al Din who was of the best and truest spoken of the traders of the city and he had eunuchs and servants and negro slaves and handmaids and Mame lukes and great store of money Moreover he was Consul FN twenty six of the Merchants of Cairo and owned a wife whom he loved and who loved him except that he had lived with her forty years yet had not been blessed with a son or even a daughter One day as he sat in his shop he noted that the merchants each and every had a son or two sons or more sitting in their shops like their sires Now the day being Friday he entered the Hammam bath and made the total ablution after which he came out and took the barber s glass and looked in it saying I testify that there is no god but the God and I testify that Mohammed is the Messenger of God Then he considered his beard and seeing that the white hairs in it covered the black bethought himself that hoariness is the harbinger of death Now his wife knew the time of his coming home and had washed and made herself ready for him so when he came in to her she said Good evening but he replied I see no good Then she called to the handmaid Spread the supper tray and when this was done quoth she to her husband Sup O my lord Quoth he I will eat nothing and pushing the tray away with his foot turned his back upon her She asked Why dost thou thus and what hath vexed thee and he answered Thou art the cause of my vexation And Shahrazed perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Fiftieth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Shams al Din said to his wife Thou art the cause of my vexation She asked Wherefore and he answered When I opened my shop this morning I saw that each and every of the merchants had with him a son or two sons or more sitting in their shops like their fathers and I said to myself He who took thy sire will not spare thee Now the night I first visited thee FN twenty seven thou madest me swear that I would never take a second wife over thee nor a concubine Abyssinian or Greek or handmaid of other race nor would lie a single night away from thee and behold thou art barren and having thee is like boring into the rock Rejoined she Allah is my witness that the fault lies with thee for that thy seed is thin He asked And what showeth the man whose semen is thin And she answered He cannot get women with child nor beget children Quoth he What thickeneth the seed tell me and I will buy it haply it will thicken mine Quoth she Enquire for it of the druggists So he slept with her that night and arose on the morrow repenting of having spoken angrily to her and she also regretted her cross words Then he went to the market and finding a druggist saluted him and when his salutation was returned said to him Say hast thou with thee a seed thickener He replied I had it but am out of it enquire thou of my neighbour Then Shams al Din made the round till he had asked every one but they all laughed at him and presently he returned to his shop and sat down sore troubled Now there was in the bazar a man who was Deputy Syndic of the brokers and was given to the use of opium and electuary and green hashish FN twenty eight He was called Shaykh Mohammed Samsam and being poor he used to wish Shams al Din good morrow every day So he came to him according to his custom and saluted him The merchant returned his salute but in ill temper and the other seeing him vexed said O my lord what hath crossed thee Thereupon Shams al Din told him all that occurred between himself and his wife adding These forty years have I been married to her yet hath she borne me neither son nor daughter and they say The cause of thy failure to get her with child is the thinness of thy seed so I have been seeking a some thing wherewith to thicken my semen but found it not Quoth Shaykh Mohammed O my lord I have a seed thickener but what wilt thou say to him who causeth thy wife to conceive by thee after these forty years have passed Answered the merchant If thou do this I will work thy weal and reward thee Then give me a dinar rejoined the broker and Shams al Din said Take these two dinars He took them and said Give me also yonder big bowl of porcelain So he gave it to him and the broker betook himself to a hashish seller of whom he bought two ounces of concentrated Roumi opium and equal parts of Chinese cubebs cinnamon cloves cardamoms ginger white pepper and mountain skink FN twenty nine and pounding them all together boiled them in sweet olive oil after which he added three ounces of male frankincense in fragments and a cupful of coriander seed and macerating the whole made it into an electuary with Roumi bee honey Then he put the confection in the bowl and carried it to the merchant to whom he delivered it saying Here is the seed thickener and the manner of using it is this Take of my electuary with a spoon after supping and wash it down with a sherbet made of rose conserve but first sup off mutton and house pigeon plentifully seasoned and hotly spiced So the merchant bought all this and sent the meat and pigeons to his wife saying Dress them deftly and lay up the seed thickener until I want it and call for it She did his bidding and when she served up the meats he ate the evening meal after which he called for the bowl and ate of the electuary It pleased him well so he ate the rest and knew his wife That very night she conceived by him and after three months her courses ceased no blood came from her and she knew that she was with child When the days of her pregnancy were accomplished the pangs of labour took her and they raised loud lullilooings and cries of joy The midwife delivered her with difficulty by pronouncing over the boy at his birth the names of Mohammed and Ali and said Allah is Most Great and she called in his ear the call to prayer Then she wrapped him up and passed him to his mother who took him and gave him the breast and he sucked and was full and slept The midwife abode with them three days till they had made the mothering cakes of sugared bread and sweetmeats and they distributed them on the seventh day Then they sprinkled salt against the evil eye and the merchant going in to his wife gave her joy of her safe delivery and said Where is Allah s deposit So they brought him a babe of surpassing beauty the handiwork of the Orderer who is ever present and though he was but seven days old those who saw him would have deemed him a yearling child So the merchant looked on his face and seeing it like a shining full moon with moles on either cheek said he to his wife What hast thou named him Answered she If it were a girl I had named her but this is a boy so none shall name him but thou Now the people of that time used to name their children by omens and whilst the merchant and his wife were taking counsel of the name behold one said to his friend Ho my lord Ala al Din So the merchant said We will call him Ala al Din Abu al Shamat FN thirty Then he committed the child to the nurse and he drank milk two years after which they weaned him and he grew up and throve and walked upon the floor When he came to seven years old they put him in a chamber under a trap door for fear of the evil eye and his father said He shall not come out till his beard grow So he gave him in charge to a handmaid and a blackamoor the girl dressed him his meals and the slave carried them to him Then his father circumcised him and made him a great feast after which he brought him a doctor of the law who taught him to write and read and repeat the Koran and other arts and sciences till he became a good scholar and an accomplished One day it so came to pass that the slave after bringing him the tray of food went away and left the trap door open so Ala al Din came forth from the vault and went in to his mother with whom was a company of women of rank As they sat talking behold in came upon them the youth as he were a white slave drunken FN thirty one for the excess of his beauty and when they saw him they veiled their faces and said to his mother Allah requite thee O such an one How canst thou let this strange Mameluke in upon us Knowest thou not that modesty is a point of the Faith She replied Pronounce Allah s name FN thirty two and cry Bismillah this is my son the fruit of my vitals and the heir of Consul Shams al Din the child of the nurse and the collar and the crust and the crumb FN thirty three Quoth they Never in our days knew we that thou hadst a son and quoth she Verily his father feared for him the evil eye and reared him in an under ground chamber And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Fifty first Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Ala al Din s mother said to her lady friends Verily his father feared for him the evil eye and reared him in an underground chamber and haply the slave forgot to shut the door and he fared forth but we did not mean that he should come out before his beard was grown The women gave her joy of him and the youth went out from them into the court yard where he seated himself in the open sitting room and behold in came the slaves with his father s she mule and he said to them Whence cometh this mule Quoth they We escorted thy father when riding her to the shop and we have brought her back He asked What may be my father s trade and they answered Thy father is Consul of the merchants in the land of Egypt and Sultan of the Sons of the Arabs Then he went in to his mother and said to her O my mother what is my father s trade Said she O my son thy sire is a merchant and Consul of the merchants in the land of Egypt and Sultan of the Sons of the Arabs His slaves consult him not in selling aught whose price is less than one thousand gold pieces but merchandise worth him an hundred and less they sell at their own discretion nor cloth any merchandise whatever little or much leave the country without passing through his hands and he disposeth of it as he pleaseth nor is a bale packed and sent abroad amongst folk but what is under his disposal And Almighty Allah O my son hath given thy father monies past compt He rejoined O my mother praised be Allah that I am son of the Sultan of the Sons of the Arabs and that my father is Consul of the merchants But why O my mother do ye put me in the underground chamber and leave me prisoner there Quoth she O my son we imprisoned thee not save for fear of folks eyes the evil eye is a truth FN thirty four and most of those in their long homes are its victims Quoth he O my mother and where is a refuge place against Fate Verily care never made Destiny forbear nor is there flight from what is written for every wight He who took my grandfather will not spare myself nor my father for though he live to day he shall not live tomorrow And when my father dieth and I come forth and say I am Ala al Din son of Shams al Din the merchant none of the people will believe me but men of years and standing will say In our lives never saw we a son or a daughter of Shams al Din Then the public Treasury will come down and take my father s estate and Allah have mercy on him who said The noble dieth and his wealth passeth away and the meanest of men take his women Therefore O my mother speak thou to my father that he carry me with him to the bazar and open for me a shop so may I sit there with my merchandise and teach me to buy and sell and take and give Answered his mother O my son as soon as thy sire returneth I will tell him this So when the merchant came home he found his son Ala al Din Abu al Shamat sitting with his mother and said to her Why hast thou brought him forth of the underground chamber She replied O son of my uncle it was not I that brought him out but the servants forgot to shut the door and left it open so as I sat with a company of women of rank behold he came forth and walked in to me Then she went on to repeat to him his son s words so he said O my son to morrow Inshallah I will take thee with me to the bazar but my boy sitting in markets and shops demandeth good manners and courteous carriage in all conditions Ala al Din passed the night rejoicing in his father s promise and when the morrow came the merchant carried him to the Hammam and clad him in a suit worth a mint of money As soon as they had broken their fast and drunk their sherbets Shams al Din mounted his she mule and putting his son upon another rode to the market followed by his boy But when the market folk saw their Consul making towards them foregoing a youth as he were a slice of the full moon on the fourteenth night they said one to other See thou yonder boy behind the Consul of the merchants verily we thought well of him but he is like the leek gray of head and green at heart FN thirty five And Shaykh Mohammed Samsam Deputy Syndic of the market the man before mentioned said to the dealers O merchants we will not keep the like of him for our Shaykh no never Now it was the custom anent the Consul when he came from his house of a morning and sat down in his shop for the Deputy Syndic of the market to go and recite to him and to all the merchants assembled around him the Fatihah or opening chapter of the Koran FN thirty six after which they accosted him one by one and wished him good morrow and went away each to his business place But when Shams al Din seated himself in his shop that day as usual the traders came not to him as accustomed so he called the Deputy and said to him Why come not the merchants together as usual Answered Mohammed Samsam I know not how to tell thee these troubles for they have agreed to depose thee from the Shaykh ship of the market and to recite the Fatihah to thee no more Asked Shams al Din What may be their reason and asked the Deputy What boy is this that sitteth by thy side and thou a man of years and chief of the merchants Is this lad a Mameluke or akin to thy wife Verily I think thou lovest him and inclines lewdly to the boy Thereupon the Consul cried out at him saying Silence Allah curse thee genus and species This is my son Rejoined the Deputy Never in our born days have we seen thee with a son and Shams al Din answered When thou gavest me the seed thickener my wife conceived and bare this youth but I reared him in a souterrain for fear of the evil eye nor was it my purpose that he should come forth till he could take his beard in his hand FN thirty seven However his mother would not agree to this and he on his part begged I would stock him a shop and teach him to sell and buy So the Deputy Syndic returned to the other traders and acquainted them with the truth of the case whereupon they all arose to accompany him and going in a body to Shams al Din s shop stood before him and recited the Opener of the Koran after which they gave him joy of his son and said to him The Lord prosper root and branch But even the poorest of us when son or daughter is born to him needs must cook a pan full of custard FN thirty eight and bid his friends and kith and kin yet hast thou not done this Quoth he This I owe you be our meeting in the garden And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Fifty second Night Her sister Dunyazad said to her Pray continue thy story for us as thou be awake and not inclined to sleep Quoth she With pleasure and goodwill it hath reached me O auspicious King that the Consul of the merchants promised them a banquet and said Be our meeting in the garden So when morning dawned he despatched the carpet layer to the saloon of the garden pavilion and bade him furnish the two Moreover he sent thither all that was needful for cooking such as sheep and clarified butter and so forth according to the requirements of the case and spread two tables one in the pavilion and another in the saloon Then Shams al Din and his boy girded themselves and he said to Ala al Din O my son whenas a greybeard entereth I will meet him and seat him at the table in the pavilion and do thou in like manner receive the beardless youths and seat them at the table in the saloon He asked O my father why dost thou spread two tables one for men and another for youths and he answered O my son the beardless is ashamed to eat with the bearded And his son thought this his answer full and sufficient So when the merchants arrived Shams al Din received the men and seated them in the pavilion whilst Ala al Din received the youths and seated them in the saloon Then the food was set on and the guests ate and drank and made merry and sat over their wine whilst the attendants perfumed them with the smoke of scented woods and the elders fell to conversing of matters of science and traditions of the Prophet Now there was amongst them a merchant called Mahmud of Balkh a professing Moslem but at heart a Magian a man of lewd and mischievous life who loved boys And when he saw Ala al Din from whose father he used to buy stuffs and merchandise one sight of his face sent him a thousand sighs and Satan dangled the jewel before his eyes so that he was taken with love longing and desire and affection and his heart was filled with mad passion for him Presently he arose and made for the youths who stood up to receive him and at this moment Ala Al Din being taken with an urgent call of Nature withdrew to make water whereupon Mahmud turned to the other youths and said to them If ye will incline Ala al Din s mind to journeying with me I will give each of you a dress worth a power of money Then he returned from them to the men s party and as the youths were sitting Ala al Din suddenly came back when all rose to receive him and seated him in the place of highest honour Presently one of them said to his neighbour O my lord Hasan tell me whence came to thee the capital whereon thou trades He replied When I grew up and came to man s estate I said to my sire O my father give me merchandise Quoth he O my son I have none by me but go thou to some merchant and take of him money and traffic with it and so learn to buy and sell give and take So I went to one of the traders and borrowed of him a thousand dinars wherewith I bought stuffs and carrying them to Damascus sold them there at a profit of two for one Then I bought Syrian stuffs and carrying them to Aleppo made a similar gain of them after which I bought stuffs of Aleppo and repaired with them to Baghdad where I sold them with like result two for one nor did I cease trading upon my capital till I was worth nigh ten thousand ducats Then each of the others told his friend some such tale till it came to Ala al Din s turn to speak when they said to him And thou O my lord Ala al Din Quoth he I was brought up in a chamber underground and came forth from it only this week and I do but go to the shop and return home from the shop They remarked Thou art used to wone at home and wottest not the joys of travel for travel is for men only He replied I reck not of voyaging and wayfaring cloth not tempt me Whereupon quoth one to the other This one is like the fish when he leaveth the water he dieth Then they said to him O Ala al Din the glory of the sons of the merchants is not but in travel for the sake of gain Their talk angered him so he left them weeping eyed and heavy hearted and mounting his mule returned home Now his mother saw him in tears and in bad temper and asked him What hath made thee weep O my son and he answered Of a truth all the sons of the merchants put me to shame and said Naught is more glorious for a merchant s son than travel for gain and to get him gold And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Fifty third Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Ala al Din said to his mother Of a truth all the sons of the merchants put me to shame and said Naught is more honourable for a merchant s son than travel for gain O my son hast thou a mind to travel Even so And whither wilt thou go To the city of Baghdad for there folk make double the cost price on their goods O my son thy father is a very rich man and if he provide thee not with merchandise I will supply it out of my own monies The best favour is that which is soonest bestowed if this kindness is to be now is the time So she called the slaves and sent them for cloth packers then opening a store house brought out ten loads of stuffs which they made up into bales for him Such was his case but as regards his father Shams al Din he looked about and failed to find Ala al Din in the garden and enquiring after him was told that he had mounted mule and gone home so he too mounted and followed him Now when he entered the house he saw the bales ready bound and asked what they were whereupon his wife told him what had chanced between Ala al Din and the sons of the merchants and he cried O my son Allah s malison on travel and stranger hood Verily Allah s Apostle whom the Lord bless and preserve hath said It is of a man s happy fortune that he eat his daily bread in his own land and it was said of the ancients Leave travel though but for a mile Then quoth he to his son Say art thou indeed resolved to travel and wilt thou not turn back from it Quoth the other There is no help for it but that I journey to Baghdad with merchandise else will I doff clothes and don dervish gear and fare a wandering over the world Shams al Din rejoined I am no penniless pauper but have great plenty of wealth then he showed him all he owned of monies and stuffs and stock in trade and observed With me are stuffs and merchandise befitting every country in the world Then he showed him among the rest forty bales ready bound with the price a thousand dinars written on each and said O my son take these forty loads together with the ten which thy mother gave thee and set out under the safeguard of Almighty Allah But O my child I fear for thee a certain wood in thy way called the Lion s Copse FN thirty nine and a valley highs the Vale of Dogs for there lives are lost without mercy He said How so O my father and he replied Because of a Badawi bandit named Ajlan Quoth Ala al Din Such is Allah s luck if any share of it be mine no harm shall hap to me Then they rode to the cattle bazar where behold a cameleer FN forty alighted from his she mule and kissing the Consul s hand said to him O my lord it is long by Allah since thou hast employed us in the way of business He replied Every time hath its fortune and its men FN forty one and Allah have truth on him who said And the old man crept o er the worldly ways So bowed his beard o er his knees down flow th Quoth I What gars thee so doubled go Quoth he as to me his hands he show th My youth is lost in the dust it lieth And see I bend me to find my youth FN forty two Now when he had ended his verses he said O chief of the caravan it is not I who am minded to travel but this my son Quoth the cameleer Allah save him for thee Then the Consul made a contract between Ala al Din and the man appointing that the youth should be to him as a son and gave him into his charge saying Take these hundred gold pieces for thy people More over he bought his son threescore mules and a lamp and a tomb covering for the Sayyid Abd al Kadir of Gilan FN forty three and said to him O my son while I am absent this is thy sire in my stead whatsoever he biddeth thee do thou obey him So saying he returned home with the mules and servants and that night they made a Khitmah or perfection of the Koran and held a festival in honour of the Shaykh Abd al Kadir al Jilani And when the morrow dawned the Consul gave his son ten thousand dinars saying O my son when thou comest to Baghdad if thou find stuffs easy of sale sell them but if they be dull spend of these dinars Then they loaded the mules and taking leave of one another all the wayfarers setting out on their journey marched forth from the city Now Mahmud of Balkh had made ready his own venture for Baghdad and had moved his bales and set up his tents without the walls saying to himself Thou shalt not enjoy this youth but in the desert where there is neither spy nor marplot to trouble thee It chanced that he had in hand a thousand dinars which he owed to the youth s father the balance of a business transaction between them so he went and bade farewell to the Consul who charged him Give the thousand dinars to my son Ala al Din and commended the lad to his care saying He is as it were thy son Accordingly Ala al Din joined company with Mahmud of Balkh And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Fifty fourth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Ala al Din joined company with Mahmud of Balkh who before beginning the march charged the youth s cook to dress nothing for him but himself provided him and his company with meat and drink Now he had four houses one in Cairo another in Damascus a third in Aleppo and a fourth in Baghdad So they set out and ceased not journeying over waste and wold till they drew near Damascus when Mahmud sent his slave to Ala al Din whom he found sitting and reading He went up to him and kissed his hands and Ala al Din having asked him what he wanted he answered My master saluteth thee and craveth thy company to a banquet at his place Quoth the youth Not till I consult my father Kamal al Din the captain of the caravan So he asked advice of the Makaddam FN forty four who said Do not go Then they left Damascus and journeyed on till they came to Aleppo where Mahmud made a second entertainment and sent to invite Ala al Din but he consulted the Chief Cameleer who again forbade him Then they marched from Aleppo and fared on till there remained between them and Baghdad only a single stage Here Mahmud prepared a third feast and sent to bid Ala al Din to it Kamal al Din once more forbade his accepting it but he said I must needs go So he rose and slinging a sword over his shoulder under his clothes repaired to the tent of Mahmud of Balkh who came to meet him and saluted him Then he set before him a sumptuous repast and they ate and drank and washed hands At last Mahmud bent towards Ala al Din to snatch a kiss from him but the youth received the kiss on the palm of his hand and said to him What wouldest thou be at Quoth Mahmud In very sooth I brought thee hither that I might take my pleasure with thee in this jousting ground and we will comment upon the words of him who saith Say canst not come to us one momentling Like milk of ewekin or aught glistening And eat what liketh thee of dainty cake And take thy due of fee in silverling And bear whatso thou wilt without mislike Of spanling fistling or a span long thing Then Mahmud of Balkh would have laid hands on Ala al Din to ravish him but he rose and baring his brand said to him Shame on thy gray hairs Hast thou no fear of Allah and He of exceeding awe FN forty five May He have mercy on him who saith Preserve thy hoary hairs from soil and stain For whitest colours are the easiest stained And when he ended his verses he said to Mahmud of Balkh Verily this merchandise FN forty six is a trust from Allah and may not be sold If I sold this property to other than thee for gold I would sell it to thee for silver but by Allah O filthy villain I will never again company with thee no never Then he returned to Kamal Al Din the guide and said to him Yonder man is a lewd fellow and I will no longer consort with him nor suffer his company by the way He replied O my son did I not say to thee Go not near him But if we part company with him I fear destruction for ourselves so let us still make one caravan But Ala al Din cried It may not be that I ever again travel with him So he loaded his beasts and journeyed onwards he and his company till they came to a valley where Ala al Din would have halted but the Cameleer said to him Do not halt here rather let us fare forwards and press our pace so haply we make Baghdad before the gates are closed for they open and shut them with the sun in fear lest the Rejectors FN forty seven should take the city and throw the books of religious learning into the Tigris But Ala al Din replied to him O my father I came not forth from home with this merchandise or travelled hither for the sake of traffic but to divert myself with the sight of foreign lands and folks and he rejoined O my son we fear for thee and for thy goods from the wild Arabs Whereupon the youth answered Harkye fellow art thou master or man I will not enter Baghdad till the morning that the sons of the city may see my merchandise and know me Do as thou wilt said the other I have given thee the wisest advice but thou art the best judge of thine own case Then Ala al Din bade them unload the mule and pitch the tent so they did his bidding and abode there till the middle of the night when he went out to obey a call of nature and suddenly saw something gleaming afar off So he said to Kamal al Din O captain what is yonder glittering The Cameleer sat up and considering it straitly knew it for the glint of spear heads and the steel of Badawi weapons and swords And lo and behold this was a troop of wild Arabs under a chief called Ajlan Abu Naib Shaykh of the Arabs and when they neared the camp and saw the bales and baggage they said one to another O night of loot Now when Kamal al Din heard these their words he cried Avaunt O vilest of Arabs But Abu Naib so smote him with his throw spear in the breast that the point came out gleaming from his back and he fell down dead at the tent door Then cried the water carrier FN forty eight Avaunt O foulest of Arabs and one of them smote him with a sword upon the shoulder that it issued shining from the tendons of the throat and he also fell down dead And all this while Ala Al Din stood looking on Then the Badawin surrounded and charged the caravan from every side and slew all Ala al Din s company without sparing a man after which they loaded the mules with the spoil and made off Quoth Ala al Din to himself Nothing will slay thee save thy mule and thy dress so he arose and put off his gown and threw it over the back of a mule remaining in his shirt and bag trousers only after which he looked towards the tent door and seeing there a pool of gore flowing from the slaughtered wallowed in it with his remaining clothes till he was as a slain man drowned in his own blood Thus it fared with him but as regards the Shaykh of the wild Arabs Ajlan he said to his banditti O Arabs was this caravan bound from Egypt for Baghdad or from Baghdad for Egypt And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

father bid thee divorce me do thou reply By what law is it lawful and right that I should marry at nightfall and divorce in the morning Then kiss the Kazi s hand and give him a present and in like manner kiss the Assessors hands and give each of them ten gold pieces So they will all speak with thee and if they ask thee Why dost thou not divorce her and take the thousand dinars and the mule and suit of clothes according to contract duly contracted do thou answer Every hair of her head is worth a thousand ducats to me and I will never put her away neither will I take a suit of clothes nor aught else And if the Kazi say to thee Then pay down the marriage settlement do thou reply I am short of cash at this present whereupon he and the Assessors will deal in friendly fashion with thee and allow thee time to pay Now whilst they were talking behold the Kazi s officer knocked at the door so Ala al Din went down and the man said to him Come speak the Efendi FN sixty seven for thy fatherinlaw summoneth thee So Ala al Din gave him five dinars and said to him O Summoner by what law am I bound to marry at nightfall and divorce next morning The serjeant answered By no law of ours at all at all and if thou be ignorant of the religious law I will act as thine advocate Then they went to the divorce court and the Kazi said to Ala al Din Why dost thou not put away the woman and take what falleth to thee by the contract Hearing this he went up to the Kazi and kissing his hand put fifty dinars in it and said O our lord the Kazi by what law is it lawful and right that I should marry at nightfall and divorce in the morning in my own despite The Kazi answered Divorce as a compulsion and by force is sanctioned by no school of the Moslems Then said the young lady s father If thou wilt not divorce pay me the ten thousand dinars her marriage settlement Quoth Ala al Din Give me a delay of three days but the Kazi said Three days is not time enough he shall give thee ten So they agreed to this and bound him after ten days either to pay the dowry or to divorce her And after consenting he left them and taking meat and rice and clarified butter FN sixty eight and what else

come to afflict thy soul Be patient when calamity breeds ire Lookye the Nights are big with child by Time Whose pregnancy bears wondrous things and dire Then she rose and made ready food and brought the tray and they two ate and drank and were merry and mirthful Presently Ala al Din besought her to let him hear a little music so she took the lute and played a melody that had made the hardest stone dance for glee and the strings cried out in present ecstacy O Loving One FN sixty nine after which she passed from the adagio into the presto and a livelier measure As they thus spent their leisure in joy and jollity and mirth and merriment behold there came a knocking at the door and she said to him Go see who is at the door So he went down and opened it and finding four Dervishes standing without said to them What want ye They replied O my lord we are foreign and wandering religious mendicants the viands of whose souls are music and dainty verse and we would fain take our pleasure with thee this night till morning cloth appear when we will wend our way and with Almighty Allah be thy reward for we adore music and there is not one of us but knoweth by heart store of odes and songs and ritornellos FN seventy He answered There is one I must consult and he returned and told Zubaydah who said Open the door to them So he brought them up and made them sit down and welcomed them then he fetched them food but they would not eat and said O our lord our meat is to repeat Allah s name in our hearts and to hear music with our ears and bless him who saith Our aim is only converse to enjoy And eating joyeth only cattle kind FN seventy one And just now we heard pleasant music in thy house but when we entered it ceased and fain would we know whether the player was a slave girl white or black or a maiden of good family He answered It was this my wife and told them all that had befallen him adding Verily my father in law hath bound me to pay a marriage settlement of ten thousand dinars for her and they have given me ten days time Said one of the Dervishes Have no care and think of naught but good for I am Shaykh of the Convent and have forty Dervishes under my orders I will presently collect from them the ten thousand dinars and thou shalt pay thy father in law the wedding settlement But now bid thy wife make us music that we may be gladdened and pleasured for to some folk music is meat to others medicine and to others refreshing as a fan Now these four Dervishes were none other than the Caliph Harun al Rashid his Wazir Ja afar the Barmecide Abu al Nowas al Hasan son of Hani FN seventy two and Masrur the sworder and the reason of their coming to the house was that the Caliph being heavy at heart had summoned his Minister and said O Wazir it is our will to go down to the city and pace its streets for my breast is sore straitened So they all four donned dervish dress and went down and walked about till they came to that house where hearing music they were minded to know the cause They spent the night in joyance and harmony and telling tale after tale until morning dawned when the Caliph laid an hundred gold pieces under the prayer carpet and all taking leave of Ala al Din went their way Now when Zubaydah lifted the carpet she found beneath it the hundred dinars and she said to her husband Take these hundred dinars which I have found under the prayer carpet assuredly the Dervishes when about to leave us laid them there without our knowledge So Ala al Din took the money and repairing to the market bought therewith meat and rice and clarified butter and all they required And when it was night he lit the wax candles and said to his wife The mendicants it is true have not brought the ten thousand dinars which they promised me but indeed they are poor men As they were talking behold the Dervishes knocked at the door and she said Go down and open to them So he did her bidding and bringing them up said to them Have you brought me the ten thousand dinars you promised me They answered We have not been able to collect aught thereof as yet but fear nothing Inshallah tomorrow we will compound for thee some alchemical cookery But now bid thy wife play us her very best pieces and gladden our hearts for we love music So she took her lute and made them such melody that had caused the hardest rocks to dance with glee and they passed the night in mirth and merriment converse and good cheer till morn appeared with its sheen and shone when the Caliph laid an hundred gold pieces under the prayer carpet and all after taking leave of Ala al Din went their way And they ceased not to visit him thus every night for nine nights and each morning the Caliph put an hundred dinars under the prayer carpet till the tenth night when they came not Now the reason of their failure to come was that the Caliph had sent to a great merchant saying to him Bring me fifty loads of stuffs such as come from Cairo And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Fifty eighth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Prince of True Believers said to that merchant Bring me fifty loads of stuffs such as come from Cairo and let each one be worth a thousand dinars and write on each bale its price and bring me also a male Abyssinian slave The merchant did the bidding of the Caliph who committed to the slave a basin and ewer of gold and other presents together with the fifty loads and wrote a letter to Ala al Din as from his father Shams al Din and said to him Take these bales and what else is with them and go to such and such a quarter wherein dwelleth the Provost of the merchants and say Where be Ala al Din Abu al Shamat till folk direct thee to his quarter and his house So the slave took the letter and the goods and what else and fared forth on his errand Such was his case but as regards Zubaydah s cousin and first husband he went to her father and said to him Come let us go to Ala al Din and make him divorce the daughter of my uncle So they set out both together and when they came to the street in which the house stood they found fifty he mules laden with bales of stuffs and a blackamoor riding on a she mule So they said to him Whose loads are these He replied They belong to my lord Ala al Din Abu al Shamat for his father equipped him with merchandise and sent him on a journey to Baghdad city but the wild Arabs came forth against him and took his money and goods and all he had So when the ill news reached his father he despatched me to him with these loads in lieu of those he had lost besides a mule laden with fifty thousand dinars a parcel of clothes worth a power of money a robe of sables FN seventy three and a basin and ewer of gold Whereupon the lady s father said He whom thou seekest is my son in law and I will show thee his house Meanwhile Ala al Din was sitting at home in huge concern when lo one knocked at the door and he said O Zubaydah Allah is all knowing but I fear thy father hath sent me an officer from the Kazi or the Chief of Police Quoth she Go down and see what it is So he went down and opening the door found his father in law the Provost of the merchants with an Abyssinian slave dusky complexioned and pleasant of favour riding on a mule When the slave saw him he dismounted and kissed his hands and Ala al Din said What dost thou want He replied I am the slave of my lord Ala al Din Abu al Shamat son of Shams al Din Consul of the merchants for the land of Egypt who hath sent me to him with this charge Then he gave him the letter and Ala al Din opening it found written what followeth FN seventy four Ho thou my letter when my friend shall see thee Kiss thou the ground and buss his sandal shoon Look thou hie softly and thou hasten not My life and rest are in those hands so boon After hearty salutations and congratulations and high estimation from Shams al Din to his son Abu al Shamat Know O my son that news hath reached me of the slaughter of thy men and the plunder of thy monies and goods so I send thee herewith fifty loads of Egyptian stuffs together with a suit of clothes and a robe of sables and a basin and ewer of gold Fear thou no evil and the goods thou hast lost were the ransom of thy life so regret them not and may no further grief befall thee Thy mother and the people of the house are doing well in health and happiness and all greet thee with abundant greetings Moreover O my son it hath reached me that they have married thee by way of intermediary to the lady Zubaydah the lutist and they have imposed on thee a marriage settlement of ten thousand dinars wherefore I send thee also fifty thousand dinars by the slave Salim FN seventy five Now when Ala al Din had made an end of reading the letter he took possession of the loads and turning to the Provost said to him O my father in law take the ten thousand dinars the marriage settlement of thy daughter Zubaydah and take also the loads of goods and dispose of them and thine be the profit only return me the cost price He answered Nay by Allah I will take nothing and as for thy wife s settlement do thou settle the matter with her Then after the goods had been brought in they went to Zuhaydah and she said to her sire O my father whose loads be these He said These belong to thy husband Ala al Din his father hath sent them to him instead of those whereof the wild Arabs spoiled him Moreover he hath sent him fifty thousand dinars with a parcel of clothes a robe of sables a she mule for riding and a basin and ewer of gold As for the marriage settlement that is for thy recking Thereupon Ala al Din rose and opening the money box gave her her settlement and the lady s cousin said O my uncle let him divorce to me my wife but the old man replied This may never be now for the marriage tie is in his hand Thereupon the young man went out sore afflicted and sadly vexed and returning home fell sick for his heart had received its death blow so he presently died But as for Ala al Din after receiving his goods he went to the bazar and buying what meats and drinks he needed made a banquet as usual against the night saying to Zubaydah See these lying Dervishes they promised us and broke their promises Quoth she Thou art the son of a Consul of the merchants yet was thy hand short of half a dirham how then should it be with poor Dervishes Quoth he Almighty Allah hath enabled us to do without them but if they come to us never again will I open the door to them She asked Why so whenas their coming footsteps brought us good luck and moreover they put an hundred dinars under the prayer carpet for us every night Perforce must thou open the door to them an they come So when day departed with its light and in gloom came night they lighted the wax candles and he said to her Rise Zubaydah make us music and behold at this moment some one knocked at the door and she said Go and look who is at the door So he went down and opened it and seeing the Dervishes said Oh fair welcome to the liars Come up Accordingly they went up with him and he seated them and brought them the tray of food and they ate and drank and became merry and mirthful and presently said to him O my lord our hearts have been troubled for thee what hath passed between thee and thy father in law He answered Allah compensated us beyond and above our desire Rejoined they By Allah we were in fear for thee And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and and Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Dervishes thus addressed Ala al Din By Allah we were in fear for thee and naught kept us from thee but our lack of cash and coin Quoth he Speedy relief hath come to me from my Lord for my father hath sent me fifty thousand dinars and fifty loads of stuffs each load worth a thousand dinars besides a riding mule a robe of sables an Abyssinian slave and a basin and ewer of gold Moreover I have made my peace with my father in law and my wife hath become my lawful wife by my paying her settlement so laud to Allah for that Presently the Caliph rose to do a necessity whereupon Ja afar bent him towards Ala al Din and said Look to thy manners for thou art in the presence of the Commander of the Faithful Asked he How have I failed in good breeding before the Commander of the Faithful and which of you is he Quoth Ja afar He who went out but now to make water is the Commander of the Faithful Harun al Rashid and I am the Wazir Ja afar and this is Masrur the executioner and this other is Abu Nowas Hasan bin Hani And now O Ala al Din use thy reason and bethink thee how many days journey it is between Cairo and Baghdad He replied Five and forty days journey and Ja afar rejoined Thy baggage was stolen only ten days ago so how could the news have reached thy father and how could he pack thee up other goods and send them to thee five and forty days journey in ten days time Quoth Ala al Din O my lord and whence then came they From the Commander of the Faithful replied Ja afar of his great affection for thee As they were speaking lo the Caliph entered and Ala al Din rising kissed the ground before him and said Allah keep thee O Prince of the Faithful and give thee long life and may the lieges never lack thy bounty and beneficence Replied the Caliph O Ala al Din let Zubaydah play us an air by way of house warming FN seventy six for thy deliverance Thereupon she played him on the lute so rare a melody that the very stones shook for glee and the strings cried out for present ecstasy O Loving One They spent the night after the merriest fashion and in the morning the Caliph said to Ala al Din Come to the Divan to morrow He answered Hearkening and obedience O Commander of the Faithful so Allah will and thou be well and in good case On the morrow he took ten trays and putting on each a costly present went up with them to the palace and the Caliph was sitting on the throne when behold Ala al Din appeared at the door of the Divan repeating these two couplets Honour and Glory wait on thee each morn Thine enviers noses in the dust be set Ne er cease thy days to be as white as snow Thy foeman s days to be as black as jet Welcome O Ala Al Din said the Caliph and he replied O Commander of the Faithful the Prophet whom Allah bless and assain FN seventy seven was wont to accept presents and these ten trays with what is on them are my offering to thee The Caliph accepted his gift and ordering him a robe of honour made him Provost of the merchants and gave him a seat in the Divan And as he was sitting behold his father in law came in and seeing Ala al Din seated in his place and clad in a robe of honour said to the Caliph O King of the age why is this man sitting in my place and wearing this robe of honour Quoth the Caliph I have made him Provost of the merchants for offices are by investiture and not in perpetuity and thou art deposed Answered the merchant Thou hast done well O Commander of the Faithful for he is ours and one of us Allah make the best of us the managers of our affairs How many a little one hath become great Then the Caliph wrote Ala al Din a Firman FN seventy eight of investiture and gave it to the Governor who gave it to the crier FN seventy nine and the crier made proclamation in the Divan saying None is Provost of the merchants but Ala al Din Abu al Shamat and his word is to be heard and he must be obeyed with due respect paid and he meriteth homage and honour and high degree Moreover when the Divan broke up the Governor went down with the crier before Ala Al Din and the crier repeated the proclamation and they carried Ala al Din through the thoroughfares of Baghdad making proclamation of his dignity Next day Ala al Din opened a shop for his slave Salim and set him therein to buy and sell whilst he himself rode to the palace and took his place in the Caliph s Divan And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Sixtieth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Ala al Din rode to the palace and took his place in the Caliph s Divan Now it came to pass one day when he sat in his stead as was his wont behold one said to the Caliph O Commander of the Faithful may thy head survive such an one the cup companion for he is gone to the mercy of Almighty Allah but be thy life prolonged FN eighty Quoth the Caliph Where is Ala al Din Abu al al Shamat So he went up to the Commander of the Faithful who at once clad him in a splendid dress of honour and made him his boon companion appointing him a monthly pay and allowance of a thousand dinars He continued to keep him company till one day as he sat in the Divan according to his custom attending upon the Caliph lo and behold an Emir came up with sword and shield in hand and said O Commander of the Faithful may thy head long outlive the Head of the Sixty for he is dead this day whereupon the Caliph ordered Ala al Din a dress of honour and made him Chief of the Sixty in place of the other who had neither wife nor son nor daughter So Ala al Din laid hands on his estate and the Caliph said to him Bury him in the earth and take all he hath left of wealth and slaves and handmaids FN eighty one Then he shook the handkerchief FN eighty two and dismissed the Divan whereupon Ala al Din went forth attended by Ahmad al Danaf captain of the right and Hasan Shuman captain of the left riding at his either stirrup each with his forty men FN eighty three Presently he turned to Hasan Shuman and his men and said to them Plead ye for me with the Captain Ahmad al Danaf that he please to accept me as his son by covenant before Allah And Ahmad assented saying I and my forty men will go before thee to the Divan every morning Now after this Ala al Din continued in the Caliph s service many days till one day it chanced that he left the Divan and returning home dismissed Ahmad al Danaf and his men and sat down with his wife Zubaydab the lute player who lighted the wax candles and went out of the room upon an occasion Suddenly he heard a loud shriek so he rose up and running in haste to see what was the matter found that it was his wife who had cried out She was lying at full length on the ground and when he put his hand to her breast he found her dead Now her father s house faced that of Ala al Din and he hearing the shriek came in and said What is the matter O my lord Ala al Din He replied O my father may thy head outlive thy daughter Zubaydah But O my father honour to the dead is burying them So when the morning dawned they buried her in the earth and her husband and father condoled with and mutually consoled each other Thus far concerning her but as regards Ala al Din he donned mourning dress and declined the Divan abiding tearful eyed and heavy hearted at home After a while the Caliph said to Ja afar O Watir what is the cause of Ala al Din s absence from the Divan The Minister answered O Commander of the Faithful he is in mourning for his wife Zubaydah and is occupied in receiving those who come to console him and the Caliph said It behoveth us to pay him a visit of condolence I hear and I obey replied Ja afar So they took horse the Caliph and the Minister and a few attendants and rode to Ala al Din s house and as he was sitting at home behold the party came in upon him whereupon he rose to receive them and kissed the ground before the Caliph who said to him Allah make good thy loss to thee Answered Ala Al Din May Allah preserve thee to us O Commander of the Faithful Then said the Caliph O Ala al Din why hast thou absented thyself from the Divan And he replied Because of my mourning for my wife Zubaydah O Commander of the Faithful The Caliph rejoined Put away grief from thee verily she is dead and gone to the mercy of Almighty Allah and mourning will avail thee nothing no nothing But Ala al Din said O Commander of the Faithful I shall never leave mourning for her till I die and they bury me by her side Quoth the Caliph In Allah is compensation for every decease and neither device nor riches can deliver from death and divinely gifted was he who said All sons of woman albe long preserved Are borne upon the bulging bier some day FN eighty four How then shall joy man joy or taste delight Upon whose cheeks shall rest the dust and clay When the Caliph had made an end of condoling with him he charged him not to absent himself from the Divan and returned to his palace And Ala Al Din after a last sorrowful night mounted early in the morning and riding to the court kissed the ground before the Commander of the Faithful who made a movement if rising from the throne FN eighty five to greet and welcome him and bade him take his appointed place in the Divan saying O Ala al Din thou art my guest to night So presently he carried him into his serraglio and calling a slave girl named Kut al Kulub said to her Ala al Din had a wife called Zubaydah who used to sing to him and solace him of cark and care but she is gone to the mercy of Almighty Allah and now I would have thee play him an air upon the lute And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Sixty first Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Caliph said to the damsel Kut al Kulub I would have thee play him upon the lute an air of fashion sweet and rare that he may be solaced of his cark and care So she rose and made sweet music and the Caliph said to Ala al Din What sayst thou of this damsel s voice He replied Verily O Commander of the Faithful Zubaydah s voice was the finer but she is skilled in touching the lute cunningly and her playing would make a rock dance with glee The Caliph asked Doth she please thee and he answered She doth O Commander of the Faithful whereupon the King said By the life of my head and the tombs of my forefathers she is a gift from me to thee she and her waiting women Ala al Din fancied that the Caliph was jesting with him but on the morrow the King went in to Kut al Kulub and said to her I have given thee to Ala Al Din whereat she rejoiced for she had seen and loved him Then the Caliph returned from his serraglio palace to the Divan and calling porters said to them Set all the goods of Kut al Kulub and her waiting women in a litter and carry them to Ala al Din s home So they conducted her to the house and showed her into the pavilion whilst the Caliph sat in the hall of audience till the dose of day when the Divan broke up and he retired to his harem Such was his case but as regards Kut al Kulub when she had taken up her lodging in Ala al Din s mansion she and her women forty in all besides the eunuchry she called two of these caponised slaves and said to them Sit ye on stools one on the right and another on the left hand of the door and when Ala al Din cometh home both of you kiss his hands and say to him Our mistress Kut al Kulub requesteth thy presence in the pavilion for the Caliph hath given her to thee her and her women They answered We hear and obey and did as she bade them So when Ala al Din returned he found two of the Caliph s eunuchs sitting at the door and was amazed at the matter and said to himself Surely this is not my own house or else what can have happened Now when the eunuchs saw him they rose to him and kissing his hands said to him We are of the Caliph s household and slaves to Kut al Kulub who saluteth thee giving thee to know that the Caliph hath bestowed her on thee her and her women and requesteth thy presence Quoth Ala al Din Say ye to her Thou art welcome but so long as thou shalt abide with me I will not enter the pavilion wherein thou art for what was the master s should not become the man s and furthermore ask her What was the sum of thy day s expenditure in the Caliph s palace So they went in and did his errand to her and she answered An hundred dinars a day whereupon quoth he to himself There was no need for the Caliph to give me Kut al Kulub that I should be put to such expense for her but there is no help for it So she abode with him awhile and he assigned her daily an hundred dinars for her maintenance till one day he absented himself from the Divan and the Caliph said to Ja afar O Watir I gave not Kut al Kulub unto Ala al Din but that she might console him for his wife why then doth he still hold aloof from us Answered Ja afar O Commander of the Faithful he spake sooth who said Whoso findeth his fere forgetteth his friends Rejoined the Caliph Haply he hath not absented himself without excuse but we will pay him a visit Now some days before this Ala al Din had said to Ja afar I complained to the Caliph of my grief and mourning for the loss of my wife Zubaydah and he gave me Kut al Kulub and the Minister replied Except he loved thee he had not given her to thee Say hast thou gone in unto her O Ala al Din He rejoined No by Allah I know not her length from her breadth He asked And why and he answered O Wazir what befitteth the lord befitteth not the liege Then the Caliph and Ja afar disguised themselves and went privily to visit Ala al Din but he knew them and rising to them kissed the hands of the Caliph who looked at him and saw signs of sorrow in his face So he said to him O Al Din whence cometh this sorrow wherein I see thee Hast thou not gone in unto Kut al Kulub He replied O Commander of the Faithful what befitteth the lord befitteth not the thrall No as yet I have not gone in to visit her nor do I know her length from her breadth so pray quit me of her Quoth the Caliph I would fain see her and question her of her case and quoth Ala al Din I hear and I obey O Commander of the Faithful So the Caliph went in And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Sixty second Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Caliph went in to Kut al Kulub who rose to him on sighting him and kissed the ground between his hands when he said to her Hath Ala al Din gone in unto thee and she answered No O Commander of the Faithful I sent to bid him come but he would not So the Caliph bade carry her back to the Harim and saying to Ala Al Din Do not absent thyself from us returned to his palace Accordingly next morning Ala Al Din mounted and rode to the Divan where he took his seat as Chief of the Sixty Presently the Caliph ordered his treasurer to give the Wazir Ja afar ten thousand dinars and said when his order was obeyed I charge thee to go down to the bazar where handmaidens are sold and buy Ala Al Din a slave girl with this sum So in obedience to the King Ja afar took Ala al Din and went down with him to the bazar Now as chance would have it that very day the Emir Khalid whom the Caliph had made Governor of Baghdad went down to the market to buy a slave girl for his son and the cause of his going was that his wife Khatun by name had borne him a son called Habzalam Bazazah FN eighty six and the same was foul of favour and had reached the age of twenty without learning to mount horse albeit his father was brave and bold a doughty rider ready to plunge into the Sea of Darkness FN eighty seven And it happened that on a certain night he had a dream which caused nocturnal pollution whereof he told his mother who rejoiced and said to his father I want to find him a wife as he is now ripe for wedlock Quoth Khalid The fellow is so foul of favour and withal so rank of odour so sordid and beastly that no woman would take him as a gift And she answered We will buy him a slave girl So it befell for the accomplishing of what Allah Almighty had decreed that on the same day Ja afar and Ala al Din the Governor Khalid and his son went down to the market and behold they saw in the hands of a broker a beautiful girl lovely faced and of perfect shape and the Wazir said to him O broker ask her owner if he will take a thousand dinars for her And as the broker passed by the Governor with the slave Hahzalam Bazazah cast at her one glance of the eyes which entailed for himself one thousand sighs and he fell in love with her and passion got hold of him and he said O my father buy me yonder slave girl So the Emir called the broker who brought the girl to him and asked her her name She replied My name is Jessamine and he said to Hahzalam Bazazah O my son as she please thee do thou bid higher for her Then he asked the broker What hath been bidden for her and he replied A thousand dinars Said the Governor s son She is mine for a thousand pieces of gold and one more and the broker passed on to Ala al Din who bid two thousand dinars for her and as often as the Emir s son bid another dinar Ala al Din bid a thousand The ugly youth was vexed at this and said O broker who is it that outbiddeth me for the slave girl Answered the broker It is the Wazir Ja afar who is minded to buy her for Ala al Din Abu al Shamat And Ala al Din continued till he brought her price up to ten thousand dinars and her owner was satisfied to sell her for that sum Then he took the girl and said to her I give thee thy freedom for the love of Almighty Allah and forthwith wrote his contract of marriage with her and carried her to his house Now when the broker returned after having received his brokerage the Emir s son summoned him and said to him Where is the girl Quoth he She was bought for ten thousand dinars by Ala al Din who hath set her free and married her At this the young man was greatly vexed and cast down and sighing many a sigh returned home sick for love of the damsel and he threw himself on his bed and refused food for love and longing were sore upon him Now when his mother saw him in this plight she said to him Heaven assain thee O my son What aileth thee And he answered Buy me Jessamine O my mother Quoth she When the flower seller passeth I will buy thee a basketful of jessamine Quoth he It is not the jessamine one smells but a slave girl named Jessamine whom my father would not buy for me So she said to her husband Why and wherefore didest thou not buy him the girl and he replied What is fit for the lord is not fit for the liege and I have no power to take her no less a man bought her than Ala Al Din Chief of the Sixty Then the youth s weakness redoubled upon him till he gave up sleeping and eating and his mother bound her head with the fillets of mourning And while in her sadness she sat at home lamenting over her son behold came in to her an old woman known as the mother of Ahmad Kamakim FN eighty eight the arch thief a knave who would bore through a middle wall and scale the tallest of the tall and steal the very kohl off the eye ball FN eighty nine From his earliest years he had been given to these malpractices till they made him Captain of the Watch when he stole a sum of money and the Chief of Police coming upon him in the act carried him to the Caliph who bade put him to death on the common execution ground FN ninety But he implored protection of the Wazir whose intercession the Caliph never rejected so he pleaded for him with the Commander of the Faithful who said How canst thou intercede for this pest of the human race Ja afar answered O Commander of the Faithful do thou imprison him whoso built the first jail was a sage seeing that a jail is the grave of the living and a joy for the foe So the Caliph bade lay him in bilboes and write thereon Appointed to remain here until death and not to be loosed but on the corpse washer s bench and they cast him fettered into limbo Now his mother was a frequent visitor to the house of the Emir Khalid who was Governor and Chief of Police and she used to go in to her son in jail and say to him Did I not warn thee to turn from thy wicked ways FN ninety one And he would always answer her Allah decreed this to me but O my mother when thou visitest the Emir s wife make her intercede for me with her husband So when the old woman came into the Lady Khatun she found her bound with the fillets of mourning and said to her Wherefore dost thou mourn She replied For my son Habzalam Bazazah and the old woman exclaimed Heaven assain thy son what hath befallen him So the mother told her the whole story and she said What thou say of him who should achieve such a feat as would save thy son Asked the lady And what feat wilt thou do Quoth the old woman I have a son called Ahmad Kamakim the arch thief who lieth chained in jail and on his bilboes is written Appointed to remain till death so do thou don thy richest clothes and trick thee out with thy finest jewels and present thyself to thy husband with an open face and smiling mien and when he seeketh of thee what men seek of women put him off and baulk him of his will and say By Allah tis a strange thing When a man desireth aught of his wife he dunneth her till she doeth it but if a wife desire aught of her husband he will not grant it to her Then he will say What dost thou want and do thou answer First swear to grant my request If he swear to thee by his head or by Allah say to him Swear to me the oath of divorce and do not yield to him except he do this And whenas he hath sworn to thee the oath of divorce say to him Thou keepest in prison a man called Ahmad Kamakim and he hath a poor old mother who hath set upon me and who urgeth me in the matter and who saith Let thy husband intercede for him with the Caliph that my son may repent and thou gain heavenly guerdon And the Lady Khatun replied I hear and obey So when her husband came into her And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Sixty third Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Governor came in to his wife who spoke to him as she had been taught and made him swear the divorce oath before she would yield to his wishes He lay with her that night and when morning dawned after he had made the Ghusl ablution and prayed the dawn prayer he repaired to the prison and said O Ahmad Kamakim O thou arch thief dost thou repent of thy works whereto he replied I do indeed repent and turn to Allah and say with heart and tongue I ask pardon of Allah So the Governor took him out of jail and carried him to the Court he being still in bilboes and approaching the Caliph kissed ground before him Quoth the King O Emir Khalid what seekest thou whereupon he brought forward Ahmad Kamakim shuffling and tripping in his fetters and the Caliph said to him What art thou yet alive O Kamakim He replied O Commander of the Faithful the miserable are long lived Quoth the Caliph to the Emir Why hast thou brought him hither and quoth he O Commander of the Faithful he hath a poor old mother cut off from the world who hath none but this son and she hath had recourse to thy slave imploring him to intercede with thee to strike off his chains for he repenteth of his evil courses and to make him Captain of the Watch as before The Caliph asked Ahmad Kamakim Doss thou repent of thy sins I do indeed repent me to Allah O Commander of the Faithful answered he whereupon the Caliph called for the blacksmith and made him strike off his irons on the corpse washer s bench FN ninety two Moreover he restored him to his former office and charged him to walk in the ways of godliness and righteousness So he kissed the Caliph s hands and being invested with the uniform of Captain of the Watch he went forth whilst they made proclamation of his appointment Now for a long time he abode in the exercise of his office till one day his mother went in to the Governor s wife who said to her Praised be Allah who hath delivered thy son from prison and restored him to health and safety But why dost thou not bid him contrive some trick to get the girl Jessamine for my son Hahzalam Bazazah That will I answered she and going out from her repaired to her son She found him drunk with wine and said to him O my son no one caused thy release from jail but the wife of the Governor and she would have thee find some means to slay Ala al Din Abu al Shamat and get his slave girl Jessamine for her son Habzalam Bazazah He answered That will be the easiest of things and I must needs set about it this very night Now this was the first night of the new month and it was the custom of the Caliph to spend that night with the Lady Zubaydah for the setting free of a slave girl or a Mameluke or something of the sort Moreover on such occasions he used to doff his royal habit together with his rosary and dagger sword and royal signet and set them all upon a chair in the sitting saloon and he had also a golden lanthorn adorned with three jewels strung on a wire of gold by which he set great store and he would commit all these things to the charge of the eunuchry whilst he went into the Lady Zubaydah s apartment So arch thief Ahmad Kamakin waited till midnight when Canopus shone bright and all creatures to sleep were dight whilst the Creator veiled them with the veil of night Then he took his drawn sword in his right and his grappling hook in his left and repairing to the Caliph s sitting saloon planted his scaling ladder and cast his grapnel on to the side of the terrace roof then raising the trap door let himself down into the saloon where he found the eunuchs asleep He drugged them with hemp fumes FN ninety three and taking the Caliph s dress dagger rosary kerchief signet ring and the lanthorn whereupon were the pearls returned whence he came and betook himself to the house of Ala al Din who had that night celebrated his wedding festivities with Jessamine and had gone in unto her and gotten her with child So arch thief Ahmad Kamakim climbed over into his saloon and raising one of the marble slabs from the sunken part of the floor FN ninety four dug a hole under it and laid the stolen things therein all save the lanthorn which he kept for himself Then he plastered down the marble slab as it before was and returning whence he came went back to his own house saying I will now tackle my drink and set this lanthorn before me and quaff the cup to its light FN ninety five Now as soon as it was dawn of day the Caliph went out into the sitting chamber and seeing the eunuchs drugged with hemp aroused them Then he put his hand to the chair and found neither dress nor signet nor rosary nor dagger sword nor kerchief nor lanthorn whereat he was exceeding wroth and donning the dress of anger which was a scarlet suit FN ninety six sat down in the Divan So the Wazir Ja afar came forward and kissing the ground before him said Allah avert all evil from the Commander of the Faithful Answered the Caliph O Wazir the evil is passing great Ja afar asked What has happened so he told him what had occurred and behold the Chief of Police appeared with Ahmad Kamakim the robber at his stirrup when he found the Commander of the Faithful sore enraged As soon as the Caliph saw him he said to him O Emir Khalid how goes Baghdad And he answered Safe and secure Cried he Thou liest How so O Prince of True Believers asked the Emir So he told him the case and added I charge thee to bring me back all the stolen things Replied the Emir O Commander of the Faithful the vinegar worm is of and in the vinegar and no stranger can get at this place FN ninety seven But the Caliph said Except thou bring me these things I will put thee to death Quoth he Ere thou slay me slay Ahmad Kamakim for none should know the robber and the traitor but the Captain of the Watch Then came forward Ahmad Kamakim and said to the Caliph Accept my intercession for the Chief of Police and I will be responsible to thee for the thief and will track his trail till I find him but give me two Kazis and two Assessors for he who did this thing feareth thee not nor cloth he fear the Governor nor any other Answered the Caliph Thou shalt have what thou wantest but let search be made first in my palace and then in those of the Wazir and the Chief of the Sixty Rejoined Ahmad Kamakim Thou sayest well O Commander of the Faith ful belike the man that did this ill deed be one who hath been reared in the King s household or in that of one of his officers Cried the Caliph As my head liveth whosoever shall have done the deed I will assuredly put him to death be it mine own son Then Ahmad Kamakim received a written warrant to enter and perforce search the houses And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Sixty fourth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Ahmad Kamakim got what he wanted and received a written warrant to enter and perforce search the houses so he fared forth taking in his hand a rod FN ninety eight made of bronze and copper iron and steel of each three equal parts He first searched the palace of the Caliph then that of the Wazir Ja afar after which he went the round of the houses of the Chamberlains and the Viceroys till he came to that of Ala al Din Now when the Chief of the Sixty heard the clamour before his house he left his wife Jessamine and went down and opening the door found the Master of Police without in the midst of a tumultuous crowd So he said What is the matter O Emir Khalid Thereupon the Chief told him the case and Ala al Din said Enter my house and search it The Governor replied Pardon O my lord thou art a man in whom trust is reposed and Allah forfend that the trusty turn traitor Quoth Ala al Din There is no help for it but that my house be searched So the Chief of Police entered attended by the Kazi and his Assessors whereupon Ahmad Kamakim went straight to the depressed floor of the saloon and came to the slab under which he had buried the stolen goods and let the rod fall upon it with such violence that the marble broke in sunder and behold something glittered underneath Then said he Bismillah in the name of Allah Mashallah whatso Allah willeth By the blessing of our coming a hoard hath been hit upon wait while we go down into this hiding place and see what is therein So the Kazi and Assessors looked into the hole and finding there the stolen goods drew up a statement FN ninety nine of how they had discovered them in Ala al Din s house to which they set their seals Then they bade seize upon Ala al Din and took his turban from his head and officially registered all his monies and effects which were in the mansion Meanwhile arch thief Ahmad Kamakim laid hands on Jessamine who was with child by Ala al Din and committed her to his mother saying Deliver her to Khatun the Governor s lady so the old woman took her and carried her to the wife of the Master of Police Now as soon as Habzalam Bazazah saw her health and heart returned to him and he arose without stay or delay and joyed with exceeding joy and would have drawn near her but she plucks a dagger from her girdle and said Keep off from me or I will kill thee and kill myself after Exclaimed his mother O strumpet let my son have his will of thee But Jessamine answered O bitch by what law is it lawful for a woman to marry two men and how shall the dog be admitted to the place of the lion With this the ugly youth s love longing redoubled and he sickened for yearning and unfulfilled desire and refusing food returned to his pillow Then said his mother to her O harlot how canst thou make me thus to sorrow for my son Needs must I punish thee with torture and as for Ala al Din he will assuredly be hanged And I will die for love of him answered Jessamine Then the Governor s wife arose and stripped her of her jewels and silken raiment and clothing her in petticoat trousers of sack cloth and a shift of hair cloth sent her down into the kitchen and made her a scullery wench saying The reward for thy constancy shall be to break up fire wood and peel onions and set fire under the cooking pots Quoth she I am willing to suffer all manner of hardships and servitude but I will not suffer the sight of thy son However Allah inclined the hearts of the slave girls to her and they used to do her service in the kitchen Such was the case with Jessamine but as regards Ala al Din they carried him together with the stolen goods to the Divan where the Caliph still sat upon his throne And behold the King looked upon his effects and said Where did ye find them They replied In the very middle of the house belonging to Ala al Din Abu al Shamat whereat the Caliph was filled with wrath and took the things but found not the lanthorn among them and said O Ala al Din where is the lanthorn He answered I stole it not I know naught of it I never saw it I can give no information about it Said the Caliph O traitor how cometh it that I brought thee near unto me and thou hast cast me out afar and I trusted in thee and thou betrayest me And he commanded to hang him So the Chief of Police took him and went down with him into the city whilst the crier preceded them proclaiming aloud and saying This is the reward and the least of the reward he shall receive who doth treason against the Caliphs of True Belief And the folk flocked to the place where the gallows stood Thus far concerning him but as regards Ahmad al Danaf Ala al Din s adopted father he was sitting making merry with his followers in a garden and carousing and pleasuring when lo in came one of the water carriers of the Divan and kissing the hand of Ahmad al Danaf said to him O Captain Ahmad O Danaf thou sittest at thine ease with water flowing at thy feet FN one hundred and thou knowest not what hath happened Asked Ahmad What is it and the other answered They have gone down to the gallows with thy son Ala al Din adopted by a covenant before Allah Quoth Ahmad What is the remedy here O Hasan Shuuman and what sayst thou of this He replied Assuredly Ala al Din is innocent and this blame hath come to him from some one enemy FN one hundred one Quoth Ahmad What counsellest thou and Hasan said We must rescue him Inshallah Then he went to the jail and said to the gaolor Give us some one who deserveth death So he gave him one that was likest of men to Ala al Din Abu al Shamat and they covered his head and carried him to the place of execution between Ahmad al Danaf and Ali al Zaybak of Cairo FN one hundred two Now they had brought Ala al Din to the gibbet to hang him but Ahmad al Danaf came forward and set his foot on that of the hangman who said Give me room to do my duty He replied O accursed take this man and hang him in Ala al Din s stead for he is innocent and we will ransom him with this fellow even as Abraham ransomed Ishmael with the ram FN one hundred three So the hangman seized the man and hanged him in lieu of Ala al Din whereupon Ahmad and Ali took Ala al Din and carried him to Ahmad s quarters and when there Ala al Din turned to him and said O my sire and chief Allah requite thee with the best of good Quoth he O Ala al Din And Shahrazed perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Sixty fifth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Calamity Ahmad cried O Ala al Din what is this deed thou hast done The mercy of Allah be on him who said Whoso trusteth thee betray him not e en if thou be a traitor Now the Caliph set thee in high place about him and styled thee Trusty and Faithful how then couldst thou deal thus with him and steal his goods By the Most Great Name O my father and chief replied Ala al Din I had no hand in this nor did I such deed nor know I who did it Quoth Ahmad Of a surety none did this but a manifest enemy and whoso doth aught shall be requited for his deed but O Ala al Din thou canst sojourn no longer in Baghdad for Kings O my son may not pass from one thing to another and when they go in quest of a man ah longsome is his travail Whither shall I go O my chief asked Ala al Din and he answered O my son I will bring thee to Alexandria for it is a blessed place its threshold is green and its sojourn is agreeable And Ala al Din rejoined I hear and I obey O my chief So Ahmad said to Hasan Shuuman Be mindful and when the Caliph asketh for me say He is gone touring about the provinces Then taking Ala al Din he went forth of Baghdad and stayed not going till they came to the outlying vineyards and gardens where they met two Jews of the Caliph s tax gatherers riding on mules Quoth Ahmad Al Danaf to these Give me the black mail FN one hundred four and quoth they Why should we pay thee black mail whereto he replied Because I am the watchman of this valley So they gave him each an hundred gold pieces after which he slew them and took their mules one of which he mounted whilst Ala al Din bestrode the other Then they rode on till they came to the city of Ayas FN one hundred five and put up their beasts for the night at the Khan And when morning dawned Ala al Din sold his own mule and committed that of Ahmad to the charge of the door keeper of the caravanserai after which they took ship from Ayas port and sailed to Alexandria Here they landed and walked up to the bazar and behold there was a broker crying a shop and a chamber behind it for nine hundred and fifty dinars Upon this Ala al Din bid a thousand which the broker accepted for the premises belonged to the Treasury and the seller handed over to him the keys and the buyer opened the shop and found the inner parlour furnished with carpets and cushions Moreover he found there a store room full of sails and masts cordage and seamen s chests bags of beads and cowrie FN one hundred six shells stirrups battle axes maces knives scissors and such matters for the last owner of the shop had been a dealer in second hand goods FN one hundred seven ook his seat in the shop and Ahmad al Danaf said to him O my son the shop and the room and that which is therein are become thine so tarry thou here and buy and sell and repine not at thy lot for Almighty Allah blesseth trade After this he abode with him three days and on the fourth he took leave of him saying Abide here till I go back and bring thee the Caliph s pardon and learn who hath played thee this trick Then he shipped for Ayas where he took the mule from the inn and returning to Baghdad met Pestilence Hasan and his followers to whom said he Hath the Caliph asked after me and he replied No nor hast thou come to his thought So he resumed his service about the Caliph s person and set himself to sniff about for news of Ala al Din s case till one day he heard the Caliph say to the Watir See O Ja afar how Ala al Din dealt with me Replied the Minister O Commander of the Faithful thou hast requited him with hanging and hath he not met with his reward Quoth he O Wazir I have a mind to go down and see him hanging and the Wazir answered Do what thou wilt O Commander of the Faithful So the Caliph accompanied by Ja afar went down to the place of execution and raising his eyes saw the hanged man to be other than Ala al Din Abu al Shamat surnamed the Trusty and said O Wazir this is not Ala al Din How knowest thou that it is not he asked the Minister and the Caliph answered Ala al Din was short and this one is tall Quoth Ja afar Hanging stretcheth Quoth the Caliph Ala al Din was fair and this one s face is black Said Ja afar Knowest thou not O Commander of the Faithful that death is followed by blackness Then the Caliph bade take down the body from the gallows tree and they found the names of the two Shaykhs Abu Bakr and Omar written on its heels FN one hundred eight whereupon cried the Caliph O Wazir Ala al Din was a Sunnite and this fellow is a Rejecter a Shi ah He answered Glory be to Allah who knoweth the hidden things while we know not whether this was Ala al Din or other than he Then the Caliph bade bury the body and they buried it and Ala al Din was forgotten as though he never had been Such was his case but as regards Habzalam Bazazah the Emir Khalid s son he ceased not to languish for love and longing till he died and they joined him to the dust And as for the young wife Jessamine she accomplished the months of her pregnancy and being taken with labour pains gave birth to a boy child like unto the moon And when her fellow slave girls said to her What wilt thou name him she answered Were his father well he had named him but now I will name him Aslan FN one hundred nine She gave him suck for two successive years then weaned him and he crawled and walked Now it so came to pass that one day whilst his mother was busied with the service of the kitchen the boy went out and seeing the stairs mounted to the guest chamber FN one hundred ten And the Emir Khalid who was sitting there took him upon his lap and glorified his Lord for that which he had created and fashioned then closely eyeing his face the Governor saw that he was the likest of all creatures to Ala al Din Abu al Shamat Presently his mother Jessamine sought for him and finding him not mounted to the guest chamber where she saw the Emir seated with the child playing in his lap for Allah had inclined his heart to the boy And when the child espied his mother he would have thrown himself upon her but the Emir held him tight to his bosom and said to Jessamine Come hither O damsel So she came to him when he said to her Whose son is this and she replied He is my son and the fruit of my vitals And who is his father asked the Emir and she answered His father was Ala al Din Abu al Shamat but now he is become thy son Quoth Khalid In very sooth Ala al Din was a traitor Quoth she Allah deliver him from treason the Heavens forfend and forbid that the Trusty should be a traitor Then said he When this boy shall grow up and reach man s estate and say to thee Who is my father say to him Thou art the son of the Emir Khalid Governor and Chief of Police And she answered I hear and I obey Then he circumcised the boy and reared him with the goodliest rearing and engaged for him a professor of law and religious science and an expert penman who taught him to read and write so he read the Koran twice and learnt it by heart and he grew up saying to the Emir O my father Moreover the Governor used to go down with him to the tilting ground and assemble horsemen and teach the lad the fashion of fight and fray and the place to plant lance thrust and sabre stroke so that by the time he was fourteen years old he became a valiant wight and accomplished knight and gained the rank of Emir Now it chanced one day that Aslan fell in with Ahmad Kamakim the arch thief and accompanied him as cup companion to the tavern FN one hundred eleven and behold Ahmad took out the jewelled lanthorn he had stolen from the Caliph and setting it before him pledged the wine cup to its light till he became drunken So Aslan said to him O Captain give me this lanthorn but he replied I cannot give it to thee Asked Aslan Why not and Ahmad answered Because lives have been lost for it Whose life enquired Aslan and Ahmad rejoined There came hither a man who was made Chief of the Sixty he was named Ala al Din Abu al Shamat and he lost his life through this lanthorn Quoth Aslan And what was that story and what brought about his death Quoth Ahmad Kamakim Thou hadst an elder brother by name Hahzalam Bazazah and when he reached the age of sixteen and was ripe for marriage thy father would have bought him a slave girl named Jessamine And he went on to tell him the whole story from first to last of Habzalam Bazazah s illness and what befell Ala al Din in his innocence When Aslan heard this he said in thought Haply this slave girl was my mother Jessamine and my father was none other than Ala al Din Abu al Shamat So the boy went out from him sorrowful and met Calamity Ahmad who at sight of him exclaimed Glory be to Him unto whom none is like Asked Hasan the Pestilence Whereat dost thou marvel O my chief and Ahmad the Calamity replied At the make of yonder boy Aslan for he is the likest of human creatures to Ala al Din Abu al Shamat Then he called the lad and said to him O Aslan what is thy mother s name to which he replied She is called the damsel Jessamine and the other said Harkye Aslan be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear for thy father was none other than Ala al Din Abu al Shamat but O my son go thou in to thy mother and question her of thy father He said Hearkening and obedience and going in to his mother put the question whereupon quoth she Thy sire is the Emir Khalid Not so rejoined he my father was none other than Ala al Din Abu al Shamat At this the mother wept and said Who acquainted thee with this O my son And he answered Ahmad al Danaf Captain of the Guard So she told him the whole story saying O my son the True hath prevailed and the False hath failed FN one hundred twelve know that Ala al Din Abu al Shamat was indeed thy sire but it was none save the Emir Khalid who reared thee and adopted thee as his son And now O my child when thou seest Ahmad al Danaf the captain do thou say to him I conjure thee by Allah O my chief take my blood revenge on the murderer of my father Ala al Din Abu al Shamat So he went out from his mother And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Sixty sixth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Aslan went out from his mother and betaking himself to Calamity Ahmad kissed his hand Quoth the captain What aileth thee O Aslan and quoth he I know now for certain that my father was Ali al Din Abu al Shamat and I would have thee take my blood revenge on his murderer He asked And who was thy father s murderer whereto Aslan answered Ahmad Kamakim the arch thief Who told thee this enquired he and Aslan rejoined I saw in his hand the jewelled lanthorn which was lost with the rest of the Caliph s gear and I said to him Give me this lanthorn but he refused saying Lives have been lost on account of this and told me it was he who had broken into the palace and stolen the articles and deposited them in my father s house Then said Ahmad al Danaf When thou seest the Emir Khalid don his harness of war say to him Equip me like thyself and take me with thee Then do thou go forth and perform some feat of prowess before the Commander of the Faithful and he will say to thee Ask a boon of me O Aslan And do thou make answer I ask of thee this boon that thou take my blood revenge on my father s murderer If he say Thy father is yet alive and is the Emir Khalid the Chief of the Police answer thou My father was Ala al Din Abu al Shamat and the Emir Khalid hath a claim upon me only as the foster father who adopted me Then tell him all that passed between thee and Ahmad Kamakim and say O Prince of True Believers order him to be searched and I will bring the lanthorn forth from his bosom Thereupon said Aslan to him I hear and obey and returning to the Emir Khalid found him making ready to repair to the Caliph s court and said to him I would fain have thee arm and harness me like thyself and take me with thee to the Divan So he equipped him and carried him thither Then the Caliph sallied forth of Baghdad with his troops and they pitched tents and pavilions without the city whereupon the host divided into two parties and forming ranks fell to playing Polo one striking the ball with the mall and another striking it back to him Now there was among the troops a spy who had been hired to slay the Caliph so he took the ball and smiting it with the bat drove it straight at the Caliph s face when behold Aslan fended it off and catching it drove it back at him who smote it so that it struck him between the shoulders and he fell to the ground The Caliph exclaimed Allah bless thee O Aslan and they all dismounted and sat on chairs Then the Caliph bade them bring the smiter of the ball before him and said Who tempted thee to do this thing and art thou friend or foe Quoth he I am thy foe and it was my purpose to kill thee Asked the Caliph And wherefore Art not a Moslem Replied the spy No I am a Rejecter FN one hundred thirteen So the Caliph bade them put him to death and said to Aslan Ask a boon of me Quoth he I ask of thee this boon that thou take my blood revenge on my father s murderer He said Thy father is alive and there he stands on his two feet And who is he asked Aslan and the Caliph answered He is the Emir Khalid Chief of Police Rejoined Aslan O Commander of the Faithful he is no father of mine save by right of fosterage my father was none other than Ala al Din Abu al Shamat Then thy father was a traitor cried the Caliph Allah forbid O Commander of the Faithful rejoined Aslan that the Trusty should be a traitor But how did he betray thee Quoth the Caliph He stole my habit and what was therewith Aslan retorted O Commander of the Faithful Allah forfend that my father should be a traitor But O my lord when thy habit was lost and found didst thou likewise recover the lanthorn which was stolen from thee Answered the Caliph We never got it back and Aslan said I saw it in the hands of Ahmad Kamakim and begged it of him but he refused to give it me saying Lives have been lost on account of this Then he told me of the sickness of Habzalam Bazazah son of the Emir Khalid by reason of his passion for the damsel Jessamine and how he himself was released from bonds and that it was he who stole the habit and the lamp so do thou O Commander of the Faithful take my blood revenge for my father on him who murdered him At once the Caliph cried Seize ye Ahmad Kamakim and they seized him whereupon he asked Where be the Captain Ahmad al Danaf And when he was summoned the Caliph bade him search Kamakim so he put his hand into the thief s bosom and pulled out the lanthorn Said the Caliph Come hither thou traitor whence hadst thou this lanthorn and Kamakim replied I bought it O Commander of the Faithful The Caliph rejoined Where didst thou buy it Then they beat him till he owned that he had stolen the lanthorn the habit and the rest and the Caliph said What moved thee to do this thing O traitor and ruin Ala al Din Abu al Shamat the Trusty and Faithful Then he bade them lay hands on him and on the Chief of Police but the Chief said O Commander of the Faithful indeed I am unjustly treated thou badest me hang him and I had no knowledge of this trick for the plot was contrived between the old woman and Ahmad Kamakim and my wife I crave thine intercession FN one hundred fourteen O Aslan So Aslan interceded for him with the Caliph who said What hath Allah done with this youngster s mother Answered Khalid She is with me and the Caliph continued I command that thou order thy wife to dress her in her own clothes and ornaments and restore her to her former degree a lady of rank and do thou remove the seals from Ala al Din s house and give his son possession of his estate I hear and obey answered Khalid and going forth gave the order to his wife who clad Jessamine in her own apparel whilst he himself removed the seals from Ala al Din s house and gave Aslan the keys Then said the Caliph Ask a boon of me O Aslan and he replied I beg of thee the boon to unite me with my father Whereat the Caliph wept and said Most like thy sire was he that was hanged and is dead but by the life of my forefathers whoso bringeth me the glad news that he is yet in the bondage of this life I will give him all he seeketh Then came forward Ahmad al Danaf and kissing the ground between his hands said Grant me indemnity O Commander of the Faithful Thou hast it answered the Caliph and Calamity Ahmad said I give thee the good news that Ala al Din Abu al Shamat the Trusty the Faithful is alive and well Quoth the Caliph What is this thou sayest Quoth Al Danaf As thy head liveth I say sooth for I ransomed him with another of those who deserved death and carried him to Alexandria where I opened for him a shop and set him up as a dealer in second hand goods Then said the Prince of True Believers And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Sixty seventh Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Caliph ordered Calamity Ahmad saying I charge thee fetch him to me and the other replied To hear is to obey whereupon the Caliph bade them give him ten thousand gold pieces and he fared forth for Alexandria On this wise it happed with Aslan but as regards his father Ala al Din Abu al Shamat he sold in course of time all that was in his shop excepting a few things and amongst them a long bag of leather And happening to shake the bag there fell out a jewel which filled the palm of the hand hanging to a chain of gold and having many facets but especially five whereon were names and talismanic characters as they were ant tracks So he rubbed each face but none answered him FN one hundred fifteen and he said to himself Doubtless it is a piece of variegated onyx and then hung it up in the shop And behold a Consul FN one hundred sixteen passed along the street and raising his eyes saw the jewel hanging up so he seated himself over against the shop and said to Ala al Din O my lord is the jewel for sale He answered All I have is for sale Thereupon the Frank said Wilt thou sell me that same for eighty thousand dinars Allah open replied Ala al Din The Frank asked Wilt thou sell it for an hundred thousand dinars and he answered I sell it to thee for a hundred thousand dinars pay me down the monies Quoth the Consul I cannot carry about such sum as its price for there be robbers and sharpers in Alexandria but come with me to my ship and I will pay thee the price and give thee to boot a bale of Angora wool a bale of satin a bale of velvet and a bale of broadcloth So Ala al Din rose and locked up his shop after giving the jewel to the Frank and committed the keys to his neighbour saying Keep these keys in trust for me whilst I go with this Consul to his ship and return with the price of my jewel If I be long absent and there come to thee Ahmad al Danaf the Captain who stablished me in this shop give him the keys and tell him where I am Then he went with the Consul to his ship and no sooner had he boarded it than the Prank set him a stool and making him sit down said to his men Bring the money So they brought it and he paid him the price of the jewel and gave him the four bales he had promised him and one over after which he said to him O my lord honour me by accepting a bite or a sup And Ala al Din answered If thou have any water give me to drink So the Frank called for sherbets and they brought drink drugged with Bhang of which no sooner had Ala al Din drunk than he fell over on his back whereupon they stowed away the chairs and shipped the shoving poles and made sail Now the wind blew fair for them till it drove them into blue water and when they were beyond sight of land the Kaptan FN one hundred seventeen bade bring Ala al Din up out of the hold and made him smell the counter drug of Bhang whereupon he opened his eyes and said Where am I He replied Thou art bound and in my power and if thou hadst said Allah open to an hundred thousand dinars for the jewel I would have bidden thee more What art thou asked Ala al Din and the other answered I am a sea captain and mean to carry thee to my sweetheart Now as they were talking behold a strip hove in sight carrying forty Moslem merchants so the Frank captain attacked the vessel and made fast to it with grappling irons then he boarded it with his men and took it and plundered it after which he sailed on with his prize till he reached the city of Genoa There the Kaptan who was carrying off Ala al Din landed and repaired to a palace whose pastern gave upon the sea and behold there came down to him a damsel in a chin veil who said Hast thou brought the jewel and the owner I have brought them both answered he and she said Then give me the jewel So he gave it to her and returning to the port fired his cannon to announce his safe return whereupon the King of the city being notified of that Kaptan s arrival came down to receive him and asked him How hath been this voyage He answered A right prosperous one and while voyaging I have made prize of a ship with one and forty Moslem merchants Said the King Land them at the port so he landed the merchants in irons and Ala al Din among the rest and the King and the Kaptan mounted and made the captives walk before them till they reached the audience chamber when the Franks seated themselves and caused the prisoners to pass in parade order one by one before the King who said to the first O Moslem whence comest thou He answered From Alexandria whereupon the King said O headsman put him to death So the sworder smote him with the sword and cut off his head and thus it fared with the second and the third till forty were dead and there remained but Ala al Din who drank the cup of his comrades sighs and agony and said to himself Allah have mercy on thee O Ala al Din Thou art a dead man Then said the King to him And thou what countryman art thou He answered I am of Alexandria and the King said O headsman strike off his head So the sworder raised arm and sword and was about to strike when behold an old woman of venerable aspect presented herself before the King who rose to do her honour and said to him O King did I not bid thee remember when the Captain came back with captives to keep one or two for the convent to serve in the church The King replied O my mother would thou hadst come a while earlier But take this one that is left So she turned to Ala al Din and said to him Say wilt thou serve in the church or shall I let the King slay thee Quoth he I will serve in the church So she took him and carried him forth of the court and went to the church where he said to her What service must I do She replied Thou must rise with the dawn and take five mules and go with them to the forest and there cut dry fire wood and saw it short and bring it to the convent kitchen Then must thou take up the carpets and sweep and wipe the stone and marble pavements and lay the carpets down again as they were after which thou must take two bushels and a half of wheat and bolt it and grind it and knead it and make it into cracknels FN one hundred eighteen for the convent and thou must take also a bushel of lentils FN one hundred nineteen and sift and crush and cook them Then must thou fetch water in barrels and fill the four fountains after which thou must take three hundred and threescore and six wooden bowls and crumble the cracknels therein and pour of the lentil pottage over each and carry every monk and patriarch his bowl Said Ala al Din FN one hundred twenty Take me back to the King and let him kill me it were easier to me than this service Replied the old woman If thou do truly and rightly the service that is due from thee thou shalt escape death but if thou do it not I will let the King kill thee And with these words Ala al Din was left sitting heavy at heart Now there were in the church ten blind cripples and one of them said to him Bring me a pot So he brought it him and he cacked and eased himself therein and said Throw away the ordure He did so and the blind man said The Messiah s blessing be upon thee O servant of the church Presently behold the old woman came in and said to him Why hast thou not done thy service in the church Answered he How many hands have I that I should suffice for all this work She rejoined Thou fool I brought thee not hither except to work and she added Take O my son this rod which was of copper capped with a cross and go forth into the highway and when thou meetest the governor of the city say to him I summon thee to the service of the church in the name of our Lord the Messiah And he will not disobey thee Then make him take the wheat sift grind bolt knead and bake it into cracknels and if any gainsay thee beat him and fear none To hear is to obey answered he and did as she said and never ceased pressing great and small into his service nor did he leave to do thus for the space of seventeen years Now one day as he sat in church lo the old woman came to him and said Go forth of the convent He asked Whither shall I go and she answered Thou canst pass the night in a tavern or with one of thy comrades Quoth he Why dost thou send me forth of the church and quote she The Princess Husn Maryam daughter of Yohanna FN one hundred twenty one King of this city purposeth to visit the church and it befitteth not that any abide in her way So he made a show of obeying her orders and rose up and pretended that he was leaving the church but he said in his mind I wonder whether the Princess is like our women or fairer than they At any rate I will not go till I have had a look at her So he hid himself in a closet with a window looking into the church and as he watched behold in came the King s daughter He cast at her one glance of eyes that cost him a thousand sighs for he found her like the full moon when it cometh swimming out of the clouds and he saw with her a young lady And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Sixty eighth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Ala al Din looked at the King s daughter he saw with her a young lady to whom he heard her say Thy company hath cheered me O Zubaydah So he looked straitly at the damsel and found her to be none other than his dead wife Zubaydah the Lutist Then the Princess said to Zubaydah Come play us an air on the lute But she answered I will make no music for thee till thou grant my wish and keep thy word to me Asked the Princess And what did I promise thee and Zubaydah answered That thou wouldst reunite me with my husband Ala al Din Abu al Shamat the Trusty the Faithful Rejoined the Princess O Zubaydah be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear play us a piece as a thank offering and an ear feast for reunion with thy husband Ala al Din Where is he asked Zubaydah and Maryam answered He is in yonder closet listening to our words So Zubaydah played on the lute a melody which had made a rock dance for glee and when Ala al Din heard it his bowels yearned towards her and he came forth from the closet and throwing himself upon his wife Zubaydah strained her to his bosom She also knew him and the twain embraced and fell to the ground in a swoon Then came forward the Princess Husn Maryam and sprinkled rose water on them till they revived when she said to them Allah hath reunited you Replied Ala al Din By thy kind of offices O lady Then turning to his wife he said to her O Zubaydah thou didst surely die and we tombed thee in the tomb how then returnedst thou to life and camest thou to this place She answered O my lord I did not die but an Aun FN one hundred twenty two of the Jinn snatched me up and dew with me hither She whom thou buriedst was a Jinniyah who shaped herself to my shape and feigned herself dead but when you entombed her she broke open the tomb and came forth from it and returned to the service of this her mistress the Princess Husn Maryam As for me I was possessed FN one hundred twenty three and when I opened my eyes I found myself with this Princess thou seest so I said to her Why hast thou brought me hither Replied she I am predestined to marry thy husband Ala al Din Abu al Shamat wilt thou then O Zubaydah accept me to company consort a night for me and a night for thee Rejoined I To hear is to obey O my lady but where is my husband Quoth she Upon his forehead is written what Allah hath decreed to him as soon as the writing which is there writ is fulfilled to him there is no help for it but he come hither and we will beguile the time of our separation from him with songs and playing upon instruments of music till it please Allah to unite us with him So I abode all these days with her till Allah brought us together in this church Then Husn Maryam turned to him and said O my lord Ala al Din wilt thou be to me baron and I be to thee femme Quoth he O my lady I am a Moslem and thou art a Nazarene so how can I intermarry with thee Quoth she Allah forbid that I should be an infidel Nay I am a Moslemah for these eighteen years I have held fast the Faith of Al Islam and I am pure of any creed other than that of the Islamite Then said he O my lady I desire a return to my native land and she replied Know that I see written on thy forehead things which thou must needs accomplish and then thou shalt win to thy will Moreover be fief and fain O Ala al Din that there hath been born to thee a son named Aslan who now being arrived at age of discretion sitteth in thy place with the Caliph Know also that Truth hath prevailed and that Falsehood naught availed and that the Lord hath withdrawn the curtain of secrecy from him who stole the Caliph s goods that is Ahmad Kamakim the arch thief and traitor and he now lieth bound and in jail And know further twas I who sent thee the jewel and had it put in the bag where thou foundest it and twas I who sent the captain that brought thee and the jewel for thou must know that the man is enamoured of me and seeketh my favours and would possess me but I refused to yield to his wishes or let him have his will of me and I said him Thou shalt never have me till thou bring me the jewel and its owner So I gave him an hundred purses and despatched him to thee in the habit of a merchant whereas he is a captain and a war man and when they led thee to thy death after slaying the forty captives I also sent thee this old woman to save thee from slaughter Said he Allah requite thee for us with all good Indeed thou hast done well Then Husn Maryam renewed at his hands her profession of Al Islam and when he was assured of the truth of her speech he said to her O my lady tell me what are the virtues of this jewel and whence cometh it She answered This jewel came from an enchanted hoard and it hath five virtues which will profit us in time of need Now my lady grandmother the mother of my father was an enchantress and skilled in solving secrets and finding hidden treasures from one of which came the jewel into her hands And as I grew up and reached the age of fourteen I read the Evangel and other books and I found the name of Mohammed whom Allah bless and preserve in the four books namely the Evangel the Pentateuch the Psalms and the Koran FN one hundred twenty four so I believed in Mohammed and became a Moslemah being certain and assured that none is worship worth save Allah Almighty and that to the Lord of all mankind no faith is acceptable save that of Al Islam Now when my lady grandmother fell sick she gave me this jewel and taught me its five virtues Moreover before she died my father said to her Take thy tablets of geomancy and throw a figure and tell us the issue of my affair and what will befal me And she foretold him that the far off one FN one hundred twenty five should die slain by the hand of a captive from Alexandria So he swore to kill every prisoner from that place and told the Kaptan of this saying There is no help for it but thou fall on the ships of the Moslems and seize them and whomsoever thou findest of Alexandria kill him or bring him to me The Captain did his bidding until he had slain as many in number as the hairs of his head Then my grandmother died and I took a geomantic tablet being minded and determined to know the future and I said to myself Let me see who will wed me Whereupon I threw a figure and found that none should be my husband save one called Ala al Din Abu al Shamat the Trusty the Faithful At this I marvelled and waited till the times were accomplished and I foregathered with thee So Ala al Din took her to wife and said to her I desire to return to my own country Quoth she If it be so rise up and come with me Then she took him and hiding him in a closet of her palace went in to her father who said to her O my daughter my heart is exceeding heavy this day sit down and let us make merry with wine I and thou So she sat down with him and he called for a table of wine and she plied him till he lost his wits when she drugged a cup with Bhang and he drank it off and fell upon his back Then she brought Ala al Din out of the closet and said to him Come verily thine enemy lieth prostrate for I made him drunk and drugged him so do thou with him as thou wilt Accordingly Ala al Din went to the King and finding him lying drugged and helpless pinioned him fast and manacled and fettered him with chains Then he gave him the counter drug and he came to himself And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Sixty ninth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Ala al Din gave the antidote of Bhang to King Yohanna father of Husn Maryam and he came to himself and found Ala al Din and his daughter sitting on his breast So he said to her O my daughter dost thou deal thus with me She answered If I be indeed thy daughter become a Moslem even as I became a Moslemah for the truth was shown to me and I attested it and the false and I deserted it I have submitted myself unto Allah The Lord of the Three Worlds and am pure of all faiths contrary to that of Al Islam in this world and in the next world Wherefore if thou wilt become a Moslem well and good if not thy death were better than thy life Ala al Din also exhorted him to embrace the True Faith but he refused and was contumacious so Ala al Din drew a dagger and cut his throat from ear to ear FN one hundred twenty six Then he wrote a scroll setting forth what had happened and laid it on the brow of the dead after which they took what was light of load and weighty of worth and turned from the palace and returned to the church Here the Princess drew forth the jewel and placing her hand upon the facet where was figured a couch rubbed it and behold a couch appeared before her and she mounted upon it with Ala al Din and his wife Zubaydah the lutist saying I conjure thee by the virtue of the names and talismans and characts engraver on this jewel rise up with us O Couch And it rose with them into the air and flew till it came to a Wady wholly bare of growth when the Princess turned earthwards the facet on which the couch was figured and it sank with them to the ground Then she turned up the face where on was fashioned a pavilion and tapping it said Let a pavilion be pitched in this valley and there appeared a pavilion wherein they seated themselves Now this Wady was a desert waste without grass or water so she turned a third face of the jewel towards the sky and said By the virtue of the names of Allah let trees upgrow here and a river flow beside them And forthwith trees sprang up and by their side ran a river plashing and dashing They made the ablution and prayed and drank of the stream after which the Princess turned up the three other facets till she came to the fourth whereon was portrayed a table of good and said By the virtue of the names of Allah let the table be spread And behold there appeared before them a table spread with all manner of rich meats and they ate and drank and made merry and were full of joy Such was their case but as regards Husn Maryam s father his son went in to waken him and found him slain and seeing Ala al Din s scroll took it and read it and readily understood it Then he sought his sister and finding her not betook himself to the old woman in the church of whom he enquired for her but she said Since yesterday I have not seen her So he returned to the troops and cried out saying To horse ye horsemen Then he told them what had happened so they mounted and rode after the fugitives till they drew near the pavilion Presently Husn Maryam arose and looked up and saw a cloud of dust which spread till it walled the view then it lifted and flew and lo stood disclosed her brother and his troops crying aloud Whither will ye fly and we on your track Then said she to Ala al Din Are thy feet firm in fight He replied Even as the stake in bran I know not war nor battle nor swords nor spears So she pulled out the jewel and rubbed the fifth face that on which were graven a horse and his rider and behold straightway a cavalier appeared out of the desert and ceased not to do battle with the pursuing host and smite them with the sword till he routed them and put them to flight Then the Princess asked Ala al Din Wilt thou go to Cairo or to Alexandria and he answered To Alexandria So they mounted the couch and she pronounced over it the conjuration whereupon it set off with them and in the twinkling of an eye brought them to Alexandria They alighted without the city and Ala al Din hid the women in a cavern whilst he went into Alexandria and fetched them outer clothing wherewith he covered them Then he carried them to his shop and leaving them in the ben FN one hundred twenty seven walked forth to fetch them the morning meal and behold he met Calamity Ahmad who chanced to be coming from Baghdad He saw him in the street and received him with open arms saluting him and welcoming him Whereupon Ahmad al Danaf gave him the good news of his son Aslan and how he was now come to the age of twenty and Ala al Din in his turn told the Captain of the Guard all that had befallen him from first to last whereat he marvelled with exceeding marvel Then he brought him to his shop and sitting room where they passed the night and next day he sold his place of business and laid its price with other monies Now Ahmad al Danaf had told him that the Caliph sought him but he said I am bound first for Cairo to salute my father and mother and the people of my house So they all mounted the couch and it carried them to Cairo the God guarded and here they alighted in the street called Yellow FN one hundred twenty eight where stood the house of Shams al Din Then Ala al Din knocked at the door and his mother said Who is at the door now that we have lost our beloved for evermore He replied Tis I Ala al Din whereupon they came down and embraced him Then he sent his wives and baggage into the house and entering himself with Ahmad al Danaf rested there three days after which he was minded to set out for Baghdad His father said Abide with me O my son but he answered I cannot bear to be parted from my child Aslan So he took his father and mother and fared forth for Baghdad Now when they came thither Ahmad al Danaf went in to the Caliph and gave him the glad tidings of Ala al Din s arrival and told him his story whereupon the King went forth to greet him taking the youth Aslan and they met and embraced each other Then the Commander of the Faithful summoned the arch thief Ahmad Kamakim and said to Ala al Din Up and at thy foe So he drew his sword and smote off Ahmad Kamakim s head Then the Caliph held festival for Ala al Din and summoning the Kazis and witnesses wrote the contract and married him to the Princess Husn Maryam and he went in unto her and found her an unpierced pearl Moreover the Caliph made Aslan Chief of the Sixty and bestowed upon him and his father sumptuous dresses of honour and they abode in the enjoyment of all joys and joyance of life till there came to them the Destroyer of delights and the Sunderer of societies But the tales of generous men are manifold and amongst them is the story of HATIM OF THE TRIBE OF TAYY It is told of Hatim of the tribe of Tayy FN one hundred twenty nine that when he died they buried him on the top of a mountain and set over his grave two troughs hewn out of two rocks and stone girls with dishevelled hair At the foot of the hill was a stream of running water and when wayfarers camped there they heard loud crying and keening in the night from dark till daybreak but when they arose in the morning they found nothing but the girls carved in stone Now when Zu l Kura a FN one hundred thirty King of Himyar going forth of his tribe came to that valley he halted to pass the night there And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Seventieth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Zu l Kura a passed by the valley he righted there and when he drew near the mountain he heard the keening and said What lamenting is that on yonder hill They answered him saying Verily this be the tomb of Hatim al Tayy over which are two troughs of stone and stone figures of girls with dishevelled hair and all who camp in this place by night hear this crying and keening So he said jestingly O Hatim of Tayy we are thy guests this night and we are lank with hunger Then sleep overcame him but presently he awoke in affright and cried out saying Help O Arabs Look to my beast So they came to him and finding his she camel struggling and struck down they stabbed her in the throat and roasted her flesh and ate Then they asked him what had happened and he said When I closed my eyes I saw in my sleep Hatim of Tayy who came to me sword in hand and cried Thou comest to us and we have nothing by us Then he smote my she camel with his sword and she had surely died even though ye had not come to her and slaughtered her FN one hundred thirty one Now when morning dawned the King mounted the beast of one of his companions and taking the owner up behind him set out and fared on till midday when they saw a man coming towards them mounted on a camel and leading another and said to him Who art thou He answered I am Adi FN one hundred thirty two son of Hatim of Tayy where is Zu l Kura a Emir of Himyar Replied they This is he and he said to the prince Take this she camel in place of thy beast which my father slaughtered for thee Asked Zu l Kura a Who told thee of this and Adi answered My father appeared to me in a dream last night and said to me Harkye Adi Zu l Kura a King of Himyar sought the guest rite of me and I having naught to give him slaughtered his she camel that he might eat so do thou carry him a she camel to ride for I have nothing And Zu l Kura a took her marvelling at the generosity of Hatim of Tayy alive and dead And amongst instances of generosity is the TALE OF MA AN THE SON OF ZAIDAH FN one hundred thirty three It is told of Ma an bin Zaidah that being out one day a chasing and a hunting he became athirst but his men had no water with them and while thus suffering behold three damsels met him bearing three skins of water And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Seventy first Night FN one hundred thirty four She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that three girls met him bearing three skins of water so he begged drink of them and they gave him to drink Then he sought of his men somewhat to give the damsels but they had no money so he presented to each girl ten golden piled arrows from his quiver Whereupon quoth one of them to her friend Well a day These fashions pertain to none but Ma an bin Zaidah so let each one of us say somewhat of verse in his praise Then quoth the first He heads his arrows with piles of gold And while shooting his foes is his bounty doled Affording the wounded a means of cure And a sheet for the bider beneath the mould And quoth the second A warrior showing such open hand His boons all friends and all foes enfold The piles of his arrows of or are made So that battle his bounty may not withhold And quoth the third From that liberal hand on his foes he rains Shafts aureate headed and manifold Wherewith the hurt shall chirurgeon pay And for slain the shrouds round their corpses roll d FN one hundred thirty five And there is also told a tale of MA AN SON OF ZAIDAH AND THE BADAWI Now Ma an bin Zaidah went forth one day to the chase with his company and they came upon a herd of gazelles so they separated in pursuit and Ma an was left alone to chase one of them When he had made prize of it he alighted and slaughtered it and as he was thus engaged he espied a person FN one hundred thirty six coming forth out of the desert on an ass So he remounted and riding up to the new comer saluted him and asked him Whence comest thou Quoth he I come from the land of Kuza ah where we have had a two years dearth but this year it was a season of plenty and I sowed early cucumbers FN one hundred thirty seven They came up before their time so I gathered what seemed the best of them and set out to carry them to the Emir Ma an bin Zaidah because of his well known beneficence and notorious munificence Asked Ma an How much dost thou hope to get of him and the Badawi answered A thousand dinars Quoth the Emir What if he say this is too much Said the Badawi Then I will ask five hundred dinars And if he say too much Then three hundred And if he say yet too much Then two hundred And if he say yet too much Then one hundred And if he say yet too much Then fifty And if he say yet too much Then thirty And if he say still too much asked Ma an bin Zaidah Answered the Badawi I will make my ass set his four feet in his Honour s home FN one hundred thirty eight and return to my people disappointed and empty handed So Ma an laughed at him and urged his steed till he came up with his suite and returned to his place when he said to his chamberlain An there come to thee a man with cucumbers and riding on an ass admit him to me Presently up came the Badawi and was admitted to Ma an s presence but knew not the Emir for the man he had met in the desert by reason of the gravity and majesty of his semblance and the multitude of his eunuchs and attendants for he was seated on his chair of state with his officers ranged in lines before him and on either side So he saluted him and Ma an said to him What bringeth thee O brother of the Arabs Answered the Badawi I hoped in the Emir and have brought him curly cucumbers out of season Asked Ma an And how much dost thou expect of us A thousand dinars answered the Badawi This is far too much quoth Ma an Quoth he Five hundred Too much Then three hundred Too much Two hundred Too much One hundred Too much Fifty Too much At last the Badawi came down to thirty dinars but Ma an still replied Too much So the Badawi cried By Allah the man who met me in the desert brought me bad luck But I will not go lower than thirty dinars The Emir laughed and said nothing whereupon the wild Arab knew that it was he whom he had met and said O my lord except thou bring the thirty dinars see ye there is the ass tied ready at the door and here sits Ma an his honour at home So Ma an laughed till he fell on his back and calling his steward said to him Give him a thousand dinars and five hundred and three hundred and two hundred and one hundred and fifty and thirty and leave the ass tied up where he is So the Arab to his amazement received two thousand one hundred and eighty dinars and Allah have mercy on them both and on all generous men And I have also heard O auspicious King a tale of THE CITY OF LABTAYT FN one hundred thirty nine There was once a royal city in the land of Roum called the City of Labtayt wherein stood a tower which was always shut And whenever a King died and another King of the Greeks took the Kingship after him he set on the tower a new and strong lock till there were four and twenty locks upon the gate according to the number of the Kings After this time there came to the throne a man who was not of the old royal house and he had a mind to open these locks that he might see what was within the tower The grandees of his kingdom forbade him this and pressed him to desist and reproved him and blamed him but he persisted saying Needs must this place be opened Then they offered him all that their hands possessed of monies and treasures and things of price if he would but refrain still he would not be baulked And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Seventy second Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the grandees offered that King all their hands possessed of monies and treasures if he would but refrain still he would not be baulked and said There is no help for it but I open this tower So he pulled off the locks and entering found within the tower figures of Arabs on their horses and camels habited in turbands FN one hundred forty hanging down at the ends with swords in baldrick belts thrown over their shoulders and bearing long lances in their hands He found there also a scroll which he greedily took and read and these words were written therein Whenas this door is opened will conquer this country a raid of the Arabs after the likeness of the figures here depicted wherefore beware and again beware of opening it Now this city was in Andalusia and that very year Tarik ibn Ziyad conquered it during the Caliphate of Al Walid son of Abd al Malik FN one hundred forty one of the sons of Umayyah and slew this King after the sorriest fashion and sacked the city and made prisoners of the women and boys therein and got great loot Moreover he found there immense treasures amongst the rest more than an hundred and seventy crowns of pearls and jacinths and other gems of price and he found a saloon wherein horsemen might throw the spears full of vessels of gold and silver such as no description can comprise Moreover he found there the table of food for the Prophet of Allah Solomon son of David peace with both of them which is extant even now in a city of the Greeks it is told that it was of grass green emerald with vessels of gold and platters of jasper Likewise he found the Psalms written in the old Ionian FN one hundred forty two characters on leaves of gold bezel d with jewels together with a book setting forth the properties of stones and herbs and minerals as well as the use of characts and talismans and the canons of the art of alchymy and he found a third volume which treated of the art of cutting and setting rubies and other precious stones and of the preparation of poisons and theriacks There found he also a mappa mundi figuring the earth and the seas and the different cities and countries and villages of the world and he found a vast saloon full of hermetic powder one drachm of which elixir would turn a thousand drachms of silver into fine gold likewise a marvellous mirror great and round of mixed metals which had been made for Solomon son of David on the twain be peace wherein whoso looked might see the counterfeit presentment of the seven climates of the world and he beheld a chamber full of Brahmini FN one hundred forty three jacinths for which no words can suffice So he despatched all these things to Walid bin Abd al Malik and the Arabs spread all over the cities of Andalusia which is one of the finest of lands This is the end of the story of the City of Labtayt And a tale is also told of THE CALIPH HISHAM AND THE ARAB YOUTH The Caliph Hisham bin Abd al Malik bin Marwan was hunting one day when he sighted an antelope and pursued it with his dogs As he was following the quarry he saw an Arab youth pasturing sheep and said to him Ho boy up and after yonder antelope for it escapeth me The youth raised his head to him and replied O ignorant of what to the deserving is due thou lookest on me with disdain and speakest to me with contempt thy speaking is that of a tyrant true and thy doing what an ass would do Quoth Hisham Woe to thee dost thou not know me Rejoined the youth Verily thine unmannerliness hath made thee known to me in that thou spakest to me without beginning by the salutation FN one hundred forty four Repeated the Caliph Fie upon thee I am Hisham bin Abd al Malik May Allah not favour thy dwelling place replied the Arab nor guard thine abiding place How many are thy words and how few thy generous deeds Hardly had he ended speaking when up came the troop from all sides and surrounded him as the white encircleth the black of the eye all and each saying Peace be with thee O Commander of the Faithful Quoth Hisham Cut short this talk and seize me yonder boy So they laid hands on him and when he saw the multitude of Chamberlains and Wazirs and Lords of State he was in nowise concerned and questioned not of them but let his chin drop on his breast and looked where his feet fell till they brought him to the Caliph FN one hundred forty five when he stood before him with head bowed groundwards and saluted him not and spoke him not So one of the eunuchs said to him O dog of the Arabs what hindereth thy saluting the Commander of the Faithful The youth turned to him angrily and replied O packsaddle of an ass it was the length of the way that hindered me from this and the steepness of the steps and the profuseness of my sweat Then said Hisham and indeed he was exceeding wroth O boy verily thy days are come to their latest hour thy hope is gone from thee and thy life is past out of thee He answered By Allah O Hisham verily an my life term be prolonged and Fate ordain not its cutting short thy words irk me not be they long or short Then said the Chief Chamberlain to him Doth it befit thy degree O vilest of the Arabs to bandy words with the Commander of the Faithful He answered promptly Mayest thou meet with adversity and may woe and wailing never leave thee Hast thou not heard the saying of Almighty Allah One day every soul shall come to defend itself FN one hundred forty six Hereupon Hisham rose in great wrath and said O headsman bring me the head of this lad for indeed he exceedeth in talk such as passeth conception So the sworder took him and making him kneel on the carpet of blood drew his sword above him and said to the Caliph O Commander of the Faithful this thy slave is misguided and is on the way to his grave shall I smite off his head and be quit of his blood Yes replied Hisham He repeated his question and the Caliph again answered in the affirmative Then he asked leave a third time and the youth knowing that if the Caliph assented yet once more it would be the signal of his death laughed till his wisdom teeth showed whereupon Hisham s wrath redoubled and he said to him O boy meseems thou art mad seest thou not that thou art about to depart the world Why then dost thou laugh in mockery of thyself He replied O Commander of the Faithful if a larger life term befell me none can hurt me great or small but I have bethought me of some couplets which do thou hear for my death cannot escape thee Quoth Hisham Say on and be brief so the Arab repeated these couplets It happed one day a hawk pounced on a bird A wildling sparrow driven by destiny And held in pounces spake the sparrow thus E en as the hawk rose ready home to hie Scant flesh have I to fill the maw of thee And for thy lordly food poor morsel I Then smiled the hawk in flattered vanity And pride so set the sparrow free to fly At this Hisham smiled and said By the truth of my kinship to the Apostle of Allah whom Allah bless and keep had he spoken this speech at first and asked for aught except the Caliphase verily I would have given it to him Stuff his mouth with jewels FN one hundred forty seven O eunuch and entreat him courteously so they did as he bade them and the Arab went his way And amongst pleasant tales is that of IBRAHIM BIN AL MAHDI AND THE BARBER SURGEON They relate that Ibrahim son of al Mahdi FN one hundred forty eight brother of Harun al Rashid when the Caliphate devolved to Al Maamun the son of his brother Harun refused to acknowledge his nephew and betook himself to Rayy FN one hundred forty nine where he claimed the throne and abode thus a year and eleven months and twelve days Meanwhile his nephew Al Maamun awaited his return to allegiance and his accepting a dependent position till at last despairing of this he mounted with his horsemen and footmen and repaired to Rayy in quest of him Now when the news came to Ibrahim he found nothing for it but to flee to Baghdad and hide there fearing for his life and Maamun set a price of a hundred thousand gold pieces upon his head to be paid to whoso might betray him Quoth Ibrahim When I heard of this price I feared for my head And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Seventy third Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Ibrahim continued Now when I heard of this price I feared for my head and knew not what to do so I went forth of my house in disguise at mid day knowing not whither I should go Presently I entered a broad street which was no thoroughfare and said in my mind Verily we are Allah s and unto Him we are returning I have exposed my life to destruction If I retrace my steps I shall arouse suspicion Then being still in disguise I espied at the upper end of the street a negro slave standing at his door so I went up to him and said to him Hast thou a place where I may abide for an hour of the day Yes answered he and opening the door admitted me into a decent house furnished with carpets and mats and cushions of leather Then he shut the door on me and went away and I misdoubted me he had heard of the reward offered for me and said to myself He hath gone to inform against me But as I sat pondering my case and boiling like cauldron over fire behold my host came back accompanied by a porter loaded with bread and meat and new cooking pots and gear and a new jar and new gugglets and other needfuls He made the porter set them down and dismissing him said to me I offer my life for thy ransom I am a barber surgeon and I know it would disgust thee to eat with me because of the way in which I get my livelihood FN one hundred fifty so do thou shift for thyself and do what thou please with these things whereon no hand hath fallen Quoth Ibrahim Now I was in sore need of food so I cooked me a pot of meat whose like I remember not ever to have eaten and when I had satisfied my want he said to me O my lord Allah make me thy ransom Art thou for wine for indeed it gladdeneth the soul and doeth away care I have no dislike to it replied I being desirous of the barber s company so he brought me new flagons of glass which no hand had touched and a jar of excellent wine and said to me Strain for thyself to thy liking whereupon I cleared the wine and mixed me a most delectable draught Then he brought me a new cup and fruits and flowers in new vessels of earthenware after which he said to me Wilt thou give me leave to sit apart and drink of my own wine by myself of my joy in thee and for thee Do so answered I So I drank and he drank till the wine began to take effect upon us when the barber rose and going to a closet took out a lute of polished wood and said to me O my lord it is not for the like of me to ask the like of thee to sing but it behoveth thine exceeding generosity to render my respect its due so if thou see fit to honour thy slave thine is the high decision Quoth I and indeed I thought not that he knew me How knowest thou that I excel in song He replied Glory be to Allah our lord is too well renowned for that Thou art my lord Ibrahim son of Al Mahdi our Caliph of yesterday he on whose head Al Maamun hath set a price of an hundred thousand dinars to be paid to thy betrayer but thou art in safety with me Quoth Ibrahim When I heard him say this he was magnified in my eyes and his loyalty and noble nature were certified to me so I complied with his wish and took the lute and tuned it and sang Then I bethought me of my severance from my children and my family and I began to say Belike Who Yusuf to his kin restored And honoured him in goal a captive wight May grant our prayer to reunite our lots For Allah Lord of Worlds hath all of might When the barber heard this exceeding joy took possession of him and he was of great good cheer for it is said that when Ibrahim s neighbours heard him only sing out Ho boy saddle the mule they were filled with delight Then being overborne by mirth he said to me O my lord wilt thou give me leave to say what is come to my mind albeit I am not of the folk of this craft I answered Do so this is of thy great courtesy and kindness So he took the lute and sang these verses To our beloveds we moaned our length of night Quoth they How short the nights that us benight Tis for that sleep like hood enveils their eyes Right soon but from our eyes is fair of flight When night falls dread and drear to those who love We mourn they joy to see departing light Had they but dree d the weird the bitter dole We dree their beds like ours had bred them blight Quoth Ibrahim So I said to him By Allah thou hast shown me a kindness O my friend and hast done away from me the pangs of sorrow Let me hear more trifles of thy fashion So he sang these couplets When man keeps honour bright without a stain Pair sits whatever robe to robe he s fain She jeered at me because so few we are Quoth I There s ever dearth of noble men Naught irks us we are few while neighbour tribes Count many neighbours oft are base born strain We are a clan which holds not Death reproach Which A mir and Samul FN one hundred fifty one hold illest bane Leads us our love of death to fated end They hate that ending and delay would gain We to our neighbours speech aye give the lie But when we speak none dare give lie again Quoth Ibrahim When I heard these lines I was filled with huge delight and marvelled with exceeding marvel Then I slept and awoke not till past night fall when I washed my face with a mind full of the high worth of this barber surgeon and his passing courtesy after which I wakened him and taking out a purse I had by me containing a number of gold pieces threw it to him saying I commend thee to Allah for I am about to go forth from thee and pray thee to expend what is in this purse on thine requirements and thou shalt have an abounding reward of me when I am quit of my fear Quoth Ibrahim But he resumed the bag to me saying O my lord paupers like myself are of no value in thine eyes but how with due respect to my own generosity can I take a price for the boon which fortune hath vouchsafed me of thy favour and thy visit to my poor abode Nay if thou repeat thy words and throw the purse to me again I will slay myself So I put in my sleeve FN one hundred fifty two the purse whose weight was irksome to me And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Seventy fourth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Ibrahim son of Al Mahdi continued So I put in my sleeve the purse whose weight was irksome to me and turned to depart but when I came to the house door he said O my lord of a truth this is a safer hiding place for thee than any other and thy keep is no burden to me so do thou abide with me till Allah be pleased grant thee relief Accordingly I turned back saying On condition that thou spend of the money in this purse He made me think that he consented to this arrangement and I abode with him some days in the utmost comfort but perceiving that he spent none of the contents of the purse I revolted at the idea of abiding at his charge and thought it shame to be a burthen on him so I left the house disguised in women s apparel donning short yellow walking boots FN one hundred fifty three and veil Now as soon as I found myself in the street I was seized with excessive fear and going to pass the bridge behold I came to a place sprinkled with water FN one hundred fifty four where a trooper who been in my service looked at me and knowing me cried out saying This is he whom Al Maamun wanteth Then he laid hold of me but the love of sweet life lent me strength and I gave him and his horse a push which threw them down in that slippery place so that he became an example to those who will take example and the folk hastened to him Meanwhile I hurried my pace over the bridge and entered a main street where I saw the door of a house open and a woman standing upon the threshold So I said to her O my lady have pity on me and save my life for I am a man in fear Quoth she Enter and welcome and carried me into an upper dining room where she spread me a bed and brought me food saying Calm thy fear for not a soul shall know of thee As she spoke lo there came a loud knocking at the door so she went and opened and suddenly my friend whom I had thrown down on the bridge appeared with his head bound up the blood running down upon his clothes and without his horse She asked O so and so what accident hath befallen thee and he answered I made prize of the young man whom the Caliph seeketh and he escaped from me whereupon he told her the whole story So she brought out tinder FN one hundred fifty five and putting it into a piece of rag bandaged his head after which she spread him a bed and he lay sick Then she came up to me and said Methinks thou art the man in question Even so answered I and she said Fear not no harm shall befall thee and redoubled in kindness to me So I tarried with her three days at the end of which time she said to me I am in fear for thee lest yonder man happen upon thee and betray thee to what thou dreadest so save thyself by flight I besought her to let me stay till nightfall and she said There is no harm in that So when the night came I put on my woman s gear and betook me to the house of a freed woman who had once been our slave When she saw me she wept and made a show of affliction and praised Almighty Allah for my safety Then she went forth as if she would go to market intent on hospitable thoughts and I fancied all was right but ere long suddenly I espied Ibrahim al Mosili FN one hundred fifty six for the house amongst his troopers and servants and led by a woman on foot and looking narrowly at her behold she was the freed woman the mistress of the house wherein I had taken refuge So she delivered me into their hands and I saw death face to face They carried me in my woman s attire to Al Maamun who called a general council and had me brought before him When I entered I saluted him by the title of Caliph saying Peace be on thee O Commander of the Faithful and he replied Allah give thee neither peace nor long life I rejoined According to thy good pleasure O Commander of the Faithful it is for the claimant of blood revenge FN one hundred fifty seven to decree punishment or pardon but mercy is nigher to piety and Allah hath set thy pardon above all other pardon even as He made my sin to excel all other sin So if thou punish it is of thine equity and if thou pardon it is of thy bounty And I repeated these couplets My sin to thee is great But greater thy degree So take revenge or else Remit in clemency An I in deeds have not Been generous generous be Quoth Ibrahim At this Al Maamun raised his head to me and I hastened to add these two couplets I ve sinned enormous sin But pardon in thee lies If pardon thou tis grace Justice an thou chastise Then Al Maamun bowed his head and repeated I am when friend would raise a rage that mote Make spittle choke me sticking in my throat His pardoner and pardon his offense Fearing lest I should live a friend without Quoth Ibrahim Now when I heard these words I scented mercy knowing his disposition to clemency FN one hundred fifty eight Then he turned to his son Al Abbas and his brother Abu Ishak and all his chief officers there present and said to them What deem ye of his case They all counselled him to do me dead but they differed as to the manner of my death Then said he to his Wazir Ahmad bin al Khalid And what sayest thou O Ahmad He answered O Commander of the Faithful an thou slay him we find the like of thee who hath slain the like of him but an thou pardon him we find not the like of thee that hath pardoned the like of him And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Seventy fifth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Al Maamun Prince of the Faithful heard the words of Ahmad bin al Khalid he bowed his head and began repeating My tribe have slain that brother mine Umaym Yet would shoot back what shafts at them I aim If I deal pardon noble pardon tis And if I shoot my bones twill only maim FN one hundred fifty nine And he also recited Be mild to brother mingling What is wrong with what is right Kindness to him continue Whether good or graceless wight Abstain from all reproaching An he joy or vex thy sprite Seest not that what thou lovest And what hatest go unite That joys of longer life tide Ever fade with hair turned white That thorns on branches growing For the plucks fruit catch thy sight Who never hath done evil Doing good for sole delight When tried the sons of worldli ness they mostly work upright Quoth Ibrahim Now when I heard these couplets I withdrew my woman s veil from my head and cried out with my loudest voice Allah is Most Great By Allah the Commander of the Faithful pardoneth me Quoth he No harm shall come to thee O uncle and I rejoined O Commander of the Faithful my sin is too sore for me to excuse it and thy mercy is too much for me to speak thanks for it And I chanted these couplets to a lively motive Who made all graces all collected He In Adam s loins our Seventh Imam for thee FN one hundred sixty Thou hast the hearts of men with reverence filled Enguarding all with heart humility Rebelled I never by delusion whelmed For object other than thy clemency FN one hundred sixty one And thou hast pardoned me whose like was ne er Pardoned before though no man pled my plea Hast pitied little ones like Kata s FN one hundred sixty two young And mother s yearning heart a son to see Quoth Maamun I say following our lord Joseph on whom and on our Prophet be blessing and peace let there be no reproach cast on you this day Allah forgiveth you for He is the most merciful of those who show mercy FN one hundred sixty three Indeed I pardon thee and restore to thee thy goods and lands O uncle and no harm shall befall thee So I offered up devout prayers for him and repeated these couplets Thou hast restored my wealth sans greed and ere So didst thou deignedest my blood to spare Then if I shed my blood and wealth to gain Thy grace till even shoon from foot I tear Twere but repaying what thou lentest me And what unloaned no man to blame would care Were I ungrateful for thy lavish boons Baser than thou rt beneficent I were Then Al Maamun showed me honour and favour and said to me O uncle Abu Ishak and Al Abbas counselled me to put thee to death So I answered And they both counselled thee right O Commander of the Faithful but thou hast done after thine own nature and hast put away what I feared with what I hoped Rejoined Al Maamun O uncle thou didst extinguish my rancour with the modesty of thine excuse and I have pardoned thee without making thee drink the bitterness of obligation to intercessors Then he prostrated himself in prayer a long while after which he raised his head and said to me O uncle knowest thou why I prostrated myself Answered I Haply thou didst this in thanksgiving to Allah for that He hath given thee the mastery over thine enemy He replied Such was not my design but rather to thank Allah for having inspired me to pardon thee and for having cleared my mind towards thee Now tell me thy tale So I told him all that had befallen me with the barber the trooper and his wife and with my freed woman who had betrayed me So he summoned the freed woman who was in her house expecting the reward to be sent to her and when she came before him he said to her What moved thee to deal thus with thy lord Quoth she Lust of money Asked the Caliph Hast thou a child or a husband and she answered No whereupon he bade them give her an hundred stripes with a whip and imprisoned her for life Then he sent for the trooper and his wife and the barber surgeon and asked the soldier what had moved him to do thus Lust of money quoth he whereupon quoth the Caliph It befitteth thee to be a barber cupper FN one hundred sixty four and committed him to one whom he charged to place him in a barber cupper s shop where he might learn the craft But he showed honour to the trooper s wife and lodged her in his palace saying This is a woman of sound sense and fit for matters of moment Then said he to the barber cupper Verily thou hast shown worth and generosity which call for extraordinary honour So he commanded the trooper s house and all that was therein to be given him and bestowed on him a dress of honour and in addition fifteen thousand dinars to be paid annually And men tell the following tale concerning THE CITY OF MANY COLUMNED IRAM AND ABDULLAH SON OF ABI KILABAH FN one hundred sixty five It is related that Abdullah bin Abi Kilabah went forth in quest of a she camel which had strayed from him and as he was wandering in the deserts of Al Yaman and the district of Saba FN one hundred sixty six behold he came upon a great city girt by a vast castle around which were palaces and pavilions that rose high into middle air He made for the place thinking to find there folk of whom he might ask concerning his she camel but when he reached it he found it desolate without a living soul in it So quoth he I alighted and hobbling my dromedary And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Seventy sixth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Abdullah bin Abi Kilabah continued I dismounted and hobbling my dromedary and composing my mind entered into the city Now when I came to the castle I found it had two vast gates never in the world was seen their like for size height inlaid with all manner of jewels and jacinths white and red yellow and green Beholding this I marvelled with great marvel and thought the case mighty wondrous then entering the citadel in a flutter of fear and dazed with surprise and affright I found it long and wide about equalling Al Medinah FN one hundred sixty seven in point of size and therein were lofty palaces laid out in pavilions all built of gold and silver and inlaid with many coloured jewels and jacinths and chrysolites and pearls And the door leaves in the pavilions were like those of the castle for beauty and their floors were strewn with great pearls and balls no smaller than hazel nuts of musk and ambergris and saffron Now when I came within the heart of the city and saw therein no created beings of the Sons of Adam I was near swooning and dying for fear Moreover I looked down from the great roofs of the pavilion chambers and their balconies and saw rivers running under them and in the main streets were fruit laden trees and tall palms and the manner of their building was one brick of gold and one of silver So I said in myself Doubtless this is the Paradise promised for the world to come Then I loaded me with the jewels of its gravel and the musk of its dust as much as I could carry and returned to my own country where I told the folk what I had seen After a time the news reached Mu awiyah son of Abu Sufyan who was then Caliph in Al Hijaz so he wrote to his lieutenant in San a of Al Yaman to send for the teller of the story and question him of the truth of the case Accordingly the lieutenant summoned me and questioned me of my adventure and of all appertaining to it and I told him what I had seen whereupon he despatched me to Mu awiyah before whom I repeated the story of the strange sights but he would not credit it So I brought out to him some of the pearls and balls of musk and ambergris and saffron in which latter there was still some sweet savour but the pearls were grown yellow and had lost pearly colour And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Seventy seventh Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Abdullah son of Abu Kilabah continued But the pearls were grown yellow and had lost pearly colour Now Mu awiyah wondered at this and sending for Ka ab al Ahbar FN one hundred sixty eight said to him O Ka ab I have sent for thee to ascertain the truth of a certain matter and hope that thou wilt be able to certify me thereof Asked Ka ab What is it O Commander of the Faithful and Mu awiyah answered Wottest thou of any city founded by man which is builded of gold and silver the pillars whereof are of chrysolite and rubies and its gravel pearls and balls of musk and ambergris and saffron He replied Yes O Commander of the Faithful this is Iram with pillars decked and dight the like of which was never made in the lands FN one hundred sixty nine and the builder was Shaddad son of Ad the Greater Quoth the Caliph Tell us something of its history and Ka ab said Ad the Greater FN one hundred seventy had two sons Shadid and Shaddad who when their father died ruled conjointly in his stead and there was no King of the Kings of the earth but was subject to them After awhile Shadid died and his brother Shaddad reigned over the earth alone Now he was fond of reading in antique books and happening upon the description of the world to come and of Paradise with its pavilions and galleries and trees and fruits and so forth his soul moved him to build the like thereof in this world after the fashion aforesaid Now under his hand were an hundred thousand Kings each ruling over an hundred thousand chiefs commanding each an hundred thousand warriors so he called these all before him and said to them I find in ancient books and annals a description of Paradise as it is to be in the next world and I desire to build me its like in this world Go ye forth therefore to the goodliest tract on earth and the most spacious and build me there a city of gold and silver whose gravel shall be chrysolite and rubies and pearls and for support of its vaults make pillars of jasper Fill it with palaces whereon ye shall set galleries and balconies and plant its lanes and thoroughfares with all manner trees bearing yellow ripe fruits and make rivers to run through it in channels of gold and silver Whereat said one and all How are we able to do this thing thou hast commanded and whence shall we get the chrysolites and rubies and pearls whereof thou speakest Quoth he What weet ye not that the Kings of the world are subject to me and under my hand and that none therein dare gainsay my word Answered they Yes we know that And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Seventy eighth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the lieges answered Yes we know that whereupon the King rejoined Fare ye then to the mines of chrysolites and rubies and pearls and gold and silver and collect their produce and gather together all of value that is in the world and spare no pains and leave naught and take also for me such of these things as be in men s hands and let nothing escape you be diligent and beware of disobedience And thereupon he wrote letters to all the Kings of the world and bade them gather together whatso of these things was in their subjects hands and get them to the mines of precious stones and metals and bring forth all that was therein even from the abysses of the seas This they accomplished in the space of twenty years for the number of rulers then reigning over the earth was three hundred and sixty Kings and Shaddad presently assembled from all lands and countries architects and engineers and men of art and labourers and handicraftsmen who dispersed over the world and explored all the wastes and words and tracts and holds At last they came to an uninhabited spot a vast and fair open plain clear of sand hills and mountains with founts flushing and rivers rushing and they said This is the manner of place the King commanded us to seek and ordered us to find So they busied themselves in building the city even as bade them Shaddad King of the whole earth in its length and breadth leading the fountains in channels and laying the foundations after the prescribed fashion Moreover all the Kings of earth s several reigns sent thither jewels and precious stones and pearls large and small and carnelian and refined gold and virgin silver upon camels by land and in great ships over the waters and there came to the builders hands of all these materials so great a quantity as may neither be told nor counted nor conceived So they laboured at the work three hundred years and when they had brought it to end they went to King Shaddad and acquainted him therewith Then said he Depart and make thereon an impregnable castle rising and towering high in air and build around it a thousand pavilions each upon a thousand columns of chrysolite and ruby and vaulted with gold that in each pavilion a Wazir may dwell So they returned forthwith and did this in other twenty years after which they again presented themselves before King Shaddad and informed him of the accomplishment of his will Then he commanded his Wazirs who were a thousand in number and his Chief Officers and such of his troops and others as he put trust in to prepare for departure and removal to Many columned Iram in the suite and at the stirrup of Shaddad son of Ad King of the World and he bade also such as he would of his women and his Harim and of his handmaids and eunuchs make them ready for the journey They spent twenty years in preparing for departure at the end of which time Shaddad set out with his host And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Seventy ninth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Shaddad bin Ad fared forth he and his host rejoicing in the attainment of his desire till there remained but one day s journey between him and Iram of the Pillars Then Allah sent down on him and on the stubborn unbelievers with him a mighty rushing sound from the Heavens of His power which destroyed them all with its vehement clamour and neither Shaddad nor any of his company set eyes on the city FN one hundred seventy one Moreover Allah blotted out the road which led to the city and it stands in its stead unchanged until the Resurrection Day and the Hour of Judgement So Mu awiyah wondered greatly at Ka ab al Ahbar s story and said to him Hath any mortal ever made his way to that city He replied Yes one of the companions of Mohammed on whom be blessing and peace reached it doubtless and forsure after the same fashion as this man here seated And quoth Al Sha abi FN one hundred seventy two it is related on the authority of learned men of Himyar in Al Yaman that Shaddad when destroyed with all his host by the sound was succeeded in his Kingship by his son Shaddad the Less whom he left vice regent in Hazramaut FN one hundred seventy three and Saba when he and his marched upon Many columned Iram Now as soon as he heard of his father s death on the road he caused his body to be brought back from the desert to Hazramaut and bade them hew him out a tomb in a cave where he laid the body on a throne of gold and threw over the corpse threescore and ten robes of cloth of gold purfled with precious stones Lastly at his sire s head he set up a tablet of gold whereon were graven these verses Take warning O proud And in length o life vain I m Shaddad son of Ad Of the forts castellain Lord of pillars and power Lord of tried might and main Whom all earth sons obeyed For my mischief and bane And who held East and West In mine awfullest reign He preached me salvation Whom God did assain FN one hundred seventy four But we crossed him and asked Can no refuge be ta en When a Cry on us cried From th horizon plain And we fell on the field Like the harvested grain And the Fixt Day await We in earth s bosom lain Al Sa alibi also relateth It chanced that two men once entered this cave and found steps at its upper end so they descended and came to an underground chamber an hundred cubits long by forty wide and an hundred high In the midst stood a throne of gold whereon lay a man of huge bulk filling the whole length and breadth of the throne He was covered with jewels and raiment gold and silver wrought and at his head was a tablet of gold bearing an inscription So they took the tablet and carried it off together with as many bars of gold and silver and so forth as they could bear away And

none	none	 ISAAC OF MOSUL Quoth Isaac of Mosul FN one hundred seventy five I went out one night from Al Maamun s presence on my way to my house and being taken with a pressing need to make water I turned aside into a by street and stood in the middle fearing lest something might hurt me if I squatted against a wall FN one hundred seventy six Presently I espied something hanging down from one of the houses so I felt it to find out what it might be and found that it was a great four handled basket FN one hundred seventy seven covered with brocade Said I to myself There must be some reason for this and knew not what to think then drunkenness led me to seat myself in the basket and behold the people of the house pulled me up thinking me to be the person they expected Now when I came to the top of the wall lo four damsels were there who said to me Descend and welcome and joy to thee Then one of them went before me with a wax candle and brought me down into a mansion wherein were furnished sitting chambers whose like I had never seen save in the palace of the Caliphate So I sat down and after a while the curtains were suddenly drawn from one side of the room and behold in came damsels walking in procession and hending hand lighted flambeaux of wax and censers full of Sumatran aloes wood and amongst them a young lady as she were the rising full moon So I stood up to her and she said Welcome to thee for a visitor and then she made me sit down again and asked me how I came thither Quoth I I was returning home from the house of an intimate friend and went astray in the dark then being taken in the street with an urgent call to make water I turned aside into this lane where I found a basket let down The strong wine which I had drunk led me to seat myself in it and it was drawn up with me into this house and this is my story She rejoined No harm shall befall thee and I hope thou wilt have cause to praise the issue of thine adventure Then she added But what is thy condition I said A merchant in the Baghdad bazar and she Canst thou repeat any verses Some small matter quoth I Quoth she Then call a few to mind and let us hear some of them But I said A visitor is bashful and timid do thou begin True replied she and recited some verses of the poets past and present choosing their choicest pieces and I listened not knowing whether more to marvel at her beauty and loveliness or at the charm of her style of declamation Then said she Is that bashfulness of thine gone and I said Yes by Allah so she rejoined Then if thou wilt recite us somewhat So I repeated to her a number of poems by old writers and she applauded saying By Allah I did not think to find such culture among the trade folk the sons of the bazar Then she called for food Whereupon quoth Shahrazad s sister Dunyazad How pleasant is this tale and enjoyable and sweet to the ear and sound to the sense But she answered And what is this story compared with that which thou shalt hear on the morrow s night if I be alive and the King deign spare me Then Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Eightieth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Isaac of Mosul continued Then the damsel called for food and when it was served to her she fell to eating it and setting it before me and the sitting room was full of all manner sweet scented flowers and rare fruits such as are never found save in Kings houses Presently she called for wine and drank a cup after which she filled another and gave it to me saying Now is the time for converse and story telling So I bethought myself and began to say It hath reached me that such and such things happened and there was a man who said so and so till I had told her a number of pleasing tales and adventures with which she was delighted and cried Tis marvellous that a merchant should bear in memory such store of stories like these for they are fit for Kings Quoth I I had a neighbour who used to consort with Kings and carouse with them so when he was at leisure I visited his house and he hath often told me what thou hast heard Thereupon she exclaimed By my life but thou hast a good memory So we continued to converse thus and as often as I was silent she would begin till in this way we passed the most part of the night whilst the burning aloes wood diffused its fragrance and I was in such case that if Al Maamun had suspected it he would have flown like a bird with longing for it Then said she to me Verily thou art one of the most pleasant of men polished passing well bred and polite but there lacketh one thing What is that asked I and she answered If thou only knew how to sing verses to the lute I answered I was passionately fond of this art aforetime but finding I had no taste for it I abandoned it though at times my heart yearneth after it Indeed I should love to sing somewhat well at this moment and fulfil my night s enjoyment Then said she Meseemeth thou hintest a wish for the lute to be brought and I It is thine to decide if thou wilt so far favour me and to thee be the thanks So she called for a lute and sang a song in a voice whose like I never heard both for sweetness of tone and skill in playing and perfection of art Then said she Knowest thou who composed this air and whose are the words of this song No answered I and she said The words are so and so s and the air is Isaac s I asked And hath Isaac then may I be thy sacrifice such a talent She replied Bravo FN one hundred seventy eight Bravo Isaac indeed he excelleth in this art I rejoined Glory be to Allah who hath given this man what he hath vouchsafed unto none other Then she said And how would it be an thou heard this song from himself This wise we went on till break of day dawn when there came to her an old woman as she were her nurse and said to her Verily the time is come So she rose in haste and said to me Keep what hath passed between us to thyself for such meetings are in confidence And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Eighty first Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the damsel whispered Keep what hath passed between us to thyself for such meetings are in confidence and I replied May I be thy ransom I needed no charge to this Then I took leave of her and she sent a handmaid to show me the way and open the house door so I went forth and returned to my own place where I prayed the morning prayer and slept Now after a time there came to me a messenger from Al Maamun so I went to him and passed the day in his company And when the night fell I called to mind my yesternight s pleasure a thing from which none but an ignoramus would abstain and betook myself to the street where I found the basket and seating myself therein was drawn up to the place in which I had passed the previous night When the lady saw me she said Indeed thou hast been assiduous and I answered Meseemeth rather that I am neglectful Then we fell to discoursing and passed the night as before in general conversation and reciting verses and telling rare tales each in turn till daybreak when I wended me home and I prayed the dawn prayer and slept Presently there came to me a messenger from Al Maamun so I went to him and spent my day with him till nightfall when the Commander of the Faithful said to me I conjure thee to sit here whilst I go out for a want and come back As soon as the Caliph was gone and quite gone my thoughts began to tempt and try me and calling to mind my late delight I recked little what might befal me from the Prince of True Believers So I sprang up and turning my back upon the sitting room ran to the street aforesaid where I sat down in the basket and was drawn up as before When the lady saw me she said I begin to think thou art a sincere friend to us Quoth I Yea by Allah and quoth she Hast thou made our house thine abiding place I replied May I be thy ransom A guest claimeth guest right for three days and if I return after this ye are free to spill my blood Then we passed the night as before and when the time of departure drew near I bethought me that Al Maamun would assuredly question me nor would ever be content save with a full explanation so I said to her I see thee to be of those who delight in singing Now I have a cousin the son of my father s brother who is fairer than I in face and higher of rank and better of breeding and he is the most intimate of Allah s creatures with Isaac Quoth she Art thou a parasite FN one hundred seventy nine and an importunate one Quoth I It is for thee to decide in this matter and she If thy cousin be as thou hast described him it would not mislike us to make acquaintance with him Then as the time was come I left her and returned to my house but hardly had I reached it ere the Caliph s runners came down on me and carried me before him by main force and roughly enough And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Eighty second Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Isaac of Mosul continued And hardly had I reached my house ere the Caliph s runners came down upon me and carried me before him by main force and roughly enough I found him seated on a chair wroth with me and he said to me O Isaac art thou a traitor to thine allegiance replied I No by Allah O Commander of the Faithful and he rejoined What hast thou then to say tell me the whole truth and I Yes I will but in private So he signed to his attendants who withdrew to a distance and I told him the case adding I promised her to bring thee and he said Thou didst well Then we spent the day in our usual pleasures but Al Maamun s heart was taken up with her and hardly was the appointed time come when we set out As we went along I cautioned him saying Look that thou call me not by my name before her and I will demean myself like thine attendant And having agreed upon this we fared forth till we came to the place where we found two baskets hanging ready So we sat down in them and were drawn up to the usual place where the damsel came forward and saluted us Now when Al Maamun saw her he was amazed at her beauty and loveliness and she began to entertain him with stories and verses Presently she called for wine and we fell to drinking she paying him special attention and he repaying her in kind Then she took the lute and sang these verses My lover came in at the close of night I rose till he sat and remained upright And said Sweet heart hast thou come this hour Nor feared on the watch and ward to light Quoth he The lover had cause to fear But Love deprived him of wits and fright And when she ended her song she said to me And is thy cousin also a merchant I answered Yes and she said Indeed ye resemble each other nearly But when Al Maamun had drunk three pints FN one hundred eighty he grew merry with wine and called out saying Ho Isaac And I replied Labbayk Adsum O Commander of the Faithful whereupon quoth he Sing me this air Now when the young lady learned that he was the Caliph she withdrew to another place and disappeared and as I had made an end of my song Al Maamun said to me See who is the master of this house whereupon an old woman hastened to make answer saying It belongs to Hasan bin Sahl FN one hundred eighty one Fetch him to me said the Caliph So she went away and after a while behold in came Hasan to whom said Al Maamun Hast thou a daughter He said Yes and her name is Khadijah Asked the Caliph Is she married Answered Hasan No by Allah Said Al Maamun Then I ask her of thee in marriage Replied her father O Commander of the Faithful she is thy handmaid and at thy commandment Quoth Al Maamun I take her to wife at a present settlement of thirty thousand dinars which thou shalt receive this very morning and when the money has been paid thee do thou bring her to us this night And Hasan answered I hear and I obey Thereupon we went forth and the Caliph said to me O Isaac tell this story to no one So I kept it secret till Al Maamun s death Surely never did man s life gather such pleasures as were mine these four days time whenas I companied with Al Maamun by day and Khadijah by night and by Allah never saw I among men the like of Al Maamun nor among women have I ever set eyes on the like of Khadijah no nor on any that came near her in lively wit and pleasant speech And Allah is All knowing But amongst stories is that of THE SWEEP AND THE NOBLE LADY During the season of the Meccan pilgrimage whilst the people were making circuit about the Holy House and the place of compassing was crowded behold a man laid hold of the covering of the Ka abah FN one hundred eighty two and cried out from the bottom of his heart saying I beseech thee O Allah that she may once again be wroth with her husband and that I may know her A company of the pilgrims heard him and seized him and carried him to the Emir of the pilgrims after a sufficiency of blows and said they O Emir we found this fellow in the Holy Places saying thus and thus So the Emir commanded to hang him but he cried O Emir I conjure thee by the virtue of the Apostle whom Allah bless and preserve hear my story and then do with me as thou wilt Quoth the Emir Tell thy tale forthright Know then O Emir quoth the man that I am a sweep who works in the sheep slaughterhouses and carries off the blood and the offal to the rubbish heaps outside the gates And it came to pass as I went along one day with my ass loaded I saw the people running away and one of them said to me Enter this alley lest haply they slay thee Quoth I What aileth the folk running away and one of the eunuchs who were passing said to me This is the Harim FN one hundred eighty three of one of the notables and her eunuchs drive the people out of her way and beat them all without respect to persons So I turned aside with the donkey And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Eighty third Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that quoth the man So I turned aside with the donkey and stood still awaiting the dispersal of the crowd and I saw a number of eunuchs with staves in their hands followed by nigh thirty women slaves and amongst them a lady as she were a willow wand or a thirsty gazelle perfect in beauty and grace and amorous languor and all were attending upon her Now when she came to the mouth of the passage where I stood she turned right and left and calling one of the Castratos whispered in his ear and behold he came up to me and laid hold of me whilst another eunuch took my ass and made off with it And when the spectators fled the first eunuch bound me with a rope and dragged me after him till I knew not what to do and the people followed us and cried out saying This is not allowed of Allah What hath this poor scavenger done that he should be bound with ropes and praying the eunuchs Have pity on him and let him go so Allah have pity on you And I the while said in my mind Doubtless the eunuchry seized me because their mistress smelt the stink of the offal and it sickened her Belike she is with child or ailing but there is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great So I continued walking on behind them till they stopped at the door of a great house and entering before me brought me into a big hall I know not how I shall describe its magnificence furnished with the finest furniture And the women also entered the hall and I bound and held by the eunuch and saying to myself Doubtless they will torture me here till I die and none know of my death However after a while they carried me into a neat bath room leading out of the hall and as I sat there behold in came three slave girls who seated themselves round me and said to me Strip off thy rags and tatters So I pulled off my threadbare clothes and one of them fell a rubbing my legs and feet whilst another scrubbed my head and a third shampooed my body When they had made an end of washing me they brought me a parcel of clothes and said to me Put these on and I answered By Allah I know not how So they came up to me and dressed me laughing together at me the while after which they brought casting bottles full of rose water and sprinkled me therewith Then I went out with them into another saloon by Allah I know not how to praise its splendour for the wealth of paintings and furniture therein and entering it I saw a person seated on a couch of Indian rattan And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Eighty fourth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the sweep continued When I entered that saloon I saw a person seated on a couch of Indian rattan with ivory feet and before her a number of damsels When she saw me she rose to me and called me so I went up to her and she seated me by her side Then she bade her slave girls bring food and they brought all manner of rich meats such as I never saw in all my life I do not even know the names of the dishes much less their nature So I ate my fill and when the dishes had been taken away and we had washed our hands she called for fruits which came without stay or delay and ordered me eat of them and when we had ended eating she bade one of the waiting women bring the wine furniture So they set on flagons of divers kinds of wine and burned perfumes in all the censers what while a damsel like the moon rose and served us with wine to the sound of the smitten strings and I drank and the lady drank till we were seized with wine and the whole time I doubted not but that all this was an illusion of sleep Presently she signed to one of the damsels to spread us a bed in such a place which being done she rose and took me by the hand and led me thither and lay down and I lay with her till the morning and as often as I pressed her to my breast I smelt the delicious fragrance of musk and other perfumes that exhaled from her and could not think otherwise but that I was in Paradise or in the vain phantasies of a dream Now when it was day she asked me where I lodged and I told her In such a place whereupon she gave me leave to depart handing to me a kerchief worked with gold and silver and containing somewhat tied in it and took leave of me saying Go to the bath with this I rejoiced and said to myself If there be but five coppers here it will buy me this day my morning meal Then I left her as though I were leaving Paradise and returned to my poor crib where I opened the kerchief and found in it fifty miskals of gold So I buried them in the ground and buying two farthings worth of bread and kitchen FN one hundred eighty four seated me at the door and broke my fast after which I sat pondering my case and continued so doing till the time of afternoon prayer when lo a slave girl accosted me saying My mistress calleth for thee I followed her to the house aforesaid and after asking permission she carried me into the lady before whom I kissed the ground and she commanded me to sit and called for meat and wine as on the previous day after which I again lay with her all night On the morrow she gave me a second kerchief with other fifty dinars therein and I took it and going home buried this also In such pleasant condition I continued eight days running going in to her at the hour of afternoon prayer and leaving her at daybreak but on the eighth night as I lay with her behold one of her slave girls came running in and said to me Arise go up into yonder closet So I rose and went into the closet which was over the gate and presently I heard a great clamour and tramp of horse and looking out of the window which gave on the street in front of the house I saw a young man as he were the rising moon on the night of fulness come riding up attended by a number of servants and soldiers who were about him on foot He alighted at the door and entering the saloon found the lady seated on the couch so he kissed the ground between her hands then came up to her and kissed her hands but she would not speak to him However he continued patiently to humble himself and soothe her and speak her fair till he made his peace with her and they lay together that night And Shahrazed perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Eighty fifth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the scavenger continued Now when her husband had made his peace with the young lady he lay with her that night and next morning the soldiers came for him and he mounted and rode away whereupon she drew near to me and said Sawst thou yonder man I answered Yes and she said He is my husband and I will tell thee what befell me with him It came to pass one day that we were sitting he and I in the garden within the house and behold he rose from my side and was absent a long while till I grew tired of waiting and said to myself Most like he is in the privy So I arose and went to the water closet but not finding him there went down to the kitchen where I saw a slave girl and when I enquired for him she showed him to me lying with one of the cookmaids Hereupon I swore a great oath that I assuredly would do adultery with the foulest and filthiest man in Baghdad and the day the eunuch laid hands on thee I had been four days going round about the city in quest of one who should answer to this description but found none fouler nor filthier than thy good self So I took thee and there passed between us that which Allah fore ordained to us and now I am quit of my oath Then she added If however my husband return yet again to the cookmaid and lie with her I will restore thee to thy lost place in my favours Now when I heard these words from her lips what while she pierced my heart with the shafts of her glances my tears streamed forth till my eyelids were chafed sore with weeping and I repeated the saying of the poet Grant me the kiss of that left hand ten times And learn it hath than right hand higher grade FN one hundred eighty five For tis but little since that same left hand Washed off Sir Reverence when ablution made Then she made them give me other fifty dinars making in all four hundred gold pieces I had of her and bade me depart So I went out from her and came hither that I might pray Allah extolled and exalted be He to make her husband return to the cookmaid that haply I might be again admitted to her favours When the Emir of the pilgrims heard the man s story he set him free and said to the bystanders Allah upon you pray for him for indeed he is excusable And men also tell the tale of THE MOCK CALIPH It is related that the Caliph Harun al Rashid was one night restless with extreme restlessness so he summoned his Wazir Ja afar the Barmecide and said to him My breast is straitened and I have a desire to divert myself to night by walking about the streets of Baghdad and looking into folks affairs but with this precaution that we disguise ourselves in merchants gear so none shall know us He answered Hearkening and obedience They rose at once and doffing the rich raiment they wore donned merchants habits and sallied forth three in number the Caliph Ja afar and Masrur the sworder Then they walked from place to place till they came to the Tigris and saw an old man sitting in a boat so they went up to him and saluting him said O Shaykh we desire thee of thy kindness and favour to carry us a pleasuring down the river in this thy boat and take this dinar to thy hire And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Eighty sixth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when they said to the old man We desire thee to carry us a pleasuring in this thy boat and take this dinar he answered Who may go a pleasuring on the Tigris The Caliph Harun al Rashid every night cometh down Tigris stream in his state barge FN one hundred eighty six and with him one crying aloud Ho ye people all great and small gentle and simple men and boys whoso is found in a boat on the Tigris by night I will strike off his head or hang him to the mast of his craft And ye had well nigh met him for here cometh his carrack But the Caliph and Ja afar said O Shaykh take these two dinars and run us under one of yonder arches that we may hide there till the Caliph s barge have passed The old man replied Hand over your gold and rely we on Allah the Almighty So he took the two dinars and embarked them in the boat and he put off and rowed about with them awhile when behold the barge came down the river in mid stream with lighted flambeaux and cressets flaming therein Quoth the old man Did not I tell you that the Caliph passed along the river every night and ceased not muttering O Protector remove not the veils of Thy protection Then he ran the boat under an arch and threw a piece of black cloth over the Caliph and his companions who looked out from under the covering and saw in the bows of the barge a man holding in hand a cresset of red gold which he fed with Sumatran lign aloes and the figure was clad in a robe of red satin with a narrow turband of Mosul shape round on his head and over one of his shoulders hung a sleeved cloak FN one hundred eighty seven of cramoisy satin and on the other was a green silk bag full of the aloes wood with which he fed the cresset by way of firewood And they sighted in the stern another man clad like the first and bearing a like cresset and in the barge were two hundred white slaves standing ranged to the right and left and in the middle a throne of red gold whereon sat a handsome young man like the moon clad in a dress of black embroidered with yellow gold Before him they beheld a man as he were the Wazir Ja afar and at his head stood an eunuch as he were Masrur with a drawn sword in his hand besides a score of cup companions Now when the Caliph saw this he turned and said O Ja afar and the Minister replied At thy service O Prince of True Believers Then quoth the Caliph Belike this is one of my sons Al Amin or Al Maamun Then he examined the young man who sat on the throne and finding him perfect in beauty and loveliness and stature and symmetric grace said to Ja afar Verily this young man abateth nor jot nor tittle of the state of the Caliphate See there standeth before him one as he were thyself O Ja afar yonder eunuch who standeth at his head is as he were Masrur and those courtiers as they were my own By Allah O Ja afar my reason is confounded and I am filled with amazement this matter And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Eighty seventh Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the Caliph saw this spectacle his reason was confounded and he cried By Allah I am filled with amazement at this matter and Ja afar replied And I also by Allah O Commander of the Faithful Then the barge passed on and disappeared from sight whereupon the boatman pushed out again into the stream saying Praised be Allah for safety since none hath fallen in with us Quoth the Caliph O old man doth the Caliph come down the Tigris river every night The boatman answered Yes O my lord and on such wise hath he done every night this year past O Shaykh rejoined Al Rashid we wish thee of thy favour to await us here to morrow night and we will give thee five golden dinars for we are stranger folk lodging in the quarter Al Khandak and we have a mind to divert ourselves Said the oldster With joy and good will Then the Caliph and Ja afar and Masrur left the boatman and returned to the palace where they doffed their merchants habits and donning their apparel of state sat down each in his several stead and came the Emirs and Wazirs and Chamberlains and Officers and the Divan assembled and was crowded as of custom But when day ended and all the folk had dispersed and wended each his own way the Caliph said to his Wazir Rise O Ja afar let us go and amuse ourselves by looking on the second Caliph At this Ja afar and Masrur laughed and the three donning merchants habits went forth by a secret pastern and made their way through the city in great glee till they came to the Tigris where they found the graybeard sitting and awaiting them They embarked with him in the boat and hardly had they sat down before up came the mock Caliph s barge and when they looked at it attentively they saw therein two hundred Mamelukes other than those of the previous night while the link bearers cried aloud as of wont Quoth the Caliph O Wazir had I heard tell of this I had not believed it but I have seen it with my own sight Then said he to the boatman Take O Shaykh these ten dinars and row us along abreast of them for they are in the light and we in the shade and we can see them and amuse ourselves by looking on them but they cannot see us So the man took the money and pushing off ran abreast of them in the shadow of the barge And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Eighty eighth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Caliph Harun al Rashid said to the old man Take these ten dinars and row us abreast of them to which he replied I hear and I obey And he fared with them and ceased not going in the blackness of the barge till they came amongst the gardens that lay alongside of them and sighted a large walled enclosure and presently the barge cast anchor before a postern door where they saw servants standing with a she mule saddled and bridled Here the mock Caliph landed and mounting the mule rode away with his courtiers and his cup companions preceded by the cresset bearers crying aloud and followed by his household which busied itself in his service Then Harun al Rashid Ja afar and Masrur landed also and making their way through the press of servants walked on before them Presently the cresset bearers espied them and seeing three persons in merchants habits and strangers to the country took offense at them so they pointed them out and brought them before the other Caliph who looked at them and asked How came ye to this place and who brought you at this tide They answered O our lord we are foreign merchants and far from our homes who arrived here this day and were out a walking to night and behold ye came up and these men laid hands on us and brought us to thy presence and this is all our story Quoth the mock Caliph Since ye be stranger folk no harm shall befall you but had ye been of Baghdad I had struck off your heads Then he turned to his Wazir and said to him Take these men with thee for they are our guests to night To hear is to obey O our lord answered he and they companied him till they came to a lofty and splendid palace set upon the firmest base no Sultan possesseth such a place rising from the dusty mould and upon the merges of the clouds laying hold Its door was of Indian teak wood inlaid with gold that glowed and through it one passed into a royal hall in whose midst was a jetting fount girt by a raised estrade It was provided with carpets and cushions of brocade and small pillows and long settees and hanging curtains it was furnished with a splendour that dazed the mind and dumbed the tongue and upon the door were written these two couplets A Palace whereon be blessings and praise Which with all their beauty have robed the Days Where marvels and miracle sights abound And to write its honours the pen affrays The false Caliph entered with his company and sat down on a throne of gold set with jewels and covered with a prayer carpet of yellow silk whilst the boon companions took their seats and the sword bearer of high works stood before him Then the tables were laid and they ate after which the dishes were removed and they washed their hands and the wine service was set on with flagons and bowls in due order The cup went round till it came to the Caliph Harun al Rashid who refused the draught and the mock Caliph said to Ja afar What mattereth thy friend that he drinketh not He replied O my lord indeed tis a long while he hath drunk naught of this Quoth the sham Caliph I have drink other than this a kind of apple wine FN one hundred eighty eight that will suit thy companion So he bade them bring the cider which they did forthright when the false Caliph coming up to Harun al Rashid said to him As often as it cometh to thy turn drink thou of this Then they continued to drink and make merry and pass the cup till the wine rose to their brains and mastered their wits And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Eighty ninth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the false Caliph and his company sitters sat at their cups and gave not over drinking till the wine rose to their brains and mastered their wits and Harun al Rashid said to the Minister O Ja afar by Allah we have no such vessels as these Would to Heaven I knew what manner of man this youth is But while they were talking privily the young man cast a glance upon them and seeing the Wazir whisper the Caliph said Tis rude to whisper He replied No rudeness was meant this my friend did but say to me Verily I have travelled in most countries and have caroused with the greatest of Kings and I have companied with noble captains yet never saw I a goodlier ordering than this entertainment nor passed a more delightful night save that the people of Baghdad are wont to say Wine without music often leaves you sick When the second Caliph heard this he smiled pleasantly and struck with a rod he had in his hand a round gong FN one hundred eighty nine and behold a door opened and out came a eunuch bearing a chair of ivory inlaid with gold glittering fiery red and followed by a damsel of passing beauty and loveliness symmetry and grace He set down the chair and the damsel seated herself on it as she were the sun shining sheen in a sky serene In her hand she had a lute of Hindu make which she laid in her lap and bent down over it as a mother bendeth over her little one and sang to it after a prelude in four and twenty modes amazing all wits Then she returned to the first mode and to a lively measure chanted these couplets Love s tongue within my heart speaks plain to thee Telling thee clearly I am fain of thee Witness the fevers of a tortured heart And ulcered eyelid tear flood rains for thee God s fate o ertaketh all created things I knew not love till learnt Love s pain of thee Now when the mock Caliph heard these lines sung by the damsel he cried with a great cry and rent his raiment to the very skirt whereupon they let down a curtain over him and brought him a fresh robe handsomer than the first He put it on and sat as before till the cup came round to him when he struck the gong a second time and lo a door opened and out of it came a eunuch with a chair of gold followed by a damsel fairer than the first bearing a lute such as would strike the envious mute She sat down on the chair and sang to her instrument these two couplets How patient bide with love in sprite of me And tears in tempest FN one hundred ninety blinding sight of me By Allah life has no delight of me How gladden heart whose core is blight of me No sooner had the youth heard this poetry than he cried out with a loud cry and rent his raiment to the skirt whereupon they let down the curtain over him and brought him another suit of clothes He put it on and sitting up as before fell again to cheerful talk till the cup came round to him when he smote once more upon the gong and out came a eunuch with a chair followed by a damsel fairer than she who forewent her So she sat down on the chair with a lute in her hand and sang thereto these couplets Cease ye this farness bate this pride of you To whom my heart clings by life tide of you Have ruth on hapless mourning lover wretch Desire full pining passion tried of you Sickness hath wasted him whose ecstasy Prays Heaven it may be satisfied of you Oh fullest moons FN one hundred ninety one that dwell in deepest heart How can I think of aught by side of you Now when the young man heard these couplets he cried out with a great cry and rent his raiment whereupon they let fall the curtain over him and brought him other robes Then he returned to his former case with his boon companions and the bowl went round as before till the cup came to him when he struck the gong a fourth time and the door opening out came a page boy bearing a chair followed by a damsel He set the chair for her and she sat down thereon and taking the lute tuned it and sang to it these couplets When shall disunion and estrangement end When shall my bygone joys again be kenned Yesterday we were joined in same abode Conversing heedless of each envious friend FN one hundred ninety two Trickt us that traitor Time disjoined our lot And our waste home to desert fate condemned Wouldst have me Grumbler from my dearling fly I find my vitals blame will not perpend Cease thou to censure leave me to repine My mind e er findeth thoughts that pleasure lend O Lords FN one hundred ninety three of me who brake our troth and plight Deem not to lose your hold of heart and sprite When the false Caliph heard the girl s song he cried out with a loud outcry and rent his raiment And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Ninetieth Night She said When the false Caliph heard the girl s song he cried with a loud outcry and rent his raiment and fell to the ground fainting whereupon they would have let down the curtain over him as of custom but its cords stuck fast and Harun al Rashid after considering him carefully saw on his body the marks of beating with palm rods and said to Ja afar By Allah he is a handsome youth but a foul thief Whence knowest thou that O Commander of the Faithful asked Ja afar and the Caliph answered Sawest thou not the whip scars on his ribs Then they let fall the curtain over him and brought him a fresh dress which he put on and sat up as before with his courtiers and cup companions Presently he saw the Caliph and Ja afar whispering together and said to them What is the matter fair sirs Quoth Ja afar O my lord all is well FN one hundred ninety four save that this my comrade who as is not unknown to thee is of the merchant company and hath visited all the great cities and countries of the world and hath consorted with kings and men of highest consideration saith to me Verily that which our lord the Caliph hath done this night is beyond measure extravagant never saw I any do the like doings in any country for he hath rent such and such dresses each worth a thousand dinars and this is surely excessive unthriftiness Replied the second Caliph Ho thou the money is my money and the stuff my stuff and this is by way of largesse to my suite and servants for each suit that is rent belongeth to one of my cup companions here present and I assign to them with each suit of clothes the sum of five hundred dinars The Wazir Ja afar replied Well is whatso thou doest O our lord and recited these two couplets Virtue in hand of thee hath built a house And to mankind thou dost thy wealth expose If an the virtues ever close their doors That hand would be a key the lock to unclose Now when the young man heard these verses recited by the Minister Ja afar he ordered him to be gifted with a thousand dinars and a dress of honour Then the cup went round among them and the wine was sweet to them but after a while quoth the Caliph to Ja afar Ask him of the marks on his sides that we may see what he will say by way of reply Answered Ja afar Softly O my lord be not hasty and soothe thy mind for patience is more becoming Rejoined the Caliph By the life of my head and by the revered tomb of Al Abbas FN one hundred ninety five except thou ask him I will assuredly stop thy breath With this the young man turned towards the Minister and said to him What aileth thee and thy friend to be whispering together Tell me what is the matter with you It is nothing save good replied Ja afar but the mock Caliph rejoined I conjure thee by Allah tell me what aileth you and hide from me nothing of your case Answered the Wazir O my lord verily this one here saw on thy sides the marks of beating with whips and palm fronds and marvelled thereat with exceeding marvel saying How came the Caliph to be beaten and he would fain know the cause of this Now when the youth heard this he smiled and said Know ye that my story is wondrous and my case marvellous were it graven with needles on the eye corners it would serve as a warner to whoso would be warned And he sighed and repeated these couplets Strange is my story passing prodigy By Love I swear my ways wax strait on me An ye desire to hear me listen and Let all in this assembly silent be Heed ye my words which are of meaning deep Nor lies my speech tis truest verity I m slain FN one hundred ninety six by longing and by ardent love My slayer s the pearl of fair virginity She hath a jet black eye like Hindi blade And bowed eyebrows shoot her archery My heart assures me our Imam is here This age s Caliph old nobility Your second Ja afar highs is his Wazir A Sahib FN one hundred ninety seven Sahib son of high degree The third is called Masrur who wields the sword Now if in words of mine some truth you see I have won every wish by this event Which fills my heart with joy and gladdest greet When they heard these words Ja afar swore to him an ambiguous oath that they were not those he named whereupon he laughed and said Know O my lords that I am not the Commander of the Faithful and that I do but style myself thus to win my will of the sons of the city My true name is Mohammed Ali son of Ali the Jeweller and my father was one of the notables of Baghdad who left me great store of gold and silver and pearls and coral and rubies and chrysolites and other jewels besides messuages and lands Hammam baths and brickeries orchards and flower gardens Now as I sat in my shop one day surrounded by my eunuchs and dependents behold there came up a young lady mounted on a she mule and attended by three damsels like moons Riding up to my shop she alighted and seated herself by my side and said Art thou Mohammed the Jeweller Replied I Even so I am he thy Mameluke thy chattel She asked Hast thou a necklace of jewels fit for me and I answered O my lady I will show thee what I have and lay all before thee and if any please thee it will be of thy slave s good luck if they please thee not of his ill fortune Now I had by me an hundred necklaces and showed them all to her but none of them pleased her and she said I want a better than those I have seen I had a small necklace which my father had bought at an hundred thousand dinars and whose like was not to be found with any of the great kings so I said to her O my lady I have yet one necklace of fine stones fit for bezels the like of which none possesseth great or small Said she Show it to me so I showed it to her and she said This is what I wanted and what I have wished for all my life adding What is its price Quoth I It cost my father an hundred thousand dinars and she said I will give thee five thousand dinars to thy profit I answered O my lady the necklace and its owner are at thy service and I cannot gainsay thee But she rejoined Needs must thou have the profit and I am still most grateful to thee Then she rose without stay or delay and mounting the mule in haste said to me O my lord in Allah s name favour us with thy company to receive the money for this thy day with us is white as milk FN one hundred ninety eight So I shut the shop and accompanied her in all security till we came to a house on which were manifest the signs of wealth and rank for its door was wrought with gold and silver and ultramarine and thereon were written these two couplets Hole thou mansion woe ne er enter thee Nor be thine owner e er misused of Fate Excellent mansion to all guests art thou When other mansions to the guest are strait The young lady dismounted and entered the house bidding me sit down on the bench at the gate till the money changer should arrive So I sat awhile when behold a damsel came out to me and said O my lord enter the vestibule for it is a dishonour that thou shouldst sit at the gate Thereupon I arose and entered the vestibule and sat down on the settle there and as I sat lo another damsel came out and said to me O my lord my mistress biddeth thee enter and sit down at the door of the saloon to receive thy money I entered and sat down nor had I sat a moment when behold a curtain of silk which concealed a throne of gold was drawn aside and I saw seated thereon the lady who had made the purchase and round her neck she wore the necklace which looked pale and wan by the side of a face as it were the rounded moon At her sight my wit was troubled and my mind confounded by reason of her exceeding beauty and loveliness but when she saw me she rose from her throne and coming close up to me said O light of mine eyes is every handsome one like thee pitiless to his mistress I answered O my lady beauty all of it is in thee and is but one of thy hidden charms And she rejoined O Jeweller know that I love thee and can hardly credit that I have brought thee hither Then she bent towards me and I kissed her and she kissed me and as she caressed me drew me towards her and to her breast she pressed me And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Ninety first Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Jeweller continued Then she bent towards me and kissed and caressed me and as she caressed me drew me towards her and to her breast she pressed me Now she knew by my condition that I had a mind to enjoy her so she said to me O my lord wouldst thou foregather with me unlawfully By Allah may he not live who would do the like of this sin and who takes pleasure in talk unclean I am a maid a virgin whom no man hath approached nor am I unknown in the city Knowest thou who I am Quoth I No by Allah O my lady and quoth she I am the Lady Dunya daughter of Yahya bin Khalid the Barmecide and sister of Ja afar Wazir to the Caliph Now as I heard this I drew back from her saying O my lady it is no fault of mine if I have been over bold with thee it was thou didst encourage me to aspire to thy love by giving me access to thee She answered No harm shall befal thee and needs must thou attain thy desire in the only way pleasing to Allah I am my own mistress and the Kazi shall act as my guardian in consenting to the marriage contract for it is my will that I be to thee wife and thou be to me man Then she sent for the Kazi and the witnesses and busied herself with making ready and when they came she said to them Mohammed Ali bin Ali the Jeweller seeketh me in wedlock and hath given me the necklace to my marriage settlement and I accept and consent So they wrote out the contract of marriage between us and ere I went in to her the servants brought the wine furniture and the cups passed round after the fairest fashion and the goodliest ordering and when the wine mounted to our heads she ordered a damsel a lute player FN one hundred ninety nine to sing So she took the lute and sang to a pleasing and stirring motive these couplets He comes and fawn and branch and moon delight these eyne Fie FN two hundred on his heart who sleeps o nights without repine Pair youth for whom Heaven willed to quench in cheek one light And left another light on other cheek bright li en I fain finesse my chiders when they mention him As though the hearing of his name I would decline And willing ear I lend when they of other speak Yet would my soul within outflow in foods of brine Beauty s own prophet he is all a miracle Of heavenly grace and greatest shows his face for sign FN two hundred one To prayer Bilal like cries that Mole upon his cheek To ward from pearly brow all eyes of ill design FN two hundred two The censors of their ignorance would my love dispel But after Faith I can t at once turn Infidel We were ravished by the sweet music she made striking the strings and the beauty of the verses she sang and the other damsels went on to sing and to recite one after another till ten had so done when the Lady Dunya took the lute and playing a lively measure chanted these couplets I swear by swayings of that form so fair Aye from thy parting fiery Pity a heart which burneth in thy love O bright as fullest moon in blackest air Vouchsafe thy boons to him who ne er will cease In light of wine cup all thy charms declare Amid the roses which with varied hues Are to the myrtle bush FN two hundred three a mere despair When she had finished her verse I took the lute from her hands and playing a quaint and not vulgar prelude sang the following verses Laud to my Lord who gave thee all of loveliness Myself amid thy thralls I willingly confess O thou whose eyes and glances captivate mankind Pray that I scape those arrows shot with all thy stress Two hostile rivals water and enflaming fire Thy cheek hath married which for marvel I profess Thou art Sa ir in heart of me and eke Na im FN two hundred four Thou agro dolce eke heart s sweetest bitterness When she heard this my song she rejoiced with exceeding joy then dismissing her slave women she brought me to a most goodly place where they had spread us a bed of various colours She did off her clothes and I had a lover s privacy of her and found her a pearl unpierced and a filly unridden So I rejoiced in her and never in my born days spent I a more delicious night And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Ninety second Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Mohammed bin Ali the Jeweller continued So I went in unto the Lady Dunya daughter of Yahya bin Khalid the Barmecide and I found her a pearl unthridden and a filly unridden So I rejoiced in her and repeated these couplets O Night here stay I want no morning light My lover s face to me is lamp and light FN two hundred five As ring of ring dove round his necks my arm And made my palm his mouth veil and twas right This be the crown of bliss and ne er we ll cease To clip nor care to be in other plight And I abode with her a whole month forsaking shop and family and home till one day she said to me O light of my eyes O my lord Mohammed I have determined to go to the Hammam to day so sit thou on this couch and rise not from thy place till I return to thee I hear and I obey answered I and she made me swear to this after which she took her women and went off to the bath But by Allah O my brothers she had not reached the head of the street ere the door opened and in came an old woman who said to me O my lord Mohammed the Lady Zubaydah biddeth thee to her for she hath heard of thy fine manners and accomplishments and skill in singing I answered By Allah I will not rise from my place till the Lady Dunya come back Rejoined the old woman O my lord do not anger the Lady Zubaydah with thee and vex her so as to make her thy foe nay rise up and speak with her and return to thy place So I rose at once and followed her into the presence of the Lady Zubaydah and when I entered her presence she said to me O light of the eye art thou the Lady Dunya s beloved I am thy Mameluke thy chattel replied I Quoth she Sooth spake he who reported thee possessed of beauty and grace and good breeding and every fine quality indeed thou surpassest all praise and all report But now sing to me that I may hear thee Quoth I Hearkening and obedience so she brought me a lute and I sang to it these couplets The hapless lover s heart is of his wooing weary grown And hand of sickness wasted him till naught but skin and bone Who should be amid the riders which the haltered camels urge But that same lover whose beloved cloth in the litters wone To Allah s charge I leave that moon like Beauty in your tents Whom my heart loves albe my glance on her may ne er be thrown Now she is fain then she is fierce how sweet her coyness shows Yea sweet whatever cloth or saith to lover loved one When I had finished my song she said to me Allah assain thy body and thy voice Verily thou art perfect in beauty and good breeding and singing But now rise and return to thy place ere the Lady Dunya come back lest she find thee not and be wroth with thee Then I kissed the ground before her and the old woman forewent me till I reached the door whence I came So I entered and going up to the couch found that my wife had come back from the bath and was lying asleep there Seeing this I sat down at her feet and rubbed them whereupon she opened her eyes and seeing me drew up both her feet and gave me a kick that threw me off the couch FN two hundred six saying O traitor thou hast been false to thine oath and hast perjured thyself Thou swarest to me that thou wouldst not rise from thy place yet didst thou break thy promise and go to the Lady Zubaydah By Allah but that I fear public scandal I would pull down her palace over her head Then said she to her black slave O Sawab arise and strike off this lying traitor s head for we have no further need of him So the slave came up to me and tearing a strip from his skirt bandaged with it my eyes FN two hundred seven and would have struck off my head And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Ninety third Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Mohammed the Jeweller continued So the slave came up to me and tearing a strip from his skirt bandaged with it my eyes and would have struck off my head but all her women great and small rose and came up to her and said to her O our lady this is not the first who hath erred indeed he knew not thy humour and hath done thee no offence deserving death Replied she By Allah I must needs set my mark on him And she bade them bash me so they beat me on my ribs and the marks ye saw are the scars of that fustigation Then she ordered them to cast me out and they carried me to a distance from the house and threw me down like a log After a time I rose and dragged myself little by little to my own place where I sent for a surgeon and showed him my hurts and he comforted me and did his best to cure me As soon as I was recovered I went to the Hammam and as my pains and sickness had left me I repaired to my shop and took and sold all that was therein With the proceeds I bought me four hundred white slaves such as no King ever got together and caused two hundred of them to ride out with me every day Then I made me yonder barge whereon I spent five thousand gold pieces and styled myself Caliph and appointed each of my servants to the charge of some one of the Caliph s officers and clad him in official habit Moreover I made proclamation Whoso goeth a pleasuring on the Tigris by night I will strike off his head without ruth or delay and on such wise have I done this whole year past during which time I have heard no news of the lady neither happened upon any trace of her Then wept he copiously and repeated these couplets By Allah while the days endure ne er shall forget her I Nor draw to any nigh save those who draw her to me nigh Like to the fullest moon her form and favour show to me Laud to her All creating Lord laud to the Lord on high She left me full of mourning sleepless sick with pine and pain And ceaseth not my heart to yearn her mystery FN two hundred eight to espy Now when Harun al Rashid heard the young man s story and knew the passion and transport and love lowe that afflicted him he was moved to compassion and wonder and said Glory be to Allah who hath appointed to every effect a cause Then they craved the young man s permission to depart which being granted they took leave of him the Caliph purposing to do him justice meet and him with the utmost munificence entreat and they returned to the palace of the Caliphate where they changed clothes for others befitting their state and sat down whilst Masrur the Sworder of High Justice stood before them After awhile quoth the Caliph to Ja afar O Wazir bring me the young man And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Two hundred and Ninety fourth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that quoth the Caliph to his Minister Bring me the young man with whom we were last night I hear and obey answered Ja afar and going to the youth saluted him saying Obey the summons of the Commander of the Faithful the Caliph Harun al Rashid So he returned with him to the palace in great anxiety by reason of the summons and going in to the King kissed ground before him and offered up a prayer for the endurance of his glory and prosperity for the accomplishment of his desires for the continuance of his beneficence and for the cessation of evil and punishment ordering his speech as best he might and ending by saying Peace be on thee O Prince of True Believers and Protector of the folk of the Faith Then he repeated these two couplets Kiss thou his fingers which no fingers are Keys of our daily bread those fingers ken And praise his actions which no actions are But precious necklaces round necks of men So the Caliph smiled in his face and returned his salute looking on him with the eye of favour then he bade him draw near and sit down before him and said to him O Mohammed Ali I wish thee to tell me what befel thee last night for it was strange and passing strange Quoth the youth Pardon O Commander of the Faithful give me the kerchief of immunity that my dread may be appeased and my heart eased Replied the Caliph I promise thee safety from fear and woes So the young man told him his story from first to last whereby the Caliph knew him to be a lover and severed from his beloved and said to him Desirest thou that I restore her to thee This were of the bounty of the Commander of the Faithful answered the youth and repeated these two couplets Ne er cease thy gate be Ka abah to mankind Long may its threshold dust man s brow beseem That o er all countries it may be proclaimed This is the Place and thou art Ibrahim FN two hundred nine Thereupon the Caliph turned to his Minister and said to him O Ja afar bring me thy sister the Lady Dunya daughter of the Wazir Yahya bin Khalid I hear and I obey answered he and fetched her without let or delay Now when she stood before the Caliph he said to her Doss thou know who this is and she replied O Commander of the Faithful how should women have knowledge of men FN two hundred ten So the Caliph smiled and said O Dunya this is thy beloved Mohammed bin Ali the Jeweller We are acquainted with his case for we have heard the whole story from beginning to end and have apprehended its inward and its outward and it is no more hidden from me for all it was kept in secrecy Replied she O Commander of the Faithful this was written in the Book of Destiny I crave the forgiveness of Almighty Allah for the wrong I have wrought and pray thee to pardon me of thy favour At this the Caliph laughed and summoning the Kazi and witnesses renewed the marriage contract between the Lady Dunya and her husband Mohammed Ali son of the Jeweller whereby there betided them both her and him the utmost felicity and to their enviers mortification and misery Moreover he made Mohammed Ali one of his boon companions and they abode in joy and cheer and gladness till there came to them the Destroyer of delights and the Sunderer of societies And men also relate the pleasant tale of ALI THE PERSIAN It is said that the Caliph Harun al Rashid being restless one night sent for his Wazir and said to him O Ja afar I am sore wakeful and heavy hearted this night and I desire of thee what may solace my spirit and cause my breast to broaden with amuse meet Quoth Ja afar O Commander of the Faithful I have a friend by name Ali the Persian who hath store of tales and plea sent stories such as lighten the heart and make care depart Quoth the Caliph Fetch him to me and quoth Ja afar Hearkening and obedience and going out from before him sent to seek Ali the Persian and when he came said to him Answer the summons of the Commander of the Faithful To hear is to obey answered Ali And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Ninety fifth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Persian replied To hear is to obey and at once followed the Wazir into the presence of the Caliph who bade him be seated and said to him O Ali my heart is heavy within me this night and it hath come to my ear that thou hast great store of tales and anecdotes so I desire of thee that thou let me hear what will relieve my despondency and brighten my melancholy Said he O Commander of the Faithful shall I tell thee what I have seen with my eyes or what I have heard with my ears He replied An thou have seen aught worth the telling let me hear that Replied Ali Hearkening and obedience Know thou O Commander of the Faithful that some years ago I left this my native city of Baghdad on a journey having with me a lad who carried a light leathern bag Presently we came to a certain city where as I was buying and selling behold a rascally Kurd fell on me and seized my wallet perforce saying This is my bag and all which is in it is my property Thereupon I cried aloud Ho Moslems FN two hundred eleven one and all deliver me from the hand of the vilest of oppressors But the folk said Come both of you to the Kazi and abide ye by his judgment with joint consent So I agreed to submit myself to such decision and we both presented ourselves before the Kazi who said What bringeth you hither and what is your case and your quarrel Quoth I We are men at difference who appeal to thee and make complaint and submit ourselves to thy judgment Asked the Kazi Which of you is the complainant so the Kurd came forward FN two hundred twelve and said Allah preserve our lord the Kazi Verily this bag is my bag and all that is in it is my swag It was lost from me and I found it with this man mine enemy The Kazi asked When didst thou lose it and the Kurd answered But yesterday and I passed a sleepless night by reason of its loss An it be thy bag quoth the Kazi tell me what is in it Quoth the Kurd There were in my bag two silver styles for eye powder and antimony for the eyes and a kerchief for the hands wherein I had laid two gilt cups and two candlesticks Moreover it contained two tents and two platters and two spoons and a cushion and two leather rugs and two ewers and a brass tray and two basins and a cooking pot and two water jars and a ladle and a sacking needle and a she cat and two bitches and a wooden trencher and two sacks and two saddles and a gown and two fur pelisses and a cow and two calves and a she goat and two sheep and an ewe and two lambs and two green pavilions and a camel and two she camels and a lioness and two lions and a she bear and two jackals and a mattress and two sofas and an upper chamber and two saloons and a portico and two sitting rooms and a kitchen with two doors and a company of Kurds who will bear witness that the bag is my bag Then said the Kazi to me And thou sirrah what sayest thou So I came forward O Commander of the Faithful and indeed the Kurd s speech had bewildered me and said Allah advance our lord the Kazi Verily there was naught in this my wallet save a little ruined tenement and another without a door and a dog house and a boys school and youths playing dice and tents and tent ropes and the cities of Bassorah and Baghdad and the palace of Shaddad bin Ad and an ironsmith s forge and a fishing net and cudgels and pickets and girls and boys and a thousand pimps who will testify that the bag is my bag Now when the Kurd heard my words he wept and wailed and said O my lord the Kazi this my bag is known and what is in it is a matter of renown for in this bag there be castles and citadels and cranes and beasts of prey and men playing chess and draughts Furthermore in this my bag is a brood mare and two colts and a stallion and two blood steeds and two long lances and it containeth eke a lion and two hares and a city and two villages and a whore and two sharking panders and an hermaphrodite and two gallows birds and a blind man and two wights with good sight and a limping cripple and two lameters and a Christian ecclesiastic and two deacons and a patriarch and two monks and a Kazi and two assessors who will be evidence that the bag is my bag Quoth the Kazi to me And what sayst thou O Ali So O Commander of the Faithful being filled with rage I came forward and said Allah keep our lord the Kazi And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Ninety sixth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Persian continued So being filled with rage O Commander of the Faithful I came forward and said Allah keep our lord the Kazi I had in this my wallet a coat of mail and a broadsword and armouries and a thousand fighting rams and a sheep fold with its pasturage and a thousand barking dogs and gardens and vines and flowers and sweet smelling herbs and figs and apples and statues and pictures and flagons and goblets and fair faced slave girls and singing women and marriage feasts and tumult and clamour and great tracts of land and brothers of success which were robbers and a company of daybreak raiders with swords and spears and bows and arrows and true friends and dear ones and Intimates and comrades and men imprisoned for punishment and cup companions and a drum and flutes and flags and banners and boys and girls and brides in all their wedding bravery and singing girls and five Abyssinian women and three Hindi maidens and four damsels of Al Medinah and a score of Greek girls and eighty Kurdish dames and seventy Georgian ladies and Tigris and Euphrates and a fowling net and a flint and steel and Many columned Iram and a thousand rogues and pimps and horse courses and stables and mosques and baths and a builder and a carpenter and a plank and a nail and a black slave with his flageolet and a captain and a caravan leader and towns and cities and an hundred thousand dinars and Cufa and Anbar FN two hundred thirteen and twenty chests full of stuffs and twenty storehouses for victuals and Gaza and Askalon and from Damietta to Al Sawan FN two hundred fourteen and the palace of Kisra Anushirwan and the kingdom of Solomon and from Wadi Nu uman to the land of Khorasan and Balkh and Ispahan and from India to the Sudan Therein also may Allah prolong the life of our lord the Kazi are doublets and cloths and a thousand sharp razors to shave off the Kazi s beard except he fear my resentment and adjudge the bag to be my bag Now when the Kazi heard what I and the Kurd avouched he was confounded and said I see ye twain be none other than two pestilent fellows atheistical villains who make sport of Kazis and magistrates and stand not in fear of reproach Never did tongue tell nor ear hear aught more extraordinary than that which ye pretend By Allah from China to Shajarat Umm Ghaylan nor from Fars to Sudan nor from Wadi Nu uman to Khorasan was ever heard the like of what ye avouch or credited the like of what ye affirm Say fellows be this bag a bottomless sea or the Day of Resurrection that shall gather together the just and unjust Then the Kazi bade them open the bag so I opened it and behold there was in it bread and a lemon and cheese and olives So I threw the bag down before the Kurd and ganged my gait Now when the Caliph heard this tale from Ali the Persian he laughed till he fell on his back and made him a handsome present FN two hundred fifteen And men also relate a TALE OF HARUN AL RASHID AND THE SLAVE GIRL AND THE IMAM ABU YUSUF It is said that Ja afar the Barmecide was one night carousing with Al Rashid who said O Ja afar it hath reached me that thou hast bought such and such a slave girl Now I have long sought her for she is passing fair and my heart is taken up with love of her so do thou sell her to me He replied I will not sell her O Commander of the Faithful Quoth he Then give her to me Quoth the other Nor will I give her Then Al Rashid exclaimed Be Zubaydah triply divorced an thou shall not either sell or give her to me Then Ja afar exclaimed Be my wife triply divorced an I either sell or give her to thee After awhile they recovered from their tipsiness and were aware of having fallen into a grave dilemma but knew not by what device to extricate themselves Then said Al Rashid None can help us in this strait but Abu Yusuf FN two hundred sixteen So they sent for him and this was in the middle of the night and when the messenger reached him he arose in alarm saying to himself I should not be sent for at this tide and time save by reason of some question of moment to Al Islam So he went out in haste and mounted his she mule saying to his servant Take the mule s nose bag with thee it may be she hath not finished her feed and when we come to the Caliph s palace put the bag on her that she may eat what is left of her fodder during the last of the night And the man replied I hear and obey Now when the Imam was admitted to the presence Al Rashid rose to receive him and seated him on the couch beside himself where he was wont to seat none save the Kazi and said to him We have not sent for thee at this untimely time and tide save to advise us upon a grave matter which is such and such and wherewith we know not how to deal And he expounded to him the case Abu Yusuf answered O Commander of the Faithful this is the easiest of things Then he turned to Ja afar and said O Ja afar sell half of her to the Commander of the Faithful and give him the other half so shall ye both be quit of your oaths The Caliph was delighted with this and both did as he prescribed Then said Al Rashid Bring me the girl at once And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Ninety seventh Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Caliph Harun al Rashid commanded Bring me the girl at once for I long for her exceedingly So they brought her and the Caliph said to Abu Yusuf I have a mind to have her forthright for I cannot bear to abstain from her during the prescribed period of purification now how is this to be done Abu Yusuf replied Bring me one of thine own male slaves who hath never been manumitted So they brought one and Abu Yusuf said Give me leave to marry her to him then let him divorce her before consummation and thus shall it be lawful for thee to lie with her before purification This second expedient pleased the Caliph yet more than the first he sent for the Mameluke and whenas he came said to the Kazi I authorise thee to marry her to him So the Imam proposed the marriage to the slave who accepted it and performed the ceremony after which he said to the slave Divorce her and thou shalt have an hundred dinars But he replied I won t do this and the Imam went on to increase his offer and the slave to refuse till he bid him a thousand dinars Then the man asked him Doth it rest with me to divorce her or with thee or with the Commander of the Faithful He answered It is in thy hand Then by Allah quoth the slave I will never do it no never Hearing these words the Caliph was exceeding wroth and said to the Imam What is to be done O Abu Yusuf Replied he Be not concerned O Commander of the Faithful the thing is easy Make this slave the damsel s chattel Quoth Al Rashid I give him to her and the Imam said to the girl Say I accept So she said I accept whereon quoth Abu Yusuf I pronounce separation from bed and board and divorce between them for that he hath become her property and so the marriage is annulled With this Al Rashid rose to his feet and exclaimed It is the like of thee that shall be Kazi in my time Then he called for sundry trays of gold and emptied them before Abu Yusuf to whom he said Hast thou wherein to put this The Imam bethought him of the mule s nose bag so he sent for it and filling it with gold took it and went home And on the morrow he said to his friends There is no easier nor shorter road to the goods of this world and the next than that of religious learning for see I have gotten all this money by answering two or three questions So consider thou O polite reader FN two hundred seventeen the pleasantness of this anecdote for it compriseth divers goodly features amongst which are the complaisance of Ja afar to Al Rashid and the wisdom of the Caliph who chose such a Kazi and the excellent learning of Abu Yusuf may Almighty Allah have mercy on their souls one and all And they also tell the TALE OF THE LOVER WHO FEIGNED HIMSELF A THIEF When Khalid bin Abdallah al Kasri FN two hundred eighteen was Emir of Bassorah there came to him one day a company of men dragging a youth of exceeding beauty and lofty bearing and perfumed attire whose aspect expressed good breeding abundant wit and dignity of the gravest They brought him before the Governor who asked what it was and they replied This fellow is a thief whom we caught last night in our dwelling house Whereupon Khalid looked at him and was pleased with his well favouredness and elegant aspect so he said to the others Loose him and going up to the young man asked what he had to say for himself He replied Verily the folk have spoken truly and the case is as they have said Quoth Khalid And what moved thee to this and thou so noble of port and comely of mien Quoth the other The lust after worldly goods and the ordinance of Allah extolled exalted be He Rejoined Khalid Be thy mother bereaved of thee FN two hundred nineteen Hadst thou not in thy fair face and sound sense and good breeding what should restrain thee from thieving Answered the young man O Emir leave this talk and proceed to what Almighty Allah hath ordained this is what my hands have earned and God is not unjust towards mankind FN two hundred twenty So Khalid was silent awhile considering the matter then he bade the young man draw near him and said Verily thy confession before witnesses perplexeth me for I cannot believe thee to be a thief haply thou hast some story that is other than one of theft and if so tell it me Replied the youth O Emir imagine naught other than what I have confessed to in thy presence for I have no tale to tell save that verily I entered these folks house and stole what I could lay hands on and they caught me and took the stuff from me and carried me before thee Then Khalid bade clap him in gaol and commended a crier to cry throughout Bassorah O yes O yes Whoso be minded to look upon the punishment of such an one the thief and the cutting off of his hand let him be present to morrow morning at such a place Now when the young man found himself in prison with irons on his feet he sighed heavily and with tears streaming from his eyes extemporized these couplets When Khalid menaced off to strike my hand If I refuse to tell him of her case Quoth I Far far fro me that I should tell A love which ever shall my heart engrace Loss of my hand for sin I have confessed To me were easier than to shame her face The warders heard him and went and told Khalid who when it was dark night sent for the youth and conversed with him He found him clever and well bred intelligent lively and a pleasant companion so he ordered him food and he ate Then after an hour s talk said Khalid I know indeed thou hast a story to tell that is no thief s so when the Kazi shall come to morrow morning and shall question thee about this robbery do thou deny the charge of theft and avouch what may avert the pain and penalty of cutting off thy hand for the Apostle whom Allah bless and keep saith In cases of doubt eschew punishment Then he sent him back to prison And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Ninety eighth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Khalid after conversing with the youth sent him back to prison where he passed the night And when morning dawned the folk assembled to see his hand cut off nor was there a soul in Bassorah man or woman but was present to look upon the punishment of that handsome youth Then Khalid mounted in company of the notables of the city and others and summoning all four Kazis sent for the young man who came hobbling and stumbling in his fetters There was none saw him but wept over him and the women all lifted up their voices in lamentation as for the dead Then the Kazi bade silence the women and said to the prisoner These folk avouch that thou didst enter their dwelling house and steal their goods belike thou stolest less than a quarter dinar FN two hundred twenty one Replied he Nay I stole that and more Peradventure rejoined the Kazi thou art partner with the folk in some of the goods Quoth the young man Not so it was all theirs and I had no right in it At this the Khalid was wroth and rose and smote him on the face with his whip applying to his own case this couplet Man wills his wish to him accorded be But Allah naught accords save what He wills Then he called for the butcher to do the work who came and drew forth his knife and taking the prisoner s hand set the blade to it when behold a damsel pressed through the crowd of women clad in tattered clothes FN two hundred twenty two and cried out and threw herself on the young man Then she unveiled and showed a face like the moon whereupon the people raised a mighty clamour and there was like to have been a riot amongst them and a violent scene But she cried out her loudest saying I conjure thee by Allah O Emir hasten not to cut off this man s hand till thou have read what is in this scroll So saying she gave him a scroll and Khalid took it and opened it and read therein these couplets Ah Khalid this one is a slave of love distraught And these bowed eye lashes sent shaft that caused his grief Shot him an arrow sped by eyes of mine for he Wedded to burning love of ills hath no relief He hath avowed a deed he never did the while Deeming this better than disgrace of lover fief Bear then I pray with this distracted lover mine Whose noble nature falsely calls himself a thief When Khalid had read these lines he withdrew himself from the people and summoned the girl and questioned her and she told him that the young man was her lover and she his mistress and that thinking to visit her he came to the dwelling of her people and threw a stone into the house to warn her of his coming Her father and brothers heard the noise of the stone and sallied out on him but he hearing them coming caught up all the household stuff and made himself appear a robber to cover his mistress s honour Now when they saw him they seized him continued she crying A thief and brought him before thee whereupon he confessed to the robbery and persisted in his confession that he might spare me disgrace and this he did making himself a thief of the exceeding nobility and generosity of his nature Khalid answered He is indeed worthy to have his desire and calling the young man to him kissed him between the eyes Then he sent for the girl s father and bespoke him saying O Shaykh we thought to carry out the law of mutilation in the case of this young man but Allah to whom be Honour and Glory hath preserved us from this and I now adjudge him the sum of ten thousand dirhams for that he would have given his hand for the preservation of thine honour and that of thy daughter and for the sparing of shame to you both Moreover I adjudge other ten thousand dirhams to thy daughter for that she made known to me the truth of the case and I ask thy leave to marry her to him Rejoined the old man O Emir thou hast my consent So Khalid praised Allah and thanked Him and improved the occasion by preaching a goodly sermon and a prayerful And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Two Hundred and Ninety ninth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Khalid praised Allah and thanked Him and improved the occasion by preaching a goodly sermon and a prayerful after which he said to the young man I give thee to wife the damsel such an one here present with her own permission and her father s consent and her wedding settlement shall be this money to wit ten thousand dirhams I accept this marriage at thy hands replied the youth and Khalid bade them carry the money on brass trays in procession to the young man s house whilst the people dispersed fully satisfied And surely quoth he who tells the tale FN two hundred twenty three never saw I a rarer day than this for that it began with tears and annoy and it ended with smiles and joy And in contrast of this story is this piteous tale of JA AFAR THE BARMECIDE AND THE BEAN SELLER When Harun al Rashid crucified Ja afar the Barmecide FN two hundred twenty four he commended that all who wept or made moan for him should also be crucified so the folk abstained from that Now it chanced that a wild Arab who dwelt in a distant word used every year to bring to the aforesaid Ja afar an ode FN two hundred twenty five in his honour for which he rewarded him with a thousand dinars and the Badawi took them and returning to his own country lived upon them he and his family for the rest of the year Accordingly he came with his ode at the wonted time and finding that Ja afar had been crucified betook himself to the place where his body was hanging and there made his camel kneel down and wept with sore weeping and mourned with grievous mourning and he recited his ode and fell asleep Presently Ja afar the Barmecide appeared to him in a vision and said Verily thou hast wearied thyself to come to us and findest us as thou seest but go to Bassorah and ask for a man there whose name is such and such one of the merchants of the town and say to him Ja afar the Barmecide saluteth thee and biddeth thee give me a thousand dinars by the token of the bean Now when the wild Arab awoke he repaired to Bassorah where he sought out the merchant and found him and repeated to him what Ja afar had said in the dream whereupon he wept with weeping so sore that he was like to depart the world Then he welcomed the Badawi and seated him by his side and made his stay pleasant and entertained him three days as an honoured guest and when he was minded to depart he gave him a thousand and five hundred dinars saying The thousand are what is commanded to thee and the five hundred are a gift from me to thee and every year thou shalt have of me a thousand gold pieces Now when the Arab was about to take leave he said to the merchant Allah upon thee tell me the story of the bean that I may know the origin of all this He answered In the early part of my life I was poor and hawked hot beans FN two hundred twenty six about the streets of Baghdad to keep me alive So I went out one raw and rainy day without clothes enough on my body to protect me from the weather now shivering for excess of cold and now stumbling into the pools of rain water and altogether in so piteous a plight as would make one shudder with goose skin to look upon But it chanced that Ja afar that day was seated with his officers and his concubines in an upper chamber overlooking the street when his eyes fell on me so he took pity on my case and sending one of his dependents to fetch me to him said as soon as he saw me Sell thy beans to my people So I began to mete out the beans with a measure I had by me and each who took a measure of beans filled the measure with gold pieces till all my store was gone and my basket was clean empty Then I gathered together the gold I had gotten and Ja afar said to me Hast thou any beans left I know not answered I and then sought in the basket but found only one bean So Ja afar took from me the single bean and splitting it in twain kept one half himself and gave the other to one of his concubines saying For how much wilt thou buy this half bean She replied For the tale of all this gold twice told whereat I was confounded and said to myself This is impossible But as I stood wondering behold she gave an order to one of her hand maids and the girl brought me the sum of the collected monies twice told Then said Ja afar And I will buy the half I have by me for double the sum of the whole presently adding Now take the price of thy bean And he gave an order to one of his servants who gathered together the whole of the money and laid it in my basket and I took it and went my ways Then I betook myself to Bassorah where I traded with the monies and Allah prospered me amply to Him be the praise and the thanks So if I give thee every year a thousand dinars of the bounty of Ja afar it will in no wise injure me Consider then the munificence of Ja afar s nature and how he was praised both alive and dead the mercy of Allah Almighty be upon him And men also recount the tale of ABU MOHAMMED HIGHT LAZYBONES It is told that Harun al Rashid was sitting one day on the throne of the Caliphate when there came in to him a youth of his eunuchry bearing a crown of red gold set with pearls and rubies and all manner of other gems and jewels such as money might not buy and bussing the ground between his hands said O Commander of the Faithful the Lady Zubaydah kisseth the earth before thee And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say Whereupon quoth her sister Dunyazad How pleasant is thy tale and profitable and how sweet is thy speech and how delectable And where is this replied Shahrazad compared with what I shall tell you next night an I live and the King grant me leave Thereupon quoth the King to himself By Allah I will not slay her until I hear the end of her tale When it was the Three Hundredth Night Quoth Dunyazad favour us O my sister with thy tale and she replied With joy and good will if the King accord me leave whereupon the King said Tell thy tale O Shahrazad So she pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that the youth said to the Caliph The Lady Zubaydah kisseth the earth before thee and saith to thee Thou knowest she hath bidden make this crown which lacketh a great jewel for its dome top and she hath made search among her treasures but cannot find a jewel of size to suit her mind Quoth the Caliph to his Chamberlains and Viceregents Make search for a great jewel such as Zubaydah desireth So they sought but found nothing befitting her and told the Caliph who vexed and annoyed thereat exclaimed How am I Caliph and King of the Kings of the earth and cannot find so small a matter as a jewel Woe to you Ask of the merchants So they enquired of the traders who replied Our lord the Caliph will not find a jewel such as he requireth save with a man of Bassorah by name Abu Mohammed highs Lazybones Thereupon they acquainted the Caliph with this and he bade his Wazir Ja afar send a note to the Emir Mohammed al Zubaydi Governor of Bassorah commanding him to equip Abu Mohammed Lazybones and bring him into the presence of the Commander of the Faithful The Minister accordingly wrote a note to that effect and despatched it by Masrur who set out forthright for the city of Bassorah and went in to the Emir Mohammed al Zubaydi who rejoiced in him and treated him with the high most honour Then Masrur read him the mandate of the Prince of True Believers Harun al Rashid to which he replied I hear and I obey and forthwith despatched him with a company of his followers to Abu Mohammed s house When they reached it they knocked at the door whereupon a page came out and Masrur said to him Tell thy lord The Commander of the Faithful summoneth thee The servant went in and told his master who came out and found Masrur the Caliph s Chamberlain and a company of the Governor s men at the door So he kissed ground before Masrur and said I hear and obey the summons of the Commander of the Faithful but first enter ye my house They replied We cannot do that save in haste even as the Prince of True Believers commanded us for he awaiteth thy coming But he said Have patience with me a little till I set my affairs in order So after much pressure and abundant persuasion they entered the house with him and found the vestibule hung with curtains of azure brocade purfled with red gold and Abu Mohammed Lazybones bade one of his servants carry Masrur to the private Hammam Now this bath was in the house and Masrur found its walls and floors of rare and precious marbles wrought with gold and silver and its waters mingled with rose water Then the servants served Masrur and his company with the perfection of service and on their going forth of the Hammam clad them in robes of honour brocade work interwoven with gold And after leaving the bath Masrur and his men went in to Abu Mohammed Lazybones and found him seated in his upper chamber and over his head hung curtains of gold brocade wrought with pearls and jewels and the pavilion was spread with cushions embroidered in red gold Now the owner was sitting softly upon a quilted cloth covering a settee inlaid with stones of price and when he saw Masrur he went forward to meet him and bidding him welcome seated him by his side Then he called for the food trays so they brought them and when Masrur saw the tables he exclaimed By Allah never did I behold the like of these appointments in the palace of the Commander of the Faithful For indeed the trays contained every manner of meat all served in dishes of gilded porcelain FN two hundred twenty seven So we ate and drank and made merry till the end of the day quoth Masrur when the host gave to each and every of us five thousand dinars and on the morrow he clad us in dresses of honour of green and gold and entreated us with the utmost worship Then said Masrur to him We can tarry no longer for fear of the Caliph s displeasure Answered Abu Mohammed Lazybones O my lord have patience with us till the morrow that we may equip ourselves and we will then depart with you So they tarried with him that day and slept the night and next morning Abu Mohammed s servants saddled him a she mule with selle and trappings of gold set with all manner of pearls and stones of price whereupon quoth Masrur to himself I wonder when Abu Mohammed shall present himself in such equipage if the Caliph will ask him how he came by all this wealth Thereupon they took leave of Al Zubaydi and setting out from Bassorah fared on without ceasing to fare till they reached Baghdad city and presented themselves before the Caliph who bade Abu Mohammed be seated He sat down and addressed the Caliph in courtly phrase saying O Commander of the Faithful I have brought with me an humble offering by way of homage have I thy gracious permission to produce it Al Rashid replied There is no harm in that FN two hundred twenty eight whereupon Abu Mohammed bade his men bring in a chest from which he took a number of rarities and amongst the rest trees of gold with leaves of white emeraid FN two hundred twenty nine and fruits of pigeon blood rubies and topazes and new pearls and bright And as the Caliph was struck with admiration he fetched a second chest and brought out of it a tent of brocade crowned with pearls and jacinths and emeralds and jaspers and other precious stones its poles were of freshly cut Hindi aloes wood and its skirts were set with the greenest smaragds Thereon were depicted all manner of animals such as beasts and birds spangled with precious stones rubies emeralds chrysolites and balasses and every kind of precious metal Now when Al Rashid saw these things he rejoiced with exceeding joy and Abu Mohammed Lazybones said to him O Commander of the Faithful deem not that I have brought these to thee fearing aught or coveting anything but I knew myself to be but a man of the people and that such things befitted none save the Commander of the Faithful And now with thy leave I will show thee for thy diversion something of what I can do Al Rashid replied Do what thou wilt that we may see To hear is to obey said Abu Mohammed and moving his lips beckoned the palace battlements FN two hundred thirty whereupon they inclined to him then he made another sign to them and they returned to their place Presently he made a sign with his eye and there appeared before him closets with closed doors to which he spoke and lo the voices of birds answered him from within The Caliph marvelled with passing marvel at this and said to him How camest thou by all this seeing that thou art known only as Abu Mohammed Lazybones and they tell me that thy father was a cupper serving in a public Hammam who left thee nothing Whereupon he answered Listen to my story And Shahrazed perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and First Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Abu Mohammed Lazybones thus spake to the Caliph O Prince of True Believers listen to my story for it is a marvellous and its particulars are wondrous were it graven with graver needles upon the eye corners it were a warner to whose would be warned Quoth Al Rashid Let us hear all thou hast to say O Abu Mohammed So he began Know then O Commander of the Faithful Allah prolong to thee glory and dominion the report of the folk that I am known as the Lazybones and that my father left me nothing is true for he was as thou hast said nothing but a barber cupper in a Hammam And I throughout my youth was the idlest wight on the face of the earth indeed so great was my sluggishness that if I lay at full length in the sultry season and the sun came round upon me I was too lazy to rise and remove from the sun to the shade And thus I abode till I reached my fifteenth year when my father deceased in the mercy of Allah Almighty and left me nothing However my mother used to go out a charing and feed me and give me to drink whilst I lay on my side Now it came to pass that one day she came in to me with five silver dirhams and said to me O my son I hear that Shaykh Abu al Muzaffar FN two hundred thirty one is about to go a voyage to China Now this Shaykh was a good and charitable man who loved the poor So come my son take these five silver bits and let us both carry them to him and beg him to buy thee therewith somewhat from the land of China so haply thou mayst make a profit of it by the bounty of Allah whose name be exalted I was too idle to move for her but she swore by the Almighty that except I rose and went with her she would bring me neither meat nor drink nor come in to me but would leave me to die of hunger and thirst Now when I heard her words O Commander of the Faithful I knew she would do as she threatened for her knowledge of my sluggishness so I said to her Help me to sit up She did so and I wept the while and said to her Bring me my shoes Accordingly she brought them and I said Put them on my feet She put them on my feet and I said Lift me up off the ground So she lifted me up and I said Support me that I may walk So she supported me and I continued to fare a foot at times stumbling over my skirts till we came to the river bank where we saluted the Shaykh and I said to him O my uncle art thou Abu al Muzaffar At thy service answered he and I Take these dirhams and with them buy me somewhat from the land of China haply Allah may vouchsafe me a profit of it Quoth the Shaykh to his companions Do ye know this youth They answered Yes he is known as Abu Mohammed Lazybones and we never saw him stir from his house till this moment Then said he to me O my son give me the silver with the blessing of Almighty Allah So he took the money saying Bismillah in the name of Allah and I returned home with my mother Presently Shaykh Abu al Muzaffar set sail with a company of merchants and stayed not till they reached the land of China where he and his bought and sold and having won what they wished set out on their homeward voyage When they had been three days at sea the Shaykh said to his company Stay the vessel They asked What dost thou want and he answered Know that I have forgotten the commission wherewith Abu Mohammed Lazybones charged me so let us turn back that we may lay out his money on somewhat whereby he may profit They cried We conjure thee by Allah Almighty turn not back with us for we have traversed a long distance and a sore and while so doing we have endured sad hardship and many terrors Quoth he There is no help for it but we return and they said Take from us double the profit of the five dirhams and turn us not back He agreed to this and they collected for him an ample sum of money Thereupon they sailed on till they came to an island wherein was much people when they moored thereto and the merchants went ashore to buy thence a stock of precious metals and pearls and jewels and so forth Presently Abu al Muzaffar saw a man seated with many apes before him and amongst them one whose hair had been plucked off and as often as their owner s attention was diverted from them the other apes fell upon the plucked one and beat him and threw him on their master whereupon the man rose and bashed them and bound them and punished them for this and all the apes were wroth with the plucked ape on this account and funded him the more When Shaykh Abu al Muzaffar saw this he felt for and took compassion upon the plucked ape and said to his master Wilt thou sell me yonder monkey Replied the man Buy and Abu al Muzaffar rejoined I have with me five dirhams belonging to an orphan lad Wilt thou sell it me for that sum Answered the monkey merchant It is a bargain and Allah give thee a blessing of him So he made over the beast and received his money and the Shaykh s slaves took the ape and tied him up in the ship Then they loosed sail and made for another island where they cast anchor and there came down divers who plunged for precious stones pearls and other gems so the merchants hired them to dive for money and they dived Now when the ape saw them doing this he loosed himself from his bonds and jumping off the ship s side plunged with them whereupon quoth Abu al Muzaffar There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great The monkey is lost to us with the luck of the poor fellow for whom we bought him And they despaired of him but after a while the company of divers rose to the surface and behold among them was the ape with his hands full of jewels of price which he threw down before Abu al Muzaffar The Shaykh marvelled at this and said There is much mystery in this monkey Then they cast off and sailed till they came to a third island called the Isle of the Zunuj FN two hundred thirty two who are a people of the blacks which eat the flesh of the sons of Adam When the blacks saw them they boarded them in dug outs FN two hundred thirty three and taking all in the vessel pinioned them and carried them to their King who bade slaughter certain of the merchants So they slaughtered them by cutting their throats and ate their flesh and the rest of the traders passed the night in bonds and were in sore concern But when it was midnight the ape arose and going up to Abu al Muzaffar loosed his bonds and as the others saw him free they said Allah grant our deliverance may be at thy hands O Abu al Muzaffar But he replied Know that he who delivered me by leave of Allah Almighty was none other than this monkey And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Second Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Abu al Muzaffar declared None loosed me by leave of Allah Al mighty save this monkey and I buy my release of him at a thousand dinars whereupon the merchants rejoined And we likewise each and every will pay him a thousand dinars if he release us With this the ape arose and went up to them and loosed their bonds one by one till he had freed them all when they made for the vessel and boarding her found all safe and nothing missing from her So they cast off and set sail and presently Abu al Muzaffar said to them O merchants fulfil your promise to the monkey We hear and we obey answered they and each one paid him one thousand dinars whilst Abu al Muzaffar brought out to him the like sum of his own monies so that a great heap of coin was collected for the ape Then they fared on till they reached Bassorah city where their friends came out to meet them and when they had landed the Shaykh said Where is Abu Mohammed Lazybones The news reached my mother who came to me as I lay asleep and said to me O my son verily the Shaykh Abu al Muzaffar hath come back and is now in the city so rise and go thou to him and salute him and enquire what he hath brought thee it may be Allah Almighty have opened to thee the door of fortune with somewhat Quoth I Lift me from the ground and prop me up whilst I go forth and walk to the river bank After which I went out and walked on stumbling over my skirts till I met the Shaykh who exclaimed at sight of me Welcome to him whose money hath been the means of my release and that of these merchants by the will of Almighty Allah Then he continued Take this monkey I bought for thee and carry him home and wait till I come to thee So I took the ape and went off saying in my mind By Allah this is naught but rare merchandise and led it home where I said to my mother Whenever I lie down to sleep thou biddest me rise and trade see now this merchandise with thine own eyes Then I sat me down and as I sat up came the slaves of Abu al Muzaffar and said to me Art thou Abu Mohammed Lazybones Yes answered I and behold Abu al Muzaffar appeared behind them So I rose up to him and kissed his hands and he said Come with me to my home Hearkening and obedience answered I and accompanied him to his house where he bade his servants bring me what money the monkey had earned for me So they brought it and he said to me O my son Allah hath blessed thee with this wealth by way of profit on thy five dirhams Then the slaves set down the treasure in chests which they had carried on their heads and Abu al Muzaffar gave me the keys saying Go before the slaves to thy house for in sooth all this wealth is thine So I returned to my mother who rejoiced in this and said to me O my son Allah hath blessed thee with all these riches so put off thy laziness and go down to the bazar and sell and buy At once I shook off my dull sloth and opened a shop in the bazar where the ape used to sit on the same divan with me eating with me when I ate and drinking when I drank But every day he was absent from dawn till noon when he came back bringing with him a purse of a thousand dinars which he laid by my side and sat down and he ceased not so doing for a great while till I amassed much wealth wherewith O Commander of the Faithful I purchased houses and lands and I planted gardens and I bought me white slaves and negroes and concubines Now it came to pass one day as I sat in my shop with the ape sitting at my side on the same carpet behold he began to turn right and left and I said to myself What aileth the beast Then Allah made the ape speak with a ready tongue and he said to me O Abu Mohammed Now when I heard him speak I was sore afraid but he said to me Fear not I will tell thee my case I am a Marid of the Jinn and came to thee because of thy poor estate but today thou knowest not the amount of thy wealth and now I have need of thee and if thou do my will it shall be well for thee I asked What is it and he answered I have a mind to marry thee to a girl like the full moon Quoth I How so and quoth he Tomorrow don thou thy richest dress and mount thy mule with the saddle of gold and ride to the Haymarket There enquire for the shop of the Sharif FN two hundred thirty four and sit down beside him and say to him I come to thee as a suitor craving thy daughter s hand If he say to thee Thou hast neither cash nor rank nor family pull out a thousand dinars and give them to him and if he ask more give him more and tempt him with money Whereto I replied To hear is to obey I will do thy bidding Inshallah So on the next morning I donned my richest clothes mounted my she mule with trappings of gold and rode to the Haymarket where I asked for the Sharif s shop and finding him there seated alighted and saluted him and seated myself beside him And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Third Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Abu Mohammed Lazybones continued So I alighted and saluting him seated myself beside him and my Mamelukes and negro slaves stood before me Said the Sharif Haply thou hast some business with us which we may have pleasure of transacting Replied I Yes I have business with thee Asked he And what is it and I answered I come to thee as a suitor for thy daughter s hand So he said Thou hast neither cash nor rank nor family whereupon I pulled him out a purse of a thousand dinars red gold and said to him This is my rank FN two hundred thirty five and my family and he whom Allah bless and keep hath said The best of ranks is wealth And how well quoth the poet Whoso two dithams hath his lips have learnt Speech of all kinds with eloquence bedight Draw near FN two hundred thirty six his brethren and crave ear of him And him thou seest haught in pride full height Were t not for dirhams wherein glories he Hadst found him mid man kind in sorry plight When richard errs in words they all reply Sooth thou hast spoken and hast said aright When pauper speaketh truly all reply Thou liest and they hold his sayings light FN two hundred thirty seven Verily dirhams in earth s every stead Clothe men with rank and make them fair to sight Gold is the very tongue of eloquence Gold is the best of arms for might who d fight Now when the Sharif heard these my words and understood my verse he bowed his head awhile groundwards then raising it said If it must be so I will have of thee other three thousand gold pieces I hear and I obey answered I and sent one of my Mamelukes home for the money As soon as he came back with it I handed it to the Sharif who when he saw it in his hands rose and bidding his servants shut his shop invited his brother merchants of the bazar the wedding after which he carried me to his house and wrote out my contract of marriage with his daughter saying to me After ten days I will bring thee to pay her the first visit So I went home rejoicing and shutting myself up with the ape told him what had passed and he said Thou hast done well Now when the time appointed by the Sharif drew near the ape said to me There is a thing I would have thee do for me and thou shalt have of me when it is done whatso thou wilt I asked What is that and he answered At the upper end of the chamber wherein thou shalt meet thy bride the Sharif s daughter stands a cabinet on whose door is a ring padlock of copper and the keys under it Take the keys and open the cabinet in which thou shalt find a coffer of iron with four flags which are talismans at its corners and in its midst stands a brazen basin full of money wherein is tied a white cock with a cleft comb while on one side of the coffer are eleven serpents and on the other a knife Take the knife and slaughter the cock cut away the flags and upset the chest then go back to the bride and do away her maidenhead This is what I have to ask of thee Hearkening and obedience answered I and betook myself to the house of the Sharif So as soon as I entered the bride chamber I looked for the cabinet and found it even as the ape had described it Then I went in unto the bride and marvelled at her beauty and loveliness and stature and symmetrical grace for indeed they were such as no tongue can set forth I rejoiced in her with exceeding joy and in the middle of the night when my bride slept I rose and taking the keys opened the cabinet Then I seized the knife and slew the cock and threw down the flags and upset the coffer whereupon the girl awoke and seeing the closet open and the cock with cut throat exclaimed There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great The Marid hath got hold of me Hardly had she made an end of speaking when the Marid swooped down upon the house and snatching up the bride flew away with her whereupon there arose a mighty clamour and behold in came the Sharif buffetting his face and crying O Abu Mohammed what is this deed thou hast done Is it thus thou requiitest us I made this talisman in the cabinet fearing for my daughter from this accursed one who for these six years hath sought to steal away the girl but could not But now there is no more abiding for thee with us so wend thy ways Thereupon I went forth and returned to my own house where I made search for the ape but could not find him nor any trace of him whereby I knew that it was he who was the Marid and that he had carried off my wife and had tricked me into destroying the talisman and the cock the two things which hindered him from taking her and I repented rending my raiment and cuffing my face And there was no land but was straitened upon me so I made for the desert forthright and ceased not wandering on till night overtook me for I knew not whither I was going And whilst I was deep in sad thought behold I met two serpents one tawny and the other white and they were fighting to kill each other So I took up a stone and with one cast slew the tawny serpent which was the aggressor whereupon the white serpent glided away and was absent for a while but presently she returned accompanied by ten other white serpents which glided up to the dead serpent and tore her in pieces so that only the head was left Then they went their ways and I fell prostrate for weariness on the ground where I stood but as I lay pondering my case lo I heard a Voice though I saw no one and the Voice versified with these two couplets Let Fate with slackened bridle fare her pace Nor pass the night with mind which cares an ace Between eye closing and its opening Allah can foulest change to fairest case Now when I heard this O Commander of the Faithful great concern get hold of me and I was beyond measure troubled and behold I heard a Voice from behind me extemporise these couplets O Moslem thou whose guide is Alcoran Joy in what brought safe peace to thee O man Fear not what Satan haply whispered thee And in us see a Truth believing Then said I I conjure thee by the truth of Him thou wore shippest let me know who thou art Thereupon the Invisible Speaker assumed the form of a man and said Fear not for the report of thy good deed hath reached us and we are a people of the true believing Jinn So if thou lack aught let us know it that we may have the pleasure of fulfilling thy want Quoth I Indeed I am in sore need for I am afflicted with a grievous affliction and no one was ever afflicted as I am Quoth he Perchance thou art Abu Mohammed Lazybones and I replied Yes He rejoined I O Abu Mohammed am the brother of the white serpent whose foe thou slewest we are four brothers by one father and mother and we are all indebted to thee for thy kindness And know thou that he who played this trick on thee in the likeness of an ape is a Marid of the Marids of the Jinn and had he not used this artifice he had never been able to get the girl for he hath loved her and had a mind to take her this long while but he was hindered of that talisman and had it remained as it was he could never have found access to her However fret not thyself for that we will bring thee to her and kill the Marid for thy kindness is not lost upon us Then he cried out with a terrible outcry And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and fourth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Ifrit continued Verily thy kindness is not lost upon us Then he cried out with a terrible outcry in a horrible voice and behold there appeared a troop of the Jinn of whom he enquired concerning the ape and one of them said I know his abiding place and the other asked Where abideth he Said the speaker He is in the City of Brass whereon sun riseth not Then said the first Jinni to me O Abu Mohammed take one of these our slaves and he will carry thee on his back and teach thee how thou shalt get back the girl but know that this slave is a Marid of the Marids and beware whilst he is carrying thee lest thou utter the name of Allah or he will flee from thee and thou wilt fall and be destroyed I hear and obey answered I and chose out one of the slaves who bent down and said to me Mount So I mounted on his back and he flew up with me into the firmament till I lost sight of the earth and saw the stars as they were the mountains of earth fixed and firm FN two hundred thirty eight and heard the angels crying Praise be to Allah in heaven while the Marid held me in converse diverting me and hindering me from pronouncing the name of Almighty Allah FN two hundred thirty nine But as we flew behold One clad in green raiment FN two hundred forty with streaming tresses and radiant face holding in his hand a javelin whence flew sparks of fire accosted me saying O Abu Mohammed say There is no god but the God and Mohammed is the Apostle of God or I will smite thee with this javelin Now already I felt heart broken by my forced silence as regards calling on the name of Allah so I said There is no god but the God and Mohammed is the Apostle of God Whereupon the shining One smote the Marid with his javelin and he melted away and became ashes whilst I was thrown from his back and fell headlong towards the earth till I dropped into the midst of a dashing sea swollen with clashing surge And behold I fell hard by a ship with five sailors therein who seeing me made for me and took me up into the vessel and they began to speak to me in some speech I knew not but I signed to them that I understood not their speech So they fared on till the last of the day when they cast out a net and caught a great fish and they broiled it and gave me to eat after which they ceased not sailing on till they reached their city and carried me to their King and set me in his presence So I kissed ground before him and he bestowed on me a dress of honour and said to me in Arabic which he knew well I appoint thee one of my officers Thereupon I asked him the name of the city and he replied It is called Hanad FN two hundred forty one and is in the land of China Then he committed me to his Wazir bidding him show me the city which was formerly peopled by Infidels till Almighty Allah turned them into stones and there I abode a month s space diverting myself with viewing the place nor saw I ever greater plenty of trees and fruits than there And when this time had past one day as I sat on the bank of a river behold there accosted me a horseman who said to me Art thou not Abu Mohammed Lazybones Yes answered I whereupon he said Fear not for the report of thy good deed hath reached us Asked I Who art thou and he answered I am a brother of the white serpent and thou art hard by the place where is the damsel whom thou seekest So saying he took off his clothes and clad me therein saying Fear not for the slave who perished under thee was one of our slaves Then the horseman took me up behind him and rode on with me to a desert place when he said Dismount now and walk on between these two mountains till thou seest the City of Brass FN two hundred forty two then halt afar off and enter it not ere I return to thee and tell thee how thou shalt do To hear is to obey replied I and dismounting from behind him walked on till I came to the city the walls whereof I found of brass Then I began to pace round about it hoping to find a gate but found none and presently as I persevered behold the serpent s brother rejoined me and gave me a charmed sword which should hinder any from seeing me FN two hundred forty three then went his way Now he had been gone but a little while when lo I heard a noise of cries and found myself in the midst of a multitude of folk whose eyes were in their breasts and seeing me quoth they Who art thou and what cast thee into this place So I told them my story and they said The girl thou seekest is in this city with the Marid but we know not what he hath done with her Now we are brethren of the white serpent adding Go thou to yonder spring and note where the water entereth and enter thou with it for it will bring thee into the city I did as they bade me and followed the water course till it brought me to a Sardab a vaulted room under the earth from which I ascended and found myself in the midst of the city Here I saw the damsel seated upon a throne of gold under a canopy of brocade girt round by a garden full of trees of gold whose fruits were jewels of price such as rubies and chrysolites pearls and coral And the moment she saw me she knew me and accosted me with the Moslem salutation saying O my lord who guided thee hither So I told her all that had passed and she said Know that the accursed Marid of the greatness of his love for me hath told me what bringeth him bane and what bringeth him gain and that there is here a talisman by means whereof he could an he would destroy the city and all that are therein and whoso possesseth it the Ifrits will do his commandment in everything It standeth upon a pillar Whereat I asked her And where is the pillar and she answered It is in such a place And what manner of thing may the talisman be said I said she It is in the semblance of a vulture FN two hundred forty four and upon it is a writing which I cannot read So go thou thither and seize it and set it before thee and taking a chafing dish throw into it a little musk whereupon there will arise a smoke which will draw the Ifrits to thee and they will all present themselves before thee nor shall one be absent also they shall be subject to thy word and whatsoever thou biddest them that will they do Arise therefore and fall to this thing with the blessing of Almighty Allah I answered Hearkening and obedience and going to the column did as she bade me where upon the Ifrits all presented themselves before me saying Here are we O our lord Whatsoever thou biddest us that will we do Quoth I Bind the Marid who brought the damsel hither from her home Quoth they We hear and obey and off they flew and bound that Marid in straitest bonds and returned after a while saying We have done thy bidding Then I dismissed them and repairing to my wife told her what had happened and said to her O my bride wilt thou go with me Yes answered she So I carried her forth of the vaulted chamber whereby I had entered the city and we fared on till we fell in with the folk who had shown me the way to find her And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Fifth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that he continued on this wise And we fared on till we fell in with the folk who had shown me the way to her So I said to them Point me out a path which shall lead me to my home and they did accordingly and brought us a foot to the sea shore and set us aboard a vessel which sailed on before us with a fair wind till we reached Bassorah city And when we entered the house of my father in law and her people saw my wife they rejoiced with exceeding joy Then I fumigated the vulture with musk and lo the Ifrits flocked to me from all sides saying At thy service what wilt thou have us do So I bade them transport all that was in the City of Brass of monies and noble metals and stones of price to my house in Bassorah which they did and I then ordered them to bring me the ape They brought him before me abject and contemptible and I said to him O accursed why hast thou dealt thus perfidiously with me Then I com mended the Ifrits to shut him in a brazen vessel FN two hundred forty five so they put him in a brazen cucurbite and sealed it with lead But I abode with my wife in joy and delight and now O Commander of the Faithful I have under my hand precious things in such measure and rare jewels and other treasure and monies on such wise as neither reckoning may express nor may limits comprise and if thou lust after wealth or aught else I will command the Jinn at once to do thy desire But all this is of the bounty of Almighty Allah Thereupon the Commander of the Faithful wondered greatly and bestowed on him imperial gifts in exchange for his presents and entreated him with the favour he deserved And men also tell the tale of the GENEROUS DEALING OF YAHYA BIN KHALID THE BARMECIDE WITH MANSUR It is told that Harun al Rashid in the days before he became jealous of the Barmecides sent once for one of his guards Salih by name and said to him O Salih go to Mansur FN two hundred forty six and say to him Thou owest us a thousand thousand dirhams and we require of thee immediate payment of this amount And I command thee O Salih unless he pay it between this hour and sundown sever his head from his body and bring it to me To hear is to obey answered Salih and going to Mansur acquainted him with what the Caliph had said whereupon quoth he I am a lost man by Allah for all my estate and all my hand owneth if sold for their utmost value would not fetch a price of more than an hundred thousand dirhams Whence then O Salih shall I get the other nine hundred thousand Salih replied Contrive how thou mayst speedily acquit thyself else thou art a dead man for I cannot grant thee an eye twinkling of delay after the time appointed me by the Caliph nor can I fail of aught which the Prince of True Believers hath enjoined on me Hasten therefore to devise some means of saving thyself ere the time expire Quoth Mansur O Salih I beg thee of thy favour to bring me to my house that I may take leave of my children and family and give my kinsfolk my last injunctions Now Salih relateth So I went with him to his house where he fell to bidding his family farewell and the house was filled with a clamour of weeping and lamentations and calling for help on Almighty Allah Thereupon I said to him I have bethought me that Allah may haply vouchsafe thee relief at the hands of the Barmecides Come let us go to the house of Yahya bin Khalid So we went to Yahya s house and Mansur told him his case whereat he was sore concerned and bowed him groundwards for a while then raising his head he called his treasurer and said to him How much have we in our treasury A matter of five thousand dirhams answered the treasurer and Yahya bade him bring them and sent a messenger to his son Al Fazl saying I am offered for sale a splendid estate which may never be laid waste so send me somewhat of money Al Fazl sent him a thousand thousand dirhams and he despatched a mes senger with a like message to his son Ja afar saying We have a matter of much moment and for it we want money whereupon Ja afar at once sent him a thousand thousand dirhams nor did Yahya leave sending to his kinsmen of the Barmecides till he had collected from them a great sum of money for Mansur But Salih and the debtor knew not of this and Mansur said to Yahya O my lord I have laid hold upon thy skirt for I know not whither to look for the money but to thee in accordance with thy wonted generosity so discharge thou the rest of my debt for me and make me thy freed slave Thereupon Yahya hung down his head and wept then he said to a page Harkye boy the Commander of the Faithful gave our slave girl Dananir a jewel of great price go thou to her and bid her send it to us The page went out and presently returned with the jewel whereupon quoth Yahya O Mansur I bought this jewel of the merchant for the Commander of the Faithful at a price of two hundred thousand dinars FN two hundred forty seven and he gave it to our slave girl Dananir the lute player and when he sees it with thee he will know it and spare thy blood and do thee honour for our sake and now O Mansur verily thy money is complete Salih continued So I took the money and the jewel and carried them to al Rashid together with Mansur but on the way I heard him repeat this couplet applying it to his own case Twas not of love that fared my feet to them Twas that I feared me lest they shoot their shafts Now when I heard this I marvelled at his evil nature and his depravity and mischief making and his ignoble birth and provenance and turning upon him I said There is none on the face of the earth better or more righteous than the Barmecides nor any baser nor more wrongous than thou for they bought thee off from death and delivered thee from destruction giving thee what should save thee yet thou thankest them not nor praises them neither acquittest thee after the manner of the noble nay thou meetest their benevolence with this speech Then I went to Al Rashid and acquainted him with all that had passed And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Sixth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Salih con tinued So I acquainted the Commander of the Faithful with all that passed and Al Rashid marvelled at the generosity and benevolence of Yahya and the vileness and ingratitude of Mansur and bade restore the jewel to Yahya saying Whatso we have given it befitteth us not to take again After that Salih returned to Yahya and acquainted him with the tale of Mansur and his ill conduct whereupon replied he O Salih when a man is in want sick at heart and sad of thought he is not to be blamed for aught that falleth from him for it cometh not from the heart and on this wise he took to seeking excuse for Mansur But Salih wept and exclaimed Never shall the revolving heavens bring forth into being the like of thee O Yahya Alas and well away that one of such noble nature and generosity should be laid in the dust And he repeated these two couplets Haste to do kindness thou cost intend Thou canst not always on boons expend How many from bounty themselves withheld Till means of bounty had come to end And men tell another tale of the GENEROUS DEALING OF YAHYA SON OF KHALID WITH A MAN WHO FORGED A LETTER IN HIS NAME There was between Yahya bin Khalid and Abdullah bin Malik al Khuza i FN two hundred forty eight an enmity which they kept secret the reason of the hatred being that Harun al Rashid loved Abdullah with exceeding love so that Yahya and his sons were wont to say that he had bewitched the Commander of the Faithful And thus they abode a long while with rancour in their hearts till it fell out that the Caliph invested Abdullah with the government of Armenia FN two hundred forty nine and despatched him thither Now soon after he had settled himself in his seat of government there came to him one of the people of Irak a man of good breeding and excellent parts and abundant cleverness but he had lost his money and wasted his wealth and his estate was come to ill case so he forged a letter to Abdullah bin Malik in the name of Yahya bin Khalid and set out therewith for Armenia Now when he came to the Governor s gate he gave the letter to one of the Chamberlains who took it and carried it to his master Abdullah opened it and read it and considering it attentively knew it to be forged so he sent for the man who presented himself before him and called down blessings upon him and praised him and those of his court Quoth Abdullah to him What moved thee to weary thyself on this wise and bring me a forged letter But be of good heart for we will not disappoint thy travail Replied the other Allah prolong the life of our lord the Wazir If my coming annoy thee cast not about for a pretext to repel me for Allah s earth is wide and He who giveth daily bread still liveth Indeed the letter I bring thee from Yahya bin Khalid is true and no forgery Quoth Abdullah I will write a letter to my agent FN two hundred fifty at Baghdad and command him enquire concerning this same letter If it be true as thou sayest and genuine and not forged by thee I will bestow on thee the Emirship of one of my cities or if thou prefer a present I will give thee two hundred thousand dirhams besides horses and camels of price and a robe of honour But if the letter prove a forgery I will order thou be beaten with two hundred blows of a stick and thy beard be shaven So Abdullah bade confine him in a chamber and furnish him therein with all he needed till his case should be made manifest Then he despatched a letter to his agent at Baghdad to the following effect There is come to me a man with a letter purporting to be from Yahya bin Khalid Now I have my suspicions of this letter therefore delay thou not in the matter but go thyself and look carefully into the case and let me have an answer with all speed in order that we may know what is true and what is untrue When the letter reached Baghdad the agent mounted at once And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Seventh Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the agent of Abdullah son of Malik al Khuza i on receipt of the letter at Baghdad mounted at once and repaired to the house of Yahya bin Khalid whom he found sitting with his officers and boon companions After the usual salute he gave him the letter and Yahya read it and said to the agent Come back to me tomorrow for my written answer Now when the agent had gone away Yahya turned to his companions and said What doth he deserve who forgeth a letter in my name and carrieth it to my foe They answered all and each saying this and that and every one proposing some kind of punishment but Yahya said Ye err in that ye say and this your counsel is of the baseness of your spirits and the meanness of your minds Ye all know the close favour of Abdullah with the Caliph and ye weet of what is between him and us of anger and enmity and now Almighty Allah hath made this man the means of reconciliation between us and hath fitted him for such purpose and hath appointed him to quench the fire of ire in our hearts which hath been growing these twenty years and by his means our differences shall be adjusted Wherefore it behoveth me to requite such man by verifying his assertion and amending his estate so I will write him a letter to Abdullah son of Malik praying that he may use him with increase of honour and continue to him his liberality Now when his companions heard what he said they called down blessings on him and marvelled at his generosity and the greatness of his magnanimity Then he called for paper and ink and wrote Abdullah a letter in his own hand to the following effect In the name of Allah the Compassionating the Compassionate Of a truth thy letter hath reached me Allah give thee long life and I am glad to hear of thy safety and am pleased to be assured of thine immunity and prosperity It was thy thought that a certain worthy man had forged a letter in my name and that he was not the bearer of any message from the same but the case is not so for the letter I myself wrote and it was no forgery and I hope of thy courtesy and consideration and the nobility of thy nature that thou wilt gratify this generous and excellent man of his hope and wish and honour him with the honour he deserveth and bring him to his desire and make him the special object of thy favour and munificence Whatso thou dost with him it is to me that thou dost the kindness and I am thankful to thee accordingly Then he superscribed the letter and after sealing it delivered it to the agent who despatched it to Abdullah Now when the Governor read it he was charmed with its contents and sending for the man said to him Whichever of the two promised boons is the more acceptable to thee that will I give thee The man replied The money gift were more acceptable to me than aught else whereupon Abdullah ordered him two hundred thousand dirhams and ten Arab horses five with housings of silk and other five with richly ornamented saddles used in state processions besides twenty chests of clothes and ten mounted white slaves and a proportionate quantity of jewels of price Moreover he bestowed on him a dress of honour and sent him to Baghdad in great splendour So when he came thither he repaired to the door of Yahya s house before he went to his own folk and craved permission to enter and have audience The Chamberlain went in to Yahya and said to him O my lord there is one at the door who craveth speech of thee and he is a man of apparent wealth courteous in manner comely of aspect and attended by many servants Then Yahya bade admit him and when he entered and kissed the ground before him Yahya asked him Who art thou He answered Hear me O my lord I am he who was done dead by the tyranny of fortune but thou didst raise me to life again from the grave of calamities and exalt me to the paradise of my desires I am the man who forged a letter in thy name and carried it to Abdullah bin Malik al Khuza i Yahya asked How hath he dealt with thee and what did he give thee and the man answered He hath given me thanks to thy hand and thy great liberality and benevolence and to thy comprehensive kindness and lofty magnanimity and thine all embracing generosity that which hath made me a wealthy man and he hath distinguished me with his gifts and favours And now I have brought all that he gave me and here it is at thy door for it is thine to decide and the command is in thy hand Rejoined Yahya Thou hast done me better service than I did thee and I owe thee a heavy debt of gratitude and every gift the white hand FN two hundred fifty one can give for that thou hast changed into love and amity the hate and enmity that were between me and a man whom I respect and esteem Wherefore I will give thee the like of what Abdullah bin Malik gave thee Then he ordered him money and horses and chests of apparel such as Abdullah had given him and thus that man s fortune was restored to him by the munificence of these two generous ones And folk also relate the tale of the CALIPH AL MAAMUN AND THE STRANGE SCHOLAR It is said of Al Maamun that among the Caliphs of the house of Abbas there was none more accomplished in all branches of knowledge than he Now on two days in each week he was wont to preside at conferences of the learned when the lawyers and theologians disputed in his presence each sitting in his several rank and room One day as he sat thus there came into the assembly a stranger clad in ragged white clothes who took seat in an obscure place behind the doctors of the law Then the assembly began to speak and debate difficult questions it being the custom that the various propositions should be submitted to each in turn and that whoso bethought him of some subtle addition or rare conceit should make mention of it So the question went round till it came to the strange man who spake in his turn and made a goodlier answer than any of the doctors replies and the Caliph approved his speech And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Eighth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Caliph Al Maamun approved his speech and ordered him to come up from his low place to a high stead Now when the second question came to him he made a still more notable answer and Al Maamun ordered him to be preferred to a yet higher seat and when the third question reached him he made answer more justly and appropriately than on the two previous occasions and Al Maamun bade him come up and sit near himself Presently the discussion ended when water was brought and they washed their hands after which food was set on and they ate and the doctors arose and withdrew but Al Maamun forbade the stranger to depart with them and calling him to himself treated him with especial favour and promised him honour and profit Thereupon they made ready the seance of wassail the fair faced cup companions came and the pure wine FN two hundred fifty two went round amongst them till the cup came to the stranger who rose to his feet and spake thus If the Commander of the Faithful permit me I will say one word Answered the Caliph Say what thou wilt Quoth the man Verily the Exalted Intelligence whose eminence Allah increase knoweth that his slave was this day in the august assembly one of the unknown folk and of the meanest of the company and the Commander of the Faithful raised his rank and brought him near to himself little as were the wit and wisdom he displayed preferring him above the rest and advancing him to a station and a degree where to his thought aspired not But now he is minded to part him from that small portion of intellect which raised him high from his lowness and made him great after his littleness Heaven forfend and forbid that the Commander of the Faithful should envy his slave what little he hath of understanding and worth and renown Now if his slave should drink wine his reason would depart far from him and ignorance draw near to him and steal away his good breeding so would he revert to that low and contemptible degree whence he sprang and become ridiculous and despicable in the eyes of the folk I hope therefore that the August Intelligence of his power and bounty and royal generosity and magnanimity will not despoil his slave of this jewel When the Caliph Al Maamun heard his speech he praised him and thanked him and making him sit down again in his place showed him high honour and ordered him a present of an hundred thousand silver pieces Moreover he mounted him upon a horse and gave him rich apparel and in every assembly he was wont to exalt him and show him favour over all the other doctors of law and religion till he became the highest of them all in rank And Allah is All knowing FN two hundred fifty three Men also tell a tale of ALI SHAR FN two hundred fifty four AND ZUMURRUD There lived once in the days of yore and the good old times long gone before in the land of Khorasan a merchant called Majd al Din who had great wealth and many slaves and servants white and black young and old but he had not been blessed with a child until he reached the age of threescore when Almighty Allah vouchsafed him a son whom he named Ali Shar The boy grew up like the moon on the night of fulness and when he came to man s estate and was endowed with all kinds of perfections his father fell sick of a death malady and calling his son to him said O my son the fated hour of my decease is at hand and I desire to give thee my last injunctions He asked And what are they O my father and he answered O my son I charge thee be not over familiar with any FN two hundred fifty five and eschew what leadeth to evil and mischief Beware lest thou sit in company with the wicked for he is like the blacksmith if his fire burn thee not his smoke shall bother thee and how excellent is the saying of the poet FN two hundred fifty six In thy whole world there is not one Whose friendship thou may saint count upon Nor plighted faith that will stand true When times go hard and hopes are few Then live apart and dwell alone Nor make a prop of any one I ve given a gift in that I ve said Will stand thy friend in every stead And what another saith Men are a hidden malady Rely not on the sham in them For perfidy and treachery Thou lieutenant find if thou examine them And yet a third saith Converse with men hath scanty weal except To while away the time in chat and prate Then shun their intimacy save it be To win thee lore or better thine estate And a fourth saith If a sharp witted wight e er tried mankind I ve eaten that which only tasted he FN two hundred fifty seven Their amity proved naught but wile and guile Their faith I found was but hypocrisy Quoth Ali O my father I have heard thee and I will obey thee what more shall I do Quoth he Do good whereas thou art able be ever kind and courteous to men and regard as riches every occasion of doing a good turn for a design is not always easily carried out and how well saith the poet Tis not at every time and tide unstable We can do kindly acts and charitable When thou art able hasten thee to act Lest thine endeavour prove anon unable Said Ali I have heard thee and I will obey thee And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Ninth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the youth replied I have heard thee and I will obey thee what more And his sire continued Be thou O my son mindful of Allah so shall He be mindful of thee Ward thy wealth and waste it not for an thou do thou wilt come to want the least of mankind Know that the measure of a man s worth is according to that which his right hand hendeth and how well saith the poet FN two hundred fifty eight When fails my wealth no friend will deign befriend And when it waxeth all men friendship show How many a foe for wealth became my friend Wealth lost how many a friend became a foe Asked Ali What more And Majd al Din answered O my son take counsel of those who are older than thou and hasten not to do thy heart s desire Have compassion on those who are below thee so shall those who are above thee have compassion on thee and oppress none lest Allah empower one who shall oppress thee How well saith the poet Add other wit to thy wit counsel craving For man s true course hides not from minds of two Man is a mirror which but shows his face And by two mirrors he his back shall view And as saith another FN two hundred fifty nine Act on sure grounds nor hurry fast To gain the purpose that thou hast And be thou kindly to all men So kindly thou lieutenant be called again For not a deed the hand can try Save neath the hand of God on high Nor tyrant harsh work tyranny Uncrushed by tyrant harsh as he And as saith yet another FN two hundred sixty Tyrannize not if thou hast the power to do so for the tyrannical is in danger of revenges Thine eye will sleep while the oppressed wakeful will call down curses on thee and God s eye sleepeth not Beware of wine bibbing for drink is the root of all evil it doeth away the reason and bringeth to contempt whoso useth it and how well saith the poet By Allah wine shall not disturb me while my soul Join body nor while speech the words of me explain No day will I be thralled to wine skin cooled by breeze FN two hundred sixty one Nor choose a friend save those who are of cups unfair This then is my charge to thee bear it before thine eyes and Allah stand to thee in my stead Then he swooned away and kept silent awhile and when he came to himself he besought pardon of Allah and pronounced the profession of the Faith and was admitted to the mercy of the Almighty So his son wept and lamented for him and presently made proper preparation for his burial great and small walked in his funeral procession and Koran readers recited Holy Writ about his bier nor did Ali Shar omit aught of what was due to the dead Then they prayed over him and committed him to the dust and wrote these two couplets upon his tomb Thou west create of dust and cam saint to life And learned saint in eloquence to place thy trust Anon to dust returning thou becamest A corpse as though ne er taken from the dust Now his son Ali Shar grieved for him with sore grief and mourned him with the ceremonies usual among men of note nor did he cease to weep the loss of his father till his mother died also not long afterwards when he did with her as he had done with his sire Then he sat in the shop selling and buying and consorting with none of Almighty Allah s creatures in accordance with his father s injunction This wise he continued to do for a year at the end of which time there came in to him by craft certain whoreson fellows and consorted with him till he turned after their example to lewdness and swerved from the way of righteousness drinking wine in flowing bowls and frequenting fair women night and day for he said to himself Of a truth my father amassed this wealth for me and if I spend it not to whom shall I leave it By Allah I will not do save as saith the poet An through the whole of life Thou gett saint and gain saint for self Say when shalt thou enjoy Thy gains and gotten pelf And Ali Shar ceased not to waste his wealth all whiles of the day and all watches of the night till he had made away with the whole of his riches and abode in pauper case and troubled at heart So he sold his shop and lands and so forth and after this he sold the clothes off his body leaving himself but one suit and as drunkenness quitted him and thoughtfulness came to him he fell into grief and sore care One day when he had sat from day break to mid afternoon without breaking his fast he said in his mind I will go round to those on whom I spent my monies perchance one of them will feed me this day So he went the round of them all but as often as he knocked at any one s door of them the man denied himself and hid from him till his stomach ached with hunger Then he betook himself to the bazar of the merchants And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Tenth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Ali Shar feeling his stomach ache with hunger betook himself to the merchants bazar where he found a crowd of people assembled in ring and said to himself I wonder what causeth these folk to crowd together thus By Allah I will not budge hence till I see what is within yonder ring So he made his way into the ring and found therein a damsel exposed for sale who was five feet tall FN two hundred sixty two beautifully proportioned rosy of cheek and high of breast and who surpassed all the people of her time in beauty and loveliness and elegance and grace even as saith one describing her As she willed she was made and in such a way that when She was cast in Nature s mould neither short nor long was she Beauty woke to fall in love with the beauties of her form Where combine with all her coyness her pride and pudency The full moon is her face FN two hundred sixty three and the branchlet is her shape And the musk pod is her scent what like her can there be Tis as though she were moulded from water of the pearl And in every lovely limblet another moon we see And her name was Zumurrud the Smaragdine So when Ali Shar saw her he marvelled at her beauty and grace and said By Allah I will not stir hence till I see how much this girl fetcheth and know who buyeth her So he took standing place amongst the merchants and they thought he had a mind to buy her knowing the wealth he had inherited from his parents Then the broker stood at the damsel s head and said Ho merchants Ho ye men of money Who will open the gate of biddings for this damsel the mistress of moons the union pearl Zumurrud the curtain maker the sought of the seeker and the delight of the desirous Open the biddings door and on the opener be nor blame nor reproach for evermore Thereupon quoth one merchant Mine for five hundred dinars And ten quoth another Six hundred cried an old man named Rashid al Din blue of eye FN two hundred sixty four and foul of face And ten cried another I bid a thousand rejoined Rashid al Din whereupon the rival merchants were tongue tied and held their peace and the broker took counsel with the girl s owner who said I have sworn not to sell her save to whom she shall choose so consult her Thereupon the broker went up to Zumurrud and said to her O mistress of moons this merchant hath a mind to buy thee She looked at Rashid al Din and finding him as we have said replied I will not be sold to a gray beard whom decrepitude hath brought to such evil plight Allah inspired his saying who saith I craved of her a kiss one day but soon as she beheld My hoary hairs though I my luxuries and wealth display d She proudly turned away from me showed shoulders cried aloud No no by Him whose hest mankind from nothingness hath made For hoary head and grizzled chin I ve no especial love What stuff my mouth with cotton FN two hundred sixty five ere in sepulchre I m laid Now when the broker heard her words he said By Allah thou art excusable and thy price is ten thousand gold pieces So he told her owner that she would not accept of old man Rashid al Din and he said Consult her concerning another Thereupon a second man came forward and said Be she mine for what price was offered by the oldster she would have none of but she looked at him and seeing that his beard was dyed said What be this fashion lewd and base and the blackening of the hoary face And she made a great show of wonderment and repeated these couplets Showed me Sir Such an one a sight and what a frightful sight A neck by Allah only made for slipper sole to smite FN two hundred sixty six A beard the meetest racing ground where gnats and lice contend A brow fit only for the ropes thy temples chafe and bite FN two hundred sixty seven O thou enravish by my cheek and beauties of my form Why so translate thyself to youth and think I deem it right Dyeing disgracefully that white of reverend aged hairs And hiding for foul purposes their venerable white Thou goest with one beard and comest back with quite another Like Punch and Judy man who works the Chinese shades by night FN two hundred sixty eight And how well saith another Quoth she I see thee dye thy hoariness FN two hundred sixty nine To hide O ears and eyes from thee quoth I She roared with laugh and said Right funny this Thou art so lying e en Now when the broker heard her verse he exclaimed By Allah thou hast spoken sooth The merchant asked what she said so the broker repeated the verses to him and he knew that she was in the right while he was wrong and desisted from buying her Then another came forward and said Ask her if she will be mine at the same price but when he did so she looked at him and seeing that he had but one eye said This man is one eyed and it is of such as he that the poet saith FN two hundred seventy Consort not with the Cyclops e en a day Beware his falsehood and his mischief fly Had this monocular a jot of good Allah had ne er brought blindness to his eye Then said the broker pointing to another bidder Wilt thou be sold to this man She looked at him and seeing that he was short of stature FN two hundred seventy one and had a beard that reached to his navel cried This is he of whom the poet speaketh I have a friend who hath a beard Allah to useless length unroll d Tis like a certain FN two hundred seventy two winter night Longsome and darksome drear and cold Said the broker O my lady look who pleaseth thee of these that are present and point him out that I may sell thee to him So she looked round the ring of merchants examining one by one their physiognomies till her glance fell on Ali Shar And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Eleventh Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the girl s glance fell on Ali Shar she cast at him a look with longing eyes which cost her a thousand sighs and her heart was taken with him for that he was of favour passing fair and pleasanter than zephyr or northern air and she said O broker I will be sold to none but to this my lord owner of the handsome face and slender form whom the poet thus describeth Displaying that fair face The tempted they assailed Who had they wished me safe That lovely face had veiled For none shall own me but he because his cheek is smooth and the water of his mouth sweet as Salsabil FN two hundred seventy three his spittle is a cure for the sick and his charms daze and dazzle poet and proser even as saith one of him His honey dew of lips is wine his breath Musk and those teeth smile shown are camphor s hue Rizwan FN two hundred seventy four hath turned him out o doors for fear The Houris lapse from virtue at the view Men blame his bearing for its pride but when In pride the full moon sails excuse is due Lord of the curling locks and rose red cheeks and ravishing look of whom saith the poet The fawn like one a meeting promised me And eye expectant waxed and heart unstirred His eyelids bade me hold his word as true But in their languish FN two hundred seventy five can he keep his word And as saith another Quoth they Black letters on his cheek are writ How canst thou love him and a side beard see Quoth I Cease blame and cut your chiding short If those be letters tis a forgery Gather his charms all growths of Eden garth Whereto those Kausar FN two hundred seventy six lips bear testimony When the broker heard the verses she repeated on the charms of Ali Shar he marvelled at her eloquence no less than at the brightness of her beauty but her owner said to him Marvel not at her splendour which shameth the noonday sun nor that her memory is stored with the choicest verses of the poets for besides this she can repeat the glorious Koran according to the seven readings FN two hundred seventy seven and the august Traditions after ascription and authentic transmission and she writeth the seven modes of handwriting FN two hundred seventy eight and she knoweth more learning and knowledge than the most learned Moreover her hands are better than gold and silver for she maketh silken curtains and selleth them for fifty gold pieces each and it taketh her but eight days to make a curtain Exclaimed the broker O happy the man who hath her in his house and maketh her of his choicest treasures and her owner said to him Sell her to whom she will So the broker went up to Ali Shar and kissing his hands said to him O my lord buy thou this damsel for she hath made choice of thee FN two hundred seventy nine Then he set forth to him all her charms and accomplishments and added I give thee joy if thou buy her for this be a gift from Him who is no niggard of His giving Whereupon Ali bowed his head groundwards awhile laughing at himself and secretly saying Up to this hour I have not broken my fast yet I am ashamed before the merchants to own that I have no money wherewith to buy her The damsel seeing him hang down his head said to the broker Take my hand and lead me to him that I may show my beauty to him and tempt him to buy me for I will not be sold to any but to him So the broker took her hand and stationed her before Ali Shar saying What is thy good pleasure O my lord But he made him no answer and the girl said to him O my lord and darling of my heart what aileth thee that thou wilt not bid for me Buy me for what thou wilt and I will bring thee good fortune So he raised his eyes to her and said Is buying perforce Thou art dear at a thousand dinars Said she Then buy me O my lord for nine hundred He cried No and she rejoined Then for eight hundred and though he again said Nay she ceased not to abate the price till she came to an hundred dinars Quoth he I have not by me a full hundred So she laughed and asked How much dost thou lack of an hundred He answered By Allah I have neither an hundred dinars nor any other sum for I own neither white coin nor red cash neither dinar nor dirham So look out thou for another and a better customer And when she knew that he had nothing she said to him Take me by the hand and carry me aside into a by lane as if thou wouldst examine me privily He did so and she drew from her bosom a purse containing a thousand dinars which she gave him saying Pay down nine hundred to my price and let the hundred remain with thee by way of provision He did as she bid him and buying her for nine hundred dinars paid down the price from her own purse and carried her to his house When she entered it she found a dreary desolate saloon without carpets or vessels so she gave him other thousand dinars saying Go to the bazar and buy three hundred dinars worth of furniture and vessels for the house and three dinars worth of meat and drink And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Twelfth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that quoth the slave girl Bring us meat and drink for three dinars furthermore a piece of silk the size of a curtain and bring golden and silvern thread and sewing silk of seven colours Thus he did and she furnished the house and they sat down to eat and drink after which they went to bed and took their pleasure one of the other And they lay the night embraced behind the curtain and were even as saith the poet FN two hundred eighty Cleave fast to her thou lovestand let the envious rail amain For calumny and envy ne er to favour love were fain Lo whilst I slept in dreams I saw thee lying by my side And from thy lips the sweetest sure of limpid springs did drain Yea true and certain all I saw is as I will avouch And spite the envier thereto I surely will attain There is no goodlier sight indeed for eyes to look upon Than when one couch in its embrace enfoldeth lovers twain Each to the other s bosom clasped clad in their twinned delight Whilst hand with hand and arm with arm about their necks enchain Lo when two hearts are straitly knit in passion and desire But on cold iron smite the folk who chide at them in vain Thou that for loving censurest the votaries of love Canst thou assain a heart diseased or heal a cankered brain If in thy time thou kind but one to love thee and be true I rede thee cast the world away and with that one remain So they lay together till the morning and love for the other waxed firmly fixed in the heart of each And on rising Zumurrud took the curtain and embroidered it with coloured silks and purpled it with silver and gold thread and she added thereto a border depicting round about it all manner of birds and beasts nor is there in the world a feral but she wrought his semblance This she worked in eight days till she had made an end of it when she trimmed it and glazed and ironed it and gave it to her lord saying Carry it to the bazar and sell it to one of the merchants at fifty dinars but beware lest thou sell it to a passer by as this would cause a separation between me and thee for we have foes who are not unthoughtful of us I hear and I obey answered he and repairing to the bazar sold the curtain to a merchant as she bade him after which he bought a piece of silk for another curtain and gold and silver and silken thread as before and what they needed of food and brought all this to her giving her the rest of the money Now every eight days she made a curtain which he sold for fifty dinars and on this wise passed a whole year At the end of that time he went as usual to the bazar with a curtain which he gave to the broker and there came up to him a Nazarene who bid him sixty dinars for it but he refused and the Christian continued bidding higher and higher till he came to an hundred dinars and bribed the broker with ten ducats So the man returned to Ali Shar and told him of the proffered price and urged him to accept the offer and sell the article at the Nazarene s valuation saying O my lord be not afraid of this Christian for that he can do thee no hurt The merchants also were urgent with him so he sold the curtain to the Christian albeit his heart misgave him and taking the money set off to return home Presently as he walked he found the Christian walking behind him so he said to him O Nazarene FN two hundred eighty one why dost thou follow in my footsteps Answered the other O my lord I want a something at the end of the street Allah never bring thee to want but Ali Shar had barely reached his place before the Christian overtook him so he said to him O accursed what aileth thee to follow me wherever I go Replied the other O my lord give me a draught of water for I am athirst and with Allah be thy reward FN two hundred eighty two Quoth Ali Shar to himself Verily this man is an Infidel who payeth tribute and claimeth our protection FN two hundred eighty three and he asketh me for a draught of water by Allah I will not baulk him And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Thirteenth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that quoth Ali Shar to himself This man is a tributary Unbeliever and he asked me for a draught of water by Allah I will not baulk him So he entered the house and took a gugglet of water but the slave girl Zumurrud saw him and said to him O my love hast thou sold the curtain He replied Yes and she asked To a merchant or to a passer by for my heart presageth a parting And he answered To whom but to a merchant Thereupon she rejoined Tell me the truth of the case that I may order my affair and why take the gugglet of water And he To give the broker to drink upon which she exclaimed There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great and she repeated these two couplets FN two hundred eighty four O thou who seekest separation act leisurely and let not the embrace of the beloved deceive thee Act leisurely for the nature of fortune is treacherous and the end of every union is disjunction Then he took the gugglet and going out found the Christian within the vestibule and said to him How comest thou here and how darest thou O dog enter my house without my leave Answered he O my lord there is no difference between the door and the vestibule and I never intended to stir hence save to go out and my thanks are due to thee for thy kindness and favour thy bounty and generosity Then he took the mug and emptying it returned it to Ali Shar who received it and waited for him to rise up and to go but he did not move So Ali said to him Why dost thou not rise and wend thy way and he answered O my lord be not of those who do a kindness and then make it a reproach nor of those of whom saith the poet FN two hundred eighty five They re gone who when thou stoodest at their door Would for thy wants so generously cater But stand at door of churls who followed them They d make high favour of a draught of water And he continued O my lord I have drunk and now I would have thee give me to eat of whatever is in the house though it be but a bit of bread or a biscuit with an onion Replied Ali Shar Begone without more chaffer and chatter there is nothing in the house He persisted O my lord if there be nothing in the house take these hundred dinars and bring us something from the market if but a single scone that bread and salt may pass between us FN two hundred eighty six With this quoth Ali Shar to himself This Christian is surely mad I will take his hundred dinars and bring him somewhat worth a couple of dirhams and laugh at him And the Nazarene added O my lord I want but a small matter to stay my hunger were it but a dry scone and an onion for the best food is that which doeth away appetite not rich viands and how well saith the poet Hunger is sated with a bone dry scone How is it then FN two hundred eighty seven in woes of want I wone Death is all justest lacking aught regard For Caliph king and beggar woe begone Then quoth Ali Shar Wait here while I lock the saloon and fetch thee somewhat from the market and quoth the Christian To hear is to obey So Ali Shar shut up the saloon and locking the door with a padlock put the key in his pocket after which he went to market and bought fried cheese and virgin honey and bananas FN two hundred eighty eight and bread with which he returned to the house Now when the Christian saw the provision he said O my lord this is overmuch tis enough for half a score of men and I am alone but belike thou wilt eat with me Replied Ali Eat by thyself I am full and the Christian rejoined O my lord the wise say Whoso eateth not with his guest is a son of a whore Now when Ali Shar heard these words from the Nazarene he sat down and ate a little with him after which he would have held his hand And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Fourteenth Night She said 
5285-48598-0000	train-other-500	It hath reached me O auspicious King that Ali Shar sat down and ate a little with him after which he would have held his hand but the Nazarene privily took a banana and peeled it then splitting it in twain
none	none	 put into one half concentrated Bhang mixed with opium 
5285-48598-0001	train-other-500	a drachm whereof would over throw an elephant and he dipped it in the honey and gave it to Ali Shar saying O my lord by the truth of thy religion I adjure thee to take this So Ali Shar being ashamed to make him forsworn took it and swallowed it
