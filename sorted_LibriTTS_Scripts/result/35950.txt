she would scarcely have pointed to two grocer s boys one in a little country store at Danvers Mass the other in Baltimore both poor both uneducated the one leaving seven millions to Johns Hopkins University and Hospital the other nearly nine millions to elevate humanity George Peabody was born in Danvers Feb eighteen seventeen ninety five His parents were respectable hard working people whose scanty income afforded little education for their children George grew up an obedient faithful son called a mother boy by his companions from his devotion to her a title of which any boy may well be proud At eleven years of age he must go out into the world to earn his living Doubtless his mother wished to keep her child in school but there was no money A place was found with a mister Proctor in a grocery store and here for four years he worked day by day giving his earnings to his mother and winning esteem for his promptness and honesty But the boy at fifteen began to grow ambitious He longed for a larger store and a broader field Going with his maternal grandfather to Thetford Vt he remained a year when he came back to work for his brother in a dry goods store in Newburyport Perhaps now in this larger town his ambition would be satisfied when lo the store burned and George was thrown out of employment His father had died and he was without a dollar in the world Ambition seemed of little use now However an uncle in Georgetown D C hearing that the boy needed work sent for him and thither he went for two years Here he made many friends and won trade by his genial manner and respectful bearing His tact was unusual He never wounded the feelings of a buyer of goods never tried him with unnecessary talk never seemed impatient and was punctual to the minute Perhaps no one trait is more desirable than the latter A person who breaks his appointments or keeps others waiting for him loses friends and business success as well A young man s habits are always observed If he is worthy and has energy the world has a place for him and sooner or later he will find it A wholesale dry goods dealer mister Riggs had been watching young Peabody He desired a partner of energy perseverance and honesty Calling on the young clerk he asked him to put his labor against his mister Riggs s capital But I am only nineteen years of age was the reply This was considered no objection and the partnership was formed A year later the business was moved to Baltimore The boyish partner travelled on horseback through the western wilds of New York Pennsylvania Maryland and Virginia selling goods and lodging over night with farmers or planters In seven years the business had so increased that branch houses were established in Philadelphia and New York Finally mister Riggs retired from the firm and George Peabody found himself at the age of thirty five at the head of a large and wealthy establishment which his own energy industry and honesty had helped largely to build He had bent his life to one purpose that of making his business a success No one person can do many things well Having visited London several times in matters of trade he determined to make that great city his place of residence He had studied finance by experience as well as close observation and believed that he could make money in the great metropolis Having established himself as a banker at Wanford Court he took simple lodgings and lived without display When Americans visited London they called upon the genial true hearted banker whose integrity they could always depend upon and transacted their business with him In eighteen fifty one the World s Fair was opened at the Crystal Palace London Prince Albert having worked earnestly to make it a great success Congress neglected to make the needed appropriations for America and her people did not care apparently whether Powers Greek Slave Hoe s wonderful printing press or the McCormick Reaper were seen or not But George Peabody cared for the honor of his nation and gave fifteen thousand dollars to the American exhibitors that they might make their display worthy of the great country which they were to represent The same year he gave his first Fourth of July dinner to leading Americans and Englishmen headed by the Duke of Wellington While he remembered and honored the day which freed us from England no one did more than he to bind the two nations together by the great kindness of a great heart mister Peabody was no longer the poor grocery boy or the dry goods clerk He was fine looking most intelligent from his wide reading a total abstainer from liquors and tobacco honored at home and abroad and very rich Should he buy an immense estate and live like a prince Should he give parties and grand dinners and have servants in livery Oh no mister Peabody had acquired his wealth for a different purpose He loved humanity How could he elevate the people was the one question of his life He would not wait till his death and let others spend his money he would have the satisfaction of spending it himself And now began a life of benevolence which is one of the brightest in our history Unmarried and childless he made other wives and children happy by his boundless generosity If the story be true that he was once engaged to a beautiful American girl who gave him up for a former poor lover the world has been the gainer by her choice In eighteen fifty two mister Peabody gave ten thousand dollars to help fit out the second expedition under doctor Kane in his search for Sir John Franklin and for this gift a portion of the newly discovered country was justly called Peabody Land This same year the town of Danvers his birthplace decided to celebrate its centennial Of course the rich London banker was invited as one of the guests He was too busy to be present but sent a letter to be opened on the day of the celebration The seal was broken at dinner and this was the toast or sentiment it contained EDUCATION a debt due from present to future generations A check was enclosed for twenty thousand dollars for the purpose of building an Institute with a free library and free course of lectures Afterward this gift was increased to two hundred and fifty thousand dollars The poor boy had not forgotten the home of his childhood Four years later when Peabody Institute was dedicated the giver who had been absent from America twenty years was present New York and other cities offered public receptions but he declined all save Danvers A great procession was formed the houses along the streets being decorated all eager to do honor to their noble townsman The Governor of Massachusetts Edward Everett and others made eloquent addresses and then the kind faced great hearted man responded Though Providence has granted me an unvaried and unusual success in the pursuit of fortune in other lands I am still in heart the humble boy who left yonder unpretending dwelling many very many years ago There is not a youth within the sound of my voice whose early opportunities and advantages are not very much greater than were my own and I have since achieved nothing that is impossible to the most humble boy among you Bear in mind that to be truly great it is not necessary that you should gain wealth and importance Steadfast and undeviating truth fearless and straightforward integrity and an honor ever unsullied by an unworthy word or action make their possessor greater than worldly success or prosperity These qualities constitute greatness Soon after this mister Peabody determined to build an Institute combining a free library and lectures with an Academy of Music and an Art Gallery in the city of Baltimore For this purpose he gave over one million dollars a princely gift indeed Well might Baltimore be proud of the day when he sought a home in her midst But the merchant prince had not finished his giving He saw the poor of the great city of London living in wretched desolate homes Vice and poverty were joining hands He too had been poor He could sympathize with those who knew not how to make ends meet What would so stimulate these people to good citizenship as comfortable and cheerful abiding places March twelve eighteen sixty two he called together a few of his trusted friends in London and placed in their hands for the erection of neat tasteful dwellings for the poor the sum of seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars Ah what a friend the poor had found not the gift of a few dollars which would soon be absorbed in rent but homes which for a small amount might be enjoyed as long as they lived At once some of the worst portions of London were purchased tumble down structures were removed and plain high brick blocks erected around open squares where the children could find a playground Gas and water were supplied bathing and laundry rooms furnished Then the poor came eagerly with their scanty furniture and hired one or two rooms for twenty five or fifty cents a week cab men shoemakers tailors and needle women Tenants were required to be temperate and of good moral character Soon tiny pots of flowers were seen in the windows and a happier look stole into the faces of hard working fathers and mothers mister Peabody soon increased his gift to the London poor to three million dollars saying If judiciously managed for two hundred years its accumulation will amount to a sum sufficient to buy the city of London No wonder that these gifts of millions began to astonish the world London gave him the freedom of the city in a gold box an honor rarely bestowed and erected his bronze statue near the Royal Exchange Queen Victoria wished to make him a baron but he declined all titles What gift then would he accept was eagerly asked A letter from the Queen of England which I may carry across the Atlantic and deposit as a memorial of one of her most faithful sons was the response It is not strange that so pure and noble a man as George Peabody admired the purity and nobility of character of her who governs England so wisely A beautiful letter was returned by the Queen assuring him how deeply she appreciated his noble act of more than princely munificence an act as the Queen believes wholly without parallel and asking him to accept a miniature portrait of herself The portrait in a massive gold frame is fourteen inches long and ten inches wide representing the Queen in robes of state the largest miniature ever attempted in England and for the making of which a furnace was especially built The cost is believed to have been over fifty thousand dollars in gold It is now preserved with her letter in the Peabody Institute near Danvers Oct twenty five eighteen sixty six the beautiful white marble Institute in Baltimore was to be dedicated mister Peabody had crossed the ocean to be present Besides the famous and the learned twenty thousand children with Peabody badges were gathered to meet him The great man s heart was touched as he said Never have I seen a more beautiful sight than this vast collection of interesting children The review of the finest army attended by the most delightful strains of martial music could never give me half the pleasure He was now seventy one years old He had given nearly five millions could the world expect any more He realized that the freed slaves at the South needed an education They were poor and so were a large portion of the white race He would give for their education three million dollars the same amount he had bestowed upon the poor of London To the trustees having this gift in charge he said With my advancing years my attachment to my native land has but become more devoted My hope and faith in its successful and glorious future have grown brighter and stronger But to make her prosperity more than superficial her moral and intellectual development should keep pace with her material growth I feel most deeply therefore that it is the duty and privilege of the more favored and wealthy portions of our nation to assist those who are less fortunate Noble words mister Peabody s health was beginning to fail What he did must now be done quickly Yale College received a hundred and fifty thousand dollars for a Museum of Natural History Harvard the same for a Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology to found the Peabody Academy of Science at Salem a hundred and forty thousand dollars to Newburyport Library where the fire threw him out of employment and thus probably broadened his path in life fifteen thousand dollars twenty five thousand dollars each to various institutions of learning throughout the country ten thousand dollars to the Sanitary Commission during the war besides four million dollars to his relatives making in all thirteen million dollars Just before his return to England he made one of the most tender gifts of his life The dear mother whom he idolized was dead but he would build her a fitting monument not a granite shaft but a beautiful Memorial Church at Georgetown Mass where for centuries perhaps others will worship the God she worshipped On a marble tablet are the words Affectionately consecrated by her children George and Judith to the memory of missus Judith Peabody Whittier wrote the hymn for its dedication The heart and not the hand has wrought From sunken base to tower above The image of a tender thought The memory of a deathless love Nov four eighteen sixty nine mister Peabody lay dying at the house of a friend in London The Queen sent a special telegram of inquiry and sympathy and desired to call upon him in person but it was too late It is a great mystery said the dying man feebly but I shall know all soon At midnight he passed to his reward Westminster Abbey opened her doors for a great funeral where statesmen and earls bowed their heads in honor of the departed Then the Queen sent her noblest man of war Monarch to bear in state across the Atlantic her friend the once poor boy of Danvers Around the coffin in a room draped in black stood immense wax candles lighted When the great ship reached America Legislatures adjourned and went with Governors and famous men to receive the precious freight The body was taken by train to Peabody and then placed on a funeral car eleven feet long and ten feet high covered with black velvet trimmed with silver lace and stars Under the casket were winged cherubs in silver The car was drawn by six horses covered with black and silver while corps of artillery preceded the long procession At sunset the Institute was reached and there surrounded by the English and American flags draped with crape the guard kept silent watch about the dead At the funeral at the church honorable Robert C Winthrop pronounced the eloquent eulogy of the brave honest noble hearted friend of mankind and then amid a great concourse of people George Peabody was buried at Harmony Grove by the side of the mother whom he so tenderly loved Doubtless he looked out upon this greensward from his attic window when a child or when he labored in the village store Well might two nations unite in doing honor to this man both good and great who gave nine million dollars to bless humanity The building fund of Lfive hundred thousand left by mister Peabody for the benefit of the poor of London has now been increased by rents and interest to Leight hundred fifty seven thousand three hundred twenty The whole of this great sum of money is in active employment together with Lthree hundred forty thousand which the trustees have borrowed A total of Lone million one hundred seventy thousand seven hundred eighty seven has been expended during the time the fund has been in existence of which Leighty thousand nine hundred three was laid out during eighteen eighty four The results of these operations are seen in blocks of artisans dwellings built on land purchased by the trustees and let to working men at rents within their means containing conveniences and comforts not ordinarily attainable by them thus fulfilling the benevolent intentions of mister Peabody At the present time four thousand five hundred fifty one separate dwellings have been erected containing ten thousand one hundred forty four rooms inhabited by eighteen thousand four hundred fifty three persons Thirteen new blocks of buildings are now in course of erection and near completion Indeed there is no cessation in the work of fulfilling the intentions of the noble bequest Boston Journal Mar seven eighteen eighty five Illustration BAYARD TAYLOR BAYARD TAYLOR Since Samuel Johnson toiled in Grub Street London literature has scarcely furnished a more pathetic or inspiring illustration of struggle to success than that of Bayard Taylor Born of Quaker parentage in the little town of Kennett Square near Philadelphia Jan eleven eighteen twenty five he grew to boyhood in the midst of fresh air and the hard work of farm life His mother a refined and intelligent woman who taught him to read at four and who early discovered her child s love for books shielded him as far as possible from picking up stones and weeding corn and set him to rocking the baby to sleep What was her amazement one day on hearing loud cries from the infant to find Bayard absorbed in reading and rocking his own chair furiously supposing it to be the cradle It was evident that though such a boy might become a fine literary man he could not be a successful baby tender He was especially eager to read poetry and travels and before he was twelve years old had devoured the contents of their small circulating library as well as Cooper s novels and the histories of Gibbon Robertson and Hume The few books which he owned were bought with money earned by selling nuts which he had gathered He read Milton Scott Byron and Wordsworth and his mother would often hear him repeating poetry to his brother after they had gone to bed He was always planning journeys in Europe which seemed very far from being realized At fourteen he began to study Latin and French and at fifteen Spanish and a year later he assisted in teaching at the academy where he was attending school He was ambitious but there seemed no open door There is never an open door to fame or prosperity except we open it for ourselves The world is too busy to help others and assistance usually weakens rather than strengthens us About this time he received through request an autograph from Charles Dickens then lecturing in this country The boy of sixteen wrote in his journal It was not without a feeling of ambition that I looked upon it that as he a humble clerk had risen to be the guest of a mighty nation so I a humble pedagogue might by unremitted and arduous intellectual and moral exertion become a light a star among the names of my country May it be I believe all poets are possessed in a greater or less degree of ambition I think this is never given without a mind of sufficient power to sustain it and to achieve its lofty object At seventeen Bayard s schooling was over He sketched well and would gladly have gone to Philadelphia to study engraving but he had no money One poem had been published in the Saturday Evening Post Those only who have seen their first poem in print can experience his joy But writing poetry would not earn him a living He had no liking for teaching but as that seemed the only thing at hand he would try to obtain a school He did not succeed however and apprenticed himself for four years to a printer He worked faithfully using all his spare hours in reading and writing poetry Two years later he walked to Philadelphia and back thirty miles each way to see if fifteen of his poems could not be printed in a book His ambition evidently had not abated Of course no publisher would take the book at his own risk There was no way of securing its publication therefore but to visit his friends and solicit them to buy copies in advance This was a trying matter for a refined nature but it was a necessity He hoped thus to earn a little money for travel and to win a name that the person who shall be chosen to share with me the toils of life will not be ashamed to own This person was Mary Agnew whose love and that of Bayard Taylor form one of the saddest and tenderest pictures in our literature At last the penniless printer boy had determined to see Europe For two years he had read every thing he could find upon travels abroad His good mother mourned over the matter and his acquaintances prophesied dire results from such a roving disposition He would go again to Philadelphia and see if the newspapers did not wish correspondence from Europe All the editors politely declined the ardent boy s proposals Probably he did not know that unknown writers are not wanted About to return home not in despair he afterwards wrote but in a state of wonder as to where my funds would come from for I felt certain they would come the editor of the Saturday Evening Post offered him four dollars a letter for twelve letters fifty dollars with the promise of taking more if they were satisfactory The United States Gazette made a similar offer and after selling a few manuscript poems which he had with him he returned home in triumph with a hundred and forty dollars in his pocket This he says seemed sufficient to carry me to the end of the world Immediately Bayard and his cousin started on foot for Washington a hundred miles to see the member of Congress from their district and obtain passports from him Reaching a little village on their way thither they were refused lodgings at the tavern because of the lateness of the hour nine o clock and walked on till near midnight Then seeing a house brilliantly lighted as for a wedding they approached and asked the proprietor whether a tavern were near by The man addressed turned fiercely upon the lads shouting Begone Leave the place instantly Do you hear Off The amazed boys hastened away and at three o clock in the morning footsore and faint after a walk of nearly forty miles slept in a cart standing beside an old farmhouse And now at nineteen he was in New York ready for Europe He called upon the author N P Willis who had once written a kind note to him and this gentleman with a ready nature in helping others alas not always found among writers gave him several letters of introduction to newspaper men mister Greeley said bluntly when applied to I am sick of descriptive letters and will have no more of them But I should like some sketches of German life and society after you have been there and know something about it If the letters are good you shall be paid for them but don t write until you know something July one eighteen forty four Bayard and two young friends after paying ten dollars each for steerage passage started out for this eventful voyage No wonder that as land faded from sight and he thought of gentle Mary Agnew and his devoted mother his heart failed him and he quite broke down After twenty eight days they landed in Liverpool strangers poor knowing almost nothing of the world but full of hope and enthusiasm They spent three weeks in Scotland and the north of England and then travelled through Belgium to Heidelberg Bayard passed the first winter in Frankfort in the plainest quarters and then with his knapsack on his back visited Leipzig Dresden Prague Vienna and Munich After this he walked over the Alps and through Northern Italy spending four months in Florence and then visiting Rome Often he was so poor that he lived on twenty cents a day Sometimes he was without food for nearly two days writing his natural and graphic letters when his ragged clothes were wet through and his body faint from fasting But the manly enthusiastic youth always made friends by his good cheer and unselfishness At last he was in London with but thirty cents to buy food and lodging But he had a poem of twelve hundred lines in his knapsack which he supposed any London publisher would be glad to accept He offered it but it was declined with thanks The youth had not learned that Bayard Taylor unknown and Bayard Taylor famous in two hemispheres were two different names upon the title page of a book Publishers cannot usually afford to do missionary work in their business they print what will sell Weak from sea sickness he says hungry chilled and without a single acquaintance in the great city my situation was about as hopeless as it is possible to conceive Possibly he could obtain work in a printer s shop This he tried hour after hour and failed Finally he spent his last twopence for bread and found a place to sleep in a third rate chop house among sailors and actors from the lower theatres He rose early so as not to be asked to pay for his bed and again sought work Fortunately he met an American publisher who loaned him five dollars and with a thankful heart he returned to pay for his lodging For six weeks he staid in his humble quarters wrote letters home to the newspapers and also sent various poems to the English journals which were all returned to him For two years he supported himself on two hundred and fifty dollars a year earning it all by writing I saw he says almost nothing of intelligent European society but literature and art were nevertheless open to me and a new day had dawned in my life On his return to America he found that his published letters had been widely read He was advised to put them in a book and Views Afoot with a preface by N P Willis were soon given to the world Six editions were sold the first year and the boy who had seen Europe in the midst of so much privation found himself an author with the prospect of fame Not alone had poverty made these two years hard to bear He was allowed to hold no correspondence with Mary Agnew because her parents steadily refused to countenance the young lovers He had wisely made his mother his confidante and she had counselled patience and hope The rising fame possibly smoothed the course of true love for at twenty one Bayard became engaged to the idol of his heart She was an intelligent and beautiful girl with dark eyes and soft brown hair and to the ardent young traveller seemed more angel than human He showed her his every poem and laid before her every purpose He wrote her I have often dim vague forebodings that an eventful destiny is in store for me and then he added in quaint Quaker dialect I have told thee that existence would not be endurable without thee I feel further that thy aid will be necessary to work out the destinies of the future I am really glad that thou art pleased with my poetry One word from thee is dearer to me than the cold praise of all the critics in the land For the year following his return home he edited a country paper and thereby became involved in debts which required the labors of the next three years to cancel He now decided to go to New York if possible where there would naturally be more literary society and openings for a writer He wrote to editors and publishers but there were no vacancies to be filled Finally he was offered enough to pay his board by translating and this he gladly accepted By teaching literature in a young ladies school he increased his income to nine dollars a week Not a luxurious amount surely For a year he struggled on saving every cent possible and then mister Greeley gave him a place on the Tribune at twelve dollars a week He worked constantly often writing poetry at midnight when his day s duties were over He made true friends such as Stedman and Stoddard published a new book of poems and in the beginning of eighteen forty nine life began to look full of promise Sent by his paper to write up California for six months he lived in the open air his saddle for his pillow and on his return wrote his charming book El dorado He was now twenty five out of debt and ready to marry Mary Agnew But a dreadful cloud had meantime gathered and burst over their heads The beautiful girl had been stricken with consumption The May day bridal had been postponed God help me if I lose her wrote the young author to mister Stoddard from her bedside Oct twenty four came and the dying girl was wedded to the man she loved Four days later he wrote We have had some heart breaking hours talking of what is before us and are both better and calmer for it And later still She is radiantly beautiful but it is not the beauty of earth We have loved so long so intimately and so wholly that the footsteps of her life have forever left their traces in mine If my name should be remembered among men hers will not be forgotten Dec twenty one eighteen fifty she went beyond and Bayard Taylor at twenty six was alone in the world benumbed unfitted for work of any kind I am not my true self more than half the time I cannot work with any spirit another such winter will kill me I am certain I shall leave next fall on a journey somewhere no matter where he wrote a friend Fortunately he took a trip to the Far East travelling in Egypt Asia Minor India and Japan for two years writing letters which made him known the country over On his return he published three books of travel and accepted numerous calls in the lecture field His stock in the Tribune had become productive and he was gaining great success His next long journey was to Northern Europe when he took his brother and two sisters with him as he could enjoy nothing selfishly This time he saw much of the Brownings and Thackeray and spent two days as the guest of Tennyson He was no longer the penniless youth vainly looking for work in London to pay his lodging but the well known traveller lecturer and poet Oct twenty seven eighteen fifty seven seven years after the death of Mary Agnew he married the daughter of a distinguished German astronomer Marie Hansen a lady of great culture whose companionship has ever proved a blessing Tired of travel mister Taylor now longed for a home for his wife and infant daughter Lilian He would erect on the old homestead where he played when a boy such a house as a poet would love to dwell in and such as poet friends would delight to visit So with minutest care and thought Cedarcroft a beautiful structure was built in the midst of two hundred acres Every flower every tree was planted with as much love as Scott gave to Abbotsford But when it was completed the old story had been told again of expenses going far beyond expectations and instead of anticipated rest toil and struggle to pay debts and provide for constant outgoes But Bayard Taylor was not the man to be disturbed by obstacles He at once set to work to earn more than ever by his books and lectures With his characteristic generosity he brought his parents and his sisters to live in his home and made everybody welcome to his hospitality The Poet s Journal a poem of exquisite tenderness was written here and Hannah Thurston a novel of which fifteen thousand were soon sold Shortly after the beginning of our civil war mister Taylor was made Secretary of Legation at Russia He was now forty years of age loved well to do and famous His novels John Godfrey s Fortunes and the Story of Kennett were both successful The Picture of saint John rich and stronger than his other poems added to his fame But the gifted and versatile man was breaking in health Again he travelled abroad and wrote Byways in Europe On his return he translated with great care and study Faust which will always be a monument to his learning and literary skill He published Lars a Norway pastoral and gave delightful lectures on German literature at Cornell University and Lowell and Peabody Institutes at Boston and Baltimore At last he wearied of the care and constant expense of Cedarcroft He needed to be near the New York libraries mister Greeley had died his newspaper stock had declined and he could not sell his home as he had hoped There was no alternative but to go back in eighteen seventy one into the daily work of journalism in the Tribune office The rest which he had longed for was never to come For four years he worked untiringly delivering the Centennial Ode at our Exposition and often speaking before learned societies In eighteen seventy eight President Hayes bestowed upon him a well deserved honor by appointing him minister to Berlin Germany rejoiced that a lover of her life and literature had been sent to her borders The best of New York gathered to say good by to the noted author Arriving in Berlin Emperor William gave him cordial welcome and Bismark made him a friend A pleasant residence was secured and furniture purchased At last he was to find time to complete a long desired work the Lives of Goethe and Schiller Prince Deukalion his last noble poem had just reached him All was ready for the best and strongest work of his life when lo the overworked brain and body gave way He did not murmur Only once Dec nineteen he groaned I want I want oh you know what I mean that stuff of life It was too late At fifty three the great heart the exquisite brain the tired body were still Dead he lay among his books The peace of God was in his looks Germany as well as America wept over the bier of the once poor Quaker lad who travelled over Europe with scarce a shilling in his pocket now by his own energy brought to one of the highest positions in the gift of his country Dec twenty two the great of Germany gathered about his coffin Bertold Auerbach speaking beautiful words March thirteen eighteen seventy nine the dead poet lay in state in the City Hall at New York in the midst of assembled thousands The following day the body was borne to Cedarcroft and surrounded by literary associates and tender friends laid to rest Public memorial meetings were held in various cities where Holmes Longfellow Whittier and others gave their loving tributes A devoted student a successful diplomat a true friend a noble poet a gifted traveller a man whose life will never cease to be an inspiration CAPTAIN JAMES B EADS On the steamship Germanic I played chess with the great civil engineer Captain Eads stimulated by the thought that to beat him was to defeat the man who had twice conquered the Mississippi But I didn t defeat him The building of a ship canal across the Isthmus of Suez made famous the Frenchman Ferdinand de Lesseps so the opening up of the mouth of the Mississippi River has distinguished Captain Eads To day both these men are struggling for the rare honor of joining at the Isthmus of Panama the waters of the great Atlantic and Pacific a magnificent scheme which if successful will save annually thousands of miles of dangerous sea voyage around Cape Horn besides millions of money The Great West seems to delight in producing self made men like Lincoln Grant Eads and others James B Eads was born in Indiana in eighteen twenty He is slender in form neat in dress genial courteous and over sixty years of age In eighteen thirty three his father started down the Ohio River with his family proposing to settle in Wisconsin The boat caught fire and his scanty furniture and clothing were burned Young Eads barely escaped ashore with his pantaloons shirt and cap Taking passage on another boat this boy of thirteen landed at saint Louis with his parents his little bare feet first touching the rocky shore of the city on the very spot where he afterwards located and built the largest steel bridge in the world over the Mississippi one of the most difficult feats of engineering ever performed in America At the age of nine young Eads made a short trip on the Ohio when the engineer of the steamboat explained to him so clearly the construction of the steam engine that before he was a year older he built a little working model of it so perfect in its parts and movements that his schoolmates would frequently go home with him after school to see it work A locomotive engine driven by a concealed rat was one of his next juvenile feats in mechanical engineering From eight to thirteen he attended school after which from necessity he was placed as clerk in a dry goods store How few young people of the many to whom poverty denies an education either understand the value of the saying knowledge is power or exercise will sufficient to overcome obstacles Willpower and thirst for knowledge elevated General Garfield from driving canal horses to the Presidency of the United States Over the store in saint Louis where he was engaged his employer lived He was an old bachelor and having observed the tastes of his clerk gave him his first book in engineering The old gentleman s library furnished evening companions for him during the five years he was thus employed Finally his health failing at the age of nineteen he went on a Mississippi River steamer from which time to the present day that great river has been to him an all absorbing study Soon afterwards he formed a partnership with a friend and built a small boat to raise cargoes of vessels sunken in the Mississippi While this boat was building he made his first venture in submarine engineering on the lower rapids of the river by the recovery of several hundred tons of lead He hired a scow or flat boat and anchored it over the wreck An experienced diver clad in armor who had been hired at considerable expense in Buffalo was lowered into the water but the rapids were so swift that the diver though incased in the strong armor feared to be sunk to the bottom Young Eads determined to succeed and finding it impracticable to use the armor went ashore purchased a whiskey barrel knocked out the head attached the air pump hose to it fastened several heavy weights to the open end of the barrel then swinging it on a derrick he had a practical diving bell the best use I ever heard made of a whiskey barrel Neither the diver nor any of the crew would go down in this contrivance so the dauntless young engineer having full confidence in what he had read in books was lowered within the barrel down to the bottom the lower end of the barrel being open The water was sixteen feet deep and very swift Finding the wreck he remained by it a full hour hitching ropes to pig lead till a ton or more was safely hoisted into his own boat Then making a signal by a small line attached to the barrel he was lifted on deck and in command again The sunken cargo was soon successfully raised and was sold and netted a handsome profit which increased by other successes enabled energetic Eads to build larger boats with powerful pumps and machinery on them for lifting entire vessels He surprised all his friends in floating even immense sunken steamers boats which had long been given up as lost When the Rebellion came it was soon evident that a strong fleet must be put upon Western rivers to assist our armies Word came from the government to Captain Eads to report in Washington His thorough knowledge of the Father of Waters and its tributaries and his practical suggestions secured an order to build seven gunboats and soon after an order for the eighth was given In forty eight hours after receiving this authority his agents and assistants were at work and suitable ship timber was felled in half a dozen Western States for their hulls Contracts were awarded to large engine and iron works in saint Louis Pittsburgh and Cincinnati and within one hundred days eight powerful ironclad gunboats carrying over one hundred large cannon and costing a million dollars were achieving victories no less important for the Mississippi valley than those which Ericsson s famous Cheese box Monitor afterwards won on the James River These eight gunboats Commodore Foote ably employed in his brave attacks on Forts McHenry and Donaldson They were the first ironclads the United States ever owned Captain Eads covered the boats with iron Commodore Foote covered them with glory Eads built not less than fourteen of these gunboats During the war the models were exhibited by request to the German and other governments His next work was to throw across the mighty Mississippi River nearly half a mile wide at saint Louis a monstrous steel bridge supported by three arches the spans of two being five hundred and two feet long and the central one five hundred and twenty feet The huge piles were ingeniously sunk in the treacherous sand one hundred and thirty six feet below the flood level to the solid rock through ninety feet of sand This bridge and its approaches cost eighty millions of dollars and is used by ten or twelve railroad companies Above the tracks is a big street with carriage roads street cars and walks for foot passengers The honor of building the finest bridge in the world would have satisfied most men but not ambitious Captain Eads He actually loved the noble river in which De Soto its discoverer was buried and fully realized the vast undeveloped resources of its rich valleys Equally well he understood what a gigantic work in the past the river and its fifteen hundred sizable tributaries had accomplished in times of freshets by depositing soil and sand north of the original Gulf of Mexico forming an alluvial plain five hundred miles long sixty miles wide and of unknown depth and having a delta extending out into the Gulf sixty miles long and as many miles wide and probably a mile deep And yet this heroic man although jealously opposed for years by West Point engineers having a sublime confidence in the laws of nature and actuated by intense desire to benefit mankind dared to stand on the immense sand bars at the mouth of this defiant stream and making use of the jetty system bid the river itself dig a wide deep channel into the seas beyond for the world s commerce Captain Eads who had studied the improvements on the Danube Maas and other European rivers observed that all rivers flow faster in their narrow channels and carry along in the swift water sand gravel and even stones This familiar law he applied at the South Pass of the Mississippi River where the waters though deep above escaped from the banks into the Gulf and spread sediment far and wide The water on the sand bars of the three principal passes varied from eight to thirteen feet in depth Many vessels require twice the depth Two piers twelve hundred feet apart were built from land s end a mile into the sea They were made from willows timber gravel concrete and stone Mattresses a hundred feet long from twenty five to fifty feet wide and two feet thick were constructed from small willows placed at right angles and bound securely together These were floated into position and sunk with gravel one mattress upon another which the river soon filled with sand that firmly held them in their place The top was finished with heavy concrete blocks to resist the waves These piers are called jetties and the swift collected waters have already carried over five million cubic yards of sand into the deep gulf and made a ship way over thirty feet deep The five million dollars paid by the United States was little enough for so priceless a service In June eighteen eighty four Captain Eads received the Albert medal of the British Society of Arts the first American upon whom this honor has been conferred Before his great enterprise of the Tehuantepec ship railroad had been completed he died at Nassau New Providence Bahama Islands March eight eighteen eighty seven after a brief illness of pneumonia at the age of sixty seven Illustration JAMES WATT JAMES WATT The history of inventors is generally the same old struggle with poverty Sir Richard Arkwright the youngest of thirteen children with no education a barber shaving in a cellar for a penny to each customer dies worth two and one half million dollars after being knighted by the King for his inventions in spinning Elias Howe junior in want and sorrow lives on beans in a London attic and dies at forty five having received over two million dollars from his sewing machines in thirteen years Success comes only through hard work and determined perseverance The steps to honor or wealth or fame are not easy to climb The history of James Watt the inventor of the steam engine is no exception to the rule of struggling to win He was born in the little town of Greenock Scotland seventeen thirty six Too delicate to attend school he was taught reading by his mother and a little writing and arithmetic by his father When six years of age he would draw mechanical lines and circles on the hearth with a colored piece of chalk His favorite play was to take to pieces his little carpenter tools and make them into different ones He was an obedient boy especially devoted to his mother a cheerful and very intelligent woman who always encouraged him She would say in any childish quarrels Let James speak from him I always hear the truth Old George Herbert said One good mother is worth a hundred schoolmasters and such a one was missus Watt When sent to school James was too sensitive to mix with rough boys and was very unhappy with them When nearly fourteen his parents sent him to a friend in Glasgow who soon wrote back that they must come for their boy for he told so many interesting stories that he had read that he kept the family up till very late at night His aunt wrote that he would sit for an hour taking off the lid of the teakettle and putting it on holding now a cup and now a silver spoon over the steam watching how it rises from the spout and catching and condensing the drops of hot water it falls into Before he was fifteen he had read a natural philosophy twice through as well as every other book he could lay his hands on He had made an electrical machine and startled his young friends by some sudden shocks He had a bench for his special use and a forge where he made small cranes pulleys pumps and repaired instruments used on ships He was fond of astronomy and would lie on his back on the ground for hours looking at the stars Frail though he was in health yet he must prepare himself to earn a living When he was eighteen with many tender words from his mother her only boy started for Glasgow to learn the trade of making mathematical instruments In his little trunk besides his best clothes which were a ruffled shirt a velvet waistcoat and silk stockings were a leather apron and some carpenter tools Here he found a position with a man who sold and mended spectacles repaired fiddles and made fishing nets and rods Finding that he could learn very little in this shop an old sea captain a friend of the family took him to London Here day after day he walked the streets asking for a situation but nobody wanted him Finally he offered to work for a watchmaker without pay till he found a place to learn his trade This he at last obtained with a mister Morgan to whom he agreed to give a hundred dollars for the year s teaching As his father was poorly able to help him the conscientious boy lived on two dollars a week earning most of this pittance by rising early and doing odd jobs before his employer opened his shop in the morning He labored every evening until nine o clock except Saturday and was soon broken in health by hunger and overwork His mother s heart ached for him but like other poor boys he must make his way alone At the end of the year he went to Glasgow to open a shop for himself but other mechanics were jealous of a new comer and would not permit him to rent a place A professor at the Glasgow University knew the deserving young man and offered him a room in the college which he gladly accepted He and the lad who assisted him could earn only ten dollars a week and there was little sale for the instruments after they were made so following the example of his first master he began to make and mend flutes fiddles and guitars though he did not know one note from another One of his customers wanted an organ built and at once Watt set to work to learn the theory of music When the organ was finished a remarkable one for those times the young machinist had added to it several inventions of his own This earning a living was a hard matter but it brought energy developed thought and probably helped more than all else to make him famous The world in general works no harder than circumstances compel Poverty is no barrier to falling in love and poor though he was he now married Margaret Miller his cousin whom he had long tenderly loved Their home was plain and small but she had the sweetest of dispositions was always happy and made his life sunny even in its darkest hours of struggling Meantime he had made several intellectual friends in the college one of whom talked much to him about a steam carriage Steam was not by any means unknown Hero a Greek physician who lived at Alexandria a century before the Christian era tells how the ancients used it Some crude engines were made in Watt s time the best being that of Thomas Newcomen called an atmospheric engine and used in raising water from coal mines It could do comparatively little however and many of the mines were now useless because the water nearly drowned the miners Watt first experimented with common vials for steam reservoirs and canes hollowed out for steam pipes For months he went on working night and day trying new plans testing the powers of steam borrowing a brass syringe a foot long for his cylinder till finally the essential principles of the steam engine were born in his mind He wrote to a friend My whole thoughts are bent on this machine I can think of nothing else He hired an old cellar and for two months worked on his model His tools were poor his foreman died and the engine when completed leaked in all parts His old business of mending instruments had fallen off he was badly in debt and had no money to push forward the invention He believed he had found the right principle but he could not let his family starve Sick at heart and worn in body he wrote Of all things in life there is nothing more foolish than inventing Poor Watt His great need was money money to buy food money to buy tools money to give him leisure for thought Finally a friend induced doctor Roebuck an iron dealer to become Watt s partner pay his debts of five thousand dollars take out a patent and perfect the engine Watt went to London for his patent but so long was he delayed by indifferent officials that he wrote home to his young wife quite discouraged With a brave heart in their pinching poverty Margaret wrote back I beg that you will not make yourself uneasy though things should not succeed to your wish If the engine will not do something else will never despair On his return home for six months he worked in setting up his engine The cylinder having been badly cast was almost worthless the piston though wrapped in cork oiled rags and old hat let the air in and the steam out and the model proved a failure To day he said I enter the thirty fifth year of my life and I think I have hardly yet done thirty five pence worth of good in the world but I cannot help it The path to success was not easy doctor Roebuck was getting badly in debt and could not aid him as he had promised so Watt went sadly back to surveying a business he had taken up to keep the wolf from the door In feeble health out in the worst weather his clothes often wet through life seemed almost unbearable When absent on one of these surveying excursions word was brought that Margaret his beloved wife was dead He was completely unnerved Who would care for his little children or be to him what he had often called her the comfort of his life After this he would often pause on the threshold of his humble home to summon courage to enter since she was no longer there to welcome him She had shared his poverty but was never to share his fame and wealth And now came a turning point in his life though the struggles were by no means over At Birmingham lived Matthew Boulton a rich manufacturer eight years older than Watt He employed over a thousand men in his hardware establishment and in making clocks and reproducing rare vases He was a friend of Benjamin Franklin with whom he had corresponded about the steam engine and he had also heard of Watt and his invention through doctor Roebuck He was urged to assist But Watt waited three years longer for aid Nine years had passed since he made his invention he was in debt without business and in poor health What could he do He seemed likely to finish life without any success Finally Boulton was induced to engage in the manufacture of engines giving Watt one third of the profits if any were made One engine was constructed by Boulton s men and it worked admirably Soon orders came in for others as the mines were in bad condition and the water must be pumped out Fortunes like misfortunes rarely come singly Just at this time the Russian Government offered Watt five thousand dollars yearly if he would go to that country Such a sum was an astonishment How he wished Margaret could have lived to see this proud day He could not well be spared from the company now so he lived on at Birmingham marrying a second time Anne Macgregor of Scotland to care for his children and his home She was a very different woman from Margaret Miller a neat housekeeper but seemingly lacking in the lovable qualities which make sunshine even in the plainest home As soon as the Boulton and Watt engines were completed and success seemed assured obstacles arose from another quarter Engines had been put into several Cornwall mines which bore the singular names of Ale and Cakes Wheat Fanny Wheat Abraham Cupboard and Cook s Kitchen As soon as the miners found that these engines worked well they determined to destroy the patent by the cry that Boulton and Watt had a monopoly of a thing which the world needed Petitions were circulated giving great uneasiness to both the partners Several persons also stole the principle of the engine either by bribing the engine men or by getting them drunk so that they would tell the secrets of their employers The patent was constantly infringed upon Every hour was a warfare Watt said The rascality of mankind is almost past belief Meantime Boulton with his many branches of business and the low state of trade had gotten deeply in debt and was pressed on every side for the tens of thousands which he owed Watt was nearly insane with this trouble He wrote to Boulton I cannot rest in my bed until these money matters have assumed some determinate form I am plagued with the blues I am quite eaten up with the mulligrubs Soon after this Watt invented the letter copying press which at first was greatly opposed because it was thought that forged names and letters would result After a time however there was great demand for it Watt was urged by Boulton to invent a rotary engine but this was finally done by their head workman William Murdock the inventor of lighting by gas He also made the first model of a locomotive which frightened the village preacher nearly out of his senses as it came puffing down the street one evening Though devoted to his employers sometimes working all night for them they counselled him to give up all thought about his locomotive lest by developing it he might in time withdraw from their firm Alas for the selfishness of human nature He was never made a partner and though he thought out many inventions after his day s work was done he remained faithful to their service till the end of his life mister Buckle tells this good story of Murdock Having found that fish skins could be used instead of isinglass he came to London to inform the brewers and took board in a handsome house Fancying himself in his laboratory he went on with his experiments Imagine the horror of the landlady when she entered his room and found her elegant wall paper covered with wet fish skins hung up to dry The inventor took an immediate departure with his skins When the rotary engine was finished the partners sought to obtain a charter when lo The millers and mealmen all opposed it because said they If flour is ground by steam the wind and water mills will stop and men will be thrown out of work Boulton and Watt viewed with contempt this new obstacle of ignorance Carry out this argument said the former and we must annihilate water mills themselves and go back again to the grinding of corn by hand labor Presently a large mill was burned by incendiaries with a loss of fifty thousand dollars Watt about this time invented his Parallel Motion and the Governor for regulating the speed of the engine Large orders began to come in even from America and the West Indies but not till they had expended two hundred thousand dollars were there any profits Times were brightening for the hard working inventor He lost his despondency and did not long for death as he had previously After a time he built a lovely home at Heathfield in the midst of forty acres of trees flowers and tasteful walks Here gathered some of the greatest minds of the world doctor Priestley who discovered oxygen Sir William Herschel doctor Darwin Josiah Wedgwood and scores of others who talked of science and literature missus Watt so detested dirt and so hated the sight of her husband s leather apron and soiled hands that he built for himself a garret where he could work unmolested by his wife or her broom and dustpan She never allowed even her two pug dogs to cross the hall without wiping their feet on the mat She would seize and carry away her husband s snuff box wherever she found it because she considered snuff as dirt At night when she retired from the dining room if mister Watt did not follow at the time fixed by her she sent a servant to remove the lights If friends were present he would say meekly We must go and walk slowly out of the room Such conduct must have been about as trying as the failure of his engines For days together he would stay in his garret not even coming down to his meals cooking his food in his frying pan and Dutch oven which he kept by him One cannot help wondering whether sometimes as he worked up there alone he did not think of Margaret whose face would have brightened even that dingy room A crushing sorrow now came to him His only daughter Jessie died and then his pet son Gregory the dearest friend of Humphry Davy a young man of brilliant scholarship and oratorical powers Boulton died before his partner loved and lamented by all having followed the precept he once gave to Watt Keep your mind and your heart pleasant if possible for the way to go through life sweetly is not to regard rubs Watt died peacefully Aug nineteen eighteen nineteen in his eighty third year and was buried in beautiful Handsworth Church Here stands Chantrey s masterpiece a sitting statue of the great inventor Another is in Westminster Abbey When Lord Brougham was asked to write the inscription for this monument he said I reckon it one of the chief honors of my life Sir James Mackintosh placed him at the head of all inventors in all ages and nations and Wordsworth regarded him Considering both the magnitude and the universality of his genius as perhaps the most extraordinary man that this country has ever produced After all the struggle came wealth and fame The mine opens up its treasures only to those who are persevering enough to dig into it and life itself yields little only to such as have the courage and the will to overcome obstacles Heathfield has passed into other hands but the quiet garret is just as James Watt left it at death Here is a large sculpture machine and many busts partly copied Here is his handkerchief tied to the beam on which he rested his head The beam itself is crumbling to dust Little pots of chemicals on the shelves are hardened by age A bunch of withered grapes is on a dish and the ashes are in the grate as when he sat before it Close by is the hair trunk of his beloved Gregory full of his schoolbooks his letters and his childish toys This the noble old man kept beside him to the last SIR JOSIAH MASON One sunny morning in June I went out five miles from the great manufacturing city of Birmingham England to the pretty town called Erdington to see the Mason Orphanage I found an immense brick structure with high Gothic towers in the midst of thirteen acres of velvety lawn Over the portals of the building were the words DO DEEDS OF LOVE Three hundred happy children were scattered over the premises the girls in brown dresses with long white aprons some were in the great play room some doing the housework and some serving at dinner Sly Cupid creeps into an orphan asylum even and the matron had to watch carefully lest the biggest pieces of bread and butter be given by the girls to the boys they liked best In the large grounds full of flowers and trees among the children he so tenderly loved and called by name the founder Sir Josiah Mason and his wife are buried in a beautiful mausoleum a Gothic chapel with stone carving and stained glass windows Illustration SIR JOSIAH MASON And who was this founder In a poor plain home in Kidderminster Feb twenty three seventeen ninety five Sir Josiah Mason was born His father was a weaver and his mother the daughter of a laborer At eight years of age with of course little education the boy began the struggle of earning a living His mother fitted up two baskets for him and these he filled with baker s cakes and sold them about the streets Little Joe became so great a favorite that the buyers often gave him an extra penny Finally a donkey was obtained and a bag containing cakes in one end and fruit and vegetables in the other was strapped across his back In this way for seven years Joe peddled from door to door Did anybody ever think then that he would be rich and famous The poor mother helped him with her scanty means and both parents allowed him to keep all he could make His father s advice used to be Joe thee saint got a few pence never let anybody know how much thee saint got in thee pockets And well the boy carried out his father s injunction in afterlife When he was fifteen his brother had become a confirmed invalid and needed a constant attendant The father was away at the shop and the mother busy with her cares so Joe who thought of others always before himself determined to be nurse and earn some money also He set about becoming a shoemaker having learned the trade from watching an old man who lived near their house but he could make only a bare pittance Then he taught himself writing and earned a trifle for composing letters and Valentines for his poor neighbors This money he spent in books for he was eager for an education He read no novels nor poetry but books of history science and theology Finally the mother started a small grocery and bakery and Joe assisted Many of their customers were tramps and beggars who could buy only an ounce or half ounce of tea but even a farthing was welcome to the Masons Later Josiah took up carpet weaving and blacksmithing but he could never earn more than five dollars a week and he became restless and eager for a broader field He had courage was active and industrious and had good habits He was now twenty one He decided to go to Birmingham on Christmas Day to visit an uncle whom he had never seen He went and this was the turning point of his life His uncle gave him work in making gilt toys and what was perhaps better still for the poor young man he fell in love with his cousin Annie Griffiths and married her the following year This marriage proved a great blessing and for fifty two years childless they two were all in all to each other For six years the young husband worked early and late with the promise of succeeding to the small business but at the end of these years the promise was broken and Mason found himself at thirty out of work and owning less than one hundred dollars Walking down the street one day in no very happy frame of mind a stranger stepped up to him and said mister Mason Yes was the answer You are now I understand without employment I know some one who wants just such a man as you and I will introduce him to you Will you meet me to morrow morning at mister Harrison s the split ring maker I will The next day the stranger said to mister Harrison I have brought you the very man you want The business man eyed Mason closely saying I ve had a good many young men come here but they are afraid of dirtying their fingers Mason opened his somewhat calloused hands and looking at them said Are you ashamed of dirtying yourselves to get your own living Mason was at once employed and a year later mister Harrison offered him the business at twenty five hundred dollars Several men observing the young man s good qualities had offered to loan him money when he should go into trade for himself He bethought him of these friends and called upon them but they all began to make excuse The world s proffers of help or friendship we can usually discount by half Seeing that not a dollar could be borrowed mister Harrison generously offered to wait for the principal till it could be earned out of the profits This was a noble act and mister Mason never ceased to be grateful for it He soon invented a machine for bevelling hoop rings and made five thousand dollars the first year from its use Thenceforward his life reads like a fairy tale One day seeing some steel pens on a card in a shop window he went in and purchased one for twelve cents That evening he made three and enclosed one in a letter to Perry of London the maker paying eighteen cents postage which now would be only two cents His pen was such an improvement that mister Perry at once wrote for all he could make In a few years Mason became the greatest pen maker in the world employing a thousand persons and turning out over five million pens per week Sixty tons of pens containing one and a half million pens to the ton were often in his shops What a change from peddling cakes from door to door in Kidderminster Later he became the moneyed partner in the great electro plating trade of the Elkingtons whose beautiful work at the Centennial Exposition we all remember mister Mason never forgot his laborers When he established copper smelting works in Wales he built neat cottages for the workmen and schools for the three hundred and fifty children The Welsh refused to allow their children to attend school where they would be taught English mister Mason overcame this by distributing hats bonnets and other clothing to the pupils and once in school they needed no urging to remain The manufacturer was as hard a worker as any of his men For years he was the first person to come to his factory and the last to leave it He was quick to decide a matter and act upon it and the most rigid economist of time He allowed nobody to waste his precious hours with idle talk nor did he waste theirs He believed with Shakespeare that Talkers are no good doers His hours were regular He took much exercise on foot and lived with great simplicity He was always cheerful and had great self control Finally he began to ask himself how he could best use his money before he died He remembered his poor struggling mother in his boyish days His first gift should be a home for aged women a noble thought his next should be for orphans as he was a great lover of children For eight years he watched the beautiful buildings of his Orphanage go up and then saw the happy children gathered within bringing many of them from Kidderminster who were as destitute as himself when a boy He seemed to know and love each child for whose benefit he had included even his own lovely home a million dollars in all The annual income for the Orphanage is about fifty thousand dollars What pleasure he must have had as he saw them swinging in the great playgrounds where he had even thought to make triple columns so that they could the better play hide and seek At eight he was trudging the streets to earn bread they should have an easier lot through his generosity For this and other noble deeds Queen Victoria made him a knight What would his poor mother have said to such an honor for her boy had she been alive What would the noble man now over eighty do next with his money He recalled how hard it had been for him to obtain knowledge The colleges were patronized largely by the rich He would build a great School of Science free to all who depended upon themselves for support They might study mathematics languages chemistry civil engineering without distinction of sex or race For five years he watched the elegant brick and stone structure in Birmingham rise from its foundations And then Oct one eighteen eighty in the midst of assembled thousands and in the presence of such men as Fawcett Bright and Max Muller Mason Science College was formally opened Professor Huxley R W Dale and others made eloquent addresses In the evening a thousand of the best of England gathered at the college made beautiful by flowers and crimson drapery On a dais sat the noble giver in his eighty sixth year The silence was impressive as the grand old man arose handing the key of his college his million dollar gift to the trustees Surely truth is stranger than fiction To what honor and renown had come the humble peddler On the following twenty fifth of June Sir Josiah Mason was borne to his grave in the Erdington mausoleum Three hundred and fifty orphan children followed his coffin which was carried by eight servants or workingmen as he had requested After the children had sung a hymn they covered the coffin lid with flowers which he so dearly loved He sleeps in the midst of his gifts one of England s noble benefactors BERNARD PALISSY In the Louvre in Paris preserved among almost priceless gems are several pieces of exquisite pottery called Palissy ware Thousands examine them every year yet but few know the struggles of the man who made such beautiful works of art Born in the south of France in fifteen oh nine in a poor plain home Bernard Palissy grew to boyhood sunny hearted and hopeful learning the trade of painting on glass from his father He had an ardent love for nature and sketched rocks birds and flowers with his boyish hands When he was eighteen he grew eager to see the world and with a tearful good by from his mother started out to seek his fortune For ten years he travelled from town to town now painting on glass for some rich lord and now sketching for a peasant family in return for food Meantime he made notes about vegetation and the forming of crystals in the mountains of Auvergne showing that he was an uncommon boy Illustration BERNARD PALISSY Finally like other young people he fell in love and was married at twenty eight He could not travel about the country now so he settled in the little town of Saintes Then a baby came into their humble home How could he earn more money since the poor people about him had no need for painted glass Every time he tried to plan some new way to grow richer his daily needs weighed like a millstone around his neck About this time he was shown an elegant enamelled cup from Italy What if I could be the first and only maker of such ware in France thought he But he had no knowledge of clay and no money to visit Italy where alone the secret could be obtained The Italians began making such pottery about the year thirteen hundred Two centuries earlier the Pagan King of Majorca in the Mediterranean Sea was said to keep confined in his dungeons twenty thousand Christians The Archbishop of Pisa incited his subjects to make war upon such an infidel king and after a year s struggle the Pisans took the island killed the ruler and brought home his heir and great booty Among the spoils were exquisite Moorish plates which were so greatly admired that they were hung on the walls of Italian churches At length the people learned to imitate this Majolica ware which brought very high prices The more Palissy thought about this beautiful pottery the more determined he became to attempt its making But he was like a man groping in the dark He had no knowledge of what composed the enamel on the ware but he purchased some drugs and ground them to powder Then he bought earthen pots broke them in pieces spread the powder upon the fragments and put them in a furnace to bake He could ill afford to build a furnace or even to buy the earthenware but he comforted his young wife with the thought that as soon as he had discovered what would produce white enamel they would become rich When the pots had been heated sufficiently as he supposed he took them out but lo the experiment had availed nothing Either he had not hit upon the right ingredients or the baking had been too long or too short in time He must of course try again For days and weeks he pounded and ground new materials but no success came The weeks grew into months Finally his supply of wood became exhausted and the wife was losing her patience with these whims of an inventor They were poor and needed present income rather than future prospects She had ceased to believe Palissy s stories of riches coming from white enamel Had she known that she was marrying an inventor she might well have hesitated lest she starve in the days of experimenting but now it was too late His wood used up Palissy was obliged to make arrangements with a potter who lived three miles away to burn the broken pieces in his furnace His enthusiasm made others hopeful so that the promise to pay when white enamel was discovered was readily accepted To make matters sure of success at this trial he sent between three and four hundred pieces of earthenware to his neighbor s furnace Some of these would surely come back with the powder upon them melted and the surface would be white Both himself and wife waited anxiously for the return of the ware she much less hopeful than he however When it came he says in his journal I received nothing but shame and loss because it turned out good for nothing Two years went by in this almost hopeless work then a third three whole years of borrowing money wood and chemicals three years of consuming hope and desperate poverty Palissy s family had suffered extremely One child had died probably from destitution The poor wife was discouraged and at last angered at his foolishness Finally the pottery fever seemed to abate and Palissy went back to his drudgery of glass painting and occasional surveying Nobody knew the struggle it had cost to give up the great discovery but it must be done Henry II who was then King of France had placed a new tax on salt and Palissy was appointed to make maps of all the salt marshes of the surrounding country Some degree of comfort now came back to his family New clothes were purchased for the children and the overworked wife repented of her lack of patience When the surveying was completed a little money had been saved but alas the pottery fever had returned Three dozen new earthen pots were bought chemicals spread over them as before and these taken to a glass furnace where the heat would be much greater He again waited anxiously and when they were returned some of the powder had actually melted and run over the earthenware This added fuel to the flame of his hope and ambition And now for two whole years more he went between his house and the glass furnace always hoping always failing His home had now become like a pauper s For five years he had chased this will o the wisp of white enamel and the only result was the sorrow of his relatives and the scorn of his neighbors Finally he promised his heart broken wife that he would make but one more trial and if this failed he would give up experimenting and support her and the children He resolved that this should be an almost superhuman effort In some unknown way he raised the money for new pots and three hundred mixtures of chemicals Then with the feelings of a man who has but one chance for life he walked beside the person who carried his precious stock to the furnace He sat down before the mouth of the great hot oven and waited four long hours With what a sinking heart he watched the pieces as they were taken out He hardly dared look because it would probably be the old story of failure But lo some were melted and as they hardened oh joy unspeakable they turned white He hastened home with unsteady step like one intoxicated to tell his wife the overwhelming truth Surely he could not stop now in this great work and all must be done in secret lest other potters learn the art Fears no doubt mingled with the new born hopes of missus Palissy for there was no regular work before her husband and no steady income for hungry little mouths Besides he must needs build a furnace in the shed adjoining their home But how could he obtain the money Going to the brick yard he pledged some of the funds he hoped to receive in the future and brought home the bricks upon his back Then he spent seven long months experimenting in clay vessels that he might get the best shapes and quality to take the enamel For another month from early morning till late at night he pounded his preparations of tin lead iron and copper and mixed them as he hoped in proper proportions When his furnace was ready he put in his clay pots and seated himself before the mouth All day and all night he fed the fire his little children bringing him soup which was all the food the house afforded A second day and night he watched the results eagerly but the enamel did not melt Covered with perspiration and faint from loss of sleep and food with the desperation of hope that is akin to despair for six days and six nights catching scarcely a moment of sleep he watched the earthen pots but still the enamel did not melt At last thinking that his proportions in his mixtures might have been wrong he began once more to pound and grind the materials without letting his furnace cool His clay vessels which he had spent seven months in making were also useless so he hastened to the shops and bought new ones The family were now nearly frantic with poverty and the pottery madness of the father To make matters quite unbearable the wood had given out and the furnace fires must not stop Almost wild with hope deferred and the necessities of life pressing upon him Palissy tore up the fence about his garden and thrust it into the furnace mouth Still the enamel did not melt He rushed into the house and began breaking up the table and chairs for fuel His wife and children were horrified They ran through the streets crying out that Palissy was tearing the house down and had become crazy The neighbors gathered and begged him to desist but all to no purpose He tore up the floors of the house and threw them in The town jeered at him and said It is right that he die of hunger seeing that he has left off following his trade He was exhausted and dried up by the heat of the furnace but still he could not yield Finally the enamel melted But now he was more crazy than before He must go forward come what might With his family nearer than ever to starvation he hired an assistant potter promising the old promise to pay when the discovery had been perfected The town of Saintes must have become familiar with that promise An innkeeper boarded the potter for six months and charged it to Palissy to be paid like all the other bills in the future Probably missus Palissy did not wish to board the assistant even had she possessed the necessary food At the end of the six months the potter departed receiving as pay nearly all Palissy s wearing apparel which probably was scarcely worth carrying away He now felt obliged to build an improved furnace tearing down the old one to recover the bricks nearly turned to stone by the intense heat His hands were fearfully bruised and cut in the work He begged and borrowed more money and once more started his furnace with the boast that this time he would draw three or four hundred francs from it When the ware was drawn out the creditors came eager for their share but alas there was no share for them The mortar had been full of flints which adhered to the vessels and Palissy broke the spoiled lot in pieces The neighbors called him a fool the wife joined in the maledictions and who could blame her Under all this disappointment his spirit gave way and he fled to his chamber and threw himself upon the bed Six of his children had died from want during the last ten years of struggle What agony for the fond mother I was so wasted in person he quaintly wrote afterwards that there was no form nor prominence of muscle on my arms or legs also the said legs were throughout of one size so that the garters with which I tied my stockings were at once when I walked down upon my heels with the stockings too I was despised and mocked by all But the long lane turned at last He stopped for a year and took up his old work to support his dying family and then perfected his discovery For five or six years there were many failures the furnaces were too hot or the proportions were wrong but finally the work became very beautiful His designs from nature were perfect and his coloring marvellous His fame soon spread abroad and such nobles as Montmorenci who stood next in rank to the King and counts and barons were his patrons He designed tiles for the finest palaces ideal heads of the Saviour and dainty forms from Greek mythology Invited by Catherine de Medicis wife of King Henry II Palissy removed to Paris and was thenceforward called Bernard of the Tuileries He was now rich and famous What a change from that day when his half starved wife and children fled along the streets of Saintes their furniture broken up for furnace fires And yet but for this blind devotion to a single object he would have remained a poor unknown glass painter all his life While in Paris he published two or three books which showed wide knowledge of history mines springs metals and philosophy He founded a Museum of Natural History and for eight years gave courses of lectures attended by all the learned men of the day When his great learning was commented upon he replied I have had no other book than the sky and the earth known to all A wonderful man indeed All his life Palissy was a devoted Huguenot not fearing to read his Bible and preach to the people daily from it Once he was imprisoned at Bordeaux and but for his genius and his necessity to the beautifying of palaces and chapels he would have been put to death When he was seventy six under the brutal Henry III he was shut up in the Bastille After nearly four years the curled and vain monarch visited him and said My good man you have been forty five years in the service of the Queen my mother or in mine and we have suffered you to live in your own religion amidst all the executions and the massacres Now however I am so pressed by the Guise party and my people that I have been compelled in spite of myself to imprison these two poor women and you they are to be burnt to morrow and you also if you will not be converted Sire answered the old man you have said several times that you feel pity for me but it is I who pity you who have said I am compelled That is not speaking like a King These girls and I who have part in the kingdom of heaven we will teach you to talk royally The Guisarts all your people and yourself cannot compel a potter to bow down to images of clay The two girls were burnt a few months afterward The next year fifteen eighty nine Henry III was stabbed by a monk who knelt before his throne and the same year Palissy died in the Bastille at the age of eighty Illustration THORWALDSEN BERTEL THORWALDSEN

none	none	 and on the side is his boyish name Bertel Bartholomew Thorwaldsen MOZART The quaint old city of Salzburg Austria built into the mountain side is a Mecca for all who love music and admire the immortal Mozart When he was alive his native city allowed him nearly to starve when he was dead she built him a beautiful monument and preserved his home a plain two story stuccoed building for thousands of travellers to look upon sadly and tenderly Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born Jan twenty seven seventeen fifty six a delicate sensitive child who would ask a dozen times a day whether his friends loved him and if answered in the negative would burst into tears At three he began to show his passion for music He would listen intensely as his father taught his little sister Nannerl seven years old would move his playthings from one room to another to the sound of the violin and at four composed pieces which astonished his sire Illustration W A MOZART Two years later the proud father took Wolfgang and his sister on a concert tour to Vienna So well did the boy play that the Empress Maria Theresa held him in her arms and kissed him heartily One day as he was walking between two of her daughters he slipped on the polished floor and fell Marie Antoinette afterward Empress of France raised him up whereupon he said You are very kind I will marry you The father was alarmed at this seeming audacity but the lovely Princess playfully kissed him The next year he was taken to Paris and here two sets of sonatas the works of a boy of seven were brought out dedicated to Marie Antoinette The children sat at the royal table poems were written about them and everywhere they excited wonder and admiration yet so excessively modest was young Mozart that he cried when praised too much In London Bach took the boy between his knees and alternately they played his own great works and those of Handel at sight Royalty gave them gold snuffboxes enough to set up a shop wrote home the father but in money I am poor Wolfgang was now taken ill of inflammatory fever but he could not give up his music A board was laid across the bed and on this he wrote out his thoughts in the notes Finally with ardor dampened at their lack of pecuniary success Leopold Mozart took his dear ones back to quiet Salzburg Here the cold archbishop discrediting the reports of the boy s genius shut him up alone for a week to compose an oratorio the text furnished by himself Mozart only ten years old stood the test brilliantly The next year a second tour was taken to Vienna to be present at the marriage of the Archduchess Maria Josepha The bride died from smallpox shortly after their arrival and poor Wolfgang took the disease and was blind for nine days When he recovered the musicians moved by envy and jealousy would not be outdone by a boy of twelve who was equally at home in German or Italian opera and determined to hiss off the stage whatever he might compose Sad at heart and disappointed again the Mozarts went back to the old home Two years later after much self sacrifice the father took his boy to Italy for study The first day in Passion Week they went to the Sistine Chapel to hear the famous Miserere of Allegri which was considered so sacred that the musicians were forbidden to take home any part of it or copy it out of the chapel on pain of excommunication Wolfgang as soon as he reached his lodgings wrote it out from memory which remarkable feat for a boy of fourteen astonished all Rome So wonderfully did he play that the audience at Naples declared there was witchcraft in the ring which he wore on his left hand and he was obliged to remove it At Milan when he was nearly fifteen he composed the opera Mithridate conducting it himself which was given twenty nights in succession to enthusiastic audiences After this came requests for operas from Maria Theresa Munich and elsewhere He was busy every moment Overworked he was often ill but the need for money to meet heavy expenses made constant work a necessity All this time he wrote beautiful letters to his mother and sister Kiss mamma s hand for me a thousand billion times is the language of his loving heart He could scarcely be said to have had any childhood but he kept his tenderness and affection to the last of his life After their return to Salzburg finding the new archbishop even less cordial than the old the former had allowed Wolfgang the munificent salary of five dollars and a fourth yearly it was deemed wise to try to find a new field for employment The father now sixty years of age must earn a pittance for the family by giving music lessons while the mother accompanied the son to Paris The separation was a hard one for the devoted father who could not say good by to his idolized son and poor Nannerl wept the whole day long Mozart now twenty one and famous well repaid this affection by his pure character He wrote I have God always before me Whatever is according to his will is also according to mine therefore I cannot fail to be happy and contented Stopping for a time at Mannheim he attempted to gain the position of tutor to the elector s children but was disappointed Here he fell in love with Aloysia Weber a pretty girl of fifteen whose father a prompter at the National Theatre earned only two hundred dollars yearly for the support of his wife and six children The girl had a fine voice and Mozart blinded by love asked no higher joy than to write operas in which she might be the star The good old father who had spent all his life in helping his son to win fame was nearly heart broken when he learned of this foolish affection and wrote him tenderly but firmly Off with you to Paris get the great folks on your side aut Caesar aut nihil From Paris the name and fame of a man of great talent goes through the whole world The young man carrying out his childish motto God first and then papa reluctantly started for Paris Here he did not meet with great success for scores of applicants waited for every position His loving mother soon died perhaps from over economy in her cold dark lodgings and the young musician took his lonely way back to Salzburg begging his father s consent to his stopping at Mannheim to see the Webers Finding that Aloysia had gone upon the stage at Munich he hastened to see her She had been offered a good salary Meantime Mozart had won no new laurels at Paris He was small in stature and poor and the girl who wept at his departure a few months previously professed now scarcely to have seen his face before The young lover cut to the heart yet proud seated himself at the piano and played I leave the girl gladly who cares not for me and then hastened away to Salzburg Aloysia married a comedian and lived a most unhappy life gaining some fame from singing the music which Mozart wrote for her He remained at home for a year and a half till called to Munich to write the opera Idomeneo and later to Vienna Here unfortunately he met the Webers again and their father having died he boarded in their house and gave lessons to Constance a younger sister of Aloysia She was a plain good hearted girl without much energy but with a great appreciation of her gifted teacher The result came naturally he fell in love with the penniless girl and despite the distress of his aged father at his choice married her when he was twenty six and she eighteen Henceforward there was no hope of any thing save the direst poverty To marry without love is a grave mistake to marry simply for love is sometimes a mistake equally grave He could of course do nothing now for his aged father or sister Unsteady employment a rapidly increasing family and a wife ill most of the time made the struggle for existence ten times harder than before his marriage Once when he had prepared to visit his father for the first time after the wedding and had waited months for the necessary funds he was arrested for a debt of fifteen dollars just as he was stepping into the carriage The Emperor Joseph said to him one day Why did you not marry a rich wife With dignity Mozart at once replied Sire I trust that my genius will always enable me to support the woman I love but unfortunately it did not He wrote after his marriage The moment we were made one my wife as well as myself began to weep which touched every one even the priest and they all cried when they witnessed how our hearts were moved How little they dreamed that they should weep more seriously when hunger stared their six children in the face From the time of his marriage till his death nine years says reverend mister Haweis his life can be compared to nothing but a torch burning out rapidly in the wind It was a period of incessant astonishing labor He dedicated six quartets to his dear friend Joseph Haydn who said Mozart is the greatest composer who has ever lived wrote Figaro when he was twenty nine which had the greatest popularity Don Giovanni at thirty one and the Flauto Magico gratis for the benefit of the theatre director who was in want The two latter creations were hailed with delight Goethe wrote to Schiller later of Don Giovanni That piece stands entirely alone and Mozart s death has rendered all hope of any thing like it idle Whenever he appeared at the theatre he was called upon the stage from all parts of the house yet all this time he could not earn enough to live He received only a hundred dollars from his Don Giovanni and less for the others He gave lessons every hour he could spare concerts in the open air borrowed from his friends scrimped himself to send money to his sick wife at Baden pawned his silver plate to make one more unsuccessful journey to win the aid of indifferent princes and fainted often at his tasks after midnight Still he wrote to the best and dearest wife of my heart If I only had a letter from you all would be right and promised her to work harder than ever to earn money When Constance was at home with him if he left her in the morning before she awakened he would leave a note for her with the words Good morning my darling wife I shall be at home at o clock precisely Once when she had been ill for eight months and Mozart was composing beside her as she slept suddenly a noisy messenger entered Alarmed lest his wife should be disturbed he rose hastily when the penknife in his hand fell and buried itself in his foot Without a word escaping his lips he left the room a surgeon was called and though lame for some time the wife was not told of the accident His compositions found few purchasers for the people generally could not comprehend them Publishers shops were closed to him unless he would write in the popular style Then I can make no more by my pen he said bitterly and I had better starve and go to destruction at once So poor had his family become that with no fuel in the house he and his wife were found by a friend waltzing to keep warm About this time a sepulchral looking man called to ask that a Requiem be written on the death of the wife of an Austrian nobleman who was to be considered the author and thus his intense grief be shown though manifested through a lie Mozart consulted with his wife as was his custom and as she indorsed it he accepted the commission for fifty dollars Overworked harassed by debts which he could not pay hurt at the jealousies and intrigues of several musicians disappointed at the reception of his new opera at Prague his hopeful nature forsook him and he told Constance that the Requiem would be written for himself In the midst of this wretchedness their sixth child was born The poor wife forgot her own sorrows and prevailed upon him to give up work for a time but the active brain could not rest and he wrote as he lay on his sick bed On the day before he died Dec four seventeen ninety one at two o clock he persisted in having a portion of the Requiem sung by the friends who stood about his bed and joining with them in the alto burst into tears saying Did I not say that I was writing the Requiem for myself Soon after he said Constance oh that I could only hear my Flauto Magico and a friend playing it he was cheered A messenger now arrived to tell him that he was appointed organist at saint Stephen s Cathedral a position for which he had longed for years but it came too late Death was unwelcome to him Now must I go he said just as I should be able to live in peace I must leave my family my poor children at the very instant in which I should have been able to provide for their welfare Cold applications were ordered by the physicians for his burning head he became delirious for two hours and died at midnight only thirty five years old Constance was utterly prostrated and threw herself upon his bed hoping to die also Mozart s body was laid beside his piano and then in a pouring rain buried in a common grave in the plainest manner possible with nobody present except the keepers of the cemetery Weeks after when the wife visited the spot she found a new grave digger who could not tell where her beloved husband was buried and to this day the author of fourteen Italian operas seventeen symphonies and dozens of cantatas and serenades about eight hundred compositions in all sleeps in an unknown grave The Emperor Leopold aided her in a concert to raise fifteen hundred dollars to pay her husband s debts and provide a little for herself Eighteen years afterward she married the Danish councillor Baron von Missen who educated her two sons four other children having died Salzburg waited a half century before she erected a bronze statue to her world renowned genius in the Square of saint Michael and seventy years after his death Vienna built him a monument in the Cemetery of saint Mark History scarcely furnishes a more pathetic life He filled the world with music yet died in want and sorrow Illustration SAMUEL JOHNSON doctor SAMUEL JOHNSON In a quaint old house in Lichfield England now used as a draper s shop Samuel Johnson son of a poor bookseller and bookbinder was born Here as in Westminster Abbey a statue is erected to his memory Near by is the schoolhouse where Addison and Garrick studied When Samuel was two and a half years old diseased with scrofula his good mother with ten dollars sewed in her skirt so that nobody could steal it took him to London that with two hundred others he might be touched by Queen Anne and thus as superstitious people believed be healed On this journey she bought him a silver cup and spoon The latter he kept till his dying day and parted with the cup only in the dire poverty of later years The touch of the Queen did no good for he became blind in one eye with the other he could not see a friend half a yard off and his face was sadly disfigured Being prevented thus from sharing the sports of other boys much time was spent in reading He was first taught at a little school kept by Widow Oliver who years after when he was starting for Oxford brought him a present of gingerbread telling him he was the best scholar she ever had After a time he studied Latin under a master who whipped it into him The foolish teacher would ask the boy the Latin word for candlestick or some unexpected thing and then whip him saying This I do to save you from the gallows Naturally indolent Samuel had to struggle against this tendency He had however the greatest ambition to excel and to this he attributed his later success He was also inquisitive and had a wonderful memory When he wore short dresses his mother gave him the Prayer Book one day and pointing to the Collect said You must get this by heart She went up stairs but no sooner had she reached the second floor than she heard him following He could repeat it perfectly having looked it over but twice He left school at sixteen spending two years at home in helping his parents and studying earnestly One day his father being ill asked him to go to a neighboring town and take his place in selling books at a stall on market day He was proud and did not go Fifty years afterward in his greatness then an old man he went to this stall and with uncovered head remained for an hour in the rain where his father had formerly stood exposed to the sneers of the bystanders and the inclemency of the weather It showed the repentance of a noble soul for disobedience to a parent At nineteen he entered Pembroke College Oxford where he acted as servant He used to go daily to his friend Taylor and get lectures second hand till his feet showing through his worn out shoes were perceived by the students and he ceased going A rich young man secretly put a pair of new shoes at his door which he indignantly threw out of the window He was willing to work and earn but would not receive charity At the end of three years he became so poor that he was obliged to leave college his father dying soon after After various experiences he sought the position of usher at a school but was refused because it was thought that the boys would make fun of his ugliness He finally obtained such a place was treated with great harshness and left in a few months Strange to say the poor lonely scholar only twenty six now fell in love with a widow forty eight years old After obtaining his mother s consent he married her and the union proved a most happy one With the little money his wife possessed he started a school and advertised for pupils but only three came and the school soon closed In despair he determined to try London and see if an author could there earn his bread In that great city he lived for some time on nine cents a day One publisher to whom he applied suggested to him that the wisest course would be to become a porter and carry trunks A poem written at this time entitled London for which he received fifty dollars one line of which was in capital letters SLOW RISES WORTH BY POVERTY DEPRESSED attracted attention and Pope who was then at the height of his fame asked Dublin University to give to the able scholar the degree of M A that he might thus be able to take the principalship of a school and earn three hundred dollars a year but this was refused Out of such struggles come heroic souls When he was forty he published the Vanity of Human Wishes receiving seventy five dollars asserted by many to be the most impressive thing of its kind in the language The lines There mark what ills the scholar s life assail Toil envy want the patron and the jail show his struggles A drama soon after played by the great actor David Garrick brought him nearly a thousand dollars but the play itself was a failure When asked by his friends how he felt about his ill success he replied Like the monument meaning that he continued firm and unmoved like a column of granite Fame was coming at last after he had struggled in London for thirteen years and what bitterness they had brought For two years he worked almost constantly on a paper called the Rambler When his wife said that well as she had thought of him before she had never considered him equal to this he was more pleased than with any praise he ever received She died three days after the last copy was published and Johnson was utterly prostrated He buried himself in hard work in his garret a most inconvenient room but he said In that room I never saw missus Johnson Her wedding ring was placed in a little box and tenderly kept till his death Three years afterward his great work his Dictionary appeared for which he received eight thousand dollars but as he had been obliged to employ six assistants for seven years he was still poor but now famous The Universities of Oxford and Dublin when he no longer needed their assistance hastened to bestow their degrees upon him Even George III invited him to the royal palace a strange contrast to a few years before when Samuel Johnson was under arrest for a debt of thirty dollars When asked by Reynolds how he had obtained his accuracy and flow of language in conversation he replied By trying to do my best on every occasion and in every company About this time his aged mother died and in the evenings of one week to defray her funeral expenses he wrote Rasselas and received five hundred dollars for it He wrote in his last letter to her You have been the best mother and I believe the best woman in the world I thank you for your indulgence to me and beg forgiveness of all that I have done ill and of all that I have omitted to do well His last great work was The Lives of the Poets He received now a pension of fifteen hundred dollars a year for his valuable services to literature but never used more than four hundred dollars for himself He took care of a blind woman of whom he said She was a friend to my poor wife and was in the house when she died she has remained in it ever since of a mother and daughter dependent upon an old family physician and of two men whom nobody else would care for Once when he found a poor woman on the street late at night he took her home and kept her till she was restored to health His pockets were always filled with pennies for street Arabs and if he found poor children asleep on a threshold he would slip money into their hands that when they awakened they might buy a breakfast When a servant was dying who had been in the family for forty three years he prayed with her and kissed her the tears falling down his cheeks He wrote in his diary We kissed and parted I humbly hope to meet again and part no more He held rightly that Christianity levels all distinctions of rank He was very tender to animals Once when in Wales a gardener brought into the house a hare which had been caught in the potatoes and was told to give it to the cook doctor Johnson asked to have it placed in his arms then taking it to the window he let it go shouting to it to run as fast as possible He would buy oysters for his cat Hodge that the servants from seeing his fondness for it might be led to treat it kindly He died at the age of seventy five such men as Burke and Reynolds standing by his bedside Of the latter he begged that he would read his Bible and never paint on Sundays His last words were to a young lady who had asked his blessing God bless you my dear He was buried with appropriate honors in Westminster Abbey and monuments are erected to him in saint Paul s Cathedral and at Lichfield The poor boy nearly blind became the brightest ornament of the eighteenth century OLIVER GOLDSMITH On a low slab in a quiet spot just north of the Church of Knight Templars in London are the simple words Here lies Oliver Goldsmith The author of the Vicar of Wakefield needs no grander monument for he lives in the hearts of the people Oliver Goldsmith was born in Pallas Ireland in seventeen twenty eight the son of a poor minister who by means of tilling some fields and assisting in a parish outside his own earned two hundred dollars a year for his wife and seven children When about six years old Oliver nearly died of smallpox and his pitted face made him an object of jest among the boys At eight he showed great fondness for books and began to write verses His mother pleaded for a college education for him but there seemed little prospect of it One day when a few were dancing at his uncle s house the little boy sprang upon the floor and began to dance The fiddler to make fun of his short figure and homely face exclaimed AEsop The boy stung to the quick replied Heralds proclaim aloud all saying See AEsop dancing and his monkey playing when of course the fiddler became much chagrined Illustration OLIVER GOLDSMITH All his school life Oliver was painfully diffident but a good scholar His father finally earned a better salary and the way seemed open for college when lo his sister who had the opportunity of marrying a rich man was obliged so thought the public opinion of the day to have a marriage portion of two thousand dollars and poor Oliver s educational hopes were blasted He must now enter Trinity College Dublin as a sizar servant wear a coarse black gown without sleeves a red cap the badge of servitude sweep the courts carry dishes and be treated with contempt which nearly crushed his sensitive nature A year and a half later his father died and his scanty means ceased from that source To keep from starving he wrote ballads selling them to street musicians at one dollar twenty five cents apiece and stole out at night to hear them sung Often he shared this pittance with some one more wretched than himself One cold night he gave his blankets to a person with five children and crawled into the ticking of his bed for warmth When a kind friend who often brought him food came in the morning he was obliged to break in the door as Goldsmith could not extricate himself from his bed Obtaining a small scholarship he gave a little party in his room in honor of the event A savage tutor appeared in the midst of the festivities and knocked him down So incensed was Goldsmith that he ran away from college and with twenty five cents in his pocket started for Cork For three days he lived on eight cents a day and by degrees parted with nearly all his clothes for food Though wholly unfitted for the ministry Goldsmith was urged by his relatives to enter the church because he would then have a living Too young to be accepted he remained at home for two years assisting his brother Henry in the village school and then offering himself as a candidate was refused it was said because he appeared before the right reverend in scarlet trousers After being tutor for a year his uncle gave him two hundred fifty dollars that he might go to Dublin and study law On arriving he met an old friend lost all his money in playing cards with him and ashamed and penniless returned and begged the forgiveness of his relative A little more money was given him and with this he studied medicine in Edinburgh for over a year earning later some money by teaching Afterward he travelled in Italy and France begging his way by singing or playing on his flute at the doors of the peasants returning to England at twenty eight years of age without a cent in his pocket Living among the beggars in Axe Lane he asked to spread plasters or pound in the mortars of the apothecaries till finally a chemist hired him out of pity Through the aid of a fellow student he finally opened a doctor s office but few came to a stranger and these usually so poor as to be unable to pay Attending one day upon a workman he held his hat close to his breast so as to cover a big patch in his second hand clothes while he felt the patient s pulse Half guessing the young doctor s poverty the sick man told him about his master the author of the famous old novel Clarissa Harlowe and how he had befriended writers Goldsmith at once applied for work and became press corrector in Salisbury Court Fleet Street Later he was employed as a reviewer on a magazine Being obliged to submit all his reviews to an illiterate bookseller and his wife the engagement soon came to an end He lived now in a garret was dunned even for his milk bill wrote a book for a college friend under whose name it was published and began a work of his own Polite Learning in Europe writing to a wealthy relative for aid to publish which letter was never answered though it was greatly regretted after Goldsmith became famous With no hope in London he was promised a position in the East Indies Life began to look bright though his Fleet Street garret with one chair was surrounded by swarms of children and dirt The promise was not kept and he applied for the position of hospital mate His clothes being too poor for him to be seen on the streets he pledged the money to be received for four articles bought a new suit went up to the court of examiners and was rejected Had any of these positions been obtained the world doubtless would never have known the genius of Oliver Goldsmith He went back to his garret to write pawned his clothes to pay the landlady who was herself to be turned out of the wretched lodgings sold his Life of Voltaire for twenty dollars and published his Polite Learning in Europe anonymously The critics attacked it and Goldsmith s day of fame had dawned at last The Citizen of the World a good natured satire on society next appeared and was a success doctor Johnson became his friend and made him a member of his club with Reynolds Burke and other noted men The Traveller was next published with an immense sale Goldsmith now moved into the buildings which bear his name near Temple Church and for once had flowers and green grass to look out upon He was still poor doubtless spending what money he received with little wisdom His landlady arrested him for room rent upon hearing which doctor Johnson came at once to see him gave him money took from his desk the manuscript of the Vicar of Wakefield and sold it to a publisher for three hundred dollars This was the fruit of much labor and the world received it cordially Some of his essays were now reprinted sixteen times What a change from the Fleet Street garret The Deserted Village was published five years later Goldsmith having spent two whole years in reviewing it after it was written so careful was he that every word should be the best that could be chosen This was translated at once into German by Goethe who was also a great admirer of the Vicar of Wakefield He also wrote an English History a Roman a Grecian several dramas of which She Stoops to Conquer was the most popular and eight volumes of the History of the Earth and Animated Nature for which he received five hundred dollars a volume leaving this unfinished Still in debt overworked laboring sometimes far into the morning hours not leaving his desk for weeks together even for exercise Goldsmith died at forty five broken with the struggle of life but with undying fame When he was buried one April day seventeen seventy four Brick Court and the stairs of the building were filled with the poor and the forsaken whom he had befriended His monument is in the Poets Corner at Westminster Abbey the greatest honor England could offer True she let him nearly starve but she crowned him at the last He conquered the world by hard work kindness and a gentleness as beautiful as his genius was great MICHAEL FARADAY In the heart of busy London over a stable lived James and Margaret Faraday with their four little children The father was a blacksmith in feeble health unable to work for a whole day at a time a kind good man to his household the mother like himself was uneducated but neat and industrious and devoted to her family The children learned the rudiments of reading writing and arithmetic at school and then of course were obliged to earn their living Michael the third child born seventeen ninety one became at thirteen years of age an errand boy in a bookseller s shop His first duty was to carry newspapers in the morning to customers who read them for an hour or two for a trifle a penny probably and then gave them to the newsboy to be re loaned Often on Sunday morning the patrons would say You must call again forgetting that the next place might be a mile away and that the young boy was quite as desirous as they to go to church with his parents Years after this when he had become famous the world over he said I always feel a tenderness for those boys because I once carried newspapers myself Illustration MICHAEL FARADAY The following year eighteen oh five he was apprenticed to a bookseller for seven years to learn the trade of binding and selling books Here was hard work before him till he was twenty one not a cheerful prospect for one who loved play as well as other boys Whenever he had a spare moment he was looking inside the books he was binding missus Marcet s Conversations in Chemistry delighted him and when he was given the Encyclopedia Britannica to bind the article on Electricity seemed a treasure house of wonders He soon made an electrical machine not an expensive one simply a glass vial and other apparatus of a similar kind and afterwards with a real cylinder These cost only a few pence a week but they gave a vast amount of pleasure to the blacksmith s son One day he saw in a shop window a notice that a mister Tatum was to give at his own house some lectures on Natural Philosophy The charge for each was twenty five cents No bookseller s apprentice would have such an amount of money to spend weekly as that However his brother Robert three years older himself a blacksmith with some pride perhaps that Michael was interested in such weighty matters furnished the money and a lodger at the home of the bookseller taught him drawing so that he might be able in taking notes to illustrate the experiments He attended the lectures wrote them out carefully in a clear hand bound them in four volumes and dedicated them to his employer A customer at the shop had become interested in a boy who cared so much for science and took him to hear four lectures given by Sir Humphry Davy at the Royal Institution This was an unexpected pleasure He was beginning to sigh for something beyond book binding Oh if I could only help in some scientific work no matter how humble he thought to himself He says in his journal In my ignorance of the world and simplicity of my mind I wrote to Sir Joseph Banks President of the Royal Society No answer was ever returned to the request for a situation Could the president have realized that some day ten thousand people would know the name of Michael Faraday where one knew the name of Sir Joseph Banks probably he would have answered the boy s letter Blessings on the great man or woman who takes time however briefly to answer every letter received Such a man was Garfield and such is Whittier A civil question demands a civil answer whether the person addressed be king or peasant About the time his apprenticeship ended in eighteen twelve he summoned courage to write directly to the great Sir Humphry Davy sending the full notes he had made at that gentleman s lectures Sir Humphry possibly remembering that he too had been a poor boy the son of a widowed milliner wrote a polite note saying that Science was a harsh mistress and in a pecuniary point of view but poorly rewarding those who devoted themselves to her service that he was going out of town but would see if he could some time aid him Meantime Michael was making crude galvanic experiments He bought some malleable zinc cut out seven plates each the size of a half penny covered these with the copper half pennies placing between them six pieces of paper soaked in a solution of muriate of soda and with this simple battery decomposed sulphate of magnesia So pleased was he that he wrote a letter to one of his boy friends telling of the experiment and adding Time is all I require Oh that I could purchase at a cheap rate some of our modern gent s spare hours nay days I think it would be a good bargain both for them and for me The youth had learned the first secret of success not to waste time not to throw it away on useless persons or useless subjects He had learned another secret that of choosing right companions To this same young friend Abbott he wrote A companion cannot be a good one unless he is morally so I have met a good companion in the lowest path of life and I have found such as I despised in a rank far superior to mine I keep regular hours and enter not intentionally into pleasures productive of evil London s highest circles possessed no purer spirit than this young mechanic Faraday now began work at his trade of book binding for a Frenchman in London who having no children promised him the business if he would remain with him always but the employer s temper was so hasty that the position became almost unbearable The young man was growing depressed in spirits when one night just as he was preparing for bed a loud knock on the door startled him On looking out of the window he espied a grand carriage with a footman in livery who left a note This was a request from Sir Humphry Davy to see him in the morning Was there then the possibility of a place in the Royal Institution Between conflicting hopes and fears he went to sleep and in the morning hastened to see the great chemist The result was an engagement at six dollars a week with two rooms at the top of the house He was to clean the instruments move them to and from the lecture room and in all ways to make himself useful Now he could say good by to book binding and though six dollars a week was not a munificent sum yet he could actually handle beautiful instruments not copper half pence and bits of zinc and could listen to stimulating lectures And now work began in earnest He joined the City Philosophical Society an association of thirty or forty persons in moderate circumstances who met each Wednesday evening one of their number giving a lecture Then a half dozen friends came together once a week to read criticise and correct each other in pronunciation and conversation How eagerly would such a young man have attended college There was no opportunity to hear polished talk in elegant drawing rooms no chance to improve manners in so called best society He did what is in the power of everybody he educated himself Did he not need recreation after the hard day s work Every person has to make his choice Amusements do not make scholars pleasure and knowledge do not go hand in hand Faraday chose the topmost story of the Royal Institution and books for companions and immortal fame was the result The experiments with Davy soon became absorbing and often dangerous Now they extracted sugar from beet root now they treated chloride of nitrogen wearing masks of glass upon their faces which notwithstanding were sometimes badly cut by the explosions Seven months after this Sir Humphry decided to travel upon the Continent and asked Faraday to be his amanuensis This was a rare opportunity for the young assistant For a year and a half they visited France Switzerland Italy and Germany climbing Vesuvius enjoying art galleries and meeting the learned and famous of the age The journey had its disagreeable side for Faraday was made more or less a servant by Davy and his sometimes inconsiderate wife but it had great and lasting advantages for one who had never been but twelve miles from London His heart turned longingly back to the poor ones he had left behind He wrote to his mother The first and last thing in my mind is England home and friends When sick when cold when tired the thoughts of those at home are a warm and refreshing balm to my heart These are the first and greatest sweetness in the life of man I am almost contented except with my ignorance which becomes more visible to me every day And again I have several times been more than half decided to return hastily home I am only restrained by the wish of improvement To his sister he wrote Give my love with a kiss to mother the first thing you do on reading this letter and tell her how much I think of her To Abbott he wrote something intended for his eyes only but headed I do not wish that my mother should remain ignorant of it I have no secrets from her His heart bounded with joy at the prospect of meeting them again and enjoying the pleasure of their conversation from which he had been excluded No absorption in science could make him outgrow his parents and his humble home On his return to England his salary was increased to five hundred dollars yearly and he was promoted to Laboratory Assistant He was now twenty four He had noted carefully Davy s researches in iodine and chlorine had seen him develop his safety lamp which has proved an untold blessing to miners had made many experiments from his own thinking and now he too was to give his first course of six lectures before his friends in the City Philosophical Society on Chemical Affinity and kindred topics He wrote them out with great care for whatever he did was well done This year he published his first paper in the Quarterly Journal of Science on caustic lime Encouraged by the approving words of Sir Humphry the following year he wrote six papers for the Quarterly giving his experiments with gases and minerals and gave another course of lectures before the Philosophical Society To improve himself in delivering these he attended lectures on oratory taking copious notes Seven years had now gone by in his apprenticeship to Science He had published thirty seven papers in the Quarterly had a book ready for the press on the alloys of steel and had read a paper before the Royal Society itself on two new compounds of chlorine and carbon and a new compound of iodine carbon and hydrogen But the young and now brilliant student had other weighty matters in hand Five years before this he had written in his diary What is t that comes in false deceitful guise Making dull fools of those that fore were wise Tis love What s that the wise man always strives to shun Though still it ever o er the world has run Tis love But now whether he tried to shun it or no he became thoroughly in love with Sarah Barnard an intelligent and sweet tempered girl the daughter of a silversmith Distracted by fears lest he might not win her he wrote her In whatever way I can best minister to your happiness either by assiduity or by absence it shall be done Do not injure me by withdrawing your friendship or punish me for aiming to be more than a friend by making me less The girl showed this to her father who replied that love made philosophers say very foolish things She hesitated about accepting him and went away to the seaside to consider it but the ardent lover followed determined to learn the worst if need be They walked on the cliffs overhanging the ocean and Faraday wrote in his journal as the day drew near its close My thoughts saddened and fell from the fear I should never enjoy such happiness again I could not master my feelings or prevent them from sinking and I actually at last shamed myself by moist eyes He blamed himself because he did not know the best means to secure the heart he wished to gain He knew how to fathom the depths of chemical combinations but he could not fathom the depths of Sarah Barnard s heart At last the hour of her decision came and both were made supremely happy by it A week later he wrote her Every moment offers me fresh proof of the power you have over me I could not at one time have thought it possible that I that any man could have been under the dominion of feelings so undivided and so intense now I think that no other man can have felt or feel as I do A year later they were married very quietly he desiring their wedding day to be just like any other day Twenty eight years later he wrote among the important dates and discoveries of his life June twelve eighteen twenty one he married an event which more than any other contributed to his earthly happiness and healthful state of mind The union has nowise changed except in the depth and strength of its character For forty seven years his dear Sarah made life a joy to him He rarely left home but if so as at the great gathering of British Scientists at Birmingham he wrote back After all there is no pleasure like the tranquil pleasure of home and here even here the moment I leave the table I wish I were with you IN QUIET Oh what happiness is ours My runs into the world in this way only serve to make me esteem that happiness the more And now came twenty years in science that made Faraday the wonder and ornament of his age Elected an F R S he began at once twelve lectures in Chemical Manipulation before the London Institution six on Chemical Philosophy before the Royal Society published six papers on electromagnetism and began a course of juvenile lectures which continued for nineteen years This was one of the beautiful things of Faraday s life a great man living in a whirl of work yet taking time to make science plain to the young When asked at what age he would teach science he replied that he had never found a child too young to understand him For twenty years he lectured at the Royal Academy at Woolwich became scientific adviser to the government with regard to lighthouses and buoys not for gain but for the public good drew all London to his eloquent lectures with his brilliant experiments Prince Albert attending with his sons and published one hundred and fifty eight scientific essays and thirty series of Experimental Researches in Electricity which latter says doctor Gladstone form one of the most marvellous monuments of intellectual work one of the rarest treasure houses of newly discovered knowledge with which the world has ever been enriched He not only gathered into his vast brain what other men had learned of science but he tested every step to prove the facts and became says Professor Tyndall the greatest experimental philosopher the world has ever seen He loved science as he loved his family and his God and played with Nature as with a petted child When he lectured there was a gleaming in his eyes which no painter could copy and which no poet could describe His audience took fire with him and every face was flushed In his earlier discoveries in compressing gases into liquids he obtained from one thousand cubic feet of coal gas one gallon of fluid from which he distilled benzine In eighteen forty five the chemist Hofman found this same substance in coal tar from which come our beautiful aniline dyes After eighteen years of studying the wonderful results of Galvani s discovery at the University of Bologna that the legs of a dead frog contract under the electric current and of Volta in seventeen ninety nine with his voltaic pile of copper zinc and leather in salt water and of Christian Oersted at the University of Copenhagen and Ampere and Arago that electricity will produce magnets Faraday made the great discovery of magneto electricity that magnets will produce electricity At once magneto electric machines were made for generating electricity for the electric light electro plating et cetera This discovery says Professor Tyndall is the greatest experimental result ever attained by an investigator the Mont Blanc of Faraday s achievements Soon after he made another great discovery that of electric induction or that one electric current will induce another current in an adjoining wire Others had suspected this but had sought in vain to prove it The Bell telephone which Sir William Thompson calls the wonder of wonders depends upon this principle Here no battery is required for the vibration of a thin iron plate is made to generate the currents After this Faraday proved that the various kinds of electricity are identical and that the electricity of the Voltaic pile is produced by chemical action and not by contact of metals as Volta had supposed The world meantime had showered honors upon the great scientist Great Britain had made him her idol The Cambridge Philosophical Society the Institution of Civil Engineers of British Architects of Philosophy and of Medicine and the leading associations of Scotland had made him an honorary member Paris had elected him corresponding member of all her great societies saint Petersburg Copenhagen Stockholm Berlin Palermo Modena Lisbon Heidelberg Frankfort and our own Boston and Philadelphia had sent tokens of admiration Eminent men from all the world came to see him How proud his mother must have felt at this wonderful success She was not able to enter into her son s pursuits from lack of early education but she talked much about him calling him ever my Michael and would do nothing whatever without his advice He supported her in her declining years and she seemed perfectly happy His father had died in his boyhood but Faraday ever honored his occupation He used to say I love a smith shop and anything relating to smithing My father was a blacksmith He was now forty nine The overtaxed brain refused to work longer Memory was losing her grasp and but for the sweet and careful presence of Sarah Faraday the life work would doubtless have been finished at this time She took him to Switzerland where he walked beside the lakes and over the mountains with my companion dear wife and partner in all things For four years he made scarcely any experiments in original research and then the tired brain seemed to regain its wonted power and go on to other discoveries An Italian philosopher Morichini was the first to announce the magnetizing power of the solar rays missus Somerville covered one half of a sewing needle with paper and exposed the other half to the violet rays In two hours the exposed end had acquired magnetism Faraday by long and difficult experiments showed the converse of this he magnetized a ray of light an experiment high beautiful and alone says mister Tyndall He also showed the magnetic condition of all matter He was always at work He entered the laboratory in the morning and often worked till eleven at night hardly stopping for his meals He seldom went into society for time was too precious If he needed a change he read aloud Shakspeare Byron or Macaulay to his wife in the evening or corresponded with Herschel Humboldt and other great men In the midst of exhausting labors he often preached on the Sabbath believing more earnestly in the word of God the more he studied science When he was sixty four the great brain began to show signs of decline Belgium Munich Vienna Madrid Rome Naples Turin Rotterdam Upsala Lombardy and Moscow had sent him medals or made him a member of their famous societies Napoleon III made him commander of the Legion of Honor a rare title and the French exhibition awarded him the grand medal of honor The Queen asked him to dine with her at Windsor Castle and at the request of Prince Albert her husband she presented him with a lovely home at Hampton Court At seventy one he wrote to missus Faraday from Glasgow My head is full and my heart also but my recollection rapidly fails You will have to resume your old function of being a pillow to my mind and a rest a happy making wife Still he continued to make able reports to the government on lighthouses electric machines steam engines and the like And then for two years the memory grew weaker the body feebler and he was as he told a friend just waiting He died in his chair in his study August twenty fifth eighteen sixty seven and was buried in Highgate Cemetery Westminster Abbey would have opened her doors to him but he requested to be buried in the simplest earthly place with a gravestone of the most ordinary kind On a plain marble slab in the midst of clustering ivy are his name and the dates of his birth and death One feels a strange tenderness of heart as he stands beside this sacred spot where rests one who though elected to seventy societies and offered nearly one hundred titles and tokens of honor said he would remain plain Michael Faraday to the last Wonderful man great in mind noble in heart and gentle in manner having brought a strong nature under the most complete discipline His energy his devotion to a single object his untiring work and his beautiful character carried the blacksmith s son to the highest success SIR HENRY BESSEMER A little way from London England at Denmark Hill looking toward the Crystal Palace is a mansion which is fit for royalty The grounds covering from thirty to forty acres are beautifully terraced dotted here and there with lakelets fountains and artificial caverns while the great clumps of red rhododendron yellow laburnum pink hawthorne and white laurel make an exquisitely colored picture The home itself is spacious and inviting with its elegant conservatory and rare works of art The owner of this house Sir Henry Bessemer is cordial and gracious and from his genial face and manner no one would imagine that his life had been one long struggle with obstacles Born in Charlton a little county town in Hertfordshire Jan nineteen eighteen thirteen he received the rudiments of an education like other boys in the neighborhood His father Anthony Bessemer an inventor seeing that his son was inclined to mechanics bought him in London a five inch foot lathe and a book which described the art of turning Day after day in the quiet of his country home he studied and practised turning and modelling in clay Illustration SIR HENRY BESSEMER At eighteen years of age he went to London knowing no one he says and myself unknown a mere cipher in a vast sea of human enterprise He soon found a place to work as modeller and designer engraving a large number of original designs on steel with a diamond point for patent medicine labels A year later he exhibited one of his models at the Royal Academy His inventive brain and observing eye were always alert in some new direction Having ascertained that the Government lost thousands of pounds annually by the transfer of adhesive stamps from old deeds to new ones he determined to devise a stamp which could not be used twice For several months he worked earnestly at night after his daily tasks were over and in secret thinking how richly the Government would reward him if he succeeded At last he produced a die of unique design which perforated a parchment deed with four hundred little holes He hastened to the Stamp officials to show his work They were greatly pleased and asked him which he preferred for his reward a sum of money or the position of Superintendent of Stamps with a salary of three or four thousand dollars a year He delightedly chose the latter as that would make him comfortable for life There was another reason for his delight for being engaged to be married he would have no solicitude now about daily needs life would flow on as smoothly as a river At once he visited the young lady and told her of his great success She listened eagerly and then said Yes I understand this but surely if all stamps had a date put upon them they could not at a future time be used without detection His spirits fell He confessed afterward that while he felt pleased and proud of the clever and simple suggestion of the young lady he saw also that all his more elaborate system the result of months of toil was shattered to pieces by it What need for four hundred holes in a die when a single date was more effective He soon worked out a die with movable dates and with frankness and honor presented it before the Government officials They saw its preferableness the new plan was adopted by Act of Parliament the old stamps were called in and new ones issued and then the young inventor was informed that his services as Superintendent of Stamps at three thousand dollars a year were not needed But surely the Government which was to save a half million dollars a year would repay him for his months of labor and thought Associations like individuals are very apt to forget favors when once the desired end is attained The Premier had resigned and after various promises and excuses a lawyer in the Stamp Office informed him that he made the new stamp of his own free will and there was no money to be given him Sad and dispirited and with a burning sense of injustice overpowering all other feelings says young Bessemer I went my way from the Stamp Office too proud to ask as a favor that which was indubitably my right Alas that he must learn thus early the selfishness of the world But he took courage for had he not made one real invention and it must be in his power to make others When he was twenty five he produced a type casting machine but so opposed was it by the compositors that it was finally abandoned He also invented a machine for making figured Utrecht velvet and some of his productions were used in the state apartments of Windsor Castle A little later his attention was accidentally called to bronze powder he having bought a small portion to ornament his sister s album The powder made in Germany cost only twenty two cents a pound in the raw material and sold for twenty two dollars Here was a wonderful profit Why could he not discover the process of making it He worked for eighteen months trying all sorts of experiments and failed But failure to a great mind never really means failure so after six months he tried again and succeeded He knew little about patents had been recently defrauded by the Government and he determined that this discovery should be kept a secret He made a small apparatus and worked it himself sending out a travelling man with the product That which cost him less than one dollar was sold for eighteen A fortune seemed now really within his grasp A friend assured of his success put fifty thousand dollars into the business Immediately Bessemer made plans of all the machinery required sent various parts to as many different establishments lest his secret be found out and then put the pieces of his self acting machines together Five assistants were engaged at high wages under pledge of secrecy At first he made one thousand per cent profit and now in these later years the profit is three hundred per cent Three of the assistants have died and mister Bessemer has turned over the business and the factory to the other two The secret of making the bronze powder has never been told Even mister Bessemer s oldest son had reached manhood before he ever entered the locked room where it was made For ten years the inventor now turned his attention to the construction of railway carriages centrifugal pumps et cetera His busy brain could not rest When frequent explosions in coal mines occasioned discussion throughout the country he made at large expense a working model for ventilating mines and offered to explain it to a committee of the House of Commons His offer was declined with thanks A little investigation on the part of great statesmen would have been scarcely out of place At the great exhibition in London in eighteen fifty one he exhibited several machines one for grinding and polishing plate glass and another for draining in an hour an acre of land covered with water a foot deep The crowd looked at them called the inventor the ingenious mister Bessemer and passed on Two years later he made some improvements in war implements and submitted his plans to the Woolwich Arsenal but they were declined without thanks even Some other men might have become discouraged but mister Bessemer knew that obstacles only strengthen and develop men The improved ordnance having been brought to the knowledge of Napoleon III he encouraged the inventor and furnished the money to carry forward the experiments While the guns were being tested at Vincennes an officer remarked If you cannot get stronger metal for your guns such heavy projectiles will be of little use And then mister Bessemer began to ask himself if he could not improve iron But he had never studied metallurgy This however did not deter him for he immediately obtained the best books on the subject and visited the iron making districts Then he bought an old factory at Baxter House where Richard Baxter used to live and began to experiment for himself After a whole year of labor he succeeded in greatly improving cast iron making it almost as white as steel Could he not improve steel also For eighteen months he built and pulled down one furnace after another at great expense At last the idea struck him he says of making cast iron malleable by forcing air into the metal when in a fluid state cast iron being a combination of iron and carbon When oxygen is forced in it unites with the carbon and thus the iron is left nearly pure The experiment was tried at the factory in the midst of much trepidation as the union of the compressed air and the melted iron produced an eruption like a volcano but when the combustion was over the result was steel Astonished and delighted after two years and a half of labor Bessemer at once took out a patent and the following week by request Aug eleven eighteen fifty six read a paper before the British Association on The manufacture of malleable iron and steel without fuel There was great ridicule made beforehand Said one leading steel maker to another I want you to go with me this morning There is a fellow who has come down from London to read a paper on making steel from cast iron without fuel Ha ha ha The paper was published in the Times and created a great sensation Crowds hastened to Baxter House to see the wonderful process In three weeks mister Bessemer had sold one hundred thousand dollars worth of licenses to make steel by the new and rapid method Fame as well as great wealth seemed now assured when lo in two months it being found that only certain kinds of iron could be worked the newspapers began to ridicule the new invention and scientists and business men declared the method visionary and worse than useless mister Bessemer collected a full portfolio of these scathing criticisms but he was not the man to be disconcerted or cast down Again he began the labor of experimenting and found that phosphorus in the iron was the real cause of the failure For three long years he pursued his investigations His best friends tried to make him desist from what the world had proved to be an impracticable thing Sometimes he almost distrusted himself and thought he would give up trying and then the old desire came back more strongly than ever At last success was really assured but nobody would believe it Every one said Oh this is the thing which made such a blaze two or three years ago and which was a failure mister Bessemer took several hundredweight of the new steel to some Manchester friends that their workmen might try it without knowing from whence it came They detected no difference between this which cost thirty dollars a ton and what they were then using at three hundred dollars a ton But nobody wanted to buy the new steel Two years went by in this fruitless urging for somebody to take up the manufacture of the new metal Finally Bessemer induced a friend to unite with him and they erected works and began to make steel At first the dealers would buy only twenty or thirty pounds then the demand steadily increased At last the large manufacturers awoke to the fact that Bessemer was underselling them by one hundred dollars a ton and they hastened to pay a royalty for making steel by the new process But all obstacles were not yet overcome The Government refused to make steel guns the shipbuilders were afraid to touch it and when the engineer of the London and North western Railway was asked to use steel rails he exclaimed excitedly mister Bessemer do you wish to see me tried for manslaughter Now steel rails are used the world over at the same cost as iron formerly and are said to last twenty times as long as iron rails Prejudice at last wore away and in eighteen sixty six the Bessemer process the conversion of crude iron into steel by forcing cold air through it for fifteen or twenty minutes was bringing to its inventor an income of five hundred thousand dollars a year Fame had now come as well as wealth In eighteen seventy four he was made President of the Iron and Steel Institute to succeed the Duke of Devonshire The Institute of Civil Engineers gave him the Telford Gold Medal the Society of Arts the Albert Gold Medal Sweden made him honorary member of her Iron Board Hamburg gave him the freedom of the city and the Emperor of Austria conferred upon him the honor of Knight Commander of the Order of Francis Joseph sending a complimentary letter in connection with the jewelled cross and circular collar of the order Napoleon III wished to give him the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor but the English Government would not permit him to wear it the Emperor therefore presented him in person with a gold medal weighing twelve ounces Berlin and the King of Wurtemburg sent him gold medals In eighteen seventy nine he was made Fellow of the Royal Society and the same year was knighted by Queen Victoria In eighteen eighty the freedom of the city of London was presented to him in a gold casket the only other great discoverers who have received this distinction being doctor Jenner who introduced vaccination and Sir Rowland Hill the author of penny postage In the United States which gives no ribbons or decorations Indiana has appropriately named a flourishing town after him It is estimated that Sir Henry Bessemer s one discovery of making steel has saved the world in the last twenty one years above five thousand million dollars When his patent expired in eighteen seventy he had received in royalties over five million dollars In his steel works at Sheffield after buying in all the licenses sold in eighteen fifty six when the new process seemed a failure the profits every two months equalled the original capital or in fourteen years the company increased the original capital eighty one times by the profits How wise it proved that the country lad did not obtain the permanent position of superintendent of stamps at three thousand dollars a year Rich beyond his highest hopes the friend of such eminent and progressive men as the King of the Belgians who visits Denmark Hill Sir Henry has not ceased his inventions Knowing the terrors of sea sickness he designed a great swinging saloon seventy feet by thirty in the midst of a sea going vessel named the Bessemer The experiment cost one hundred thousand dollars but has not yet proved successful In eighteen seventy seven when sixty four years old he began to devote himself to the study of Herschel s works on optics and has since constructed an immense and novel telescope which magnifies five thousand times The instrument is placed in a comfortable observatory so that the investigator can either sit or stand while making his observations The observing room with its floor windows and dome revolve and keep pace automatically with every motion of the telescope This is accomplished by hydraulic power No wonder that Bessemer has been called the great captain of modern civilization He has revolutionized one of the most important of the world s industries he has fought obstacles at every step poverty the ridicule of the press the indifference of his countrymen and the cupidity of men who would steal his inventions or appropriate the results He has earned leisure but he rarely takes it His has been a life of labor prosecuted with indomitable will and energy He has taken out one hundred and twenty patents for which the specifications and drawings fill seven large volumes all made by himself The world had at last come to know and honor the boy who came to London at the age of eighteen a mere cipher in a vast sea of human enterprise He made his way to greatness unaided save by his helpful wife Sir Henry died on the fifteenth of March eighteen ninety eight leaving an immense fortune which nevertheless was not inordinate when compared with the services rendered by him to mankind and a stainless name The unfair treatment which had embittered his earlier days had been atoned for by the Queen granting him a title in recognition of his invention accepted by the Post Office and he had come to be regarded as one of the greatest benefactors of modern times Such a life crowned with such a success is calculated to be a mighty inspiration to every ambitious youth SIR TITUS SALT I spent a day with great interest in visiting the worsted mills and warehouses at Saltaire just out from Bradford England which cover about ten acres The history of the proprietor Sir Titus Salt reads like a romance A poor boy the son of a plain Yorkshire man at nineteen in a loose blouse he was sorting and washing wool a little later a good salesman a faithful Christian worker and the superintendent of a Sunday school At thirty three happening to be in Liverpool he observed on the docks some huge pieces of dirty looking alpaca wool They had long lain in the warehouses and becoming a nuisance to the owners were soon to be reshipped to Peru Young Salt took away a handful of the wool in his handkerchief scoured and combed it and was amazed at its attractive appearance His father and friends advised him strongly to have nothing to do with the dirty stuff as he could sell it to no one and if he attempted to make cloth from it himself he ran a great risk of failure Finally he said I am going into this alpaca affair right and left and I ll either make myself a man or a mouse Illustration SIR TITUS SALT Returning to Liverpool he bought the whole three hundred bales for a small sum and toiled diligently till proper machinery was made for the new material The result was a great success In three years over two million pounds of alpaca wool were imported and now four million pounds are brought to Bradford alone Employment was soon furnished to thousands laborers coming from all over Great Britain and Germany Ten years later mister Salt was made mayor of Bradford ten years after this a member of Parliament and ten years later still a baronet by Queen Victoria a great change from the boy in his soiled coarse blouse but he deserved it all He was a remarkable man in many ways Even when worth his millions and giving lavishly on every hand he would save blank leaves and scraps of paper for writing and lay them aside for future use He was an early riser always at the works before the engines were started It used to be said of him Titus Salt makes a thousand pounds before others are out of bed He was punctual to the minute most exact and unostentatious After he was knighted it was no uncommon thing for him to take a poor woman and her baby in the carriage beside him or a tired workman or scatter hundreds of tracts in a village where he happened to be Once a gypsy not knowing who he was asked him to buy a broom To her astonishment he bought all she was carrying The best of his acts one which he had thought out carefully as he said to do good to his fellow men was the building of Saltaire for his four thousand workmen When asked once what he had been reading of late he replied Alpaca If you had four or five thousand people to provide for every day you would not have much time left for reading Saltaire is a beautiful place on the banks of the river Aire clean and restful In the centre of the town stands the great six story mill well ventilated lighted and warmed five hundred and forty five feet long of light colored stone costing over a half million dollars The four engines of eighteen hundred horse power consume fifteen thousand tons of coal per year The weaving shed covering two acres holds twelve hundred looms which make eighteen miles of fabric per day The homes of the work people are an honor to the capitalist They are of light stone like the mill two stories high each containing parlor kitchen pantry and three bedrooms or more well ventilated and tasteful Flower beds are in every front yard with a vegetable garden in the rear No broken carts or rubbish are to be seen Not satisfied to make Saltaire simply healthful by proper sanitary measures and beautiful for which Napoleon III made him one of the Legion of Honor mister Salt provided school buildings at a cost of two hundred thousand dollars a Congregational church costing eighty thousand dollars Italian in style as are the other buildings a hospital for sick or injured and forty five pretty almshouses like Italian villas where the aged and infirm have a comfortable home Each married man and his wife receive two dollars fifty cents weekly and each single man or woman one dollar eighty seven cents for expenses Once a year mister Salt and his family used to take tea with the inmates which was a source of great delight Believing that indoor washing is most pernicious and a fruitful source of disease especially to the young he built twenty four baths at a cost of thirty five thousand dollars and public wash houses These are supplied with three steam engines and six washing machines Each person bringing clothes is provided with a rubbing and boiling tub into which steam and hot and cold water are conveyed by pipes The clothes are dried by hot air and can be washed dried mangled and folded in an hour In Sweden I found the same dislike to having washing done in the homes and clothes are usually carried to the public wash houses Perhaps the most interesting of all mister Salt s gifts to his workmen is the Saltaire Club and Institute costing one hundred twenty five thousand dollars a handsome building with large reading room supplied with daily papers and current literature a library lecture hall for eight hundred persons a School of Art with models drawings and good teachers a billiard room with four tables a room for scientific study each student having proper appliances for laboratory work a gymnasium and drill room nearly sixty feet square an armory for rifle practice and a smoking room though mister Salt did not smoke The membership fee for all this study and recreation is only thirty seven cents for each three months Opposite the great mill is a dining hall where a plate of meat can be purchased for four cents a bowl of soup for two cents and a cup of tea or coffee for one cent If the men prefer to bring their own food it is cooked free of charge The manager has a fixed salary so that there is no temptation to scrimp the buyers Still another gift was made to the work people a park of fourteen acres with croquet and archery grounds music pavilion places for boating and swimming and walks with beautiful flowers No saloon has ever been allowed in Saltaire Without the temptation of the beer shops the boys have grown to intelligent manhood and the girls to virtuous womanhood Sir Titus Salt s last gift to his workmen was a Sunday school building costing fifty thousand dollars where are held the model Sunday schools of the country say those who have attended the meetings No wonder at the death of this man forty thousand people came to his burial members of Parliament clergymen workingmen s unions and ragged schools No wonder that statues have been erected to his memory and that thousands go every year to Saltaire to see what one capitalist has done for his laborers No fear of strikes in his workshops no socialism talked in the clean and pretty homes of the men no squalid poverty no depraving ignorance That capital is feeling its responsibility in this matter of homes for laborers is one of the hopeful signs of the times We shall come sometime to believe with the late President Chadbourne The rule now commonly acted upon is that business must be cared for and men must care for themselves The principle of action in the end must be that men must be cared for and business must be subservient to this great work If as Spurgeon has well said Home is the grandest of all institutions capital can do no better work than look to the homes of the laborer It is not the mansion which the employer builds for himself but the home which he builds for his employe which will insure a safe country for his children to dwell in If discontent and poverty surround his palace its foundations are weak if intelligence has been disseminated and comfort promoted by his unselfish thought for others then he leaves a goodly heritage for his children JOSEPH MARIE JACQUARD The small world which lives in elegant houses knows little of the great world in dingy apartments with bare walls and empty cupboards Those who walk or ride in the sunshine often forget the darkness of the mines or the tiresome treadmill of the factories Over a century ago in Lyons France lived a man who desired to make the lives of the toilers brighter and happier Joseph Jacquard the son of a silk weaver who died early began his young manhood the owner of two looms and a comfortable little home He had married Claudine Boichon the daughter of a goldsmith who expected to give his daughter a marriage portion but was unable from loss of property Jacquard loved her just as devotedly however as though she had brought him money A pretty boy was born into their home and no family was happier in all France But the young loom owner saw the poor weavers working from four in the morning till nine at night in crowded rooms whole families often bending over a loom their chests shrunken and their cheeks sallow from want of air and sunlight and their faces dull and vacant from the monotony of unvaried toil There were no holidays no walks in the fields among the flowers no reading of books nothing but the constant routine which wore out body and mind together There was no home life little children grew pinched and old and mothers went too early to their graves If work stopped they ate the bread of charity and went to the almshouse The rich people of Lyons were not hard hearted but they did not think they were too busy with their parties and their marriages too busy buying and selling that they might grow richer But Jacquard was always thinking how he could lighten the labor of the silk weavers by some invention The manufacture of silk had become a most important industry Seventeen hundred years before Christ the Chinese had discovered the making of silk from silk worms and had cultivated mulberry trees They forbade anybody to export the eggs or to disclose the process of making the fabric under penalty of death The Roman Emperor Justinian determined to wrest this secret from China and thus revive the resources of his empire He sent two monks who ostensibly preached Christianity but in reality studied silk worms and secreting some eggs in two hollow reeds returned to Justinian and breaking these canes laid the eggs on the lap of the beautiful Empress Theodora From this the art spread into Italy and thence into France The more Jacquard thought how he could help the silk weavers of France the more he became absorbed and forgot that money was needed to support his family Soon the looms had to be sold at auction with his small home The world ridiculed and his relatives blamed him but Claudine his wife encouraged him and prophesied great fame for him in the future She sold her little treasures and even her bed to pay his debts Finally when there was no food in the house with tears in his eyes Jacquard left his wife and child to become a laborer for a lime burner in a neighboring town Claudine went to work in a straw bonnet factory and for sixteen years they battled with poverty Then the French Revolution burst upon Lyons in seventeen ninety three Her crime before such murderers as Robespierre and Marat was that she was the friend of Louis XVI Sixty thousand men were sent against her by the so called Republicans who were commanded to utterly destroy her and write over the ruins Lyons made war upon liberty Lyons is no more Six thousand persons were put to death their houses burned and twelve thousand exiled among them Jacquard His only child a brave boy of sixteen had joined the Republican ranks that he might fight against the foreign armies of England Austria and Naples who had determined under Pitt to crush out the new government At the boy s earnest request his father enlisted with him and together they marched toward the Rhine In one of the first battles a cannon ball struck the idolized son who fell expiring in Jacquard s arms Covered with the blood of his only child he dug a grave for him on the battle field and exhausted and heart broken went to the hospital till his discharge was obtained He returned to Lyons and sought his poor wife At last he found her in the outskirts of the city living in a hay loft and earning the barest pittance by spreading out linen for the laundresses to dry She divided her crusts with her husband while they wept together over their irreparable loss She soon died of grief but with her last words bade Jacquard go forward in developing his genius and have trust in God who would yet show him the way of success Blessed Claudine A sweet beautiful soul shining like a star in the darkness of the French Revolution Jacquard with all earthly ties severed went back to the seclusion of inventing After his day s work was done as a laborer he studied on his machine for silk weaving Finally after seven years a long time to patiently develop an idea he had produced a loom which would decrease the number of workmen at each machine by one person The model was placed at the Paris Industrial Exposition in eighteen oh one and the maker was awarded a bronze medal In gratitude for this discovery he went to the image of the Virgin which stood on a high hill and for nine days ascended daily the steps of the sacred place Then he returned to his work and seating himself before a Vaucanson loom which contained the germ of his own he consecrated himself anew to the perfecting of his invention Jacques de Vaucanson who died when Jacquard was thirty years old was one of the most celebrated mechanicians of France His automatons were the wonder of the age He exhibited a duck which when moved ate and drank like a live one The figure would stretch out its neck for food and swallow it walk swim dabble in the water and quack most naturally His musician playing the flageolet with the left hand and beating the tambourine with the right executing many pieces of difficult music with great accuracy was an astonishment to every body He had been appointed inspector of silk factories at Lyons and because he made some improvements in machines he was pelted with stones by the workmen who feared that they would thereby lose their labor He revenged himself by making a machine which wove brocaded and colored at the same time and was worked by a donkey It remained for Jacquard to make the Vaucanson loom of the utmost practical use to Lyons and to the world After a time he was not only able to dispense with one workman at each loom but he made machinery do the work of three men and two women at each frame The city authorities sent a model of this machine to Paris that the Emperor Napoleon might examine it So pleased was he that he at once sent for Jacquard to come to Paris The latter had previously invented a machine for making fishing nets now used in producing Nottingham lace When brought before Bonaparte and Carnot the Minister of the Interior the latter asked Is it you then who pretend to do a thing which is impossible for man to make a knot upon a tight thread Jacquard answered the brusque inquiry by setting up a machine and letting the incredulous minister see for himself The Emperor made Jacquard welcome to the Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers where he could study books and machines to his heart s content and gave him a pension of about twelve hundred dollars for his discovery When he had with his own hands woven a magnificent brocaded silk dress for the Empress Josephine he returned to Lyons to set up the Jacquard looms His name began to be lauded everywhere Claudine s prophecies had at last come true She had given her life to help him but she could not live to share his honors Soon however the tide of praise turned Whole families found themselves forced into the street for lack of work as the looms were doing what their hands had done Bands of unemployed men were shouting Behold the traitor Let him provide for our wives and children now driven as mendicants from door to door or let him the destroyer of the peoples labor share in the death which he has prepared for us The authorities seemed unable to quell the storm and by their orders the new loom was broken in pieces on the public square The iron says Jacquard was sold as old iron the wood for fuel One day he was seized by a crowd of starving workmen who knocked him down and dragged him to the banks of the Rhone where he would have been drowned at once had not the police rescued him bleeding and nearly dead He left the city overwhelmed with astonishment and sorrow Soon Switzerland Germany Italy and America were using the Jacquard looms largely increasing the manufacture and sale of silk and therefore the number of laborers The poor men of Lyons awoke to the sad fact that by breaking up Jacquard s machines they had put the work of silk weaving into other hands all over the world and idleness was proving their ruin They might have doubled and trebled the number of their factories and benefited labor a thousand fold The inventor refused to take out a patent for himself nor would he accept any offers made him by foreigners because he thought all his services belonged to France He loved the working people who for twenty years were too blind to see it He removed to a little home and garden at Oullins near Lyons the use of which had been given him for life where he could hear the sound of his precious looms on which he had worked for sixty years and which his city had at last adopted Here he attended his garden and went every morning to early church distributing each day some small pieces of money to poor children As old age came on Lyons realized the gratitude due her great inventor A silver medal was awarded him and then the grand distinction of the cross of the Legion of Honor People from the neighboring towns visited Oullins and pointed out with pride the noble old man at eighty four sitting by his garden wall dressed like a workman in his long black tunic but wearing his broad red ribbon with his cross of honor Illustrious travellers and statesmen visited him whose fame was now spread through Europe and America Toinette a faithful servant who had known and loved Claudine watched over the pure hearted Jacquard till death came Aug seven eighteen thirty four Six years after Lyons which once broke his machine and nearly killed him raised a beautiful statue of him in the public square The more than seventy thousand looms in the city employing two hundred thousand workmen are grander monuments even than the statue The silk weavers are better housed and fed than formerly The struggling self sacrificing man who might have been immensely rich as well as famous was an untold blessing to labor and to the world HORACE GREELEY

7313_91072_000003_000001	train-clean-360	When two years old he would pore over the Bible as he lay on the floor and ask questions about the letters at three he went to the district school often carried through the deep snow on the shoulders of one of his aunts or on the back of an older boy 
7313_91072_000003_000002	train-clean-360	He soon stood at the head of his little class in spelling and reading and took it so much to heart when he did happen to lose his place that he would cry bitterly so that some boys when they had gained the right to get above him declined the honor because it hurt Horace s feelings so 
7313_91072_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Before he was six years old he had read the Bible through and Pilgrim s Progress Their home contained only about twenty books and these he read and re read

7313_91072_000007_000001	train-clean-360	From earliest childhood he had determined to be a printer so when eleven years of age he walked nine miles to see the publisher of a newspaper and obtain a situation

7313_91072_000007_000004	train-clean-360	After some weeks he returned with a few more cents in his purse than when he started 
7313_91072_000008_000000	train-clean-360	The father Greeley ought to have foreseen that such energy and will would produce results but because Horace in a fit of abstraction tried to yoke the off ox on the near side he said Ah that boy will never get along in the world

7313_91072_000009_000001	train-clean-360	He hastened thither and though unprepossessing from his thin voice short pantaloons lack of stockings and worn hat he was hired on trial

7313_91072_000009_000003	train-clean-360	Finally the boys began to tease him with saucy remarks and threw type at him but he paid no attention 
7313_91072_000009_000004	train-clean-360	On the third day one of the apprentices took a large black ball used to put ink on the type and remarking that Horace s hair was too light daubed his head four times

7313_91072_000009_000007	train-clean-360	Seeing that he could not be irritated and that he was determined to work he became a great favorite 
7313_91072_000010_000000	train-clean-360	When at his type he would often compose paragraphs for the paper setting up the words without writing them out 
7313_91072_000010_000001	train-clean-360	He soon joined a debating society composed of the best informed persons of the little town of East Poultney the minister the doctor the lawyer the schoolteachers and the like

7313_91072_000012_000000	train-clean-360	Soon after he had learned his trade the newspaper suspended and he was thrown out of work

none	none	mister Greeley s one great wish was gratified I cherish the hope that the journal I projected and established will live and flourish long after I shall have mouldered into forgotten dust and that the stone which covers my ashes may bear to future eyes the still intelligible inscription Founder of the NEW YORK TRIBUNE WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON For a great work God raises up a great man Usually he is trained in the hard school of poverty to give him courage and perseverance Usually he stands alone among a great multitude that he may have firmness and endurance William Lloyd Garrison was born to be preeminently the deliverer of the slave For two hundred years the curse of African slavery had rested upon one of the fairest portions of our land Everybody thought it an evil to keep four million human beings from even the knowledge of how to read and write and a cruelty to sell children away from parents to toil forever without home or kindred Everybody knew that slavery was as ruinous almost to master as to slave that labor was thereby despised and that luxury was sapping the vigor of a race But every slave meant money and money is very dear to mankind Illustration WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON Before the Declaration of Independence three hundred thousand slaves had been brought to this country Some of the colonists remonstrated but the traffic was not stopped till eighteen oh eight The Quakers were opposed to human bondage from the first and decided in seventeen eighty to free all their slaves Vermont had freed hers three years previously and other Northern States soon followed Benjamin Franklin Alexander Hamilton and others were outspoken against the sin but it continued to increase till in eighteen ten we had over a million slaves Five years before this time in a plain wooden house in Newburyport Mass a boy was born who was to electrify America and the world even on this great subject William Lloyd Garrison s father was a sea captain a man who loved books and had some literary ambition the mother was a noble woman deeply religious willing to bear all and brave all for conscience sake and fearless in the path of duty She early taught her boy to hate oppression of every kind and to stand everywhere for the right Very poor there was no chance for William either in school or college When he was seven his mother having found work for herself as a nurse for the sick placed the child with a deacon of the town where he learned to split wood and other useful things At nine the careful mother put him to the shoemaking trade though he was scarcely large enough to hold the lap stone He was not happy here longing for something that made him think Perhaps he would like to build tables and chairs better so he was apprenticed to a cabinet maker but here he was no more satisfied than with the monotony of sewing leather At his own request the dealer cancelled the agreement and the boy found a place to set type on the Newburyport Herald At last he had obtained the work he loved He would some day own a paper he thought and write articles for it Ah how often poor boys and rich build air castles which tumble to the ground It is well that we build them for life soon becomes prosaic enough to the happiest of us At sixteen he wrote an article for the Herald signing it An Old Bachelor Imagine his surprise and delight when he saw it really in print Meantime his mother who was six hundred miles away wrote him devoted letters ever encouraging and stimulating him to be upright and temperate A year later she died and William was left to fight his battles alone He missed the letters missed having some one to whom he could tell a boy s hopes and fears and temptations That boy is especially blest who has a mother to whom he can confide everything such a boy usually has a splendid future because by her wisdom and advice he becomes well fitted for life making no foolish experiments Reading as much as possible at nineteen William wrote some political articles for a Salem paper and strange to say they were attributed to honorable Timothy Pickering Surely he could do something in the world now so when his apprenticeship was over and he had worked long and faithfully he started a paper for himself He called it the Free Press It was a good title and a good paper but like most first literary adventures it proved a failure Perhaps he ought to have foreseen that one can do little without capital but youth is about as blind as love and rarely stops to reason Did one failure discourage him Oh no He went to Boston and found a place in a printing office He soon became the editor of the National Philanthropist the first paper established to advocate total abstinence from intoxicants His motto was a true one not very popular however in those days Moderate drinking is the down hill road to drunkenness He was now twenty two poor but God fearing and self reliant About this time there came to Boston a man whose influence changed young Garrison s whole life Benjamin Lundy a Quaker thirty nine years of age Leaving his father s home at nineteen he had spent four years at Wheeling Va where he learned the saddler s trade and learned also the cruelties of slave holding After this he moved to Ohio and in four years earned three thousand dollars above his living expenses When he was twenty six he organized an Anti slavery Society at his own house and promising to become assistant editor of an abolition paper he went to saint Louis to dispose of his stock of saddlery Business was greatly depressed the whole region being agitated over the admission of Missouri as a slave State and after spending two years Lundy returned to Ohio on foot in winter his property entirely gone None of his ardor for freedom having abated he determined to start a monthly paper though poor and entirely ignorant about printing This sheet he called the Genius of Universal Emancipation printed twenty miles from his home the edition being carried on his back each month as he walked the long distance He moved shortly after to East Tennessee walking half of the eight hundred miles and gradually increased his subscription list Several times his life was in danger but the slight gentle Quaker kept quietly on his course In eighteen twenty four he set out on foot for Baltimore paying his way by saddlery or harness mending living on the poorest fare and he subsequently established the Genius there While he was absent from home his wife died leaving twins and his five children were divided among friends Deeply sorrowing he renewed his resolve to devote his life to worse than motherless children those sold into bondage and made his way as best he could to Boston Of such material were the foundation stones of the anti slavery cause At his boarding place Lundy met Garrison and told him his burning desire to rid the country of slavery The heart of the young printer was deeply moved He too was poor and unknown but he had not forgotten his mother s teachings and prayers After some time he agreed to go to Baltimore and help edit the Genius of Universal Emancipation Lundy was in favor of sending the slaves to the West Indies or Africa as fast as their masters would consent to free them which was not very fast Garrison said The slaves are here by no fault of their own and do not deserve to be sent back to barbarous Africa He was in favor of immediate freedom for every human being Baltimore had slave pens on the principal streets Vessel loads of slaves torn from their homes were sent hundreds of miles away to southern ports and the auction block often witnessed heart rending scenes The tender heart of Garrison was stirred to its very depths In the first issue of his paper he declared for Immediate Emancipation and soon denounced the slave trade between Baltimore and New Orleans as domestic piracy giving the names of several citizens engaged in the traffic among them a vessel owner from his own town Newburyport The Northern man immediately arrested Garrison for gross and malicious libel and he was found guilty by a slave holding court and fined fifty dollars and costs No one was ready to give bail and he was thrown into prison The young man was not in the least cast down but calm and heroic wrote two sonnets on the walls of his cell Meantime a noble young Quaker at the North John G Whittier was deeply anxious for Garrison He had no money to pay his fine but greatly admiring Henry Clay whom he hoped to see President wrote him urging that he aid the guiltless prisoner Clay would doubtless have done so but Arthur Tappan one of New York s noble men sent the money releasing Garrison from his forty nine days imprisonment Wendell Phillips says of him He was in jail for his opinions when he was just twenty four He had confronted a nation in the very bloom of his youth Garrison had not been idle while in prison He had prepared several lectures on slavery and these he now gave when he could find a hearing Large churches were not opened to him and nobody offered him two hundred dollars a night The free colored people welcomed him gladly but the whites were usually indifferent or opposed to such fanatical ideas At last he came to Boston to start a paper that city where brains and not wealth open the doors to the best society Here with no money nor influential friends he started the Liberator with this for his motto I will be as harsh as truth and as uncompromising as justice On this subject I do not wish to speak or write with moderation I am in earnest I will not equivocate I will not excuse I will not retreat a single inch and I will be heard The North was bound hand and foot by the slave trade almost as effectually as the South The great plea was the fear lest the Union would be dissolved Cotton factories had sprung up on every hand and it was believed that slave labor was essential to the producing of cotton Some thought it would not be safe to free the slaves that assassinations would be the result The real secret however was that each slave meant several hundred dollars and freedom meant poverty to the masters Meantime the Liberator was making itself felt despite Garrison s poverty The Vigilance Association of South Carolina offered a reward of fifteen hundred dollars for the apprehension and prosecution of any white person who might be detected in distributing or circulating it In Raleigh N C the grand jury found a bill against the young editor hoping to bring him to that State for trial honorable Robert Y Hayne of South Carolina having received a paper by mail wrote to Harrison Gray Otis Mayor of Boston to ascertain the sender mister Otis caused an agent to visit the office of the Liberator and returned answer to mister Hayne that he found it an obscure hole his only visible auxiliary a negro boy and his supporters a few very insignificant persons of all colors And where was this obscure hole In the third story of a business block the walls dingy says mister Oliver Johnson in Garrison and his Times the small windows bespattered with printers ink the press standing in one corner the long editorial and mailing table covered with newspapers the bed of the editor and publisher on the floor all these make a picture never to be forgotten Their food what little they had was procured at a neighboring bakery Soon Georgia passed a law offering five thousand dollars to any person arresting and bringing to trial under the laws of the State and punishing to conviction the editor or publisher of the Liberator What a wonder that some ruffian at midnight did not break into the obscure hole and drag the young man off to a slave vessel lying close by in the harbor The leaven of anti slavery was beginning to work Twelve fanatics gathered one stormy night in the basement of an African church in Boston and organized the New England Anti Slavery Society in eighteen thirty two The following year as the managers of the American Colonization Society had sent an agent to England it was deemed best to send Garrison abroad to tell Wilberforce and others who were working for the suppression of slavery in the West Indies that it was not a wise plan to send the slaves to Africa It was difficult to raise the money needed but self sacrifice usually leaves a good bank account The fanatic only twenty eight was received with open arms by such men as Lord Brougham Wilberforce Clarkson and Daniel O Connell Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton gave a breakfast in his honor When the guests had arrived among them mister Garrison mister Buxton held up both hands exclaiming Why my dear sir I thought you were a black man This mister Garrison used to say was the greatest compliment of his life because it showed how truly and heartily he had labored for the slave A great meeting was arranged for him at Exeter Hall London How inspiring all this for the young reformer Here he met the eloquent George Thompson and asked him to visit our country which invitation he accepted On his return the American Anti Slavery Society was formed Dec four eighteen thirty three at Philadelphia delegates coming from eleven States John G Whittier was chosen Secretary The noble poet has often said that he was more proud that his name should appear signed to the Declaration of Principles adopted at that meeting than on the title page of any of his volumes Thus has he ever loved liberty The contest over the slavery question was growing extremely bitter Prudence Crandall of Canterbury Conn a young Quaker lady admitted several colored girls to her school who came from Boston New York and Philadelphia The people were indignant at such a commingling of races Shopkeepers refused to sell her anything her well was filled with refuse and at last her house was nearly torn down by a midnight mob Lane Theological Seminary Cincinnati Western Reserve College Hudson O with some others were nearly broken up by the conflict of opinion Some anti slavery lecturers were tarred and feathered or thrown into prison In New York a pro slavery mob broke in the doors and windows of a Presbyterian church and laid waste schoolhouses and dwellings of colored people In Philadelphia the riots lasted three days forty four houses of colored people being nearly or quite destroyed In Boston a most respectable mob composed says Horace Greeley in good part of merchants dispersed a company of women belonging to the Female Anti Slavery Society while its President was engaged in prayer Learning that Garrison was in the adjoining office they shouted We must have Garrison Out with him Lynch him Attempting to escape by the advice of the Mayor who was present he sought refuge in a carpenter s shop but the crowd drew him out and coiling a rope around his body dragged him bareheaded along the street One man called out He shan t be hurt he is an American and this probably saved his life though many blows were aimed at his head and his clothes were nearly torn from his body The Mayor declaring that he could only be saved by being lodged in jail Garrison pressed into a hack and was driven as rapidly as possible to the prison the maddened crowd clinging to the wheels dashing against the doors and seizing hold of the horses At last he was behind the bars and out of their reach On the walls of his cell he wrote William Lloyd Garrison was put into this cell on Wednesday afternoon Oct twenty one eighteen thirty five to save him from the violence of a respectable and influential mob who sought to destroy him for preaching the abominable and dangerous doctrine that all men are created equal and that all oppression is odious in the sight of God Confine me as a prisoner but bind me not as a slave Punish me as a criminal but hold me not as a chattel Torture me as a man but drive me not like a beast Doubt my sanity but acknowledge my immortality The respectable mob had wrought wiser than they knew Garrison and his Liberator became more widely known than ever Famous men and women now joined the despised Abolitionists The conflict was growing deeper Elijah P Lovejoy the ardent young preacher of Alton Illinois was murdered by four balls at the hands of a pro slavery mob who broke up his printing press and threw it into the river A public meeting was held in Faneuil Hall to condemn such an outrage A prominent man in the gallery having risen to declare that Lovejoy died as the fool dieth a young man unknown to most stepped to the rostrum and spoke as though inspired From that day Wendell Phillips was the orator of America From that day the anti slavery cause had a new consecration From this time till eighteen sixty the struggle between freedom and slavery was continuous The South needed the Territories for her rapid increase of slaves The North was opposed but in the year eighteen fifty four the Kansas Nebraska Act devised by Stephen A Douglas repealed the Missouri Compromise of eighteen twenty which had prohibited slavery north of latitude thirty six deg thirty the southern boundary of Kansas Kansas at once became a battle ground Armed men came over from Missouri to establish slavery Men came from New England determined that the soil should be free if they spilled their blood to gain it The Fugitive Slave Law whereby slaves were returned without trial by jury and slave owners allowed to search the North for their slaves made great bitterness The brutal attack of Preston Brooks of South Carolina on Charles Sumner for his speech on Kansas and the hanging of John Brown by the State of Virginia for his invasion of Harper s Ferry with seventeen white men and five negroes calling upon the slaves to rise and demand their liberty brought matters to a crisis Garrison was opposed to war but after the firing on Sumter April twelve eighteen sixty one it was inevitable For two years after Abraham Lincoln s election to the Presidency Garrison waited impatiently for that pen stroke which set four million human beings free When the Emancipation Proclamation was issued Jan one eighteen sixty three Garrison s life work was accomplished Thirty five years of untiring heroic struggle had not been in vain When two years later the stars and stripes were raised again over Fort Sumter he was invited by President Lincoln as a guest of the government to witness the imposing scene When mister Garrison arrived in Charleston the colored people were nearly wild with joy Children sang and men shouted A slave made an address of welcome his two daughters bearing a wreath of flowers to their great benefactor Garrison s heart was full to overflowing as he replied Not unto us not unto us but unto God be all the glory for what has been done in regard to your emancipation Thank God this day that you are free And be resolved that once free you will be free forever Liberty or death but never slavery While God gives me reason and strength I shall demand for you everything I claim for the whitest of the white in this country The same year he discontinued the publication of the Liberator putting in type with his own hands the official ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment forever prohibiting slavery in the United States and adding Hail redeemed regenerated America Hail all nations tribes kindred and peoples made of one blood interested in a common redemption heirs of the same immortal destiny Hail angels in glory tune your harps anew singing Great and marvellous are thy works Lord God Almighty Two years after the war mister Garrison crossed the ocean for the fourth time He was no longer the poor lad setting type at thirteen or sleeping on the hard floor of a printing room or lying in a Baltimore jail or the victim of a Boston mob He was the centre of a grand and famous circle The Duke and Duchess of Argyle and the Duchess of Sutherland paid him special honors John Bright presided at a public breakfast given him at saint James Hall London Such men as John Stuart Mill Herbert Spencer and Prof Huxley graced the feast mister Bright said in his opening address concerning mister Garrison His is the creation of that opinion which has made slavery hateful and which has made freedom possible in America His name is venerated in his own country venerated in this country and in Europe wheresoever Christianity softens the hearts and lessens the sorrows of men Edinburgh conferred upon him the freedom of the city an honor accorded to one other American only George Peabody Birmingham Manchester and other cities held great public meetings to do him reverence On his return such friends as Sumner Wilson Emerson Longfellow Lowell Greeley and others presented him with thirty thousand dollars The remainder of his life he devoted to temperance woman suffrage and every other reform calculated to make the world better His true character was shown when years before appointed to the London Anti Slavery Convention as a delegate he refused to take his seat after his long journey across the ocean because such noble company workers as Lucretia Mott missus Wendell Phillips and others were denied their place as delegates Thus strenuous was he for right and justice to all Always modest hopeful and cheerful he was as gentle in his private life with his wife and five children as he was strong and fearless in his public career He died at the home of his daughter in New York May twenty four eighteen seventy nine his children singing about his bed at his request Awake my soul stretch every nerve and Rise my soul and stretch thy wings At sunset in Forest Hills they laid the brave man to rest a quartette of colored singers around his open grave singing I cannot always trace the way The storm and peril overpast The hounding hatred shamed and still Go soul of freedom take at last The place which thou alone canst fill Confirm the lesson taught of old Life saved for self is lost while they Who lose it in His service hold The lease of God s eternal day GIUSEPPE GARIBALDI Few men come to greatness Most drift on with the current having no special plan nor aim They live where their fathers lived taking no thought beyond their neighborhood or city and die in their little round of social life Not so a boy born in Southern France in eighteen oh seven Giuseppe Garibaldi was the son of humble parents His father was a sailor with a numerous family to support seemingly unskilled in keeping what little property he had once acquired His mother was a woman of ambition energy and nobility of character If one looks for the cause of greatness in a man he seldom has to go further than the mother Hence the need of a highly educated noble womanhood all over the world Such as Giuseppe Garibaldi are not born of frivolous fashionable women Of his mother the great soldier wrote in later years She was a model for mothers Her tender affection for me has perhaps been excessive but do I not owe to her love to her angel like character the little good that belongs to mine Often amidst the most arduous scenes of my tumultuous life when I have passed unharmed through the breakers of the ocean or the hail storms of battle she has seemed present with me I have in fancy seen her on her knees before the Most High my dear mother imploring for the life of her son and I have believed in the efficacy of her prayers No wonder that Give me the mothers of the nation to educate and you may do what you like with the boys was one of his favorite maxims Illustration GIUSEPPE GARIBALDI Giuseppe was an ardent boy fond of books loving to climb the lonely mountains around his home and eager for some part of the world s bustle Sometimes he earned his living among the fishermen on the Riviera sometimes he took sea voyages with his father He had unusual tenderness of heart combined with fearlessness One day he caught a grasshopper took it to his house and in handling it broke its leg He was so grieved for the poor little creature that he went to his room and wept bitterly for hours Another time standing by a deep ditch he discovered that a woman had fallen from the bank as she was washing clothes With no thought for his own life he sprang in and rescued her His parents seeing that he was quick in mathematics and the languages desired him to study for the ministry but he loved the sea and adventure too well for a sedentary life Becoming tired of study at twelve years of age he and some companions procured a boat put some provisions and fishing tackle on board and started to make their fortune in the East These visions of greatness soon came to an inglorious end for the paternal Garibaldi put to sea at once and soon overtook and brought home the mortified and disappointed infantile crew At twenty one we find Garibaldi second in command on the brig Cortese bound for the Black Sea Three times during the voyage they were plundered by Greek pirates their sails charts and every article of clothing taken from them the sailors being obliged to cover their bodies with some matting left by chance in the hold of the ship As a result of this destitution the young commander became ill at Constantinople and was cared for by some Italian exiles Poor as are most who are born to be leaders he must work now to pay the expenses incurred by this illness Through the kindness of his physician he found a place to teach and when once more even with the world pecuniarily went back to sea and was made captain He was now twenty seven years old Since his father had taken him when a mere boy to Rome he had longed for and prayed over his distracted Italy He saw what the Eternal City must have been in her ancient splendor he pictured her in the future again the pride and glory of a united nation He remembered how Italy had been the battle ground of France Spain and Austria when kings as they have ever done quarrelled for power He saw the conqueror of Europe himself conquered by the dreadful Russian campaign then the Congress of Vienna parcelling out a prostrate people among the nations Austria took Lombardy and Venice Parma and Lucca were given to Marie Louise the second wife of Napoleon and the Two Sicilies to Ferdinand II who ruled them with a rod of iron Citizens for small offences were lashed to death in the public square Filthy dungeons excavated under the sea without light or air were filled with patriots whose only crime was a desire for a free country The people revolted in Naples and Sardinia and asked for a constitution but Austria soon helped to restore despotism Kings had divine rights the people had none No man lessens his power willingly The only national safety is the least possible power in the hands of any one person The rule of the many is liberty of the few despotism Garibaldi was writing all these things on his heart His blood boiled at the slavery of his race Mazzini a young lawyer of Genoa had just started a society called Young Italy and was looking hopefully in a hopeless age toward a republic for his native country Garibaldi was ready to help in any manner possible The plan proposed was to seize the village of saint Julien and begin the revolt but as usual there was a traitor in the camp they were detected and Garibaldi like the rest was sentenced to death This was an unexpected turn of events for the young sea captain Donning the garb of a peasant he escaped by mountain routes to Nice his only food being chestnuts bade a hasty farewell to his precious mother and started for South America He had learned alas so soon the result of working for freedom in Italy He arrived at Rio Janeiro an exile and poor but finding several of his banished countrymen they assisted him in buying a trading vessel and he engaged in commerce But his mind constantly dwelt on freedom The Republic of Rio Grande had just organized and set up its authority against Brazil Here was a chance to fight for liberty A small cruiser was obtained which he called The Mazzini and with twenty companions he set out to combat an empire After capturing a boat loaded with copper the second vessel they met gave battle wounded Garibaldi in the neck and made them all prisoners A little later attempting to escape he was brutally beaten with a club and then his wrists tied together by a rope which was flung over a beam He was suspended in the air for two hours His sufferings were indescribable Fever parched his body and the rope cut his flesh He was rescued by a fearless lady Senora Alemon but for whom he would have died After two months finding that he would divulge nothing of the plans of his adopted republic he was released without trial and entered the war again at once After several successful battles his vessel was shipwrecked nearly all his friends were drowned and he escaped as by a miracle His heart now became desolate He says in his diary I felt the want of some one to love me and a desire that such a one might be very soon supplied as my present state of mind seemed insupportable After all the brave young captain was human and cried out for a human affection He had always regarded woman as the most perfect of creatures but he had never thought it possible to marry with his adventurous life About this time he met a dark haired dark eyed young woman tall and commanding and as brave and fearless as himself Anita belonged to a wealthy family and her father was incensed at the union though years after when Garibaldi became famous he wrote them a letter of forgiveness They idolized each other and the soldier s heart knew desolation no longer come now what would She stood beside him in every battle waving her sword over her head to encourage the men to their utmost When a soldier fell dead at her feet she seized his carbine and kept up a constant fire When urged by her husband to go below because almost frantic with fear for her safety she replied If I do it will be but to drive out those cowards who have sought concealment there and then return to the fight In one of the land battles she was surrounded by twenty or more of the enemy but she put spurs to her horse and dashed through their midst At first they seemed dazed as though she were something unearthly then they fired killing her animal which fell heavily to the ground and she was made a prisoner Obtaining permission to search among the dead for her husband and not finding him she determined to make her escape That night while they slept she seized a horse plunged into the forests and for four days lived without food On the last night a stormy one closely pursued by several of the enemy she urged her horse into a swollen river five hundred yards broad and seizing fast hold of his tail the noble creature swam across dragging her with him After eight days she reached her agonized husband and their joy was complete After a year or more of battles and hardships their first child Menotti was born named for the great Italian Liberal Garibaldi fighting for a poor republic destitute of everything for his wife and child started across the marshes to purchase a few articles of clothing In his absence their little company was attacked by the Imperialists and Anita mounted her saddle in a pitiless storm and fled to the woods with her twelve days old infant Three months later the child came near dying the mother carrying him in a handkerchief tied round her neck and keeping him warm with her breath as they forded swamps and rivers After six years of faithful service for the South American Republic Garibaldi determined to settle down to a more quiet life with his little family and sought a home at Montevideo where he took up his former occupation of teaching But he was soon drawn into war again and his famous Italian Legion of about four hundred men made for themselves a record throughout Europe and America for bravery and success against fearful odds The grateful people made Garibaldi General and placed a large tract of land at the disposal of the Legion but the leader said In obedience to the cause of liberty alone did the Italians of Montevideo take up arms and not with any views of gain or advancement and the gift was declined Yet so poor was the family of Garibaldi that they used to go to bed at sunset because they had no candles and his only shirt he had given to a companion in arms When his destitution became known the minister of war sent him one hundred dollars He accepted half for Anita and her little ones and begged that the other half might be given to a poor widow Fourteen years had gone by since he left Italy under sentence of death He was now forty one in the prime of his life and vigor Italy had become ripe for a revolution Charles Albert King of Sardinia had declared himself ready to give constitutional liberty to his people and to help throw off the Austrian yoke Garibaldi believed that his hour had come and saying good bye to the Montevideans who were loathe to part with him he took fifty six of his brave Italian Legion and sailed for Nice in the ship Esperanza His beloved Anita improvised a Sardinian flag made from a counterpane a red shirt and a bit of old green uniform and the little company gave themselves to earnest plans and hopes They met a hearty reception on their arrival Garibaldi s mother taking Anita and her three children Menotti Meresita and Ricciotti to her home General Garibaldi at once presented himself before Charles Albert and offered his services He wore a striking costume consisting of a cap of scarlet cloth a red blouse and a white cloak lined with red with a dagger at his belt besides his sword The King perhaps remembering that the brave soldier was once a Republican in sentiment made the great mistake of declining his aid Nothing daunted he hurried to Milan only to find that the weak King had yielded it to Austria Charles Albert soon abdicated in favor of his son Victor Emmanuel and died from sorrow and defeat Meantime Rome had declared herself a Republic and Pius IX had fled the city Garibaldi was asked to defend her and entered with his troops April twenty eight in eighteen forty nine England and France were urged to remain neutral while Rome fought for freedom But alas Louis Napoleon then President of the French Republic desired to please the Papal party and sent troops to reinstate the Pope When Rome found that this man at the head of a republic was willing to put a knife to her throat her people fought like tigers They swarmed out of the workshops armed with weapons of every kind while women urged them on with applause For nearly three months Rome held out against France and Austria Garibaldi showing himself an almost superhuman leader and then the end came Pius IX re entered the city and the Republic was crushed by monarchies When all was lost Garibaldi called his soldiers together and leaping on horseback shouted Venice and Garibaldi do not surrender Whoever will let him follow me Italy is not yet dead and he dashed off at full speed By lonely mountain paths he with Anita and about two hundred of his troops arrived on the shore of the Adriatic where thirteen boats were waiting to carry them to Venice Nine were soon taken by the Austrians the rest escaping though nearly all were finally captured and shot at once The General and his wife escaped to a cornfield where she lay very ill her head resting on his knee Some peasants though fearful that they would be detected by the Austrians brought a cart and carried the dying wife to the nearest cottage where as soon as she was laid upon the bed she breathed her last leaning on Garibaldi s arm Overwhelmed with the loss of his idol he seemed benumbed with no care whether he was made a prisoner or not At last urged for the sake of Italy to flee he made the peasants promise to bury Anita under the shade of the pine grove near by and hunted like a robber from mountain to mountain he found a hiding place among the rocks of the Island of Caprera There was nothing left now but to seek a refuge in the great American Republic Landing in New York the noble General asked aid from no one but believing as all true minded persons believe that any labor is honorable began to earn his living by making candles What a contrast between an able general working in a tallow factory and some proud young men and women who consent to be supported by friends and thus live on charity Woe to America if her citizens shall ever feel themselves too good to work For a year and a half he labored patiently his children three thousand miles away with his mother Then he became captain of a merchant vessel between China and Peru When told that he could bring some Chinese slaves to South America in his cargo he refused saying Never will I become a trafficker in human flesh America might buy and sell four millions of human beings but not so Garibaldi After four years he decided to return to Italy With the little money he had saved he bought half the rocky island of Caprera five miles long off the coast of Sardinia whose boulders had once sheltered him built him a one story plain house and took his three children there to live his mother having died Meantime Cavour the great Italian statesman had not been idle in diplomacy The Crimean War had been fought and Italy had helped England and France against Russia When Napoleon III went to war with Austria in eighteen fifty nine Cavour was glad to make Italy his ally He called Garibaldi from Caprera and made him Major General of the Alps At once the red blouse and white cloak seemed to inspire the people with confidence Lombardy sprang to arms Every house was open and every table spread for the Liberators And then began a series of battles which for bravery and dash and skill made the name of Garibaldi the terror of Austria and the hope and pride of Italy Tuscany Modena Parma and Lucca declared for King Victor Emmanuel The battles of Magenta and Solferino made Austria bite the dust and gladly give up Lombardy At last it seemed as if Italy were to be redeemed and reunited Garibaldi started with his famous Mille or thousand men to release the two Sicilies from the hated rule of Francis the son of Ferdinand II The first battle was fought at Palermo the Neapolitans who outnumbered the troops of Garibaldi four to one being defeated after four hours hard fighting Then the people dared to show their true feelings Peasants flocked in from the mountains and ladies wore red dresses and red feathers When the cars carried the soldiers from one town to another the people crowded the engine and shouted themselves hoarse Drums were beaten and trumpets blown and women pressed forward to kiss the hand or touch the cloak of the Lion of Italy He was everywhere the bravest of the brave Once when surrounded by four dragoons who called upon him to surrender he drew his sword and said I am Garibaldi you must surrender to me And yet amid all this honor and success in war and supremacy in power as he was the Dictator he was so poor that he would wash his red shirt in a brook and wait for it to dry while he ate his lunch of bread and water with a little fruit No wonder the Sicilians believed him to be a second Messiah and the French that he could shake the bullets from his body into his loose red shirt and empty them out at his leisure The sailor boy had become the hero of all who loved liberty the world over When the war was ended he resigned his Dictatorship handed the two Sicilies over to his sovereign distributed medals to his devoted soldiers and returned to his island home at Caprera with barely three dollars in his pocket having borrowed one hundred to pay his debts How rarely does any age produce such a man as Garibaldi But Rome was not yet the capital of Italy The hero could not rest while the city was governed by a Pope At last tired of waiting for the king to take action he started with three thousand men for Rome Victor Emmanuel fearing to offend France if the Pope were molested sent the royal troops against Garibaldi at Aspromonte who badly wounded him and carried him to a prison on the Gulf of Spezzia The people indignant at the Government crowded around him bearing gifts and kissing the hem of his raiment They even bored a hole in the door of the prison that they might catch a glimpse of their idol as he lay on his iron bedstead a gift from an English friend After his release and return to Caprera he visited England in eighteen sixty four the whole country doing him honor Stations were gaily decorated streets arched with flowers ladies dressed in red the Duke of Sutherland entertained him London gave him the freedom of the city Tennyson made him his guest at the Isle of Wight and crowds made it scarcely possible for him to appear on the public thoroughfares He refused to receive a purse of money from his friends and went back to Caprera majestic in his unselfishness Again Italy called him to help her in her alliance with Prussia against Austria in eighteen sixty six and again he fought nobly The year following he attempted to take Rome but was a second time arrested and imprisoned for fear of Napoleon III When that monarch fell at Sedan and the French troops were withdrawn from the Eternal City Victor Emmanuel entered without a struggle and Rome was free In eighteen seventy four after helping the French Republic the brave Spartan was elected to Parliament He was now sixty seven As he entered Rome the streets were blocked with people who several times attempted to remove the horses and draw the carriage themselves Ah if Anita had only been there to have seen this homage of a grateful nation He entered the Senate House on the arm of his son Menotti and when he rose in his red shirt and gray cloak to take the oath so infirm that he was obliged to be supported by two friends men wept as they recalled his struggles and shouted frantically as he took his seat Seven years longer the grand old man lived at Caprera now beautified with gifts from all the world the recipient of a thank offering of ten thousand dollars yearly from Italy Around him were Francesca whom he married late in life and their two children whom he idolized Manlio and Clelia He spent his time in writing several books in tilling the soil and in telling visitors the wonderful events of his life and of Anita On June two eighteen eighty two all day long he lay by the window looking out upon the sea As the sun was setting a bird alighted on the sill singing The great man stammered Quanti o allegro How joyful it is and closed his eyes in death He directed in his will that his body should be burned but at the request of the Government and many friends it was buried at Caprera to be transferred at some future time to Rome now the capital of united Italy Not alone does Italy honor her great Liberator whom she calls the most blameless and most beloved of men Wherever a heart loves liberty there will Garibaldi s name be cherished and honored JEAN PAUL RICHTER Vasari who wrote the lives of the Italian painters truly said It is not by sleeping but by working waking and laboring continually that proficiency is attained and reputation acquired This was emphatically true of Richter as it is of every man or woman who wins a place in the memory of men The majority die after a commonplace life and are never heard of they were probably satisfied to drift along the current with no especial purpose save to eat drink and be merry Not so with the German boy born in the cold Pine Mountains of Bavaria His home was a low thatched building made of beams of wood filled in with mortar one part for the family and the other for corn and goats This is still the custom in Switzerland the poor caring as tenderly for their dumb beasts as for their children Jean Paul was born on the twenty first of March seventeen sixty three My life and the life of the spring began the same month he used to say in after years and the thought of robin red breasts and spring flowers made the poor lad happy amid the deepest trials His father was an under pastor and organist in the little village of Wunsiedel and lived on a pitiful salary but generous to a fault he stripped off his own garments to clothe the poor and sent the schoolmaster a meal every day because if possible he was poorer than the preacher In school Jean Paul was a studious boy almost envying every one who said his lessons well and fond of his teachers and mates but one of the boys having cut Paul s hand the father at once took him home and became his instructor A painstaking and conscientious man he showed little aptness for his work when he gave his boy at nine years of age a Latin dictionary to commit to memory For four solid hours in the morning and three in the afternoon Paul and his brother learned grammatical lessons and Latin verses of which they did not understand a word Still the boy grew more and more fond of books and of Nature made clocks with pendulums and wheels a sun dial drawing his figures on a wooden plate with ink invented a new language from the calendar signs of the almanac and composed music on an old harpsichord whose only tuning hammer and tuning master were the winds and the weather When Paul was thirteen the family moved to Schwarzenbach where he made the acquaintance of a young pastor Vogel who owned quite a valuable library and encouraged him to educate himself Given free access to the books he began to read eagerly Thinking that he should never own volumes for himself he made blank books of three hundred pages each from his father s sermon paper and began the almost interminable labor of copying whatever he thought he should need in law medicine philosophy theology natural history and poetry For nearly four years he worked thus till he had quite a library of his own and a wealth of information in his brain which proved invaluable in the writing of after years Such a boy could not fail of success Paul s father meantime had become despondent over his debts small though they were and died when his son was sixteen The grandfather on the mother s side dying soon after Frau Richter became entitled by will to his property The remaining brothers and sisters at once went to law about the matter preferring to spend the estate in the courts rather than have a favorite child enjoy it Two years later at eighteen Paul started for college at Leipzig hoping that in this cultured city he might teach while pursuing his own studies Alas scores had come with the same hope and there was no work to be obtained He found himself alone in a great city poorly dressed timid sensitive and without a hand to help Many boys had brought letters of introduction to the professors and thus of course received attention He wrote to his mother The most renowned whose esteem would be useful to me are oppressed with business surrounded by a multitude of respectable people and by a swarm of envious flatterers If one would speak to a professor without a special invitation he incurs the suspicion of vanity But do not give up your hopes I will overcome all these difficulties I shall receive some little help and at length I shall not need it All honor to the brave boy who could write so encouragingly in the midst of want and loneliness He longed to make the acquaintance of some learned people but there was no opportunity Finally getting deeper and deeper into debt he wrote to his mother As I have no longer any funds I must continue to be trusted But what can I at last expect I must eat and I cannot continue to be trusted I cannot freeze but where shall I get wood without money I can no longer take care of my health for I have warm food neither morning nor evening It is now a long time since I asked you for twenty six dollars when they come I shall scarcely be able to pay what I already owe Perhaps the project I have in my head will enable me to earn for you and myself Poor lad how many hearts have ached from poverty just as did his The mother was also in debt but in some way she managed to obtain the money for what will a mother not do for her child Paul worked on but was soon in debt again He could tell nobody but his devoted mother I will not ask you for money to pay my victualler he wrote to whom I owe twenty four dollars nor my landlady to whom I am indebted ten or even for other debts that amount to six dollars For these great sums I will ask no help but for the following you must not deny me your assistance I must every week pay the washerwoman who does not trust I must drink some milk every morning I must have my boots soled by the cobbler who does not trust my torn cap must be repaired by the tailor who does not trust and I must give something to the maid servant who of course does not trust Eight dollars of Saxon money will satisfy all and then I shall need your help no longer He was keeping up courage because he was writing a book He told his mother with his high dreams of young authorship that he should bring home all his old shirts and stockings at vacation for he should buy new ones then It is well that all the mountains seem easy to climb in youth when we are older we come to know their actual height The mother discouraged authorship and hoped her boy would become a preacher but his project was too dear to be given up When his book of satirical essays called Eulogy of Stupidity was finished it was sent with beating heart to a publisher In vain Paul awaited its return He hoped it would be ready at Michaelmas fair but the publisher so long and so kindly patronized the book by letting it lie on his desk that the fair was half over before the manuscript was returned The boyish heart must have ached when the parcel came He had not learned what most authors are familiar with the heart sickness from first rejected manuscripts He had not learned too that fame is a hard ladder to climb and that a friend at court is often worth as much or more than merit Publishers are human and cannot always see merit till fame is won For a whole year Paul tried in vain to find a publisher Then he said to the manuscript Lie there in the corner together with school exercises for thou art no better I will forget for the world would certainly have forgotten thee Faint from lack of food he says I undertook again a wearisome work and created in six months a brand new satire This book was called the Greenland Lawsuits a queer title for a collection of essays on theology family pride women fops and the like Paul had now gained courage by failure Instead of writing a letter he went personally to every publisher in Leipzig and offered his manuscript and every publisher refused it Finally he sent it to Voss of Berlin On the last day of December as he sat in his room hungry and shivering because there was no fire in the stove there was a knock at the door and a letter from Voss was handed in He opened it hastily and found an offer of seventy dollars for the Greenland Lawsuits Through his whole life he looked back to this as one of its supreme moments It was not a great sum only three dollars a week for the six months but it was the first fruit of his brain given to the public He was now nineteen What little property the mother had possessed had wasted away in the lawsuits one brother in his despair had drowned himself and another had entered the army but Paul still had hope in the future After a short vacation with his mother he went back to Leipzig The second volume of the Greenland Lawsuits was now published and for this he received one hundred and twenty six dollars nearly twice that given for the first volume This did not take with the public and the third volume was refused by every publisher His money was gone What could he do He would try as some other authors had done the plan of writing letters to distinguished people telling them his needs He did so but received no answers Then spurred on by necessity he took the manuscript in his hand and presented it himself at the doors of the learned but he was either not listened to or repulsed on every occasion How one pities this lad of nineteen How many wealthy men might have aided him but they did not He wrote a few essays for various periodicals but these brought little money and were seldom wanted His high hopes for a literary career began to vanish It was evident that he must give up college life for he could not get enough to eat He had long discontinued his evening meal making his supper of a few dried prunes His boarding mistress was asking daily for her dues He could bear the privation and the disgrace no longer and packing his satchel and borrowing a coat from a college boy that he might not freeze he stole away from Leipzig in the darkness of the twilight and went home to his disconsolate mother Is it any wonder that the poor are disconsolate Is it any wonder that they regard the wealthy as usually cold and indifferent to their welfare Alas that so many of us have no wish to be our brother s keeper Perhaps some of the professors and students wondered where the bright lad had gone but the world forgets easily Frau Richter received her college boy with a warm heart but an empty purse She was living with her two children in one room supporting them as best she could by spinning working far into the night In this room where cooking washing cleaning and spinning were all carried on Paul placed his little desk and began to write Was the confusion trying to his thoughts Ah necessity knows no law He says I was like a prisoner without the prisoner s fare of bread and water for I had only the latter and if a gulden found its way into the house the jubilee was such that the windows were nearly broken with joy But with the strength of a noble and heroic nature he adds What is poverty that a man should whine under it It is but like the pain of piercing the ears of a maiden and you hang precious jewels in the wound The family were so needy however that they must look somewhere for aid and hesitatingly Paul applied to Vogel the young pastor who loaned them twenty five gulden Very soon the boarding mistress from Leipzig appeared having walked the whole way to Hof and demanded her pay In his distress Paul sent her to another friend Otto who became surety for the debt Richter now began to work harder than ever His books of extracts were invaluable as were his hand books of comical matters touching incidents synonyms et cetera He made it a rule to write half a day and take long walks in the afternoon in the open air thinking out the plans for his books Poor as he was he was always cheerful sustaining by his letters any who were downhearted One of his best friends Herman who had become a physician through much struggle died about this time broken on the wheel of poverty Despite his own starving condition Paul sent him five dollars Having an opportunity to teach French to the brother of a Leipzig friend he accepted but at the end of three years through the disappointing character of the pupil and the miserliness of the father Paul returned to his mother broken in health and dispirited His heart ached for those who like himself were suffering and now he made a resolution that changed for life the course of his writing He would write satire no more He said I will not pour into the cup of humanity a single drop of gall Henceforward love and hope and tenderness breathe upon his every page He now wrote ten essays on What is Death asking the noble hearted Herder to send them to Weiland for his magazine lest they be overlooked in his mass of papers if Richter unaided should venture to ask the favor They were overlooked for months but finally Herder procured the insertion of one essay in a different magazine but Richter never received any pay for it Three years had passed and all this time the third volume of the Greenland Lawsuits had been journeying from one publishing house to another At last it was accepted but little money came from it Again he taught this time at Schwarzenbach where he used to go to school Here his tenderness his tact and good cheer won the hearts of the pupils There was no memorizing of Latin dictionaries but the exact work of all was kept in a red book for parents to see He instructed them orally five hours a day till they were eager for astronomy history and biography For four years he taught his schoolroom being his Paradise every Sunday walking to Hof to see his mother Well might he say To the man who has had a mother all women are sacred for her sake Paul now determined to write a novel and though he had little knowledge of any sphere of life save that in which poverty held sway he would put his own heart into the work The Invisible Lodge was written and sent to the Counsellor of the town asking if the work pleased him that he would assist in its publication At first Counsellor Moritz was annoyed at the request but as he read he became deeply interested and said this is surely from Goethe Herder or Weiland The book was soon published and two hundred and twenty six dollars paid for it The moment Richter received the first instalment of seventy dollars he hastened to Hof and there late at night found his mother spinning by the light of the fire and poured the whole of the gold into her lap The surprise joy and thanksgiving of the poor woman can well be imagined Her son immediately moved her into a small but more comfortable home The new novel began to be talked about and widely read Fame was really coming He began at once to work on Hesperus one of his most famous productions though when published he received only two hundred dollars for the four volumes Letters now came from scholars and famous people One admirer sent fifty Prussian dollars What joy must have swelled the heart of the poor schoolteacher Flower Fruit and Thorn Pieces followed shortly after and Richter was indeed famous Learned ladies of Weimar wrote most enthusiastic thanks With his reverence for woman and delight in her intellectual equality with man these letters were most inspiring Request after request came for him to visit Weimar Dare he go and meet such people as Goethe and Schiller and Herder and Weiland whom for twelve long years he had hoped sometime to look upon At last he started and upon reaching Weimar was made the lion of the day His warm heart generous and unaffected nature and brilliant and well stored mind made him admired by all Herder said Heaven has sent me a treasure in Richter That I neither deserved nor expected He is all heart all soul an harmonious tone in the great golden harp of humanity Caroline Herder his wife a very gifted woman was equally his friend and helper Noble and intellectual women gathered about him to do him honor Some fell in love with him but he studied them closely as models for future characters in his books giving only an ardent friendship in return He was even invited to court and gathered here the scenes for his greatest work Titan How grand all this seemed to the poor man who had been hungering all his life for refined and intellectual companionship So rejoiced was he that he wrote home I have lived twenty years in Weimar in a few days I am happy wholly happy not merely beyond all expectation but beyond all description He was now thirty four The poor patient mother had just died but not till she had heard the fame of her son spoken on every hand After her death Paul found a faded manuscript in which she had kept the record of those small gains in spinning into the midnight hours He carried it next his heart saying If all other manuscripts are destroyed yet will I keep this good mother For weeks he was not able to write a letter or mention the loss of his parent His youngest brother Samuel a talented boy was now ready for college so Jean Paul determined to make Leipzig his home while his brother pursued his course What changes the last few years had wrought Then he was stealing away from Leipzig in debt for his board cold hungry and desolate now he was coming the brilliant author whom everybody delighted to honor When we are in want few are ready to help when above want the world stands ready to lavish all upon us After spending some time in Leipzig he visited Dresden to enjoy the culture of that artistic city During this visit Samuel who had become dissipated broke into his brother s desk stole all his hard earned money and left the city He led a wandering life thereafter dying in a hospital in Silesia Paul never saw him again but sent him a yearly allowance as soon as he learned his abiding place What a noble character He now returned to Weimar dedicating his Titan to the four daughters of the Duke of Mecklenburg one of whom became the mother of Emperor William the famous and beautiful Louise of Prussia He visited her later in Berlin where he writes I have never been received in any city with such idolatry I have a watch chain of the hair of three sisters and so much hair has been begged of me that if I were to make it a traffic I could live as well from the outside of my head as from what is inside of it In this city he met the woman who was to be hereafter the very centre of his life He had had a passing fancy for several but never for one that seemed fitted all in all to make his life complete Caroline Myer the daughter of one of the most distinguished Prussian officers was a refined intellectual noble girl with almost unlimited resources within herself devoted to her family and to every good Paul had met women who dressed more elegantly who were more sparkling in conversation who were more beautiful but they did not satisfy his heart In his thirty eighth year he had found a character that seemed perfection He wrote Caroline has exactly that inexpressible love for all beings that I have till now failed to find even in those who in everything else possess the splendor and purity of the diamond She preserves in the full harmony of her love to me the middle and lower tones of sympathy for every joy and sorrow in others Her love for Richter was nearly adoration Several months after their marriage she wrote her father Richter is the purest the holiest the most godlike man that lives Could others be admitted as I am to his inmost emotions how much more would they esteem him Richter also wrote to his best friend Otto Marriage has made me love her more romantically deeper infinitely more than before At the birth of their first child he wrote again to Otto You will be as transported as I was when the nurse brought me as out of a cloud my second love with the blue eyes wide open a beautiful high brow kiss lipped heart touching God is near at the birth of every child On Caroline s first birthday after their marriage he wrote I will be to thee father and mother Thou shalt be the happiest of human beings that I also may be happy Titan now ten years in progress was published and made a great sensation The literary world was indignant at the fate of Linda his heroine but all pronounced it a great book his masterpiece Soon after he removed to Bayreuth and settled down to earnest work Almost every day he might be seen walking out into the country where he rented a room in a peasant s house for quiet and country air Whenever the day was pleasant he worked out of doors A son had now been born to him and life seemed complete Now he played with his home treasures and now talked at table about some matter of art or science that all might be instructed He was especially fond of animals having usually a mouse a tame spider a tree frog and dogs So good was he to his canary birds that he never left the house without opening the door of their cage that they might fly about and not be lonely Often when he wrote they walked over his manuscript scattering water from the vase and mingling it with his ink His son Max a boy of sixteen had entered school at Munich He was a beautiful youth conscientious sensitive devoted to study and the idol of the household At first he wept whole nights from homesickness denying himself sufficient fire food and clothing from a desire to save expense to his parents He was a fine scholar but distrusted his intellectual gifts At the end of a year he came home pale and worn and died at the age of nineteen To Richter this was a death blow He went on writing while the tears dropped upon his page He could never bear the sight of a book his boy had touched and the word philology his son s favorite study cut him to the heart At the end of three months he wrote to a friend My being has suffered not merely a wound but a complete cutting off of all joy My longing after him grows always more painful Broken in health he visited Dresden but the end was near The sight of the left eye at first failed him then the right till he was left in complete darkness He still hoped to finish his autobiography and the Immortality of the Soul begun on the very day Max was buried but this was denied him Once only did his sorrows overpower him when pitifully looking toward the window he cried out as Ajax in the Iliad Light light only then may the enemy come The devoted wife and two daughters grew unspeakably dear to him When tired with thinking he would seat himself at the piano and play till he as well as those who heard him would burst into tears On the fourteenth of November eighteen twenty five he sat in his chamber his youngest child climbing on the back of his chair and laying her face against her father s It was only noon but thinking it was night Richter said It is time to go to rest He was wheeled into his sleeping apartment and some flowers laid on the bed beside him My beautiful flowers My lovely flowers he said as he folded his arms and soon fell asleep His wife sat beside him her eyes fixed on the face of the man she loved About six the doctor arrived The breath came shorter the face took on a heavenly expression and grew cold as marble The end had come He was buried by torchlight the unfinished manuscript of the Immortality of the Soul being borne upon his coffin while the students sung Klopstock s hymn Thou shalt arise my Soul His more than one hundred volumes and his noble generous life are his monuments He said I shall die without having seen Switzerland or the ocean but the ocean of eternity I shall not fail to see LEON GAMBETTA On January six eighteen eighty three Paris presented a sad and imposing spectacle Her shops were closed her public buildings and her homes were draped in black Her streets were solid with hundreds of thousands all dispirited and many in tears A large catafalque covered with black velvet upheld a coffin shrouded with the tricolor From a vase at each corner rose burning perfume whose vapor was like sweet incense Six black horses drew the funeral car and two hundred thousand persons followed in the procession many bearing aloft wreaths of flowers and shouting Vive la Republique Vive la Gambetta The maker of the Republic the brilliant eloquent leader of the French people was dead dead in the prime of his life at forty five The Figaro but voiced the feeling of the world when it said The Republic has lost its greatest man America might well mourn him as a friend for he made her his pattern for his beloved France The Pall Mall Gazette said He will live in French history among the most courageous and even Germany courted him as the bravest of the brave while she breathed freer saying in the Berlin Press The death of Gambetta delivers the peace of Europe from great danger The hand that would sometime doubtless have reached out to take back sobbing Alsace and Lorraine was palsied the voice that swayed the multitude now with its sweet persuasiveness and now with its thunder like the rush of a swollen torrent was hushed the supreme will that held France like a willing child in its power had yielded to the inevitable death Illustration LEON GAMBETTA Leon Gambetta was born at Cahors April two eighteen thirty eight His father was an Italian from Genoa poor and of good character his mother a French woman singularly hopeful energetic and noble They owned a little bazaar and grocery and here Onasie the wife day after day helped her husband to earn a comfortable living When their only son was seven years old he was sent to a Jesuits preparatory school at Monfaucon his parents hoping that he would become a priest His mother had great pride in him and faith in his future She taught him how to read from the National a newspaper founded by Thiers republican in its tendencies She saw with delight that when very young he would learn the speeches of Thiers and Guizot which he found in its columns and declaim them as he roamed alone the narrow streets and by the quaint old bridges and towers of Cahors At Monfaucon he gave his orations before the other children the mother sending him the much prized National whenever he obtained good marks and the Jesuits whether pleased or not did not interfere with their boyish republican At eight years of age an unfortunate accident happened which bade fair to ruin his hopes While watching a cutter drill the handle of a knife the foil broke and a piece entered the right eye spoiling the sight Twenty years afterward when the left through sympathy seemed to be nearly destroyed a glass eye was inserted and the remaining one was saved When Leon was ten years old the Revolution of eighteen forty eight deposed Louis Philippe the Orleanist and Louis Napoleon was made President of the Republic Perhaps the people ought to have known that no presidency would long satisfy the ambition of a Bonaparte He at once began to increase his power by winning the Catholic Church to his side The Jesuits no longer allowed the boy Leon to talk republicanism they saw that it was doomed They scolded him whipped him took away the National and finally expelled him writing to his parents You will never make a priest of him he has an utterly undisciplinable character The father frowned when he returned home and the neighbors prophesied that he would end his life in the Bastile for holding such radical opinions The poor mother blamed herself for putting the National into his hands and thus bringing all this trouble upon him Ah she wrought better than she knew But for the National and Gambetta s unconquerable love for a republic France might to day be the plaything of an emperor Meantime Louis Napoleon was putting his friends into office making tours about the country to win adherents and securing the army and the police to his side At seven o clock on the morning of December two eighteen fifty one the famous Coup d etat came and the unscrupulous President had made himself Emperor Nearly two hundred and fifty deputies were arrested and imprisoned and the Republicans who opposed the usurpation were quickly subdued by the army Then the French were graciously permitted to say by ballot whether they were willing to accept the empire There was of course but one judicious way to vote and that was in the affirmative and they thus voted Joseph Gambetta the father saw the political storm which was coming and fearing for his outspoken son locked him up in a lyceum at Cahors till he was seventeen Here he attracted the notice of his teachers by his fondness for reading his great memory and his love of history and politics At sixteen he had read the Latin authors and the economical works of Proudhon When he came home his father told him that he must now become a grocer and succeed to the business He obeyed but his studious mind had no interest in the work He recoiled from spending his powers in persuading the mayor s wife that a yard of Genoa velvet at twenty francs was cheaper than the same measure of the Lyon s article at thirteen So tired and sick of the business did he become that he begged his father to be allowed to keep the accounts which he did in a neat delicate hand His watchful mother saw that her boy s health was failing He was restless and miserable He longed to go to Paris to study law and then teach in some provincial town He planned ways of escape from the hated tasks but he had no money and no friends in the great city But his mother planned to some purpose She said to M Menier the chocolate maker I have a son of great promise whom I want to send to Paris against his father s will to study law He is a good lad and no fool But my husband who wants him to continue his business here will I know try to starve him into submission What I am about to propose is that if I buy your chocolate at the rate you offer it and buy it outright instead of taking it to sell on commission will you say nothing if I enter it on the book at a higher price and you pay the difference to my son Menier interested to have the boy prosper quickly agreed After a time she called her son aside and placing a bag of money in his hand said This my boy is to pay your way for a year A trunk full of clothes is ready for you Try and come home somebody Start soon and take care to let nobody suspect you are going away Do not say good bye to a single soul I want to avoid a scene between you and your father Ambition welled up again in his heart and the bright expression came back into his face The next morning he slipped away and was soon at Paris He drove to the Sorbonne because he had heard that lectures were given there The cab driver recommended a cheap hotel close by and obtaining a room in the garret the youth not yet eighteen began his studies He rose early and worked hard attending lectures at the medical school as well as at the law buying his books at second hand shops along the streets Though poverty often pinched him as to food and his clothes were poor he did not mind it but bent all his energies to his work His mother wrote how angered the father was at his leaving and would not allow his name to be mentioned in his presence Poor Joseph how limited was his horizon Leon s intelligence and originality won the esteem of the professors and one of them said Your father acts stupidly You have a true vocation Follow it But go to the bar where your voice which is one in a thousand will carry you on study and intelligence aiding The lecture room is a narrow theatre If you like I will write to your father to tell him what my opinion of you is Professor Valette wrote to Joseph Gambetta The best investment you ever made would be to spend what money you can afford to divert from your business in helping your son to become an advocate The letter caused a sensation in the Gambetta family The mother took courage and urged the case of her darling child while her sister Jenny Massabie talked ardently for her bright nephew An allowance was finally made In two years Leon had mastered the civil criminal military forest and maritime codes Too young to be admitted to the bar to plead for nearly a year he studied Paris its treasures of art and its varied life It opened a new and grand world to him Accidentally he made the acquaintance of the head usher at the Corps Legislatif who said to the young student You are an excellent fellow and I shall like to oblige you so if the debates of the Corps Legislatif interest you come there and ask for me and I will find you a corner in the galleries where you can hear and see everything Here Leon studied parliamentary usage and saw the repression of thought under an empire At the Cafe Procope once the resort of Voltaire Diderot Rousseau and other literary celebrities the young man talked over the speeches he had heard with his acquaintances and told what he would do if he were in the House An improbable thing it seemed that a poor and unknown lad would ever sit in the Corps Legislatif as one of its members He organized a club for reading and debating and was of course made its head It could not be other than republican in sentiment In eighteen sixty at the age of twenty two Gambetta was admitted to the bar The father was greatly opposed to his living in Paris where he thought there was no chance for a lawyer who had neither money nor influential friends and urged his returning to Cahors Again his aunt Jenny whom he always affectionately called Tata took his part Having an income of five hundred dollars a year she said to the father You do not see how you can help your son in Paris it may be for long years but next week I will go with him and we shall stay together and then turning to her nephew she added And now my boy I will give you food and shelter and you will do the rest by your work They took a small house in the Latin Quartier very plain and comfortless His first brief came after waiting eighteen months Grepps a deputy being accused of conspiracy against the Government Gambetta defended him so well that Cremieux a prominent lawyer asked him to become his secretary The case was not reported in the papers and was therefore known only by a limited circle For six years the brilliant young scholar was virtually chained to his desk The only recreation was an occasional gathering of a few newspaper men at his rooms for whom his aunt cooked the supper willing and glad to do the work because she believed he would some day come to renown from his genius Finally his hour came At the Coup d etat doctor Baudin a deputy for defending the rights of the National Assembly was shot on a barricade On All Soul s Day eighteen sixty eight the Republicans to the number of a thousand gathered at the grave in the cemetery of Montmartre to lay flowers upon it and listen to addresses The Emperor could not but see that such demonstrations would do harm to his throne Dellschuzes the leader was therefore arrested and chose the unknown lawyer Gambetta to defend him He was a strong radical and he asked only one favor of his lawyer that he would hit hard the Man of December as those who hated the Coup d etat of December two loved to call Louis Napoleon Gambetta was equal to the occasion He likened the Emperor to Catiline declaring that as a highwayman he had taken France and felled her senseless For seventeen years he said you have been masters of France and you have never dared to celebrate the Second of December It is we who take up the anniversary which you no more dare face than a fear haunted murderer can his victim s corpse When finally overcome with emotion Gambetta sank into his seat at the close of his speech the die was cast He had become famous from one end of France to the other and the Empire had received a blow from which it never recovered That night at the clubs and in the press offices the name of Leon Gambetta was on every lip It is not strange that in the elections of the following year he was asked to represent Belleville and Marseilles and chose the latter saying to his constituents that he was in irreconcilable opposition to the Empire He at once became the leader of a new party the Irreconcilables and Napoleon s downfall became from that hour only a question of time Gambetta spoke everywhere and was soon conceded to be the finest orator in France Worn in body by the confinement of the secretaryship and the political campaign he repaired to Ems for a short time where he met Bismarck He will go far said the Man of Iron I pity the Emperor for having such an irreconcilable enemy The National under Madam Gambetta s teaching in childhood was bearing fruit Napoleon saw that something must be done to make his throne more stable in the hearts of his people He attempted a more liberal policy with Emile Ollivier at the head of affairs But Gambetta was still irreconcilable saying in one of his great speeches We accept you and your Constitutionalism as a bridge to the Republic but nothing more At last war was declared against Prussia as much with the hope of promoting peace at home as to win honors in Germany Everybody knows the rapid and crushing defeat of the French and the fall of Napoleon at Sedan September two when he wrote to King William of Prussia Not having been able to die at the head of my troops I can only resign my sword into the hands of your Majesty When the news reached Paris on the following day the people were frantic Had the Emperor returned a defeated man he could never have reached the Tuileries alive Crowds gathered in the streets and forced their way into the hall of the Corps Legislatif Then the eloquent leader of the Republican ranks scarcely heard of two years before ascended the Tribune and declared that Louis Napoleon Bonaparte and his dynasty have forever ceased to reign over France With Jules Favre Ferry Simon and others he hastened to the Hotel de Ville writing on slips of paper and throwing out to the multitude the names of those who were to be the heads of the provisional government Cool fearless heroic Gambetta stood at the summit of power and controlled the people They believed in him because he believed in the Republic Meantime the German armies were marching on Paris The people fortified their city and prepared to die if need be in their homes Before Paris was cut off from the outside world by the siege part of the governing force retired to Tours It became necessary for Gambetta in October to visit this city for conference and to accomplish this he started in a balloon which was just grazed by the Prussian guns as he passed over the lines It was a hazardous step but the balloon landed in a forest near Amiens and he was safe When he arrived in Tours there was not a soldier in the place in a month by superhuman energy and the most consummate skill and wisdom he had raised three armies of eight hundred thousand men provided by loan for their maintenance and directed their military operations One of the prominent officers on the German side says This colossal energy is the most remarkable event of modern history and will carry down Gambetta s name to remote posterity He was now in reality the Dictator of France at thirty two years of age He gave the fullest liberty to the press had a pleasant Bon jour mon ami for a workman no matter how overwhelmed with cares he might be and a self possession a quickness of decision and an indomitable will that made him a master in every company and on every occasion He electrified France by his speeches he renewed her courage and revived her patriotism Even after the bloody defeat of Bazaine at Gravelotte and his strange surrender of one hundred and seventy thousand men at Metz Gambetta did not despair of France being able at least to demand an honorable peace But France had grown tired of battles Paris had endured a siege of four months and the people were nearly in a starving condition The Communists too were demanding impossible things Therefore after seven months of war the articles of peace were agreed upon by which France gave to Germany fourteen hundred million dollars to be paid in three years and ceded to her the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine Gambetta could never bring himself to consent to these humiliating conditions and on the day on which the terms were ratified he and his colleagues from these two sections of the country left the assembly together Just as they were passing out the venerable Jean Kuss mayor of Strasburg staggered up to Gambetta saying Let me grasp your patriot s hand It is the last time I shall shake it My heart is broken Promise to redeem brave Strasburg He fell to the floor and died almost immediately Gambetta retired to Spain till recalled by the elections of the following July He now began again his heroic labors speaking all through France teaching the people the true principles of a republic not communism not lawlessness but order prudence and self government He urged free obligatory education and the scattering of books libraries and institutes everywhere When Thiers was made the first President Gambetta was his most important and truest ally though the former had called him a furious fool so ready was the Great Republican to forgive harshness In eighteen seventy seven he again saved his beloved Republic The Monarchists had become restless and finally displaced Thiers by Marshal MacMahon a strong Romanist and a man devoted to the Empire It seemed evident that another coup d etat was meditated Gambetta stirred the country to action He declared that the President must submit or resign and for those words he was sentenced to three months imprisonment and a fine of four hundred dollars which sentence was never executed MacMahon seeing that the Republic was stronger than he had supposed soon after resigned his position and was succeeded by M Grevy Gambetta was made President of the Assembly and doubtless if he had lived would have been made President of the Republic There were not wanting those who claimed that he was ambitious for the supreme rule but when death came from the accidental discharge of a pistol producing a wound in the hand all calumny was hushed and France beheld her idol in his true light the incarnation of republicanism Two hours before his death at his plain home just out of Paris at Ville d Avray he said I am dying there is no use in denying it but I have suffered so much it will be a great deliverance He longed to last till the New Year but died five minutes before midnight Dec thirty one eighteen eighty two The following day fifteen thousand persons called to see the great statesman as he lay upon his single iron bedstead Afterward the body lay in state at the Palais Bourbon the guard standing nearly to their knees in flowers Over two thousand wreaths were given by friends Alsace sent a magnificent crown of roses No grander nor sadder funeral was ever seen in France Paris was urgent that he be buried in Pere la Chaise but his father would not consent so the body was carried to Nice to lie beside his mother who died a year before him and his devoted aunt who died five years previously Every day Joseph Gambetta lays flowers upon the graves of his dear ones Circumstances helped to make the great orator but he also made circumstances True his opportunity came at the trial after the Baudin demonstration but he was ready for the opportunity He had studied the history of an empire under the Caesars and he knew how republics are made and lost When in the Corps Legislatif a leader was needed he was ready for he had carefully studied men When at Tours he directed the military he knew what he was doing for he was conversant with the details of our civil war When others were sauntering for pleasure along the Champs Elysees he had been poring over books in an attic opposite the Sorbonne He died early but he accomplished more than most men who live to be twice forty five When in the years to come imperialists shall strive again to wrest the government from the hands of the people the name of Leon Gambetta will be an inspiration a talisman of victory for the Republic Illustration D G FARRAGUT From his Life published by D APPLETON company DAVID GLASGOW FARRAGUT The possibilities of American life are strikingly illustrated by the fact that the two names at the head of the army and navy Grant and Farragut represent self made men The latter was born on a farm near Knoxville Tennessee July five eighteen oh one His mother of Scotch descent was a brave and energetic woman Once when the father was absent in the Indian wars the savages came to their plain home and demanded admittance She barred the door as best she could and sending her trembling children into the loft guarded the entrance with an axe The Indians thought discretion the better part of valor and stole quietly away When David was seven years old the family having moved to New Orleans as the father had been appointed sailing master in the navy the noble mother died of yellow fever leaving five children the youngest an infant This was a most severe blow Fortunately soon after an act of kindness brought its reward The father of Commodore Porter having died at the Farragut house the son determined to adopt one of the motherless children if one was willing to leave his home Little David was pleased with the uniform and said promptly that he would go Saying good bye forever to his father he was taken to Washington and after a few months spent in school at the age of nine years and a half was made a midshipman And now began a life full of hardship of adventure and of brave deeds which have added lustre to the American navy and have made the name of Farragut immortal His first cruise was along the coast in the Essex after the war of eighteen twelve with Great Britain had begun They had captured the Alert and other prizes and their ship was crowded with prisoners One night when the boy lay apparently asleep the coxswain of the Alert came to his hammock pistol in hand David lay motionless till he passed on and then crept noiselessly to the cabin and informed Captain Porter Springing from his cot he shouted Fire fire The seamen rushed on deck and the mutineers were in irons before they had recovered from their amazement Evidently the boy had inherited some of his mother s fearlessness His second cruise was in the Pacific Ocean where they encountered a fearful storm going round Cape Horn An incident occurred at this time which showed the mettle of the lad Though only twelve he was ordered by Captain Porter to take a prize vessel to Valparaiso the captured captain being required to navigate it When David requested that the maintopsail be filled away the captain replied that he would shoot any man who dared to touch a rope without his orders and then went below for his pistols David called one of the crew told him what had happened and what he wanted done Aye aye sir responded the faithful sailor as he began to execute the orders The young midshipman at once sent word to the captain not to come on deck with his pistols unless he wished to go overboard From that moment the boy was master of the vessel and admired for his bravery The following year eighteen fourteen while the Essex was off the coast of Chili she was attacked by the British ships Phoebe and Cherub The battle lasted for two hours and a half the Phoebe throwing seven hundred eighteen pound shots at the Essex I shall never forget Farragut said years after the horrid impression made upon me at the sight of the first man I had ever seen killed It staggered and sickened me at first but they soon began to fall so fast that it all appeared like a dream and produced no effect upon my nerves Soon after this some gun primers were wanted and I was sent after them In going below while I was on the ward room ladder the captain of the gun directly opposite the hatchway was struck full in the face by an eighteen pound shot and fell back on me We tumbled down the hatch together I lay for some moments stunned by the blow but soon recovered consciousness enough to rush up on deck The captain seeing me covered with blood asked if I was wounded to which I replied I believe not sir Then said he where are the primers This brought me completely to my senses and I ran below again and carried the primers on deck When Porter had been forced to surrender David went below to help the surgeon in dressing wounds One brave young man Lieutenant Cowell said O Davy I fear it is all up with me He could have been saved had his leg been amputated an hour sooner but when it was proposed to drop another patient and attend to him he said No Doctor none of that fair play is a jewel One man s life is as dear as another s I would not cheat any poor fellow out of his turn Many brave men died saying Don t give her up Hurrah for liberty One young Scotchman whose leg had been shot off said to his comrades I left my own country and adopted the United States to fight for her I hope I have this day proved myself worthy of the country of my adoption I am no longer of any use to you or to her so good bye saying which he threw himself overboard When David was taken a prisoner on board the Phoebe he could not refrain from tears at his mortification Never mind my little fellow said the captain it will be your turn next perhaps I hope so was the reply Soon David s pet pig Murphy was brought on board and he immediately claimed it But said the English sailor you are a prisoner and your pig also We always respect private property the boy replied seizing hold of Murphy and after a vigorous fight the pet was given to its owner On returning to Captain Porter s house at Chester Pa David was put at school for the summer under a quaint instructor one of Napoleon s celebrated Guard who used no book but taught the boys about plants and minerals and how to climb and swim In the fall he was placed on a receiving ship but gladly left the wild set of lads for a cruise in the Mediterranean Here he had the opportunity of visiting Naples Pompeii and other places of interest but he encountered much that was harsh and trying Commodore C sometimes knocked down his own son and his son s friend as well not a pleasant person to be governed by In eighteen seventeen Chaplain Folsom of their ship was appointed consul at Tunis He loved David as a brother and begged the privilege of keeping him for a time because said he to the commodore he is entirely destitute of the aids of fortune and the influence of friends other than those whom his character may attach to him For nearly nine months he remained with the chaplain studying French Italian English literature and mathematics and developing in manliness and refinement The Danish consul showed great fondness for the frank ardent boy now sixteen and invited him to his house at Carthage Failing in his health a horseback trip toward the interior of the country was recommended and during the journey he received a sunstroke and his eyes were permanently weakened All his life however he had some one read to him and thus mitigate his misfortune The time came to go back to duty on the ship and Chaplain Folsom clasped the big boy to his bosom fervently kissing him on each cheek and giving him his parting blessing mingled with his tears Forty years after when the young midshipman had become the famous Admiral he sent a token of respect and affection to his old friend For some years having been appointed acting lieutenant he cruised in the Gulf of Mexico gaining knowledge which he was glad to use later and in the West Indies where for two years and a half he says I never owned a bed but lay down to rest wherever I found the most comfortable berth Sometimes he and his seamen pursued pirates who infested the coast cutting their way through thornbushes and cactus plants with their cutlasses then burning the houses of these robbers and taking their plunder out of their caves It was an exciting but wearing life After a visit to his old home at New Orleans his father had died and his sister did not recognize him he contracted yellow fever and lay ill for some time in a Washington hospital Perhaps the sailor was tired of his roving and somewhat lonely life and now married at twenty two Miss Susan Marchant of Norfolk Virginia For sixteen years she was an invalid so that he carried her often in his arms like a child Now he took her to New Haven for treatment and improved what time he could spare by attending Professor Silliman s lectures at Yale College Now he conducted a school on a receiving ship so as to have her with him She bore the sickness with unparalleled resignation and patience says Farragut in his journal affording a beautiful example of calmness and fortitude One of her friends in Norfolk said When Captain Farragut dies he should have a monument reaching to the skies made by every wife in the city contributing a stone to it How the world admires a brave man with a tender heart Farragut was now nearly forty years of age never pushing himself forward honors had come slowly Three years later having been made commandant he married Miss Virginia Royall also of Norfolk Va At the beginning of the Mexican War he offered his services to the Government but from indifference or the jealousy of officials he was not called upon The next twelve years were spent partly in the Norfolk Navy Yard giving weekly lectures on gunnery preparing a book on ordnance regulations and establishing a navy yard on the Pacific Coast Whatever he did was done thoroughly and faithfully When asked by the Navy Department to express a preference about a position he said I have no volition in the matter your duty is to give me orders mine to obey I have made it the rule of my life to ask no official favors but to await orders and then obey them And now came the turning point of his life April seventeen eighteen sixty Virginia by a vote of eighty eight to fifty five seceded from the United States The next morning Farragut then at Norfolk expressed disapproval of the acts of the convention and said President Lincoln would be justified in calling for troops after the Southerners had taken forts and arsenals He was soon informed that a person with those sentiments could not live in Norfolk Well then I can live somewhere else was the calm reply Returning home he announced to his wife that he had determined to stick to the flag This act of mine may cause years of separation from your family so you must decide quickly whether you will go North or remain here She decided at once to go with him and hastily collecting a few articles departed that evening for Baltimore That city was in commotion the Massachusetts troops having had a conflict with the mob He finally secured passage for New York on a canal boat and with limited means rented a cottage at Hastings on the Hudson for one hundred and fifty dollars a year He loved the South and said God forbid that I should have to raise my hand against her but he was anxious to take part in the war for the Union and offered his services to that end The Government had an important project in hand The Mississippi River was largely in the control of the Confederacy and was the great highway for transporting her supplies New Orleans was the richest city of the South receiving for shipment at this time ninety two million dollars worth of cotton and more than twenty five million dollars worth of sugar yearly If this city could be captured and the river controlled by the North the South would be seriously crippled But the lower Mississippi was guarded by the strongest forts Jackson and saint Philip which mounted one hundred and fifteen guns and were garrisoned by fifteen hundred men Above the forts were fifteen vessels of the Confederate fleet including the ironclad ram Manassas and just below a heavy iron chain across the river bound together scores of cypress logs thirty feet long and four or five feet in diameter thus forming an immense obstruction Sharpshooters were stationed all along the banks Who could be entrusted with such a formidable undertaking as the capture of this stronghold Who sufficiently daring skilful and loyal Several naval officers were considered but Gideon Welles Secretary of the Navy said Farragut is the man The steam sloop of war Hartford of nineteen hundred tons burden and two hundred twenty five feet long was made ready as his flag ship His instructions were The certain capture of the city of New Orleans The Department and the country require of you success If successful you open the way to the sea for the Great West never again to be closed The rebellion will be riven in the centre and the flag to which you have been so faithful will recover its supremacy in every State With a grateful heart that he had been thought fitting for this high place and believing in his ability to win success at sixty one years of age he started on his mission saying If I die in the attempt it will only be what every officer has to expect He who dies in doing his duty to his country and at peace with his God has played the drama of life to the best advantage He took with him six sloops of war sixteen gunboats twenty one schooners and five other vessels forty eight in all the fleet carrying over two hundred guns April eighteen eighteen sixty two they had all reached their positions and were ready for the struggle For six days and nights the mortars kept up a constant fire on Fort Jackson throwing nearly six thousand shells Many persons were killed but the fort did not yield The Confederates sent down the river five fire rafts flat boats filled with dry wood smeared with tar and turpentine hoping that these would make havoc among Farragut s ships but his crews towed them away to shore or let them drift out to sea Farragut now made up his mind to pass the forts at all hazards It was a dangerous and heroic step If he won New Orleans must fall if he failed but he must not fail Two gunboats were sent to cut the chain across the river All night long the commander watched with intense anxiety the return of the boats which under a galling fire had succeeded in breaking the chain and thus making a passage for the fleet At half past three o clock on the morning of April twenty four the fleet was ready to start The Cayuga led off the first division of eight vessels Both forts opened fire In ten minutes she had passed beyond saint Philip only to be surrounded by eleven Confederate gunboats The Varuna came to her relief but was rammed by two Southern boats and sunk in fifteen minutes The Mississippi encountered the enemy s ram Manassas riddled her with shot and set her on fire so that she drifted below the forts and blew up Then the centre division led by the Hartford passed into the terrific fire First she grounded in avoiding a fire raft then a Confederate ram pushed a raft against her setting her on fire but Farragut gave his orders as calmly as though not in the utmost peril The flames were extinguished and she steamed on doing terrible execution with her shells Then came the last division led by the Sciota and Commander Porter s gunboats In the darkness lighted only by the flashes of over two hundred guns the fleet had cut its way to victory losing one hundred and eighty four in killed and wounded In a twinkling the flames had risen Half way to maintop and mizzen Darting up the shrouds like snakes Ah how we clanked at the brakes And the deep steam pumps throbbed under Sending a ceaseless glow Our top men a dauntless crowd Swarmed in rigging and shroud There twas a wonder The burning ratlins and strands They quenched with their bare hard hands But the great guns below Never silenced their thunder At last by backing and sounding When we were clear of grounding And under headway once more The whole Rebel fleet came rounding The point If we had it hot before Twas now from shore to shore One long loud thundering roar Such crashing splintering and pounding And smashing as you never heard before But that we fought foul wrong to wreck And to save the land we loved so well You might have deemed our long gun deck Two hundred feet of hell For all above was battle Broadside and blaze and rattle Smoke and thunder alone But down in the sick bay Where our wounded and dying lay There was scarce a sob or a moan And at last when the dim day broke And the sullen sun awoke Drearily blinking O er the haze and the cannon smoke That even such morning dulls There were thirteen traitor hulls On fire and sinking Henry Howard Brownell Thus says the son of Farragut in his admirable biography was accomplished a feat in naval warfare which had no precedent and which is still without a parallel except the one furnished by Farragut himself two years later at Mobile Starting with seventeen wooden vessels he had passed with all but three of them against the swift current of a river but half a mile wide between two powerful earthworks which had long been prepared for him his course impeded by blazing rafts and immediately thereafter had met the enemy s fleet of fifteen vessels two of them ironclads and either captured or destroyed every one of them And all this with a loss of but one ship from his squadron The following day he wrote My dearest wife and boy I am so agitated that I can scarcely write and shall only tell you that it has pleased Almighty God to preserve my life through a fire such as the world has scarcely known He has permitted me to make a name for my dear boy s inheritance as well as for my comfort and that of my family The next day at eleven o clock in the morning by order of Farragut the officers and crews of the fleet return thanks to Almighty God for His great goodness and mercy in permitting us to pass through the events of the last two days with so little loss of life and blood April twenty nine a battalion of two hundred and fifty marines and two howitzers manned by sailors from the Hartford marched through the streets of New Orleans hoisted the Union flag in place of the Confederate on the city hall and held possession till General Butler arrived with his troops on May one After the fall of the city the forts surrendered to Porter From here Farragut went to Vicksburg with sixteen vessels the Hartford he says like an old hen taking care of her chickens and passed the batteries with fifteen killed and thirty wounded Three months later he received the thanks of Congress on parchment for the gallant services of himself and his men and was made Rear Admiral He remained on the river and gulf for some months doing effective work in sustaining the blockade and destroying the salt works along the coast When the memorable passage of the batteries at Port Hudson was made where one hundred and thirteen were killed or wounded the Hartford taking the lead his idolized boy Loyall stood beside him When urged by the surgeon to let his son go below to help about the wounded because it was safer he replied No that will not do It is true our only child is on board by chance and he is not in the service but being here he will act as one of my aids to assist in conveying my orders during the battle and we will trust in Providence Neither would the lad listen to the suggestion for he wanted to be stationed on deck and see the fight Farragut soon sent him back to his mother for he said I am too devoted a father to have my son with me in troubles of this kind The anxieties of a father should not be added to those of a commander Every day was full of exciting incident The admiral needing some despatches taken down the river his secretary mister Gabaudan volunteered to bear the message A small dug out was covered with twigs so as to resemble floating trees At night he lay down in his little craft with paddle and pistol by his side and drifted with the current Once a Confederate boat pulled out into the stream to investigate the somewhat large tree but returned to report that It was only a log He succeeded in reaching General Banks who had taken the place of General Butler and when the fleet returned to New Orleans he was warmly welcomed on board by his admiring companions Farragut now returned to New York for a short time where all were anxious to meet the Hero of New Orleans and to see the historic Hartford which had been struck two hundred and forty times by shot and shell in nineteen months service The Union League Club presented him a beautiful sword the scabbard of gold and silver and the hilt set in brilliants His next point of attack was Mobile Bay Under cover of the forts Morgan Gaines and Powell the blockade was constantly broken A good story is told of the capture of one of these vessels whose merchant captain was brought before Farragut He proved to be an old acquaintance who said he was bound for Matamoras on the Rio Grande The admiral expressed amazement that he should be three hundred miles out of his course and said good naturedly I am sorry for you but we shall have to hold you for your thundering bad navigation And now occurred the most brilliant battle of his career Aug four eighteen sixty four he wrote to his wife I am going into Mobile Bay in the morning if God is my leader as I hope He is and in Him I place my trust God bless and preserve you my darling and my dear boy if anything should happen to me Your devoted and affectionate husband who never for one moment forgot his love duty or fidelity to you his devoted and best of wives At half past five on the morning of Aug five fourteen ships and four monitors headed by the Brooklyn because she had apparatus for picking up torpedoes moved into action Very soon the Tecumseh the monitor abreast of the Brooklyn went down with nearly every soul on board sunk by a torpedo When the Brooklyn saw this disaster she began to back What s the trouble was shouted through the trumpet Torpedoes The supreme moment had come for decision The grand old admiral offered up this prayer in his heart O God direct me what to do Shall I go on And a voice seemed to answer Go on Go ahead he shouted to his captain on the Hartford give her all the steam you ve got And like a thing of life she swept on over the torpedoes to the head of the fleet where she became the special target of the enemy Her timbers crashed and her wounded came pouring down cries never to be forgotten Twice the brave admiral was lashed to the rigging by his devoted men lest in his exposed position he fall overboard if struck by a ball The fleet lost three hundred and thirty five men but Farragut gained the day When all was over and he looked upon the dead laid out on the port side of his ship he wept like a child The prisoners captured in the defences of Mobile were one thousand four hundred and sixty four with one hundred and four guns On his return to New York he was welcomed with the grandest demonstrations Crowds gathered at the Battery a public reception was given him at the Custom House and fifty thousand dollars with which to buy a house in New York Congress made him Vice Admiral Prominent politicians asked him to become a candidate for the Presidency but he refused saying I have no ambition for anything but what I am an admiral I have worked hard for three years have been in eleven fights and am willing to fight eleven more if necessary but when I go home I desire peace and comfort At Hastings on the Hudson the streets were arched with the words New Orleans Mobile Jackson saint Philip et cetera Boston gave him a welcome reception at Faneuil Hall Oliver Wendell Holmes reading a poem on the occasion At Cambridge two hundred Harvard students took his horses from the carriage and attaching ropes to it drew him through the streets On July twenty five eighteen sixty six the rank of admiral was created by Congress and Farragut was appointed to the place Honors and well deserved ones had come at last to the brave midshipman The next year in command of the European squadron accompanied by missus Farragut who went by special permission of the President he visited France Russia and other countries Napoleon III welcomed him to the Tuileries the Grand Duke Constantine of Russia Duke of Edinburgh and Victor Emmanuel each made him their guest he dined with the King of Denmark and the King of Greece and Queen Victoria received him at the Osborne House Two years later he visited the navy yard on the Pacific Coast which he had established years before He died Aug fourteen eighteen seventy at the age of sixty nine universally honored and regretted Congress appropriated twenty thousand dollars for his statue on Farragut Square Washington and the work has been executed by Vinnie Ream Hoxie Success was not an accident with the Christian admiral It was the result of devotion to duty real bravery and a life distinguished by purity of character and the highest sense of honor EZRA CORNELL In the winter of eighteen nineteen might have been seen travelling from New Jersey to De Ruyter in New York a distance of two hundred and fifty miles some covered emigrant wagons containing a wife and six children in the first and household goods and farming utensils in the others Sometimes the occupants slept in a farmhouse but usually in their vehicles by a camp fire in the woods For two weeks they journeyed sometimes through an almost uninhabited wilderness and over wellnigh impassable roads The mother with a baby in her arms her oldest child Ezra a boy of twelve must have been worn with this toilsome journey but patient and cheerful no word of repining escaped her lips Elijah Cornell a frank noble hearted Quaker was going West to make his living as a potter and farmer combined Like other pioneers they made ready their little home among the sterile hills and there for twenty years they struggled to rear a family that grew to eleven children instead of six The boys of the family were taught the simple mysteries of pottery making early in life and thus formed habits of industry while their limited income necessarily made them economical Illustration EZRA CORNELL From his Biography by Gov A B Cornell The eldest boy Ezra now sixteen was growing anxious to be something more than a potter He was nearly six feet tall thin muscular and full of energy He was studious reading every book within his reach and desirous of an education which there was no money to procure Determined if possible to go to the common school one more winter he and his brother fifteen years of age chopped and cleared four acres of heavy beech and maple woodland plowed and planted it to corn and thus made themselves able to finish their education Soon after the father engaged a carpenter to build a large pottery Ezra assisted and began to think he should like the trade of a carpenter When the structure was completed taking his younger brother to the forest they cut timber and erected for their father s family a two story dwelling the best in the town Without any supervision Ezra had made the frame so that every part fitted in its exact place This for a boy of seventeen became the wonder of the neighborhood Master builders prophesied a rare carpenter for posterity It was evident that the quiet town of De Ruyter could not satisfy such a lad and at eighteen he started away from his affectionate mother to try the world She could trust him because he used neither liquor nor tobacco was truthful honest and willing to work hard If a young man desires to get his living easily or is very particular as to the kind of work he undertakes his future success may well be doubted Ezra found no carpentering as he had hoped but in the vicinity of Syracuse then a small village he engaged himself for two years to get out timber for shipment to New York by canal The following year he worked in a shop making wool carding machinery and being now only twenty miles from De Ruyter he walked home every Saturday evening and back Monday morning Twenty miles before a day s work would have been too long for most boys There was no danger that Ezra would grow tender either of foot or hand through luxury Hearing that there was a good outlook for business at Ithaca he walked forty miles thither with a spare suit of clothes and a few dollars in his pocket Who would have said then that this unknown lad with no capital save courage and ambition would make the name of Ithaca joined with that of Cornell known round the world He obtained work as a carpenter and was soon offered the position of keeping a cotton mill in repair This he gladly accepted using what knowledge he had gained in the machine shop A year later Colonel Beebe proprietor of a flouring and plaster mill asked young Cornell to repair his works and so pleased was he with the mechanic that he kept him for twelve years making him his confidential agent and general manager When a tunnel was needed to bring water from Fall Creek Cornell was made engineer in chief of the enterprise when labor saving machinery was required the head of the enterprising young man invented it Meantime he had married at the age of twenty four an intelligent girl Mary Ann Wood four years his junior the second in a family of eleven children As the young lady was not a Quaker Cornell was formally excommunicated from his church for taking a person outside the fold He was offered forgiveness and re instatement if he would apologize and show proper regret which he refused to do feeling that the church had no right to decide upon the religious convictions of the person he loved He soon purchased a few acres of land near the mill and erected a simple home for his bride Here they lived for twenty years and here their nine children were born four of whom died early It was happiness to go daily to his work receive his comfortable salary and see his children grow up around him with their needed wants supplied But the comfortable salary came to an end Colonel Beebe withdrew from active business the mill was turned into a woollen factory and Cornell was thrown out of work Business depression was great all over the country In vain for months he sought for employment The helpless family must be supported at the age of thirty six matters began to look serious Finally he went to Maine in the endeavor to sell the patent right of a new plow recently invented He visited the Maine Farmer and met the editor honorable F O J Smith a member of Congress who became much interested He tried also to sell the patent in the State of Georgia walking usually forty miles a day but with little success Again he started for Maine walking from Ithaca to Albany one hundred and sixty miles in four days then going by rail to Boston and once more on foot to Portland He was fond of walking and used to say Nature can in no way be so rationally enjoyed as through the opportunities afforded the pedestrian Entering the office of the Maine Farmer again he found mister Smith on his knees in the middle of his office floor with a piece of chalk in his hand the mould board of a plow lying by his side and with various chalk marks on the floor before him mister Smith arose and grasped him cordially by the hand saying Cornell you are the very man I want to see I have been trying to explain to neighbor Robertson a machine that I want made but I cannot make him understand it I want a kind of scraper or machine for digging a ditch for laying our telegraph pipe under ground Congress has appropriated thirty thousand dollars to enable Professor Morse to test the practicability of his telegraph on a line between Washington and Baltimore I have taken the contract to lay the pipe at one hundred dollars a mile mister Cornell s ready brain soon saw what kind of a machine was needed and he sketched a rough diagram of it Without much hope of success Smith said You make a machine and I will pay the expense whether successful or not if successful I will pay you fifty dollars or one hundred or any price you may name mister Cornell at once went to a machine shop made the patterns for the necessary castings and then the wood work for the frame The trial of the new machine was made at mister Smith s homestead four yoke of oxen being attached to the strange looking plow which cut a furrow two and one half feet deep and one and one fourth inches wide and laid the pipe in the bottom at the same time It worked successfully and mister Cornell was asked to take charge of the laying of the pipe between Baltimore and Washington He accepted for he believed the telegraph would become a vast instrument in civilization The loss of a position at the Beebe mill proved the opening to a broader world his energy had found a field as wide as the universe It was decided to put the first pipe between the double tracks of the Baltimore and Ohio railroad With an eight mule team horses being afraid of the engines nearly a mile of pipe was laid each day Soon Professor Morse came hurriedly and calling mister Cornell aside said Can you not contrive to stop this work for a few days in some manner so the papers will not know that it has been purposely interrupted I want to make some experiments before any more pipe is laid Cornell had been expecting this for he knew that the pipes were defective though other officials would not permit Morse to be told of it Replying that he would do as requested he stepped back to his plow and said Hurrah boys whip up your mules we must lay another length of pipe before we quit to night Then he purposely let the machine catch against a point of rock making it a perfect wreck mister Cornell began now at Professor Morse s request to experiment in the basement of the Patent Office at Washington studying what books he could obtain on electrical science It was soon found to be wise to put the wires upon poles as Cooke and Wheatstone had done in England The line between Baltimore and Washington proved successful despite its crudities but what should be done with it Government did not wish to buy it and private capital was afraid to touch it How could the world be made interested mister Cornell who had now put his heart into the telegraph built a line from Milk Street Boston to School Street that the people might see for themselves this new agent which was to enable nations to talk with each other but nobody cared to waste a moment in looking at it They were more interested in selling a piece of cloth or discovering the merits of a dead philosopher Not delighted with the indifference of Boston he moved his apparatus to New York in eighteen forty four and constructed a line from opposite Trinity Church on Broadway to near the site of the present Metropolitan Hotel but New York was even more indifferent than Boston The Tribune Express and some other newspapers gave cordial notices of the new enterprise but the Herald said plainly that it was opposed to the telegraph because now it could beat its rivals by special couriers but if the telegraph came into use then all would have an equal opportunity to obtain news During the whole winter mister Cornell labored seemingly to no purpose to introduce what Morse had so grandly discovered A man of less will and less self reliance would have become discouraged He met the fate of all reformers or inventors Nobody wants a thing till it is a great success and then everybody wants it at the same moment Finally by the hardest struggle the Magnetic Telegraph Company was formed for erecting a line between New York Philadelphia Baltimore and Washington and mister Cornell for superintending it was to receive one thousand dollars per annum So earnest was he for the matter that he subscribed five hundred dollars to the stock of the company paying for it out of his meagre salary Such men willing to live on the merest pittance that a measure of great practical good may succeed such men deserve to win The next line was between New York and Albany and mister Cornell being the contractor received his first return for these years of labor six thousand dollars in profits The tide had turned and though afterward various obstacles had to be met and overcome the poor mechanic had started on the high road to fame and fortune He next organized the Erie and Michigan Telegraph Company supposing that the Western cities thus benefited would subscribe to the stock but even in Chicago which now pays three thousand dollars daily for telegraphic service it was impossible to raise a dollar A year later the New York and Erie telegraph line was constructed through the southern part of New York State mister Cornell believing most heartily in the project obligated himself heavily and the result proved his far sightedness But now ruinous competition set in Those who had been unwilling to help at first were anxious to share profits To save all from bankruptcy in the cutting of rates mister Cornell and a few others consolidated the various interests in the Western Union Telegraph Company now grown so large that it has nearly five hundred thousand miles of wire employs twenty thousand persons sends over forty one million messages yearly and makes over seven and one half million dollars profits For more than fifteen years he was the largest stockholder in the company it was not strange therefore that middle life found Ezra Cornell a millionnaire This was better than making pottery in the little town of De Ruyter It had taken work however to make this fortune While others sauntered and enjoyed life at leisure he was working early and late away from his family most of the time for twelve years In eighteen fifty seven when fifty years of age he purchased three hundred acres near Ithaca planted orchards bought fine cattle and horses and moved his family thither He was made president of the County Agricultural Society and in eighteen sixty two was chosen to represent the State Agricultural Society at the International Exposition in London Taking his wife with him they travelled in Great Britain and on the Continent enjoying a few months of recreation for the first time since when a youth thirty years before he had walked into Ithaca During the war he gave money and sympathy freely being often at the front in hospitals and on battle fields caring for the wounded and their families and aiding those whom the war had left maimed or impoverished For six years he served acceptably in the State Legislature Self reliant calm unselfish simple in dress and manner he was alike the companion of distinguished scholars and the advocate of the people The great question now before his mind was how to spend his fortune most wisely He recalled the days when he cleared four acres of timber land that he might have three months of schooling He had regretted all his life his lack of a college education He determined therefore to build an institution where any person can find instruction in any study Preparatory to this he built Cornell Library costing sixty one thousand dollars A workman losing one of his horses by accident in the construction of the edifice was called upon by the philanthropist who after inquiring the value of the animal drew a check and handed it to the man remarking with a kind smile I presume I can better than you afford to lose the horse A man with money enough to build libraries does not always remember a laborer mister Cornell s first gift toward his university was two hundred acres of his cherished farm and five hundred thousand dollars in money The institution was formally opened in eighteen sixty eight honorable Andrew D White a distinguished graduate of Yale and of the University of Berlin being chosen president Soon over four hundred students gathered from over twenty seven States mister Cornell s gifts afterward including his saving the Land Grant Fund from depreciation amounted to over three million dollars A wonderful present from a self made mechanic Other men have followed his illustrious example Henry W Sage has given three hundred thousand dollars for the building of Sage College for women and the extensive conservatories of the Botanical Department Hiram Sibley of Rochester has given fifty thousand dollars for the College of Mechanic Arts and John McGraw one hundred thousand for the library and museum Cornell University is now one of the most liberally endowed institutions in the country and has already sent out over one thousand graduates mister Cornell did everything to enrich and develop his own town He brought manufactories of glass and iron into her midst held the presidency of the First National Bank for a dozen years made her as far as possible a railroad centre and gave generously to her churches of whatever denomination The first question asked in any project was Have you seen Ezra Cornell He will take hold of the work and if he is for you no one will be against you and success is assured if success be possible Dec nine eighteen seventy four at the age of sixty seven scarcely able to stand he arose from his bed and was dressed that he might attend to some unfinished business Shortly after noon it was finished by an unseen hand His body was carried to Library Hall and there the Cornell Cadets standing as guard of honor thousands looked upon the renowned giver The day of the funeral public and private buildings were draped shops were closed and the streets filled by a saddened throng The casket was borne into the cemetery between lines of students who owed to his generosity their royal opportunities for scholarship Various societies in various cities passed resolutions of respect and honor for the dead Froude the English historian well said of him There is something I admire even more than the university and that is the quiet unpretending man by whom the university was founded We have had such men in old times and there are men in England who make great fortunes and who make claim to great munificence but who manifest their greatness in buying great estates and building castles for the founding of peerages to be handed down from father to son mister Cornell has sought for immortality and the perpetuity of his name among the people of a free nation There stands his great university built upon a rock built of stone as solid as a rock to endure while the American nation endures When the herald s parchment shall have crumbled into dust and the antiquarians are searching among the tombstones for the records of these departed families mister Cornell s name will be still fresh and green through generation after generation Overlooking Ithaca and Cayuga Lake stands his home a beautiful Gothic villa in stone finished a year after his death His motto the motto of his life is carved over the principal entrance TRUE AND FIRM Illustration P H Sheridan From Appleton s Annual Cyclopedia LIEUTENANT GENERAL SHERIDAN It is sometimes said that circumstances make the man but there must be something in the man or circumstances however favorable cannot develop it A poor lad born of Irish parents in the little western town of Somerset Ohio working at twenty four dollars a year would never have come to the lieutenant generalship of the United States unless there was something noteworthy in the lad himself Philip Henry Sheridan a generous active boy after having studied arithmetic geography and spelling at the village school began to work in a country store in eighteen forty three at the early age of twelve earning fifty cents a week fortunately still keeping his home with his mother He was fond of books especially of military history and biography and when he read of battles he had dreams of one day being a great soldier Probably the keeper of the store where Philip worked and his boyish companions thought these dreams useless air castles After some months quickness and attention to business won a better position for him where he obtained one dollar and a half a week So useful had he become that at seventeen he acted as bookkeeper and manager of quite a business for the munificent wages of three dollars a week He had not forgotten his soldier ambition and applied to the member of Congress from his county Perry for appointment to West Point honorable Thomas

fifty three he was made second lieutenant in the United States Infantry and assigned to Fort Duncan on the western boundary of Texas which at that time seemed wellnigh out of the world Here he came much in contact with the Apache and Comanche Indians warlike and independent tribes One day as Sheridan was outside the fort with two other men a band of Indians swooped down upon them The chief jumped from his horse to seize his prisoners when Sheridan instantly sprang upon the animal s back and galloped to Fort Duncan Hastily summoning his troops he rushed back to save his two friends The enraged chief sprang toward him when a ball from Sheridan s rifle laid him dead upon the ground His ready thought had saved his own life and that of his friends Two years later he was made first lieutenant and sent to Oregon as escort to an expedition surveying for a branch of the Pacific Railway The region was wild and almost unknown yet beautiful and full of interest This life must have seemed inspiring compared with the quiet of the Somerset store Chosen very soon to take charge of an Indian campaign his fearlessness his quick decision and cautiousness as well made him a valuable leader The Indians could endure hardships so could Sheridan Sometimes he carried his food for two weeks in his blanket slung over his shoulder and made the ground his bed at night The Indians could scale rocks and mountains so could the young officer A severe encounter took place at the Cascades on the Columbia River April twenty eight eighteen fifty six where by getting in the rear of the Indians he completely vanquished them For this strategy he was especially commended by Lieutenant General Scott However he won the confidence of the Indian tribes for probity and honesty in his dealings with them When the Civil War began he was eager to help the cause of the Union and in eighteen sixty one was made captain and chief quartermaster in south western Missouri on the staff of Major General Curtis He was quiet and unassuming accurate in business matters and thoroughly courteous Perhaps now that he had learned more of army life by nine and a half years of service he was less sanguine of high renown than in his boyish days for he told a friend that he was the sixty fourth captain on the list and with the chances of war thought he might soon be major It required executive ability to provide for the subsistence of a great army but Sheridan organized his depots of supplies and transportation trains with economy and wisdom for the brave men who fought under Sigel With a high sense of honor Sheridan objected to the taking of any private property from the enemy for self aggrandizement as was the case with some officers and asked to be relieved from his present position Fortunately he was appointed on the staff of General Halleck in Tennessee a man who soon learned the faithfulness and ability of his captain and when the Governor of Michigan asked for a good colonel for the Second Michigan Cavalry Sheridan was chosen After sharing in several engagements around Corinth he was attacked July one eighteen sixty two at Booneville by a force of nine regiments numbering nearly five thousand men He had but two regiments What could he do Selecting ninety of his best men armed with guns and sabres he sent them four miles around a curve to attack the enemy s rear and promised to attack at the same time in front When the moment came he rushed upon the foe as though he had an immense army at his back while the handful of men in the rear charged with drawn sabres The Confederates were thrown into confusion and panic stricken rushed from the field leaving guns knapsacks and coats behind them Sheridan chased them for twenty miles This deed of valor won the admiration of General Grant who commended him to the War Department for promotion He was at once made brigadier general Perhaps the boyish dreams of being a great soldier would not turn out to be air castles after all Men love to fight under a man who knows what to do in an emergency and Sheridan s men who called him Little Phil had the greatest faith in him In the fall he was needed to defend Louisville against General Bragg This Confederate officer had been told that he would find recruits and supplies in abundance if he would come to Kentucky He came therefore bringing arms for twenty thousand men but was greatly disappointed to find that not half that number were willing to cast in their lot with the Secessionists General Buell of the Union army received on the contrary over twenty thousand new soldiers here Bragg prepared to leave the State sending his provision train ahead and made a stand at Perryville Kentucky Here Sheridan played a distinguished part holding the key of the Union position and resisting the onsets of the enemy again and again with great bravery and skill driving them at last from the open ground in front by a bayonet charge The loss in Sheridan s division in killed and wounded was over four hundred but his generalship had saved the army from defeat Bragg determined now to make one great effort to hold Tennessee and Dec thirty one eighteen sixty two gave battle at Stone River near Murfreesboro General Rosecrans had succeeded Buell as commander of the Army of the Cumberland Being a Romanist high mass was celebrated in his tent just before the battle the officers booted and spurred standing outside with heads uncovered The conflict began on the right wing the enemy advancing six lines deep Our troops were mowed down as by a scythe Sheridan sustained four attacks of the enemy and four times repulsed them swinging his hat or his sword as he rode among his men and changing his front under fire till his ammunition exhausted he brought out his shattered forces in close column with colors flying Pointing sadly to them he said to Rosecrans Here is all that are left General My loss is seventeen hundred and ninety six my three brigade commanders killed and sixty nine other officers in all seventy two officers killed and wounded The men said proudly We came out of the battle with compact ranks and empty cartridge boxes Even after this Sheridan recaptured two pieces of artillery and routed the same men who had driven him For noble conduct on the field he was made major general of volunteers General Rosecrans says of him in his official report At Stone River he won universal admiration Upon being flanked and compelled to retire he withdrew his command more than a mile under a terrible fire in remarkable order at the same time inflicting the severest punishment upon the foe The constancy and steadfastness of his troops on the thirty first of December enabled the reserve to reach the right of our army in time to turn the tide of battle and changed a threatened rout into a victory General Rosecrans showed himself dauntless in courage When a shell took off the head of his faithful staff officer Garesche riding by his side to whom he was most tenderly attached he only said I am very sorry we cannot help it This battle must be won Dashing up to a regiment lying on the ground waiting to be called into action he said while shot and shell were whizzing furiously around him Men do you wish to know how to be safe Shoot low But do you wish to know how to be safest of all Give them a blizzard and then charge with cold steel Forward men and show what you are made of After the day s bloody battle the troops lay all night on the cold ground where they had fought When says the heroic General Rousseau I saw them parch corn over a few little coals into which they were permitted to blow a spark of life when they carved steak from the loins of a horse which had been killed in battle and ate not simply without murmuring but made merry over their distress tears involuntarily rolled from my eyes At midnight it rained upon the soldiers and the fields became masses of mud yet before daylight they stood at their guns On the third day says Rosecrans the firing was terrific and the havoc terrible The enemy retreated more rapidly than they had advanced In forty minutes they lost two thousand men All that night the Federals worked to entrench the front of the army Saturday hundreds of wounded lay in the mud and rain as the enemy had destroyed so many of our hospital tents On Sunday morning it was found that the Confederates had departed leaving twenty five hundred of their wounded in Murfreesboro for us to take care of Burial parties were now sent out to inter the dead The Union loss in killed and wounded was eight thousand seven hundred and seventy eight the enemy s loss ten thousand one hundred and twenty five Sheridan s next heavy fighting was at Chickamauga The battle was begun by Bragg on Sept nineteen eighteen sixty three The right of our army had been broken to pieces but General Thomas the idol of his men stood on the left like a rock Sheridan assisting and refused to be driven from the field General Henry M Cist in his Army of the Cumberland says There is nothing finer in history than Thomas at Chickamauga Sheridan lost over one third of his four thousand men and ninety six officers The Federal loss was over sixteen thousand the Confederate over twenty thousand There were heroic deeds on this as on every battle field When a division of the Reserve Corps brave men they were too wavered under the storm of lead General James B Steedman rode up and taking the flag from the color bearer cried out Go back boys go back but the Flag can t go with you and dashed into the fight The men rallied closed their column and fought bravely to the death Even the drummer boy Johnny Clem from Newark Ohio ten years old near the close of the battle when one of Longstreet s colonels rode up and with an oath commanded him to surrender sent a bullet through the officer s heart Rosecrans made him a sergeant and the daughter of Secretary Chase gave him a silver medal Two months later the battle of Chattanooga redeemed the defeat of Chickamauga Near the town rises Lookout Mountain abrupt rocky cliffs twenty four hundred feet above the level of the sea and Missionary Ridge both of which were held by the enemy On Nov twenty four Lookout was stormed and carried by General Hooker in the Battle above the Clouds On the following day Missionary Ridge was to be assaulted Sheridan held the extreme left for General Thomas Before him was a wood then an open plain several hundred yards to the enemy s rifle pits and then beyond five hundred yards covered with rocks and fallen timber to the crest where were Bragg s heaviest breastworks At three o clock in the afternoon the signal to advance six guns fired at intervals of two seconds was given As Sheridan shouted Remember Chickamauga the men dashed over the plain at double quick their glittering bayonets ready for deadly work Says Benjamin F Taylor who was an eye witness Never halting never faltering they charged up to the first rifle pits with a cheer forked out the rebels with their bayonets and lay there panting for breath If the thunder of guns had been terrible it was now growing sublime It was rifles and musketry it was grape and canister it was shell and shrapnel Mission Ridge was volcanic a thousand torrents of red poured over its brink and rushed together to its base They dash out a little way and then slacken they creep up hand over hand loading and firing and wavering and halting from the first line of works to the second they burst into a charge with a cheer and go over it Sheets of flame baptize them plunging shot tear away comrades on left and right it is no longer shoulder to shoulder it is God for us all Under tree trunks among rocks stumbling over the dead struggling with the living facing the steady fire of eight thousand infantry they wrestle with the Ridge Things are growing desperate up aloft the rebels tumble rocks upon the rising line they light the fusees and roll shells down the steep they load the guns with handfuls of cartridges in their haste and as if there were powder in the word they shout Chickamauga down upon the mounters But it would not all do and just as the sun weary of the scene was sinking out of sight with magnificent bursts all along the line the advance surged over the crest and in a minute those flags fluttered along the fringe where fifty rebel guns were kennelled Men flung themselves exhausted upon the ground They laughed and wept shook hands embraced turned round and did all four over again It was as wild as a carnival Grant had given the order for taking the first line of rifle pits only but the men first one regiment and then another swept up the hill determined to be the first to plant the colors there When I saw those flags go up said Sheridan afterward I knew we should carry the ridge and I took the responsibility Sheridan s horse was shot under him after which he led the assault on foot Over twelve hundred men made Missionary Ridge sacred to liberty by their blood All seemed heroes on that day One poor fellow with his shoulder shattered lay beside a rock Two comrades halted to bear him to the rear when he said Don t stop for me I m of no account for GOD S sake push right up with the boys and on they went to help scale the mountain When the men were seen going up the hill Grant asked by whose orders that was done It is all right if it turns out all right he said but if not some one will suffer But it turned out all right and Grant knew thereafter how fully he could trust Sheridan The following spring Sheridan was placed by Grant in command of the cavalry of the Army of the Potomac numbering nearly twelve thousand men Here he was to add to his fame in the great battles of the Shenandoah Valley From May to August Sheridan lost over five thousand men in killed and wounded in smaller battles as he protected Grant s flank while he moved his forces to the James River or in cutting off Lee s supplies Meantime General Early had been spreading terror by his attempt to take Washington thus hoping also to withdraw Grant s attention from Lee at Richmond The time had come for decisive action Grant s orders were Put yourself south of the enemy and follow him to the death I feel every confidence that you will do the best and will leave you as far as possible to act on your own judgment and not embarrass you with orders and instructions About the middle of September Grant visited Sheridan with a plan of battle for him in his pocket but he said afterward I saw that there were but two words of instruction necessary Go in The result was such that I have never since deemed it necessary to visit General Sheridan before giving him orders The battle of Opequan was fought Sept nineteen eighteen sixty four Early being completely routed and losing about four thousand men five pieces of artillery and nine army flags with an equal loss of men by the Federals The fight was a bitter one from morning till evening a regiment like the One Hundred and Fourteenth New York going into the battle with one hundred and eighty men and coming out with forty their dead piled one above another Sheridan at first stood a little to the rear so that he might calmly direct the battle but at last swinging his sword and exclaiming I can t stand this he rode into the conflict The next day he telegraphed to Edwin M Stanton Secretary of War We have just sent them whirling through Winchester and we are after them to morrow This army behaved splendidly This battle quickened the hope and courage of the North who begun to see the end of the devastating war Whirling through Winchester was reported all over the land Abraham Lincoln telegraphed Have just heard of your great victory God bless you all officers and men Strongly inclined to come up and see you Grant ordered each of his two Richmond armies to fire a salute of one hundred guns The next day Sheridan passed on after Early and gave battle at Fisher s Hill the Confederates losing sixteen guns and eleven hundred prisoners besides killed and wounded Many of these belonged to Stonewall Jackson s corps and were the flower of the Southern army Keep on said Grant and your good work will cause the fall of Richmond Secretary Stanton ordered one hundred guns to be fired by various generals fifteen hundred guns in all for Fisher s Hill Early was now so thoroughly beaten that the Richmond mob wrote on the guns forwarded to him by the South the satirical sentence General Sheridan care of General Early Grant s orders were now to lay waste the valley so that Lee might have no base of supplies Over two thousand barns filled with grain over seventy mills besides bridges and railroads were burned and seven thousand cattle and sheep appropriated by the Union army Such destruction seemed pitiful but if the war was thereby shortened as it doubtless was then the saving of bloodshed was a blessing Oct fifteen Sheridan was summoned to Washington for consultation Early learning his absence and having been reinforced by twelve thousand troops decided at once to give battle at Cedar Creek His army marched at midnight canteens being left in camp lest they make a noise At daybreak Oct nineteen with the well known rebel yell the enemy rushed upon the sleeping camps of the Union army Nearly a thousand of our men were taken prisoners and eighteen guns A panic ensued and in utter confusion though there was some brave fighting our troops fell back to the rear Sheridan on his way from Washington had slept at Winchester that night twenty miles away At nine o clock he rode out of the town on his splendid black horse unconscious of danger to his army Soon the sound of battle was heard and not a mile away he met the fugitives He at once ordered some troops to stop the stragglers and rushed on to the front as swiftly as his foaming steed could carry him swinging his hat and shouting Face the other way boys face the other way If I had been here boys this never should have happened Meeting a colonel who said The army is whipped he replied You are but the army isn t Rude breastworks of stones rocks and trees were thrown up Then came desperate fighting and then the triumphant charge The first line was carried and then the second Sheridan leading a brigade in person Early s army was thoroughly routed The captured guns were all retaken besides twenty four pieces of artillery and sixteen hundred prisoners Early reported eighteen hundred killed and wounded Again the whole North rejoiced over this victory Sheridan was made a major general in the regular army for the personal gallantry military skill and just confidence in the courage and gallantry of your troops displayed by you on the nineteenth day of October at Cedar Run said Lincoln whereby under the blessing of Providence your routed army was reorganized a great national disaster averted and a brilliant victory achieved over the rebels for the third time in pitched battle within thirty days General Grant wrote from City Point Turning what bid fair to be a disaster into a glorious victory stamps Sheridan what I always thought him one of the ablest of generals Well wrote Thomas Buchanan Read in that immortal poem Sheridan s Ride Hurrah hurrah for Sheridan Hurrah hurrah for horse and man And when their statues are placed on high Under the dome of the Union sky The American soldier s Temple of Fame There with the glorious General s name Be it said in letters both bold and bright Here is the steed that saved the day By carrying Sheridan into the fight From Winchester twenty miles away The noble animal died in Chicago October eighteen seventy eight In eleven weeks says General Adam Badeau Sheridan had taken thirteen thousand prisoners forty nine battle flags and sixty guns besides recapturing eighteen cannon at Cedar Creek He must besides have killed and wounded at least nine thousand men so that he destroyed for the enemy twenty two thousand soldiers And now the only work remaining was to join Grant at Richmond in his capture of Lee He had passed the winter near Winchester and now having crossed the James River April one eighteen sixty five was attacked by General Pickett at Five Forks After a severe engagement about five thousand prisoners were taken by Sheridan with thirteen colors and six guns His magnetic influence over his men is shown by an incident narrated by General Badeau At the battle of Five Forks a soldier wounded under his eyes stumbled and was falling to the rear but Sheridan cried Never mind my man there s no harm done and the soldier went on with a bullet in his brain till he dropped dead on the field From here he pushed on to Appomattox Court House where he headed Lee s army and waited for Grant to come up Richmond had surrendered to Grant on the morning of April three On the seventh of April Grant wrote to Lee The result of the last week must convince you of the hopelessness of further resistance on the part of the Army of Northern Virginia in this struggle I feel that it is so and regard it as my duty to shift from myself the responsibility of any further effusion of blood by asking you to surrender that portion of the Confederate States Army known as the Army of Northern Virginia Lee replied Though not entertaining the opinion you express on the hopelessness of further resistance on the part of the Army of Northern Virginia I reciprocate your desire to avoid useless effusion of blood and therefore before considering your proposition ask the terms you will offer on condition of its surrender The reply was the only one that could be given The terms upon which peace can be had are well understood By the South laying down their arms they will hasten that most desirable event save thousands of human lives and hundreds of millions of property not yet destroyed At one o clock April nine eighteen sixty five the two able generals met and at four it was announced that the Army of Northern Virginia with over twenty eight thousand men had surrendered to the Army of the Potomac Memorable day that brought peace to a nation tired of the horrors of war In July Sheridan assumed command of the Military Division of the Gulf Ten years later June three eighteen seventy five when he was forty four years old he married Miss Irene Rucker the daughter of General D H Rucker for years his friend She is a fine linguist and a charming woman Their home in Chicago has many souvenirs of war times and tokens of appreciation from those who realize General Sheridan s great services to his country He was made Lieutenant General March four eighteen sixty nine and when General Sherman retired from the position of Commander in Chief of the Army Nov one eighteen eighty three Sheridan moved to Washington to take his place The office of Lieutenant General expires with General Sheridan he being the last of our three great and famous generals Grant Sherman and Sheridan In this latter city he has a home purchased by thirty one of his leading friends from Chicago He is devoted to his wife and children honest upright and manly and deserves the honors he has won General Sheridan was taken ill of heart disease about the middle of May eighteen eighty eight After three months he died at Nonquitt Mass near the ocean at twenty minutes past ten on the evening of August five eighteen eighty eight He left a wife and four children a girl of eight a boy of six and twin daughters of four After lying in state at Washington he was buried with military honors at Arlington Heights on Saturday August eleven in the midst of universal sorrow THOMAS COLE Four of my favorite pictures from childhood have been Cole s Voyage of Life I have studied the tiny infant in the boat surrounded by roses life s stream full of luxuriant vegetation the happy ambitious youth looking eagerly forward to the Temple of Fame steering the boat himself with no need of aid from his guardian angel then the worried and troubled man his boat tossing and whirling among the broken trees and frightful storms that come to all and lastly perhaps most beautiful the old man sailing peacefully into the ocean of eternity the angel having returned to guide him and the way to heaven being filled with celestial spirits I have always hung these pictures near my writing table and their lesson has been a helpful and inspiring one No wonder that Thorwaldsen the great sculptor said when he looked upon them in Rome O great artist what beauty of conception what an admirable arrangement of parts what an accurate study of nature what truth of detail He told Cole that his work was entirely new and original executed in a masterly manner and he commended the harmony of color These pictures are hung in thousands of homes but how few persons know the history of the artist Born in England Feb one eighteen oh one the only son in a family of eight children and the youngest but one we find him when a mere child in some print works learning to engrave simple designs for calico His father a woolen manufacturer had failed in business and the family were thrown upon themselves for support He was a kind and honest man always hoping to succeed but never succeeding always trying new scenes to build up his fortune and never building it Like other fathers especially those who have been disappointed in life he had hopes that his boy would accomplish more than himself He wished to apprentice him to an attorney or to an iron manufacturer but Thomas saw no pleasure in Blackstone or in handling ponderous iron A boy of tender feelings he found little companionship with his fellow operatives most of whom were rough and he enjoyed most an old Scotchman who could repeat ballads and tell of the beautiful hills and lakes of his native land When he had leisure he wandered with his sister Sarah into the surrounding country and while she sang he accompanied her with his flute With little opportunity for school he was a great reader and when through with designs for calico for the day he buried himself in books especially about foreign countries and in imagination clambered over high mountains and sailed upon broad rivers He talked much to the family of the wonders of the New World and when he was eighteen they all sailed for America The father rented a little house and shop in Philadelphia and began to sell the small stock of dry goods which he had brought with him while Thomas found work with a person who supplied woodcuts for printers The father soon became dissatisfied with his prospects and moved his family to Steubenville Ohio where he hoped to find a land flowing with milk and honey Thomas remained behind working on some illustrations for Bunyan s Holy War keeping up his spirits with his beloved flute going to Steubenville the next year walking almost the entire way from Philadelphia Here he worked in his father s small manufactory of paper hangings yet he had longings to do some great work in the world as he wandered alone in the wild and charming scenery He loved music architecture and pictures but he hardly dared breathe his aspirations save in a few verses of poetry How in that quiet home a boy should be born who had desires to win renown was a mystery Nobody knows whence the perilous but blessed gift of ambition comes About this time a portrait painter by the name of Stein came to the village He took an interest in the poetic boy and loaned him an English illustrated work on painting Thomas had already acquired some skill in drawing Now his heart was on fire as he read about Raphael Claude Lorraine and Titian and he resolved to make painting his life work How little he knew of the obstacles before a poor artist He set to work to make his own brushes obtaining his colors from a chair maker His easel and palette were of his own crude manufacture The father had serious misgivings for his son but his mother encouraged him to persevere in whatever his genius seemed to lie As a rule women discover genius sooner than men and good Mary Cole had seen that there was something uncommon in her boy His brushes ready putting his scanty wearing apparel and his flute in a green baize bag hung over his shoulder the youth of twenty one started for saint Clairsville thirty miles distant to begin life as a painter He broke through the ice in crossing a stream and wet to his breast arrived at the town only to find that a German had just been there and had painted all the portraits which were desired However a saddler was found who was willing to be painted and after five days of work from morning till night the young artist received a new saddle as pay A military officer gave him an old silver watch for a portrait and a dapper tradesman a chain and key which proved to be copper instead of gold For some other work he received a pair of shoes and a dollar All these except the dollar he was obliged to give to his landlord for board the man being dissatisfied even with this bargain From here Thomas walked one hundred miles to Zanesville and to his great sorrow found that the German had preceded him here also and painted the tavern keeper and his family The landlord intimated that a historical picture would be taken in payment for the young stranger s board Accordingly an impromptu studio was arranged A few patrons came at long intervals but it was soon evident that another field must be chosen What however was young Cole s astonishment to find that the historical painting would not be received for board and that if thirty five dollars were not at once paid he would be thrust into jail Two or three acquaintances became surety for the debt to the unprincipled landlord and the pale slender artist hastened toward Chillicothe with but a sixpence in his pocket After walking for three days seventy five miles he sat down under a tree by the roadside wellnigh discouraged in the hot August day but when the tears gathered in his eyes he took out his flute and playing a lively air his courage returned He had two letters of introduction in his pocket given him at Zanesville and these he would present whispering to himself that he must hold up his head like Michael Angelo as he offered them The men who received them had little time or wish to aid the young man A few persons sat for their portraits and a few took lessons in drawing but after a time he had no money to pay for washing his linen and at last no linen even to be washed Still enthusiastic over art and with visions of Italy floating in his mind yet penniless and footsore he returned to Steubenville to tell his sorrows to his sympathetic mother How her heart must have been moved as she looked upon her boy s pale face and great blue eyes and felt his eager desire for a place of honor in the world but knew alas that she was powerless to aid him He took a plain room for a studio painted some scenes for a society of amateur actors and commenced two pictures Ruth gleaning in the field of Boaz and the feast of Belshazzar One Sunday some vicious boys broke into the studio mixed the paints broke the brushes and cut the paintings in pieces Learning that the boys were poor Cole could not bear to prosecute them and the matter was dropped He soon departed to Pittsburgh whither his parents had moved and began to assist his father in making floor cloths Every moment of leisure he was down by the banks of the Monongahela carefully drawing tree or cloud or hill top Finally the old longing became irresistible He packed his little trunk his mother threw over his shoulders the table cover with her blessing and her tears and with six dollars in his purse he said good bye to the family and started for Philadelphia Then followed as he used to say in after years the winter of his discontent In a poor quarter of the city in an upper room without a bed or fire or furniture struggled poor Thomas Cole Timid friendless his only food a baker s roll and a pitcher of water his only bedding at night the table cover he worked day by day now copying in the Academy and now ornamenting bellows brushes or Japan ware with figures of birds or with flowers Sometimes he ran down a neighboring alley whipping his hands about him to keep his blood in circulation lest he be benumbed He soon became the victim of inflammatory rheumatism and was a great sufferer He still saw before him someway somehow renown Meantime his pure noble soul found solace in writing poetry and an occasional story for the Saturday Evening Post After a year and a half he put his goods on a wheelbarrow had them carried to the station and started for New York whither his family had moved He was now twenty four Life had been one continuous struggle Still he loved each beauty in nature and hoped for the good time to come In his father s garret in Greenwich Street in a room so narrow that he could scarcely work and so poorly lighted that he was perpetually fighting a kind of twilight he labored for two years Obstacles seemed but to increase his determination to persevere Of such grand material are heroes made His first five pictures were placed for exhibition in the shop of an acquaintance and were sold at eight dollars apiece Through the courtesy of a gentleman who purchased three of these he was enabled to go up the Hudson and sketch from nature among the Catskills This was indeed a great blessing On his return he painted A View of Fort Putnam Lake with dead trees and The Falls of the Caterskills These were purchased at twenty five dollars apiece by three artists Trumbull Dunlap and Durand Trumbull first discovered the merits of the pictures buying the Falls for his studio and invited Cole to meet Durand at his rooms At the hour appointed the sensitive artist made his appearance so timid that at first he could only reply to their cordial questioning by monosyllables Colonel Trumbull said You surprise me at your age to paint like this You have already done what I with all my years and experience am yet unable to do Through the new friends attention was called to his work and he soon had abundant commissions How his hungry heart must have fed on this appreciation From that time said his friend William Cullen Bryant he had a fixed reputation and was numbered among the men of whom our country had reason to be proud I well remember what an enthusiasm was awakened by these early works of his the delight which was expressed at the opportunity of contemplating pictures which carried the eye over scenes of wild grandeur peculiar to our country over our arid mountain tops with their mighty growth of forest never touched by the axe along the banks of streams never deformed by culture and into the depth of skies bright with the hues of our own climate such skies as few but Cole could ever paint and through the transparent abysses of which it seemed that you might send an arrow out of sight The struggles were not all over but the renown of which the calico designer had dreamed had actually come Down in the heart of Mary Cole there must have been deep thanksgiving that she had urged him on He with a few others now founded the National Academy of Design He took lodgings in the Catskills in the summer of eighteen twenty six and worked diligently He studied nature like a lover now he sketched a peculiar sunset now a wild storm now an exquisite waterfall Why do not the younger landscape painters walk walk alone and endlessly he used to say How I have walked day after day and all alone to see if there was not something among the old things which was new He knew every chasm every velvety bank every dainty flower growing in some tanglewood for miles around American scenery with its untamed wilderness lake and mountain was his chief passion He found no pleasure however in hunting or fishing for his kind heart could not bear to inflict the slightest injury The following spring he exhibited at the National Academy the Garden of Eden and the Expulsion rich in poetic conception and in the fall sketched in the White Mountains especially near North Conway which the lamented Starr King loved so well In the winter he was very happy finishing his Chocorua Peak A visitor said Your clouds sir appear to move That replied the artist is precisely the effect I desire He was now eager to visit Europe to study art but first he must see Niagara of which he made several sketches He had learned the secret that all poets and artists finally learn that they must identify themselves with some great event in history something grand in nature or some immortal name Milton chose a sublime subject Homer a great war just as some one will make our civil war a famous epic two centuries hence In June eighteen twenty nine he sailed for Europe and there for two years studied faithfully In London he saw much of Turner of whom he said I consider him as one of the greatest landscape painters that ever lived and his Temple of Jupiter as fine as anything the world has produced In landscapes my favorites are Claude Lorraine and Gaspar Poussin Some of Cole s work was exhibited at the British Gallery but the autumn coloring was generally condemned as false to nature How little we know about that which we have not seen Paris he enjoyed greatly for its clear skies and sunny weather essentials usually to those of poetic temperament though he was not over pleased with the Venuses and Psyches of modern French art For nine months he found the galleries of Florence a paradise to a painter He thought our skies more gorgeous than the Italian though theirs have a peculiar softness and beauty At Rome some of his friends said Cole works like a crazy man He usually rose at five o clock worked till noon taking an hour for eating and rest and then sketched again till night There was a reason for this The support of the family came upon him besides the payment of debts incurred by his father He felt that every hour was precious In Rome he found the Pantheon simple and grand the Apollo Belvidere the most perfect of human productions while the Venus de Medici has the excellence of feminine form destitute in a great measure of intellectual expression the Transfiguration beautiful in color and chiaroscuro and Michael Angelo s Moses one of the things never to be forgotten On his return to New York he took rooms at the corner of Wall Street and Broadway Here he won the friendship of Luman Reed for whom he promised to paint pictures for one room to cost five thousand dollars The chief pictures for mister Reed who died before their completion were five called The Course of Empire representing man in the different phases of savage life high civilization and ruin through sin the idea coming to him while in Rome Of this group Cooper the novelist said I consider the Course of Empire the work of the highest genius this country has ever produced and one of the noblest works of art that has ever been wrought In November eighteen thirty six mister Cole was married to Maria Bartow a young lady of refinement and loveliness of character Soon after both of his parents died The Departure and Return were now painted among his noblest works says Bryant followed by the Voyage of Life for mister Samuel Ward who like mister Reed died before the set was finished This series was sold in eighteen seventy six for three thousand one hundred dollars These pictures he had worked upon with great care and intensity He used to say Genius has but one wing and unless sustained on the other side by the well regulated wing of assiduity will quickly fall to the ground The artist must work always his eye and mind can work even when his pen is idle He must like a magician draw a circle round him and exclude all intrusive spirits And above all if he would attain that serene atmosphere of mind in which float the highest conceptions of the soul in which the sublimest works have been produced he must be possessed of a holy and reasonable faith The Voyage of Life was well received The engraver mister Smilie found one morning before the second of the series Youth a person in middle life looking as though in deep thought Sir he said at length I am a stranger in the city and in great trouble of mind But the sight of these pictures has done me great good I go away from this place quieted and much strengthened to do my duty In eighteen forty one worn in health Cole determined to visit Europe again He wrote from Kenilworth Castle to his wife Every flower and mass of ivy every picturesque effect waked my regret that you were not by my side How can I paint without you to praise or to criticize and little Theddy to come for papa to go to dinner and little Mary with her black eyes to come and kiss the figures in the pictures My life will be burdened with sadness until I return to my wife and family In Rome he received much attention as befitted one in his position On his return he painted several European scenes the Roman Campagna Angels Ministering to Christ in the Wilderness Mountain Ford sold in eighteen seventy six for nine hundred dollars The Good Shepherd Hunter s Return Mill at Sunset and many others For his Mount Etna painted in five days he received five hundred dollars How different these days from that pitiful winter in Philadelphia He dreaded interruptions in his work His saint John the Baptist in the Wilderness was destroyed by an unexpected visit from some ladies and gentlemen who quenched the fire of heart in which he was working He sorrowfully turned the canvas to the wall and never finished it He had now come to the zenith of his power yet he modestly said I have only learned how to paint He built a new studio in the Catskills in the Italian villa style and hoped to erect a gallery for several paintings he had in contemplation illustrating the cross and the world and the immortality of the soul But the overworked body at forty seven years of age could no longer bear the strain On Saturday Feb five eighteen forty eight he laid his colors under water and cleansed his palette as he left his studio The next day he was seized with inflammation of the lungs The following Friday after the communion service at his bedside he said I want to be quiet These were his last words The tired artist had finished his work The voyage of life was over He had won enduring fame OLE BULL In the quaint old town of Bergen Norway so strange with its narrow streets peculiar costumes and open hearted people that no traveller can ever forget it was born Feb five eighteen ten Ole Bull the oldest in a family of ten children His father was an able chemist and his mother a woman of fine manners and much intelligence All the relatives were musical and at the little gatherings for the purpose of cultivating this talent the child Ole would creep under table or sofa and listen enraptured for hours often receiving a whipping when discovered He loved music intensely fancying when he played alone in the meadows that he heard nature sing as the bluebells were moved among the grasses by the wind When he was four years old his uncle gave him a yellow violin which he kissed with great delight learning the notes at the same time as his primer Although forbidden to play till study hours were over he sometimes disobeyed and was punished both at home and at school Illustration Ole Bull From his Memoirs by SARA C BULL Finally at eight through the good sense of his mother a music teacher was provided and his father bought him a new red violin The child could not sleep for thinking of it so the first night after its purchase he stole into the room where it lay in his night clothes to take one peep at the precious thing He said years after with tears in his eyes at the painful remembrance The violin was so red and the pretty pearl screws did smile at me so I pinched the strings just a little with my fingers It smiled at me ever more and more I took up the bow and looked at it It said to me it would be pleasant to try it across the strings So I did try it just a very very little and it did sing to me so sweetly At first I did play very soft But presently I did begin a capriccio which I like very much and it do go ever louder and louder and I forgot that it was midnight and that everybody was asleep Presently I hear something crack and the next minute I feel my father s whip across my shoulders My little red violin dropped on the floor and was broken I weep much for it but it did no good They did have a doctor to it next day but it never recovered its health Pitiful it is that sometimes parents are so lacking in judgment as to stifle the best things in a child s nature Guiding is wise forcing usually ends in disaster In two years Ole could play pieces which his teacher found it impossible to perform He began to compose melodies imitating nature in the song of birds brooks and the roar of waterfalls and would hide in caves or in clumps of bushes where he could play his own weird improvisations When he could not make his violin do as he wished he would fling it away impetuously and not touch it again for a long time Then he would perhaps get up in the middle of the night and play at his open window forgetting that anybody might be awakened by it Sometimes he played incessantly for days scarcely eating or sleeping He had no pleasure in fishing or shooting on account of the pain inflicted a feeling seemingly common to noble and refined natures though he greatly enjoyed anything athletic At fourteen having heard of Paganini he went to his grandparent of whom he was very fond and said Dear grandmother can t I have some of Paganini s music Don t tell any one was the reply but I will try to buy a piece of his for you if you are a good child Shortly after this an old miser of whom the Bergen boys were afraid called Ole into his house one day as he was passing and said Are you the boy that plays the fiddle Yes sir Then come with me I have a fiddle I bought in England that I want to show you The fiddle needed a bridge and sounding post and these the boy gladly whittled out and then played for the old man his favorite air God save the King He was treated to cakes and milk and promised to come again The next afternoon what was his surprise to receive four pairs of doves with a blue ribbon around the neck of one and a card attached bearing the name of Ole Bull This present was more precious than the diamonds he received in later years from the hands of royalty Ole s father with a practical turn of mind urged his being a clergyman as he honored that profession and well knew that music and art usually furnish a small bank account A private tutor Musaeus by name was therefore engaged This man had the unique habit of kneeling down to pray before he whipped a boy and asking that the punishment might redound to the good of the lad He soon made up his mind that Ole s violin and theology were incompatible and forbade his playing it Ole and his brothers bore his harsh methods as long as possible when one morning at half past four as the teacher was dragging the youngest boy out of bed Ole sprang upon him and gave him a vigorous beating The smaller boys put their heads out from under the bed clothes and cried out Don t give up Ole Don t give up Give it to him with all your might The whole household soon appeared upon the scene and though little was said the private feeling seemed to be that a salutary lesson had been imparted At eighteen Ole was sent to the University of Christiana his father beseeching him that he would not yield to his passion for music On his arrival some Bergen students asked him to play for a charitable association But said Ole my father has forbidden me to play Would your father prevent your doing an act of charity Well this alters the case a little and I can write to him and claim his pardon After this he played nearly all night at the home of one of the professors saying to himself that his father would be pleased if the Faculty liked him and the next morning failed in his Latin examinations In despair he stated the case to the professor who replied My good fellow this is the very best thing that could have happened to you Do you believe yourself fitted for a curacy in Finmark or a mission among the Laps Certainly not It is the opinion of your friends that you should travel abroad Meanwhile old Thrane having been taken ill you are appointed ad interim Musical Director of the Philharmonic and Dramatic Societies A month later by the death of Thrane he came into this position having gained the pardon of his disappointed father But he was restless at Christiana He desired to know whether he really had genius or not and determined to go to Cassell to see Louis Spohr who was considered a master The great man was not sufficiently great to be interested in an unknown lad and coolly said when Ole remarked politely I have come more than five hundred miles to hear you Very well you can now go to Nordhausen I am to attend a musical festival there Ole went to the festival and was so disappointed because the methods and interpretation were different from his own that he resolved to go back to classic studies feeling that he had no genius for music Still he was not satisfied He would go to Paris and hear Berlioz and other great men Giving three concerts at Trondhjeim and Bergen by which he made five hundred dollars he found himself in possession of the needed funds When he arrived in this great city everybody was eagerly looking out for himself Some were in pursuit of pleasure but most as is the case everywhere were in pursuit of bread and shelter Nobody cared to hear his violin Nobody cared about his recommendations from far off Norway In vain he tried to make engagements He had no one to speak for him and the applicants were numberless Madam Malibran was singing nightly to crowded houses and the poor violinist would now and then purchase one of the topmost seats and listen to that marvellous voice His money was gradually melting away Finally an elderly gentleman who boarded at the same house having begged him to take what little money he possessed out of the bank as it was not a safe place stole every cent together with Ole s clothes and left him entirely destitute An acquaintance now told him of a boarding place where there were several music teachers and gave security for his board for one month twelve dollars Soon the friend and the boarding mistress grew cold and suspicious Nothing tries friendship like asking the loan of money At last his condition becoming known to a person whom he afterward learned was Vidocq the noted Chief of Police he was shown by him to a gaming table where he made one hundred and sixty dollars What a hideous joy I felt he said afterward what a horrid pleasure to hold in the hand one s own soul saved by the spoil of others He could not gamble again though starvation actually stared him in the face Cholera was sweeping through the city and had taken two persons from the house where he lodged He was again penniless and wellnigh despairing But he would not go back to Christiana The river Seine looked inviting and he thought death would be a relief He was nervous and his brain throbbed Finally he saw a placard in a window Furnished rooms to let He was exhausted but would make one more effort An elderly lady answered his query by saying that they had no vacant rooms when her pretty granddaughter Alexandrine Felicie called out Look at him grandmamma Putting on her glasses the tears filled her eyes as she saw a striking resemblance to her son who had died The next day found him at Madam Villeminot s house very ill of brain fever When he regained consciousness she assured him that he need not worry about the means for payment When however the Musical Lyceum of Christiana learned of his struggles they sent him eight hundred dollars Becoming acquainted about this time with Monsieur Lacour a dealer in violins who thought he had discovered that a certain kind of varnish would increase sweetness of tone Ole Bull was requested to play on one of his instruments at a soiree given by a Duke of the Italian Legation An elegant company were present The intense heat soon brought out the odor of assafoetida in the varnish The young man became embarrassed and then excited and played as though beside himself The player was advertised whether Monsieur Lacour s instruments were or not for Marshal Ney s son the Duke of Montebello at once invited him to breakfast and presided over a concert for him whereby the violinist made three hundred dollars The tide had turned at last and little Felicie Villeminot had done it with her Look at him grandmamma As the Grand Opera was still closed to him he made a concert tour through Switzerland and Italy In Milan one of the musical journals said He is not master of himself he has no style he is an untrained musician If he be a diamond he is certainly in the rough and unpolished Ole Bull went at once to the publisher and asked who had written the article If you want the responsible person said the editor I am he No said the artist I have not come to call the writer to account but to thank him The man who wrote that article understands music but it is not enough to tell me my faults he must tell me how to rid myself of them You have the spirit of the true artist replied the journalist The same evening he took Ole Bull to the critic a man over seventy from whom he learned much that was valuable He at once gave six months to study under able masters before again appearing in public He was however an earnest student all through life never being satisfied with his attainments At Venice he was highly praised but at Bologna he won the celebrity which continued through life Malibran was to sing in two concerts but feigned illness when she learned that the man she loved De Beriot was to receive a smaller sum than herself and would not appear The manager of the theatre was in despair Meantime in a poor hotel in an upper room Ole Bull was composing his concerto in the daytime and playing on his violin at night by his open window Rossini s first wife heard the music and said It must be a violin but a divine one That will be a substitute for De Beriot and Malibran I must go and tell Zampieri the manager On the night of the concert after Ole Bull had been two hours in bed from weariness Zampieri appeared and asked him to improvise He was delighted and exclaiming Malibran may now have her headaches hurried the young artist off to the theatre The audience was of course cold and disappointed till Ole Bull began to play Then the people seemed to hold their breath When the curtain fell he almost swooned with exhaustion but the house shook with applause Flowers were showered upon him He was immediately engaged for the next concert a large theatre was offered him free of expense one man buying one hundred tickets and the admiring throng drew his carriage to the hotel while a procession with torchlights acted as guard of honor Ole Bull had stepped into the glory of fame in a single night Henceforth while there was to be much of trial and disappointment as come to all he was to be forever the idol of two continents drawing crowded houses honored by the great and universally mourned at his death He had come to fame as by accident but he had made himself worthy of fame Malibran at first seemed hurt at his wonderful success in her stead but she soon became one of his warmest friends saying It is your own fault that I did not treat you as you deserved A man like you should step forth with head erect in the full light of day that we may recognize his noble blood From here he played with great success at Florence and Rome at the latter city composing his celebrated Polacca Guerriera in a single night writing till four o clock in the morning It was first conceived while he stood alone at Naples at midnight watching Mount Vesuvius aflame Returning to Paris he found the Grand Opera open to him Here at his first performance his a string snapped he turned deathly pale but he transposed the remainder of the piece and finished it on three strings Meyerbeer who was present could not believe it possible that the string had really broken He was now twenty six famous and above want What more fitting than that he should marry pretty Felicie Villeminot and share with her the precious life she had saved They were married in the summer of eighteen thirty six and their love was a beautiful and enduring one until her death twenty six years afterward Though absent from her much of the time necessarily his letters breathe a pure and ardent affection Going to England soon after and being at the house of the Duke of Devonshire at Chatsworth he writes How long does the time seem that deprives me of seeing you I embrace you very tenderly The word home has above all others the greatest charm for me In London from three to seven thousand persons crowded to hear him The Times said His command of the instrument from the top to the bottom of the scale and he has a scale of his own of three complete octaves on each string is absolutely perfect At Liverpool he received four thousand dollars for a single night taking the place of Malibran who had brought on a hemorrhage resulting in death by forcing a tone and holding it so long that the audience were astonished Ole Bull came near sharing her fate In playing Polacca the hall being large and the orchestra too strong he ruptured a blood vessel and his coat had to be cut from him In sixteen months he gave two hundred and seventy four concerts in the United Kingdom Afterwards at saint Petersburg he played to five thousand persons the Emperor sending him an autograph letter of affection and the Empress an emerald ring set with one hundred and forty diamonds Shortly after this his father died speaking with pride of Ole and thinking he heard divine music On his return to Norway at the request of the King he gave five concerts at Stockholm the last netting him five thousand dollars So moved was the King when Ole Bull played before him at the palace that he rose and stood till the Polacca was finished He presented the artist with the Order of Vasa set in brilliants In Christiana the students gave him a public dinner and crowned him with laurel He often played for the peasants here and in Bergen and was beloved by the poor as by the rich At Copenhagen he was presented at Court the King giving him a snuff box set in diamonds Hans Andersen became his devoted friend as did Thorwaldsen while he was in Rome He now went to Cassell and Spohr hastened to show him every attention as though to make amends for the coldness when Ole Bull was poor and unknown At Salzburg he invited the wife of Mozart to his concerts For her husband he had surpassing admiration He used to say that no mortal could write Mozart s Requiem and live While in Hungary his first child Ole died He wrote his wife God knows how much I have suffered I still hope and work not for myself for you my family my country my Norway of which I am proud All this time he was working very hard He said I must correspond with the directors of the theatres must obtain information regarding the people with whom I am to deal I must make my appointments for concerts and rehearsals have my music copied correct the scores compose play travel nights I am always cheated and in everlasting trouble I reproach myself when everything does not turn out for the best and am consumed with grief I really believe I should succumb to all these demands and fatigues if it were not for my drinking cold water and bathing in it every morning and evening In November eighteen forty three urged by Fanny Elssler he visited America At first in New York some of the prominent violinists opposed him but he steadily made his way When mister James Gordon Bennett offered him the columns of the Herald that he might reply to those who were assailing him he said in his broken English I tink mister Bennett it is best tey writes against me and I plays against tem Of his playing in New York missus Lydia Maria Child wrote His bow touched the strings as if in sport and brought forth light leaps of sound with electric rapidity yet clear in their distinctness He played on four strings at once and produced the rich harmony of four instruments While he was playing the rustling of a leaf might have been heard and when he closed the tremendous bursts of applause told how the hearts of thousands leaped like one His first audience were beside themselves with delight and the orchestra threw down their instruments in ecstatic wonder From New York he took a successful trip South That he was not effeminate while deeply poetic a single incident will show After a concert a man came to him and said he wished the diamond in his violin bow given him by the Duke of Devonshire Ole Bull replied that as it was a gift he could neither sell it nor give it away But I am going to have that stone said the man as he drew a bowie knife from his coat In an instant Ole Bull had felled the man to the floor with the edge of his hand across his throat The next time I would kill you said the musician with his foot on the man s chest but you may go now So much did the ruffian admire the muscle and skill of the artist that he begged him to accept the knife which he had intended to use upon him During this visit to America he gave two hundred concerts netting him said the New York Herald fully eighty thousand dollars besides twenty thousand given to charitable associations and fifteen thousand paid to assistant artists No artist has ever visited our country and received so many honors Poems by the hundreds have been written to him gold vases pencils medals have been presented to him by various corporations His whole remarkable appearance in this country is really unexampled in glory and fame said the same newspaper Ole Bull was kindness itself to the sick or afflicted Now he played for Alice and Phoebe Carey when unable to leave their home and now for insane and blind asylums and at hospitals He loved America and called himself her adopted son On his return to Norway after great success in Spain the Queen bestowing upon him the order of Charles III and the Portuguese order of Christus he determined to build a National Theatre in Bergen his birthplace for the advancement of his nation in the drama and in music By great energy and the bestowal of a large sum of money the place was opened in eighteen fifty Ole Bull leading the orchestra But the Storthing or Parliament declined to give it a yearly appropriation perhaps the development of home talent tended too strongly toward republicanism The burden was too great for one man to carry and the project did not prove a success The next plan of the philanthropist musician was to buy one hundred and twenty five thousand acres of land on the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania and found a New Norway consecrated to liberty baptized with independence and protected by the Union s mighty flag Soon three hundred houses were built a country inn store and church erected by the founder To pay the thousands needed for this enterprise he worked constantly at concert giving taking scarcely time to eat his meals He laid out five new villages made arrangements with the government to cast cannon for her fortresses and took out patents for a new smelting furnace While in California where he was ill with yellow fever a crushing blow fell upon him He learned that he had purchased the land through a swindling company his title was invalid and his fortune was lost He could only buy enough land to protect those who had already come from Norway and had settled there and soon became deeply involved in lawsuits honorable E W Stoughton of New York who had never met Ole Bull personally volunteered to assist him and a few thousands were wrested from the defrauding agent On his return to Norway he was accused of speculating with the funds of his countrymen which cut him to the heart A little later in eighteen sixty two his wife died worn with ill health and with her husband s misfortunes and his son Thorvald fell from the mast of a sailing vessel in the Mediterranean and was killed In the autumn of eighteen sixty eight he returned to America and nearly lost his life in a steamboat collision on the Ohio He swam to land saving also his precious violin Two years afterward he was married to Miss Thorp of Madison Wis an accomplished lady much his junior in years who has lived to write an admirable life of her illustrious husband A daughter Olea came to gladden his home two years later When he was sixty six years old he celebrated his birthday by playing his violin on the top of the great pyramid Cheops at the suggestion of King Oscar of Norway and Sweden In the Centennial year he returned to America and made his home at Cambridge in the house of James Russell Lowell while he was Minister to England Here he enjoyed the friendship of such as Longfellow who says of him in his Tales of a Wayside Inn The angel with the violin Painted by Raphael he seemed And when he played the atmosphere Was filled with magic and the ear Caught echoes of that Harp of Gold Whose music had so weird a sound The hunted stag forgot to bound The leaping rivulet backward rolled The birds came down from bush and tree The dead came from beneath the sea The maiden to the harper s knee The friend of the highest he never forgot the lowest When a colored barber in Hartford a lad who was himself a good fiddler heard Ole Bull play the latter having sent him a ticket to his concert he said Mister can t you come down to the shop to morrow to get shaved and show me those tricks I feel powerful bad And Ole Bull went to the shop and showed him how the wonderful playing was accomplished In eighteen eighty Ole Bull sailed for the last time to Europe to his lovely home at Lyso an island in the sea eighteen miles from Bergen Ill on the voyage he was thankful to reach the cherished place Here planned by his own hand was his elegant home overlooking the ocean here his choice music room upheld by delicate columns and curiously wrought arches here the shell roads he had built and here the flower beds he had planted The end came soon on a beautiful day full of sunshine The body lay in state in the great music room till a larger steamer came to bear it to Bergen This was met by a convoy of sixteen steamers ranged on either side and as the fleet approached the city all flags were at half mast and guns were fired which re echoed through the mountains The quay was covered with juniper and the whole front festooned with green As the boat touched the shore one of Ole Bull s inimitable melodies was played Young girls dressed in black bore the trophies of his success and distinguished men carried his gold crown and order in the procession The streets were strewn with flowers and showered upon the coffin When the service had been read at the grave by the pastor Bjornson the famous author gave an address After the coffin had been lowered and the mourners had departed hundreds of peasants came bringing a green bough a sprig of fern or a flower and quite filled the grave Beautiful tribute to a beautiful life Illustration MEISSONIER MEISSONIER The old maxim that the gods reward all things to labor has had fit illustration in Meissonier His has been a life of constant unvaried toil He came to Paris a poor unknown boy and has worked over fifty years till he stands a master in French art Jean Louis Ernest Meissonier was born at Lyons in eighteen eleven His early life was passed in poverty so grinding that the great artist never speaks of it and in such obscurity that scarcely anything is known of his boyhood At nineteen he came to Paris to try his fate in one of the great centres of the world He of course found no open doors nobody standing ready to assist genius Genius must ever open doors for itself The lad was a close observer and had learned to draw accurately He could give every variety of costume and express almost any emotion in the face of his subject But he was unknown He might do good work but nobody wanted it He used to paint by the side of Daubigny in the Louvre it is said for one dollar a yard Now his Amateurs in Painting a chef d oeuvre of six inches in size is bought by Leon Say for six thousand dollars Such is fame Time was so necessary in this struggle for bread that he could sleep only every other night and for six months his finances were so low it is stated that he existed on ten cents a week No wonder that the sorrows of those days are never mentioned His earliest work was painting the tops of bon bon boxes and fans Once he grew brave enough to take four little sepia drawings to an editor to illustrate a fairy tale in a magazine for children The editor said the drawings were charming but he could not afford to have them engraved and so returned them with thanks His first illustrations in some unknown journal were scenes from the life of The Old Bachelor In the first picture he is represented making his toilet before the mirror his wig spread out on the table in the second dining with two friends in the third being abused by his housekeeper in the fourth on his death bed surrounded by greedy relations and in the fifth the servants ransacking the death chamber for the property For a universal history he drew figures of Isaiah saint Paul and Charlemagne besides almost numberless ornamental letters and headings of chapters Of course he longed for more remunerative work for fame but he must plod on for months yet He worked conscientiously taking the greatest pains with every detail His first picture exhibited in eighteen thirty three when he was twenty two called The Visitors an interior view of a house with an old gentleman receiving two visitors all dressed in the costume of James I admirable for its light and shade was bought by the Society of the Friends of Art for twenty dollars Two years later he made illustrations for the Bible of the Sieur Raymond of Holofernes invading Judea and Judith appearing before Holofernes For Paul and Virginia he made forty three beautiful landscapes They contain evidence of long and careful work in the hot houses of the Jardin des Plantes and in front of the old bric a brac dealer s stalls which used to stand about the entrance to the Louvre And how admirably with the help of these slowly and scrupulously finished studies he could reproduce in an ornamental letter or floral ornament a lily broken by the storm or a sheaf of Indian arms and musical instruments In eighteen thirty six his Chess Players two men watching intently the moves of chess and The Little Messenger attracted a crowd of admirers Each sold for twenty dollars He had now struggled for six years in Paris It was high time that his unremitting and patient work should find approval The people were amazed at so vast an amount of labor in so small a space They looked with their magnifying glasses and found the work exquisite in detail They had been accustomed to great canvases glowing colors and heroic or romantic sentiments but here there was wonderful workmanship When the people began to admire critics began to criticize They said Meissonier can depict homelike or ordinary scenes but not historic He said nothing but soon brought out Diderot among the philosophers Grimm D Alembert Baron Holbach and others in the seventeenth century Then they said he can draw interiors only and on a canvas not much larger than his thumb nail He soon produced the Portrait of the Sergeant one of the most daring experiments in the painting of light in modern art The man stands out there in the open by himself literally bathed in light and he makes a perfect picture Then they were sure that he could not paint movement He replied by painting Rixe two ruffians who are striving to fight but are withheld by friends This was given by Louis Napoleon to the Prince Consort Meissonier also showed that he could depict grand scenes by Moreau and Dessoles on the eve of the battle of Hohenlinden the Retreat from Russia and the Emperor at Solferino Into these he put his admiration for Napoleon the Great and his adoration for his defeated country In the former picture the two generals are standing on a precipice surveying the snow covered battle field with a glass the trees are bending under a strong wind and the cloaks of the generals are fluttering behind them One feels the power of this picture In painting the Retreat from Russia the artist borrowed the identical coat worn by Napoleon and had it copied crease for crease and button for button When I painted that picture he said I executed a great portion of it out of doors It was midwinter and the ground was covered with snow Sometimes I sat at my easel for five or six hours together endeavoring to seize the exact aspect of the winter atmosphere My servant placed a hot foot stove under my feet which he renewed from time to time but I used to get half frozen and terribly tired He had a wooden horse made in imitation of the white charger of the Emperor and seating himself on this he studied his own figure in a mirror His studies for this picture were almost numberless a horse s head an uplifted leg cuirasses helmets models of horses in red wax et cetera He also prepared a miniature landscape strewn with white powder resembling snow with models of heavy wheels running through it that he might study the furrow made in that terrible march home from burning Moscow All this was work hard patient exacting work It had now become evident to the world and to the critics as well that Meissonier was a master that he was not confined to small canvases nor home scenes In eighteen fifty five he received the grand medal in eighteen fifty six he was made an officer of the Legion of Honor in eighteen sixty one a member of the Institute and in eighteen sixty seven at the International Exhibition he received the grand medal again When the prizes were given by the Emperor the Battle of Solferino was placed in the centre of the space cleared for the ceremony with the works of Reimers the Russian painter Knaus of Prussia Rousseau the French landscape painter and others This painting represents Napoleon III in front of his staff looking upon the battle as a cool player studies a chess board On the right in the foreground some artillery men are manoeuvring their guns The corpses of a French soldier and two white Austrians torn to rags by some explosion show where the battle had passed by Meissonier s paintings now brought enormous prices His Marshal Saxe and his Staff brought eight thousand six hundred dollars in New York the Soldiers at Cards in eighteen seventy six in the same city eleven thousand five hundred dollars in eighteen sixty seven his Cavalry Charge was sold to mister Probasco of Cincinnati for thirty thousand dollars and the Battle of Friedland upon which he is said to have worked fifteen years to A T Stewart of New York for sixty thousand dollars Every figure in this was drawn from life and the horses moulded in wax It represents Napoleon on horseback on a slight elevation his marshals grouped around him holding aloft his cocked hat in salutation as the soldiers pass hurriedly before him Edmund About once wrote To cover M Meissonier s pictures with gold pieces simply would be to buy them for nothing and the practice has now been established of covering them with bank notes The Blacksmith shoeing a patient old cart horse perfect in anatomy La Halte some soldiers at an inn now in Hertford House gallery and La Barricade a souvenir of the civil war are among the favorite pictures of this famous man And yet as one looks at some of the exquisite work about a convivial scene the words of the great Boston painter William Hunt come to mind Being shown a picture very fine in technique by a Munich artist of a drunken man holding a half filled glass of wine he said It s skilfully done but what is the use of doing it The subject isn t worthy of the painter Rarely does a woman appear in Meissonier s pictures He has done nothing to deprave morals which is more than can be said of some French art His portrait of Madame Henri Thenard was greatly admired while that of missus Mackay was not satisfactory and was said to have been destroyed by her Few persons however can afford to destroy a Meissonier When told once that he was a fortunate man as he could possess as many Meissoniers as he pleased he replied No no I cannot that would ruin me They are a great deal too dear He lives in the Boulevard Malesherbes near the lovely Parc Monceau in the heart of the artists quarter in Paris His handsome home designed by himself in every detail is in the Italian Renaissance style He has two studies one a quiet nook where he can escape interruptions and one very large where are gathered masterpieces from every part of the world Here is a courtyard of the time of Louis XIII brilliantly crowded with figures in gala dress a bride of the same period stepping into an elegant carriage of a crimson color for which Meissonier had a miniature model built by a coach maker to study from a superb work of Titian a figure of an Italian woman in a robe of green velvet the classic outline of her head shown against a crimson velvet curtain in the background a sketch of Bonaparte on horseback at the head of his picturesquely dressed staff reviewing the young conscripts of the army of Italy who are cheering as he passes and many more valuable pictures Here too are bridles of black leather with silver ornaments once the property of Murat One picture here of especial interest was painted at his summer home at Poissy when his house was crowded with German soldiers in the war of eighteen seventy one To escape their company says M Claretie in the rage that he experienced at the national defeat he shut himself up in his studio and threw upon the canvas the most striking the most vivid the most avenging of allegories he painted Paris enveloped in a veil of mourning defending herself against the enemy with her soldiers and her dying grouped round a tattered flag sailors officers and fusiliers soldiers national guards suffering women and dying children and hovering in the air above them with the Prussian eagle by her side was Famine wan and haggard Famine accomplishing the work that the bombardment had failed to achieve His summer home like the one in Paris is fitted up luxuriously He designed most of the furniture and the silver service for his table Flowers especially geraniums and tea roses blossom in profusion about the grounds while great trees and fountains make it a restful and inviting place The walls of the dining room are hung with crimson and gold satin damask against which are several of his own pictures An engraver at work clad in a red dressing gown and seated in a room hung with ancient tapestry has the face of his son Charles also an artist looking out from the frame One of Madame Meissonier also adorns this room Near by are his well filled stables his favorite horse Rivoli being often used for his model He is equally fond of dogs and has several expensive hounds How strange all this compared with those early days of pinching poverty He is rarely seen in public because he has learned what alas some people learn too late in life that there is no success without one commands his or her time It must be frittered away neither by calls nor parties neither by idle talk nor useless visits Painting or writing for an hour a day never made greatness Art and literature will give no masterships except to devotees The young lady sauntering down town to look at ribbons never makes a George Eliot The young man sauntering down town to look at the buyers of ribbons never makes a Meissonier Nature is rigid in her laws Her gifts only grow to fruitage in the hands of workers Meissonier is now seventy four with long gray beard and hair round full face and bright hazel eyes His friend Claretie says of him This man who lives in a palace is as moderate as a soldier on the march This artist whose canvases are valued by the half million is as generous as a nabob He will give to a charity sale a picture worth the price of a house Praised as he is by all he has less conceit in his nature than a wholesale painter January thirty one eighteen ninety one at his home in Paris the great artist passed away His illness was very brief The funeral services took place at the Church of the Madeleine which was thronged with the leaders of art and letters An imposing military cortege accompanied the body to its last resting place at Poissy the summer home of the artist on the Seine ten miles from Versailles

six thousand persons inside and two thousand outside This was said to doctor Magoun President of Iowa College and myself after we had waited for nearly an hour outside of Spurgeon s Tabernacle in London in the hope of hearing mister Moody preach Finally probably through courtesy to Americans we obtained seats The six thousand in this great church were sitting as though spellbound The speaker was a man in middle life rugged strong and plain in dress and manner His words were so simple that a child could understand them Now tears came into the eyes of most of the audience as he told some touching incident and now faces grew sober as the people examined their own hearts under the searching words There was no consciousness about the preacher no wild gesture nor loud tone Only one expression seemed applicable a man dead in earnest And who was this man whom thousands came to hear Not a learned man not a rich man but one of the greatest evangelists the world has ever seen Circumstances were all against him but he conquered circumstances Dwight Lyman Moody was born at Northfield Mass Feb five eighteen thirty seven His father a stone mason and farmer died when the boy was four years old broken down with reverses in business His mother was left with seven sons and two daughters the eldest a boy only fifteen What happened to this lad was well told by mister Moody a few years since Soon after my father s death the creditors came in and took everything One calamity after another swept over the entire household Twins were added to the family and my mother was taken sick To the eldest boy my mother looked as a stay in her calamity but all at once that boy became a wanderer He had been reading some of the trashy novels and the belief had seized him that he had only to go away to make a fortune Away he went I can remember how eagerly she used to look for tidings of that boy how she used to send us to the post office to see if there was a letter from him and recollect how we used to come back with the sad news No letter I remember how in the evenings we used to sit beside her in that New England home and we would talk about our father but the moment the name of that boy was mentioned she would hush us into silence Some nights when the wind was very high and the house which was upon a hill would tremble at every gust the voice of my mother was raised in prayer for that wanderer who had treated her so unkindly I used to think she loved him better than all of us put together and I believe she did On a Thanksgiving day she used to set a chair for him thinking he would return home Her family grew up and her boys left home When I got so that I could write I sent letters all over the country but could find no trace of him One day while in Boston the news reached me that he had returned While in that city I remember how I used to look for him in every store he had a mark on his face but I never got any trace One day while my mother was sitting at the door a stranger was seen coming toward the house and when he came to the door he stopped My mother didn t know her boy He stood there with folded arms and great beard flowing down his breast his tears trickling down his face When my mother saw those tears she cried Oh it s my lost son and entreated him to come in But he stood still No mother he said I will not come in until I hear that you have forgiven me She rushed to the threshold threw her arms around him and breathed forgiveness Dwight grew to be a strong self willed lad working on the farm fond of fun rather than of study held in check only by his devotion to his mother She was urged to put the children into different homes on account of their extreme poverty but by tilling their garden and doing some work for their neighbors she managed to keep her little flock together A woman who could do this had remarkable energy and courage What little schooling Dwight received was not greatly enjoyed because the teacher was a quick tempered man who used a rattan on the boys backs Years after he told how a happy change was effected in that school After a while there was somebody who began to get up a movement in favor of controlling the school by love I remember how we thought of the good time we should have that winter when the rattan would be out of school We thought we would then have all the fun we wanted I remember who the teacher was a lady and she opened the school with prayer We hadn t seen it done before and we were impressed especially when she prayed that she might have grace and strength to rule the school with love The school went on several weeks and we saw no rattan but at last the rules were broken and I think I was the first boy to break them She told me to wait till after school and then she would see me I thought the rattan was coming out sure and stretched myself up in warlike attitude After school however she sat down by me and told me how she loved me and how she had prayed to be able to rule that school by love and concluded by saying I want to ask you one favor that is if you love me try and be a good boy and I never gave her trouble again He was very susceptible to kindness When an old man who had the habit of giving every new boy who came into the town a cent put his hand on Dwight s head and told him he had a Father in heaven he never forgot the pressure of that old man s hand Farming among Northfield rocks was not exciting work enough for the energetic boy so with his mother s consent he started for Boston when he was seventeen to look for work He had the same bitter experience that other homeless boys have He says I went to the post office two or three times a day to see if there was a letter for me I knew there was not as there was but one mail a day I had not any employment and was very homesick and so went constantly to the post office thinking perhaps when the mail did come in my letter had been mislaid At last however I got a letter It was from my youngest sister the first letter she ever wrote me I opened it with a light heart thinking there was some good news from home but the burden of the whole letter was that she had heard there were pickpockets in Boston and warned me to take care of them I thought I had better get some money in hand first and then I might take care of pickpockets The homesick boy finally applied to an uncle a shoe dealer who hesitated much about taking the country lad into his employ He agreed to do so on the conditions that the boy would heed his advice and attend regularly the Mount Vernon Church and Sunday school The preaching of doctor Kirk the pastor was scholarly and eloquent but quite above the lad s comprehension His Sunday school teacher mister Edward Kimball was a devoted man and withal had the tact to win a boy s confidence One day he came into the store where young Moody worked and going behind the counter placed his hand on the boy s shoulder and talked about his becoming a Christian Such interest touched Dwight s heart and he soon took a stand on the right side Years afterward Moody was the means of the conversion of the son of mister Kimball at seventeen just his own age at this time His earnest nature made him eager to do Christian work but so poor was his command of language and his sentences were so awkward that he was not accepted to the membership of the church for a year after he had made his application They thought him very unlikely ever to become a Christian of clear and decided views of gospel truth still less to fill any extended sphere of public usefulness Alas how the best of us sometimes have our eyes shut to the treasures lying at our feet He longed for a wider field of usefulness and in the fall of eighteen fifty six when he was nineteen started for Chicago taking with him testimonials which secured him a place as salesman in a shoe store He joined Plymouth Church and at once rented four pews for the young men whom he intended to bring in Here it is said some of the more cultured assured him that his silence would be more effective for good than his speech Certainly not encouraging to a young convert He offered his services to a mission school as a teacher He was welcome if he would bring his own scholars they said The next Sunday to their astonishment young Moody walked in at the head of eighteen ragged urchins whom he had gathered from the streets He distributed tracts among the seamen at the wharfs and did not fear to go into saloons and talk with the inmates Finally he wanted a larger field still and opened an old saloon which had been vacated as a Sunday school room It was in the neighborhood of two hundred saloons and gambling dens His heart was full of love for the poor and the outcasts and they did not mind about his grammar A friend came to see him in these dingy quarters and found him holding a colored child while he read by the dim light of some tallow candles the story of the Prodigal Son to his little congregation I have got only one talent said the unassuming Moody I have no education but I love the Lord Jesus Christ and I want to do something for him I want you to pray for me Thirteen years later when all Great Britain was aflame with the sermons of this same man he wrote his friend Pray for me every day pray now that the Lord will keep me humble Soon the Sunday school outgrew the shabby saloon and was moved to a hall where a thousand scholars gathered Still attending to business as a travelling salesman for six years he swept and made ready his Sunday school room He had great tact with his pupils and won them by kindness One day a boy came who was very unruly sticking pins into the backs of the other boys mister Moody patted him kindly on the head and asked him to come again After a short time he became a Christian and then was anxious about his mother whom mister Moody had been unable to influence One night the lad threw his arms about her neck and weeping told her how he had stopped swearing and how he wanted her to love the Saviour When she passed his room she heard him praying Oh God convert my dear mother The next Sunday he led her into the Sabbath school and she became an earnest worker He also has great tact with his young converts Every man can do something he says I had a Swede converted in Chicago I don t know how I don t suppose he was converted by my sermons because he couldn t understand much The Lord converted him into one of the happiest men you ever saw His face shone all over He came to me and he had to speak through an interpreter This interpreter said this Swede wanted to have me give him something to do I said to myself What in the world will I set this man to doing He can t talk English So I gave him a bundle of little handbills and put him out on the corner of the greatest thoroughfare of Chicago and let him give them out inviting people to come up and hear me preach A man would come along and take it and see Gospel meeting and would turn around and curse the fellow but the Swede would laugh because he didn t know but he was blessing him He couldn t tell the difference A great many men were impressed by that man s being so polite and kind There he stood and when winter came and the nights got so dark they could not read those little handbills he went and got a little transparency and put it up on the corner and there he took his stand hot or cold rain or shine Many a man was won to Christ by his efforts In eighteen sixty when Moody was twenty three he made up his mind to give all his time to Christian work He was led to this by the following incident He says In the Sunday school I had a pale delicate young man as one of the teachers I knew his burning piety and assigned him to the worst class in the school They were all girls and it was an awful class They kept gadding around in the schoolroom and were laughing and carrying on all the while One Sunday he was absent and I tried myself to teach the class but couldn t do anything with them they seemed farther off than ever from any concern about their souls Well the day after his absence early Monday morning the young man came into the store where I worked and tottering and bloodless threw himself down on some boxes What s the matter I asked I have been bleeding at the lungs and they have given me up to die he said But you are not afraid to die I questioned No said he I am not afraid to die but I have got to stand before God and give an account of my stewardship and not one of my Sabbath school scholars has been brought to Jesus I have failed to bring one and haven t any strength to do it now He was so weighed down that I got a carriage and took that dying man in it and we called at the homes of every one of his scholars and to each one he said as best his faint voice would let him I have come to just ask you to come to the Saviour and then he prayed as I never heard before And for ten days he labored in that way sometimes walking to the nearest houses And at the end of that ten days every one of that large class had yielded to the Saviour Full well I remember the night before he went away for the doctors said he must hurry to the South how we held a true love feast It was the very gate of heaven that meeting He prayed and they prayed he didn t ask them he didn t think they could pray and then we sung Blest be the tie that binds It was a beautiful night in June that he left on the Michigan Southern and I was down to the train to help him off And those girls every one gathered there again all unknown to each other and the depot seemed a second gate to heaven in the joyful yet tearful communion and farewells between these newly redeemed souls and him whose crown of rejoicing it will be that he led them to Jesus At last the gong sounded and supported on the platform the dying man shook hands with each one and whispered I will meet you yonder From this says mister Moody I got the first impulse to work solely for the conversion of men When he told his employer that he was going to give up business he was asked Where will you get your support God will provide for me if he wishes me to keep on and I shall keep on till I am obliged to stop was the reply To keep his expenses as low as possible he slept at night on a hard bench in the rooms of the Young Men s Christian Association and ate the plainest food Thus was the devoted work of this Christian hero begun He was soon made city missionary for a time Then the civil war began and a camp was established near Chicago He saw his wonderful opportunity now to reach men who were soon to be face to face with death The first tent erected was used as a place of prayer Ministers and friends came to his aid He labored day and night sometimes eight or ten prayer meetings being held at the same time in the various tents He did not desert these men on the field of battle He was with the army at Pittsburgh Landing Shiloh Murfreesboro and Chattanooga Nine times in the interests of the Christian Commission he visited our men at the front on his errands of mercy He tells this incident in a hospital at Murfreesboro One night after midnight I was woke up and told that there was a man in one of the wards who wanted to see me I went to him and he called me chaplain I wasn t a chaplain and he said he wanted me to help him die And I said I d take you right up in my arms and carry you into the kingdom of God if I could but I can t do it I can t help you to die And he said Who can I said The Lord Jesus Christ can He came for that purpose He shook his head and said He can t save me I have sinned all my life And I said But he came to save sinners I thought of his mother in the north and I knew that she was anxious that he should die right and I thought I d stay with him I prayed two or three times and repeated all the promises I could and I knew that in a few hours he would be gone I said I wanted to read him a conversation that Christ had with a man who was anxious about his soul I turned to the third chapter of John His eyes were riveted on me and when I came to the fourteenth and fifteenth verses he caught up the words As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the Son of man be lifted up that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life He stopped me and said Is that there I said Yes and he asked me to read it again and I did so He leaned his elbows on the cot and clasped his hands together and said That s good won t you read it again I read it the third time and then went on with the rest of the chapter When I finished his eyes were closed his hands were folded and there was a smile on his face Oh how it was lit up What a change had come over it I saw his lips quiver and I leaned over him and heard in a faint whisper As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness so must the Son of man be lifted up that whosoever believeth on him should not perish but have eternal life He opened his eyes and said That s enough don t read any more He lingered a few hours and then pillowed his head on those two verses and went up in one of Christ s chariots and took his seat in the kingdom of God On the twenty eighth of August eighteen sixty two mister Moody married Miss Emma C Revell a most helpful assistant in his meetings and a young lady of noble character A daughter and a son came to gladden their simple cottage and there was no happier home in all Chicago One morning he said to his wife I have no money and the house is without supplies It looks as if the Lord had had enough of me in this mission work and is going to send me back again to sell boots and shoes But very soon two checks came one of fifty dollars for himself and another for his school Six years after his marriage his friends gave him the lease of a pleasant furnished house This home had a welcome for all who sought the true way to live One day a gentleman called at the office bringing a young man who had recently come out of the penitentiary The latter shrunk from going into the office but mister Moody said Bring him in mister Moody took him by the hand told him he was glad to see him and invited him to his house When the young man called mister Moody introduced him as his friend When his little daughter came into the room he said Emma this is papa s friend She went up and kissed him and the man sobbed aloud When she left the room mister Moody said What is the matter Oh sir was the reply I have not had a kiss for years The last kiss I had was from my mother and she was dying I thought I would never have another kiss again No wonder people are saved from sin by visiting a home like this In eighteen sixty three those who had been converted under this beloved leader wanted a church of their own where they could worship together A building was erected costing twenty thousand dollars Four years later mister Moody was made President of the Young Men s Christian Association and Farwell Hall was speedily built He was loved and honored everywhere Once he was invited to the opening of a great billiard hall He saw the owners and asked if he might bring a friend They said yes but asked who he was mister Moody said it wasn t necessary to tell but he never went without him They understood his meaning and said Come we don t want any praying You ve given me an invitation and I am going to come he replied But if you come you needn t pray Well I ll tell you what we ll do was the answer we ll compromise the matter and if you don t want me to come and pray for you when you open let me pray for you both now to which they agreed mister Moody prayed that their business might go to pieces which it did in a very few months After the failure one of the partners determined to kill himself but when he was about to plunge the knife into his breast he seemed to hear again the words of his dying mother Johnny if you get into trouble pray That voice changed his purpose and his life He prayed for forgiveness and obtained it In eighteen seventy one the terrible fire in Chicago swept away Moody s home and church Two years later having been invited to Great Britain by two prominent Christian men he decided to take his friend mister Ira D Sankey who had already won a place in the hearts of the people by his singing and together they would attempt some work for their Lord They landed in Liverpool June seventeen The two friends who had invited them were dead The clergy did not know them and the world was wholly indifferent At their first meeting in York England only four persons were present but mister Moody said it was one of the best meetings they ever held They labored here for some weeks and about two hundred were converted From here they went to Sunderland and Newcastle the numbers and interest constantly increasing Union prayer meetings had been held in Edinburgh for two months in anticipation of their coming When they arrived two thousand persons crowded Music Hall and hundreds were necessarily turned away As a result of these efforts over three thousand persons united with the various churches In Dundee over ten thousand persons gathered in the open air and at Glasgow nearly thirty thousand mister Moody preaching from his carriage The press reported all these sermons and his congregations were thus increased a hundred fold all over the country The farmer boy of Northfield the awkward young convert of Mount Vernon Church Boston had become famous Scholarly ministers came to him to learn how to influence men toward religion Infidels were reclaimed and rich and poor alike found the Bible precious from his simple and beautiful teaching In Ireland the crowds sometimes covered six acres and inquiry meetings lasted for eight hours Four months were spent in London where it is believed over two and a half million persons attended the meetings mister Moody had been fearless in his work When a church member who was a distiller became troubled in conscience over his business he came and asked if the evangelist thought a man could not be an honest distiller mister Moody replied You should do whatever you do for the glory of God If you can get down and pray about a barrel of whiskey and say when you sell it O Lord God let this whiskey be blessed to the world it is probably honest On his return to America mister Moody was eagerly welcomed Philadelphia utilized an immense freight depot for the meetings putting in it ten thousand chairs and providing a choir of six hundred singers Over four thousand conversions resulted In New York the Hippodrome was prepared by an expenditure of ten thousand dollars and as many conversions were reported here Boston received him with open arms Ninety churches company operated in the house to house visitation in connection with the meetings and a choir of two thousand singers was provided mister Moody with his wonderful executive ability and genius in organizing was like a general at the head of his army Chicago received him home thankfully and proudly as was her right A church had been built for him during his absence costing one hundred thousand dollars For the past ten years his work has been a marvel to the world and doubtless to himself Great Britain has been a second time stirred to its centre by his presence His sermons have been scattered broadcast by the hundreds of thousands He receives no salary never allowing a contribution to be taken for himself but his wants have been supplied A pleasant home at his birthplace Northfield has been given him by his friends made doubly dear by the presence of his mother now over eighty years old He has established two schools here one for boys and another for girls with three hundred pupils trained in all that ennobles life The results from mister Moody s work are beyond computing In his first visit to London a noted man of wealth was converted He at once sold his hunting dogs and made his country house a centre of missionary effort During mister Moody s second visit the two sons at Cambridge University professed Christianity One goes to China having induced some other students to accompany him as missionaries the other just married to a lord s daughter has begun mission work among the slums in the East End of London The work of such a life as mister Moody s goes on forever His influence will be felt in almost countless homes after he has passed away from earth He has wrought without means and with no fortuitous circumstances He is a devoted student of the Bible rising at five o clock for study in some of his most laborious seasons He is a man consecrated to a single purpose that of winning souls mister Moody died at his home at East Northfield Mass at noon Friday December twenty two eighteen ninety nine He was taken ill during a series of meetings at Kansas City a few weeks previously and heart disease resulted from overwork He was conscious to the last He said to his two sons who were standing by his bedside I have always been an ambitious man not ambitious to lay up wealth but to leave you work to do and you re going to continue the work of the schools in East Northfield and Mount Hermon and of the Chicago Bible Institute Just as death came he awoke as if from sleep and said joyfully I have been within the gate earth is receding heaven is opening God is calling me do not call me back and a moment later expired He was buried Tuesday December twenty six at Round Top on the seminary grounds where thousands have gathered yearly at the summer meetings conducted by the great evangelist ABRAHAM LINCOLN In Gentryville Indiana in the year eighteen sixteen might have been seen a log cabin without doors or window glass a dirt floor a bed made of dried leaves and a stool or two and table formed of logs The inmates were Thomas Lincoln a good hearted man who could neither read nor write Nancy Hanks his wife a pale faced sensitive gentle woman strangely out of place in her miserable surroundings a girl of ten Sarah and a tall awkward boy of eight Abraham The family had but recently moved from a similar cabin in Hardin County Kentucky cutting their way through the wilderness with an ax and living off the game they could obtain with a gun missus Lincoln possessed but one book in the world the Bible and from this she taught her children daily Abraham had been to school for two or three months at such a school as the rude country afforded and had learned to read Of quick mind and retentive memory he soon came to know the Bible wellnigh by heart and to look upon his gentle teacher as the embodiment of all the good precepts in the book Afterward when he governed thirty million people he said All that I am or hope to be I owe to my angel mother Blessings on her memory Illustration ABRAHAM LINCOLN When he was ten years old the saintly mother faded like a flower amid these hardships of pioneer life died of consumption and was buried in a plain box under the trees near the cabin The blow for the girl who also died at fifteen was hard but for the boy the loss was irreparable Day after day he sat on the grave and wept A sad far away look crept into his eyes which those who saw him in the perils of his later life well remember Nine months after this Abraham wrote a letter to Parson Elkins a good minister whom they used to know in Kentucky asking him to come and preach a funeral sermon on his mother He came riding on horseback over one hundred miles and one bright Sabbath morning when the neighbors from the whole country around had gathered some in carts and some on horseback he spoke over the open grave of the precious Christian life of her who slept beneath She died early but not till she had laid well the foundation stones in one of the grandest characters in history The boy communing with himself longed to read and know something beyond the stumps between which he planted his corn He borrowed a copy of Bunyan s Pilgrim s Progress and read and re read it till he could repeat much of it Then some one loaned him AEsop s Fables and Robinson Crusoe and these he pored over with eager delight There surely was a great world beyond Kentucky and Indiana and perhaps he would some day see it After a time Thomas Lincoln married a widow an old friend of Nancy Hanks and she came to the cabin bringing her three children besides she brought what to Abraham and Sarah seemed unheard of elegance a bureau some chairs a table and bedding Abraham had heretofore climbed to the loft of the cabin on pegs and had slept on a sack filled with corn husks now a real bed would seem indeed luxurious The children were glad to welcome the new mother to the desolate home and a good true mother she became to the orphans She put new energy into her somewhat easy going husband and made the cabin comfortable even attractive What was better still she encouraged Abraham to read more and more to be thorough and to be somebody Besides she gave his great heart something to love and well she repaid the affection He now obtained a much worn copy of Weem s Life of Washington and the little cabin grew to be a paradise as he read how one great man had accomplished so much The barefoot boy in buckskin breeches so shrunken that they reached only half way between the knee and ankle actually asked himself whether there were not some great place in the world for him to fill No wonder when a few days after making a noise with some of his fun loving companions a good woman said to him Now Abe what on earth do you s pose ll ever become of ye What ll ye be good for if ye keep a goin on in this way He replied slowly Well I reckon I m goin to be President of the United States one of these days The treasured Life of Washington came to grief One stormy night the rain beat between the logs of the cabin and flooded the volume as it lay on a board upheld by two pegs Abraham sadly carried it back to its owner and worked three days at twenty five cents a day to pay damages and thus made the book his own The few months of schooling had already come to an end and he was living out hoeing planting and chopping wood for the farmers and giving the wages to his parents In this way in the daytime he studied human nature and in the evenings he read Plutarch s Lives and the Life of Benjamin Franklin He was liked in these humble homes for he could tend baby tell stories make a good impromptu speech recite poetry even making rhymes himself and could wrestle and jump as well as the best While drinking intoxicants was the fashion all about him taught by his first mother not to touch them he had solemnly carried out her wishes But his tender heart made him kind to the many who in this pioneer life had been ruined through drink One night as he was returning from a house raising he and two or three friends found a man in the ditch benumbed with the cold and his patient horse waiting beside him They lifted the man upon the animal and held him on till they reached the nearest house where Abraham cared for him through the night and thus saved his life At eighteen he had found a situation in a small store but he was not satisfied to stand behind a counter he had read too much about Washington and Franklin Fifteen miles from Gentryville courts were held at certain seasons of the year and when Abraham could find a spare day he walked over in the morning and back at night listening to the cases Meantime he had borrowed a strange book for a poor country lad The Revised Statutes of Indiana One day a man on trial for murder had secured the able lawyer John A Breckenridge to defend him Abraham listened as he made his appeal to the jury He had never heard anything so eloquent When the court adjourned the tall homely boy his face beaming with admiration for the great man pressed forward to grasp his hand but with a contemptuous air the lawyer passed on without speaking Thirty years later the two met in Washington when Abraham Lincoln was the President of the United States and then he thanked mister Breckenridge for his great speech in Indiana In March eighteen twenty eight the long hoped for opportunity to see the world outside of Gentryville had come Abraham was asked by a man who knew his honesty and willingness to work to take a flat boat down the Mississippi River to New Orleans He was paid only two dollars a week and his rations and as a flat boat could not come up the river but must be sold for lumber at the journey s end he was obliged to walk the whole distance back The big hearted broad shouldered youth six feet and four inches tall had seen in this trip what he would never forget had seen black men in chains and men and women sold like sheep in the slave marts of New Orleans Here began his horror of human slavery which years after culminated in the Emancipation Proclamation Two years later when he had become of age Abraham helped move his father s family to Illinois driving the four yoke of oxen which drew the household goods over the muddy roads and through the creeks Then he joined his adopted brothers in building a log house plowed fifteen acres of prairie land for corn split rails to fence it in and then went out into the world to earn for himself his scanty wages heretofore belonging legally to his father He did not always receive money for his work for once for a missus Miller he split four hundred rails for every yard of brown jeans dyed with white walnut bark necessary to make a pair of trowsers He had no trade and no money and must do whatever came to hand For a year he worked for one farmer and another and then he and his half brother were hired by a mister Offutt to build and take a flat boat to New Orleans So pleased was the owner that on Abraham s return he was at once engaged to manage a mill and store at New Salem Here he went by the name of Honest Abe because he was so fair in his dealings On one occasion having sold a woman a bill of goods amounting to two dollars and six and a quarter cents he found that in adding the items he had taken six and a quarter cents too much It was night and locking the store he walked two or three miles to return the money to his astonished customer Another time a woman bought a half pound of tea He discovered afterward that he had used a four ounce weight on the scales and at once walked a long way to deliver the four ounces which were her due No wonder the world like Diogenes is always looking for an honest man He insisted on politeness before women One day as he was showing goods a boorish man came in and began to use profanity Young Lincoln leaned over the desk and begged him to desist before ladies When they had gone the man became furious Finding that he really desired to fight Lincoln said Well if you must be whipped I suppose I may as well whip you as any other man and suiting the action to the word gave him a severe punishing The man became a better citizen from that day and Lincoln s life long friend Years afterward when in the Presidential chair a man used profanity in his presence he said I thought Senator C had sent me a gentleman I was mistaken There is the door and I wish you good night Hearing that a grammar could be purchased six miles away the young store keeper walked thither and obtained it When evening came as candles were too expensive for his limited wages he burnt one shaving after another to give light and thus studied the book which was to be so valuable in after years when he should stand before the great and cultured of the land He took the Louisville Journal because he must be abreast of the politics of the day and made careful notes from every book he read mister Offutt soon failed and Abraham Lincoln was again adrift War had begun with Blackhawk the chief of the Sacs and the Governor of Illinois was calling for volunteers A company was formed in New Salem and Honest Abe was chosen captain He won the love of his men for his thoughtfulness of them rather than himself and learned valuable lessons in military matters for the future A strange thing now happened he was asked to be a candidate for the State Legislature At first he thought his friends were ridiculing him and said he should be defeated as he was not widely known Never mind said James Rutledge the president of their little debating club They ll know you better after you ve stumped the county Any how it ll do you good to try Lincoln made some bright earnest stump speeches and though he was defeated the young man of twenty three received two hundred and seventy seven votes out of the two hundred and eighty cast in New Salem This surely was a pleasant indication of his popularity It was a common saying that Lincoln had nothing only plenty of friends The County surveyor needed an assistant He called upon Lincoln bringing a book for him to study if he would fit himself to take hold of the matter This he did gladly and for six weeks studied and recited to a teacher thus making himself skilled and accurate for a new country Whenever he had an hour s leisure from his work however he was poring over his law books for he had fully made up his mind to be a lawyer He was modest but ambitious and was learning the power within him But as though the developing brain and warm heart needed an extra stimulus there came into his life at this time a beautiful affection that left a deeper look in the far away eyes when it was over Ann Rutledge the daughter of his friend was one of the most intelligent and lovely girls in New Salem When Lincoln came to her father s house to board she was already engaged to a bright young man in the neighborhood who shortly before their intended marriage was obliged to visit New York on business He wrote back of his father s illness and death and then his letters ceased Mouths passed away Meantime the young lawyer had given her the homage of his strong nature At first she could not bring herself to forget her recreant lover but the following year won by Lincoln s devotion she accepted him He seemed now supremely happy He studied day and night eager to fill such a place that Ann Rutledge would be proud of him He had been elected to the Legislature and borrowing some money to purchase a suit of clothes he walked one hundred miles to the State capitol He did not talk much in the Assembly but he worked faithfully upon committees and studied the needs of his State The following summer days seemed to pass all too swiftly in his happiness Then the shadows gathered The girl he idolized was sinking under the dreadful strain upon her young heart The latter part of August she sent for Lincoln to come to her bedside What was said in that last farewell has never been known It is stated by some that her former lover had returned as fond of her as ever his silence having been caused by a long illness But on the twenty fifth of August death took her from them both Lincoln was overwhelmed with anguish insane feared and believed his friends He said I can never be reconciled to have the snow rains and storms beat upon her grave Years after he was heard to say My heart lies buried in the grave of that girl A poem by William Knox found and read at this time became a favorite and a comfort through life Oh why should the spirit of mortal be proud mister Herndon his law partner said The love and death of that girl shattered Lincoln s purposes and tendencies He threw off his infinite sorrow only by leaping wildly into the political arena The memory of that love never faded from his heart nor the sadness from his face The following year eighteen thirty seven when he was twenty eight he was admitted to the bar and moved from New Salem to the larger town of Springfield forming a partnership with mister J P Stuart of whom he had borrowed his law books Too poor even yet to pay much for board he slept on a narrow lounge in the law office He was again elected to the legislature and in the Harrison Presidential campaign was chosen one of the electors speaking through the State for the Whig party To so prominent a position already had come the backwoods boy Four years after Ann Rutledge s death he married Nov four eighteen thirty nine Mary Todd a bright witty somewhat handsome girl of good family from Kentucky She admired his ability and believed in his success he needed comfort in his utter loneliness Till his death he was a true husband and an idolizing father to his children Robert Willie and Tad Thomas In eighteen forty six seven years after his marriage having steadily gained in the reputation of an honest able lawyer who would never take a case unless sure he was on the right side mister Lincoln was elected to Congress by an uncommonly large majority Opposed to the war with Mexico and to the extension of slavery he spoke his mind fearlessly The Compromise measures of eighteen fifty by which while California was admitted as a free State and the slave trade was abolished in the District of Columbia the Fugitive Slave Law was passed giving the owners of slaves the right to recapture them in any free State had disheartened all lovers of freedom Lincoln said gloomily to his law partner mister Herndon How hard oh how hard it is to die and leave one s country no better than if one had never lived for it His father died about this time his noble son sending him this message to remember to call upon and confide in our great and good and merciful Maker who will not turn away from him in any extremity He notes the fall of the sparrow and numbers the hairs of our heads and He will not forget the dying man who puts his trust in Him In eighteen fifty four through the influence of Stephen A Douglas a brilliant senator from Illinois the Kansas Nebraska Act was passed whereby those States were left to judge for themselves whether they would have slaves or not But by the Missouri Compromise of eighteen twenty it was expressly stated that slavery should be forever prohibited in this locality The whole North grew to white heat When Douglas returned to his Chicago home the people refused to hear him speak Illinois said His arguments must be answered and Abraham Lincoln is the man to answer them At the State Fair at Springfield in October a great company were gathered Douglas spoke with marked ability and eloquence and then on the following day Abraham Lincoln spoke for three hours His heart was in his words He quivered with emotion The audience were still as death but when the address was finished men shouted and women waved their handkerchiefs Lincoln and the right had triumphed After this the two men spoke in all the large towns of the State to immense crowds The Kansas Nebraska Bill worked out its expected results Blood flowed in the streets as pro slavery and anti slavery men contested the ground newspaper offices were torn down by mobs and Douglas lost the great prize he had in view the Presidency of the United States When the new party the Republican held its second convention in Philadelphia June seventeen eighteen fifty six Abraham Lincoln received one hundred and ten votes for Vice President What would Nancy Hanks Lincoln have said if she could have looked now upon the boy to whom she taught the Bible in the log cabin An incident occurred about this time which increased his fame A man was murdered at a camp meeting and two young men were arrested One was a very poor youth whose mother Hannah Armstrong had been kind to Lincoln in the early years She wrote to the prominent lawyer about her troubles because she believed her son to be innocent The trial came on The people were clamorous for Armstrong to be hanged The principal witness testified that by the aid of the brightly shining moon he saw the prisoner inflict the death blow with a slung shot After careful questioning mister Lincoln showed the perjury of the witness by the almanac no moon being visible on the night in question The jury were melted to tears by the touching address and their sympathy went out to the wronged youth and his poor old mother who fainted in his arms Tears too poured down the face of mister Lincoln as the young man was acquitted Why Hannah he said when the grateful woman asked what she should try to pay him I shan t charge you a cent never She had been well repaid for her friendliness to a penniless boy The next year he was invited to deliver a lecture at Cooper Institute New York He was not very well known at the East He had lived unostentatiously in the two story frame house in Springfield and when seen at all by the people except in his addresses was usually drawing one of his babies in a wagon before his door with hat and coat off deeply buried in thought When the crowd gathered at Cooper Institute they expected to hear a fund of stories and a Western stump speech But they did not hear what they expected They heard a masterly review of the history of slavery in this country and a prophecy concerning the future of the slavery question They were amazed at its breadth and its eloquence The New York Tribune said No man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a New York audience After this mister Lincoln spoke in various cities to crowded houses A Yale professor took notes and gave a lecture to his students on the address Surprised at his success among learned men mister Lincoln once asked a prominent professor what made the speeches interest The reply was The clearness of your statements the unanswerable style of your reasoning and your illustrations which were romance and pathos and fun and logic all welded together mister Lincoln said I am very much obliged to you for this It throws light on a subject which has been dark to me Certainly I have had a wonderful success for a man of my limited education The sabbath he spent in New York he found his way to the Sunday school at Five Points He was alone The superintendent noticing his interest asked him to say a few words The children were so pleased that when he attempted to stop they cried Go on oh do go on No one knew his name and on being asked who he was he replied Abraham Lincoln of Illinois After visiting his son Robert at Harvard College he returned home When the Republican State Convention met May nine eighteen sixty at Springfield Ill mister Lincoln was invited to a seat on the platform and as no way could be made through the dense throng he was carried over the people s heads Ten days later at the National Convention at Chicago though William H Seward of New York was a leading candidate the West gained the nomination with their idolized Lincoln Springfield was wild with joy When the news of his success was carried to him he said quietly Well gentlemen there s a little woman at our house who is probably more interested in this dispatch than I am and if you will excuse me I will take it up and let her see it The resulting canvass was one of the most remarkable in our history The South said War will result if he is elected The North said The time has come for decisive action The popular vote for Abraham Lincoln was nearly two millions one million eight hundred fifty seven thousand six hundred ten while Stephen A Douglas received something over a million one million two hundred ninety one thousand five hundred seventy four The country was in a fever of excitement The South made itself ready for war by seizing the forts Before the inauguration most of the Southern States had seceded Sad farewells were uttered as mister Lincoln left Springfield for Washington To his law partner he said You and I have been together more than twenty years and have never passed a word Will you let my name stay on the old sign till I come back from Washington The tears came into mister Herndon s eyes as he said I will never have any other partner while you live and he kept his word Old Hannah Armstrong told him that she should never see him again that something told her so his enemies would assassinate him He smiled and said Hannah if they do kill me I shall never die another death He went away without fear but feeling the awful responsibility of his position He found an empty treasury and the country drifting into the blackness of war He spoke few words but the lines grew deeper on his face and his eyes grew sadder In his inaugural address he said In your hands my dissatisfied fellow countrymen and not in mine is the momentous issue of civil war The government will not assail you You can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors Physically speaking we cannot separate The conflict began April twelve eighteen sixty one by the enemy firing on Fort Sumter That sound reverberated throughout the North The President called for seventy five thousand men The choicest from thousands of homes quickly responded Young men left their college halls and men their places of business The Union must and shall be preserved was the eager cry Then came the call for forty two thousand men for three years The President began to study war in earnest He gathered military books sought out on maps every creek and hill and valley in the enemy s country and took scarcely time to eat or sleep May twenty four the brilliant young Colonel Ellsworth had been shot at Alexandria by a hotel keeper because he pulled down the secession flag He was buried from the east room in the White House and the North was more aroused than ever The press and people were eager for battle and July twenty one eighteen sixty one the Union army under General McDowell attacked the Confederates at Bull Run and were defeated The South was jubilant and the North learned once for all that the war was to be long and bloody Congress at the request of the President at once voted five hundred thousand men and five hundred million dollars to carry on the war Vast work was to be done The Southern ports must be blockaded and the traffic on the Mississippi River discontinued A great and brave army of Southerners fighting on their own soil every foot of which they knew so well must be conquered if the nation remained intact The burdens of the President grew more and more heavy Men at the North who sympathized with the South for we were bound together as one family in a thousand ways said the President was going too far in his authority others said he moved too slowly and was too lenient to the slave power The South gained strength from the sympathy of England and only by careful leadership was war avoided with that country General McClellan had fought some hard battles in Virginia Fair Oaks Mechanicsville Malvern Hill and others with varying success losing thousands of men in the Chickahominy swamps and after the battle of Antietam Sept seventeen eighteen sixty two one of the severest of the war when each side lost over ten thousand men he was relieved of his command and succeeded by General Burnside There had been some successes at the West under Grant at Fort Donelson and Shiloh and at the South under Farragut but the outlook for the country was not hopeful mister Lincoln had met with a severe affliction in his own household His beautiful son Willie had died in February He used to walk the room in those dying hours saying sadly This is the hardest trial of my life why is it why is it This made him perhaps even more tender of the lives of others sons A young sentinel had been sentenced to be shot for sleeping at his post but the President pardoned him saying I could not think of going into eternity with the blood of the poor young man on my skirts It is not to be wondered at that a boy raised on a farm probably in the habit of going to bed at dark should when required to watch fall asleep and I cannot consent to shoot him for such an act This youth was found among the slain on the field of Fredericksburg wearing next his heart a photograph of his preserver with the words God bless President Lincoln An army officer once went to Washington to see about the execution of twenty four deserters who had been sentenced by court martial to be shot mister President said he unless these men are made an example of the army itself is in danger Mercy to the few is cruelty to the many mister General was the reply there are already too many weeping widows in the United States For God s sake don t ask me to add to the number for I won t do it At another time he said Well I think the boy can do us more good above ground than under ground A woman in a faded shawl and hood came to see the President begging that as her husband and all her sons three had enlisted and her husband had been killed he would release the oldest that he might care for his mother mister Lincoln quickly consented When the poor woman reached the hospital where her boy was to be found he was dead Returning sadly to mister Lincoln he said I know what you wish me to do now and I shall do it without your asking I shall release your second son Now you have one and I one of the other two left that is no more than right Tears filled the eyes of both as she reverently laid her hand on his head saying The Lord bless you mister President May you live a thousand years and always be at the head of this great nation Through all these months it had become evident that slavery must be destroyed or we should live over again these dreadful war scenes in years to come mister Lincoln had been waiting for the right time to free the slaves General McClellan had said A declaration of radical views especially upon slavery will rapidly disintegrate our present armies but Sept twenty two eighteen sixty two mister Lincoln told his Cabinet I have promised my God that I will do it and he issued the immortal Emancipation Proclamation by which four million human beings stepped out from bondage into freedom He knew what he was doing Two years afterward he said It is the central act of my administration and the great event of the nineteenth century The following year eighteen sixty three brought even deeper sorrows The Draft Act by which men were obliged to enter the army when their names were drawn occasioned in July a riot in New York city with the loss of many lives Grant had taken Vicksburg on July four and General Meade had won at the dreadful three days fight at Gettysburg July one four with a loss of more than twenty thousand on either side but the nation was being held together at a fearful cost When mister Lincoln announced to the people the victory at Gettysburg he expressed the desire that in the customary observance of the Fourth of July He whose will not ours should everywhere be done be everywhere reverenced with profoundest gratitude He reverenced God himself most devoutly I have been driven many times upon my knees he said by the overwhelming conviction that I had nowhere else to go My own wisdom and that of all about me seemed insufficient for that day On Nov nineteen of this year this battle field was dedicated with solemn ceremonies as one of the national cemeteries mister Lincoln made a very brief address in words that will last while America lasts The world will little note nor long remember what we say here but it can never forget what they did here It is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining for us that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to the cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom and that the government of the people by the people and for the people shall not perish from the earth Emerson says of these words This and one other American speech that of John Brown to the court that tried him and a part of Kossuth s speech at Birmingham can only be compared with each other and no fourth The next year Feb twenty nine eighteen sixty four the Hero of Vicksburg was called to the Lieutenant Generalship of the army and for the first time mister Lincoln felt somewhat a sense of relief from burdens He said Wherever Grant is things move He now called for five hundred thousand more men and the beginning of the end was seen Sherman swept through to the sea Grant went below Richmond where he said I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer mister Lincoln had been re elected to the Presidency for a second term giving that beautiful inaugural address to the people With malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nation s wounds to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widows and orphans to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations On April nine eighteen sixty five Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox and the long war was ended The people gathered in their churches to praise God amid their tears Abraham Lincoln s name was on every lip The colored people said of their deliverer He is eberywhere He is like de bressed Lord he walks de waters and de land An old colored woman came to the door of the White House and met the President as he was coming out and said she wanted to see Abraham the Second And who was Abraham the First asked the good man Why Lor bless you we read about Abraham de First in de Bible and Abraham de Second is de President Here he is said the President turning away to hide his tears Well did the noble hearted man say I have never willingly planted a thorn in any man s bosom Five days after the surrender of General Lee mister Lincoln went to Ford s Theatre because it would rest him and please the people to see him He used to say The tired part of me is inside and out of reach I feel a presentiment that I shall not outlast the rebellion When it is over my work will be done While mister Lincoln was enjoying the play John Wilkes Booth an actor came into the box behind him and fired a bullet into his brain then sprang upon the stage shouting Sic semper tyrannis The South is avenged The President scarcely moved in his chair and unconscious was taken to a house near by where he died at twenty two minutes past seven April fifteen eighteen sixty five Booth was caught twelve days later and shot in a burning barn The nation seemed as though struck dumb and then from the Old World as well as the New came an agonizing wail of sorrow Death only showed to their view how sublime was the character of him who had carried them through the war While the body embalmed lay in state in the east room of the White House tens of thousands crowded about it And then accompanied by the casket of little Willie the body of Abraham Lincoln took its long journey of fifteen hundred miles to the home of his early life for burial Nothing in this country like that funeral pageant has ever been witnessed In New York in Philadelphia and in every other city along the way houses were trimmed with mourning bells tolled funeral marches were played and the rooms where the body rested were filled

high Heaven and in the face of the world I swear eternal fidelity to the just cause as I deem it of the land of my life my liberty and my love Charles Sumner said There are no accidents in the
