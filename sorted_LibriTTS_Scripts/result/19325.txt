DES BREITMANNSLIED CUPID A CROOK BY EDWARD W TOWNSEND The first night assignment Francis Holt received from his city editor was in these words mister Holt you will cover the Tenderloin to night mister Fetner who usually covers it will explain what there is to do Fetner when his own work was done that night sought Holt to help him with any late story which might be troublesome to a new man They were walking up Broadway when Fetner lowering his voice said Here s Duane a plain clothes man who is useful to us I ll introduce you As the reporters in the full flood of after theater crowds stood talking to the officer a young man hurrying past abruptly stopped and stepped to Duane s side Well Tommy what s up with you the officer asked Holt noted that Tommy besides being breathed was excited His coat and hat had the provisional look of the apparel of house servants out of livery and his trousers belonged to a livery suit Tommy hesitated glancing at Duane s companions but the officer said Tell your story these are friends of mine I was just on my way to the station house to see the captain but I m glad I met you for we don t want the papers to say anything and there s always reporters around the station Holt would have stepped back but Fetner detained him while Duane said cheerfully You re a cunning one Tommy Now what s wrong Well began the youth in the manner of a witness on the stand I was on duty in the hall this evening and noticed one of our tenants mister Porter H Carrington leave the house about ten o clock I noticed that he had no overcoat which I thought was queer for I d just closed the front door because it was getting chilly At the mention of the name Holt started and now paid close attention to the story I was reading the sporting extra by the hall light Tommy continued when in about twenty minutes mister Carrington returned that is I thought it was mister Carrington and he says to me Tommy run up to my dressing room and fetch my overcoat Yes sir I says which one for he has a dozen of em The light one I wore to day he says and I starts up the stairs his apartment being on the next floor thinking I d see the coat he wanted on a chair if he d worn it to day I d just got to his hall and was unlocking the door when he comes up behind me and says I ll get it Tommy there s something else I want So in he goes handing me a dime and I goes back to the hall In about fifteen minutes he comes downstairs wearing an overcoat and carrying a bundle tosses me the key and starts for the door He s the kind that never carries a bundle so I says to him Shall I ring for a messenger to carry your package No says he and leaves the house Tommy paused and there was a shake of excitement in his voice when he resumed In five minutes mister Carrington comes back without any overcoat and says Tommy run upstairs and get me an overcoat I looks and he was as sober as I am at this minute mister Duane and I begins to feel queer It sort of comes over me all of a sudden that the voice of the other man I d unlocked the door for was different from this one But I d been reading the baseball news and didn t notice much at the time So I says hoping it was some kind of a jolly Did you lose the one you just wore out sir I wore no coat he says giving me a look Well he goes to his apartment me after him and there was things flung all over the place and all the signs of a hurry job by a sneak thief mister Carrington was kind of petrified but I runs downstairs and tells the superintendent and he chases me off to the station The superintendent was mad and rags me good for there never was a job of that kind done in the house But the other man was the same looking as the real so how was I to know Duane started off with Tommy and winked to the reporters to follow At the Quadrangle a bachelor apartment house noted for its high rents and exclusiveness Duane was met at the entrance by the superintendent who told the officer that there was nothing in the story after all It was a lark of a friend of his mister Carrington had said and was annoyed that news of the affair had been sent to the police The superintendent was glad that Tommy had not reached the station house Duane looked inquiringly at the superintendent who gravely winked Good night said Duane holding out his hand Good night replied the other taking the hand You won t report this at the station No said Duane who then put his hand in his pocket and returned to the reporters He told them what the superintendent had said What do you make out of it asked Fetner Nothing the officer replied If I tried to make out the cases we are asked not to investigate I d have mighty little time to work on the cases we are wanted in If mister Carrington says he hasn t been robbed it isn t our business to prove that he has been You won t print anything about this Fetner said he would not To have done so after that promise would have closed a fruitful source of Tenderloin stories The reporters left the officer at Broadway and resumed their interrupted walk to supper Lots of funny things happen in the Tenderloin Fetner remarked in the manner of one dismissing a subject But exclaimed Holt quite as excited as Tommy had been I know Carrington So does every one answered Fetner by name and reputation He s just a swell swell enough to be noted Isn t that all He was a couple of classes ahead of me at college continued Holt I didn t know him there one doesn t know half of one s own class but his family and mine are old friends and without troubling himself to know me more than to nod he sometimes sent me word to use his horses when he was away Before I left college and went to work on a Boston paper Carrington started on a trip around the world My people heard of him through his people at times and learned that he was doing a number of crazy things among them getting lost in all sorts of No man s lands His people were usually asking the State Department to locate him through the diplomatic and consular services Then this is one of his eccentricities commented Fetner How can you treat it like that exclaimed Holt I think it is a fascinating mystery and I m going to solve it Not for publication warned Fetner For my own satisfaction declared Holt with great earnestness When the superintendent of the Quadrangle had shaken hands with the officer he turned to Tommy and said You go up to mister Carrington He wants to see you Tommy said mister Carrington I think this is a joke on you This view of the event was such a relief to Tommy that he grinned broadly It is certainly a joke on you Now Thomas did my friend make himself up to look so much like me that you could not have told the difference even if you were not distracted by the discomfiture of the New York nine this season I can t say how much he looked like you and how much he didn t I naturally thought he was you that s all Not all Thomas nothing is all He asked in an easy nice voice for a coat so you thought he was somebody who had a coat here How did you know whose coat he preferred Because I thought he was you If I had not been the last tenant to leave the house before that would you have thought so If mister Hopkins had just left and that man had come in and asked for My coat wouldn t you have got mister Hopkins coat mister Hopkins did go out after you Tommy admitted reluctantly Oh he did eh Well Hopkins is always going out I never knew such a regular out and outer as Hopkins He should reform It s a joke on you Thomas and if I were you I wouldn t say anything about it I ain t going to say anything declared Tommy If I don t lose my job for it I ll be lucky I ll see that you do not lose your job What police did you see Only a plain clothes man I know and a couple of his side partners They won t say anything for the superintendent fixed them mister Carrington secured his college degree a year after his class The delay resulted from an occurrence which he never admitted deserved a year s rustication By mere chance he had learned the date of the birthday of one of the least known and least important instructors and decided that it would be well to celebrate it So he made the acquaintance of the instructor and invited him to a birthday dinner A large and exultant company were the instructor s fellow guests at the saint Dunstan and there was jollity that seemed out of drawing with the dominant lines of the guest of honor yet the scope of the celebration was extended until it included the burning of much red fire and explosion of many noisy bombs at a late hour as the instructor was making a speech of thanks in the yard surrounded by the dinner guests heartily encouraging him It seemed that upon the manner in which the affair was to be presented to the Faculty depended the dismissal of the instructor or the rustication of mister Carrington and the latter managed to present the case so as to save the instructor If he had foreseen all the consequences of taking all the blame for an occurrence promptly distorted in report into the aspect of a riotous carousal perhaps mister Carrington would not have sacrificed himself for a neutral personality which had so recently swum into his ken One consequence was a letter from mister Draper Curtis of New York commanding mister Carrington to cease correspondence with Miss Caroline Curtis and a note from Caroline in which a calmer man than a distracted lover would have seen signs of parental censorship wherein that young lady said that she had read her father s letter and added her commands to his She had heard from many sources as had numerous indignant relatives and friends the particulars of the shocking affair which had compelled the Faculty to discipline mister Carrington and she could but agree with her family that her happiness would rest upon insecure ground if trusted to the inciter and principal offender in such a terrible transaction He was to forget her at once as she would try to forget him Caroline and her mamma sailed for Europe the next day and several letters Carrington wrote to her giving a less censurable version of the little dinner to the little instructor were returned to him unopened After receiving his delayed degree Carrington began a tour around the world In the court of the Palace Hotel the day of his departure from San Francisco a commonplace looking man stepped up to him briskly and said placing a hand on his shoulder Presidio you ve got a nerve to come back here You to the ferry or with me to the captain Carrington turned his full face toward the man for the first time as he brushed aside the hand with some force The man reddened blinked and then stammered Excuse me but you did look so Say you must excuse me for I see that you are a gentleman Isn t Presidio a gentleman Carrington asked good naturedly when he saw that the man s confusion was genuine Why Presidio is do you mind sitting down at one of these tables I feel a little shaky making such a break He explained that he was the hotel s detective and had been on the city s police force In both places he had dealings with a confidence man called Presidio after the part of the city he came from Presidio was an odd lot had enough skill in several occupations to earn honest wages but seemed unable to forego the pleasure of exercising his wit in confidence games and sneak thievery Among his honest accomplishments was the ability to perform sleight of hand tricks well enough to work profitably in the lesser theater circuits He had married a woman who made part of the show Presidio operated for a time a good looking woman but as ready to turn a confidence trick as to help her husband s stage work or do a song and dance as an interlude They had been warned to leave San Francisco for a year and not to return then unless bringing proof that they had walked in moral paths during their exile And you mistook me for Presidio asked Carrington with the manner of one flattered For a second and seeing only your side face Of course I saw my mistake when you turned and spoke to me Presidio is considered the best looking crook we ve ever had Now that s nice Where did you say he s gone I don t know Carrington found that out for himself He first interrupted his voyage by a stop of some weeks in Japan Later at the Oriental Hotel in Manila the day of his arrival there he saw a man observing him with smiling interest a kind of smile and interest which prompted Carrington to smile in return He was bored because the only officer he knew in the Philippines was absent from Manila on an expedition to the interior and the man who smiled looked as if he might scatter the blues if he were permitted to try The stranger approached with a bright frank look and said Don t you remember me mister Carrington No o I was head waiter at the saint Dunstan Oh were you Well your face has a familiar look somehow Excuse my speaking to you but I guess your last trip was what induced me to come out here That s odd It is sort of funny I d saved a good deal I m the saving sort and the tenner you gave me that night you remember the night of the dinner happened to fetch my pile up to exactly five hundred So I says to myself that here was my chance to make a break for freedom independence you understand We re the very deuce for independence down our way Yes indeed sir I was awfully sorry to hear about the trouble you got in at college but if you don t mind my saying so now you boys were going it a little that night Going it What night There were several The red fire night You tipped me ten for that dinner Did I I hope you have it yet mister James Wilkins sir Did you see mister Thorpe and mister Culver as you passed through San Francisco I did How did you happen to know that I knew them I remember that they were chums of yours at college We heard lots of college gossip at saint Dunstan s I called on them in San Francisco and mister Thorpe got me half fare rates here I ve opened a restaurant here and am doing a good business Some of the officers who knew me at the saint Dunstan kind of made my place fashionable Lieutenant Sommers of the cavalry won t dine anywhere else Sommers I expected to find him here He s just gone out with an expedition He told me that you d be along and that I was to see that you didn t starve I ve named my place the saint Dunstan and I d like you to call there I remember your favorite dishes That s very decent of you mister Wilkins looked frequently toward the entrance with seeming anxiety I wish the proprietor of this place would come in he said at last Lieutenant Sommers left me a check on this house for a hundred mister Sommers roomed here and left his money with the office I need the cash to pay a carpenter who has built an addition for me Kind of funny to be worth not a cent less than five thousand gold in stock and good will and be pushed for a hundred cash If you ve mister Sommers check I ll let you have the money for saint Dunstan s sake If you could Of course you know the lieutenant s signature As well as my own Quite right Here you are Where is your restaurant You cross the Lunette turn toward the bay ask anybody Hope to see you soon Good day Some officers called on Carrington as they had been told to do by the absent Sommers When introductions were over one of them handed a paper to Carrington saying gravely Sommers told me to give this to you It was published in San Francisco the day after you left and reached here while you were in Japan What Carrington saw was a San Francisco newspaper story of his encounter with the Palace Hotel detective an account of his famous dinner at the saint Dunstan some selections of his other college pranks allusion to the fact that he was a classmate of two San Franciscans Messrs Thorpe and Culver the whole illustrated with pictures of Carrington and Presidio the latter taken from the rogues gallery Very pretty very pretty indeed murmured Carrington his eyes lingering with thoughtful pause on the picture of Presidio Could we not celebrate my fame in some place of refreshment the saint Dunstan for instance They knew of no saint Dunstan s I foreboded it sighed Carrington He narrated his recent experience with one James Wilkins who I now opine is mister Presidio It s not worth troubling the police about but I d give a pretty penny to see mister Presidio again Not to reprove him for the error of his ways but to discover the resemblance which has led to this winsome newspaper story The next day one of the officers told Carrington that he had learned that Presidio and his wife known to the police by a number of names had taken ship the afternoon before I see remarked Carrington He needed exactly my tip to move to new fields He worked me from the article in the paper which he had seen and I had not Clever Presidio When Tommy the hall boy on the night of mister Holt s first Tenderloin assignment went to inform the police Carrington looking about the apartment to discover the extent of his loss found on a table a letter superinscribed Before sending for the police read this He read Dear mister Carrington Since we met in Manila I have been to about every country on top of the earth where a white man s show could be worked It s been up and down and down and up the last turn being down In India I got some sleight of hand tricks which are new to this country but here we land wife and me broke Nothing but our apparatus which we can t eat and not able to use it because we are shy on dress clothes demanded by the houses where I could get engagements In that condition I happened to see you on the street and thought to try a touch and would but you might be sore over the little fun we had in Manila I heard in South Africa that you wouldn t let the army officers start the police after me and wife says that was as square a deal as she ever heard of and to try a touch But I says we will make a forced loan and repay out of our salaries We hocked our apparatus to get me a suit of clothes which looked something like those you wear and the rest was easy finding out Tommy s name and then conning him I ve taken some clothes and jewelry to make a front at the booking office and some cash You should empty your pockets of loose cash I found some in all your clothes Give me and wife a chance and we will live straight after this and remit on instalment You can get me pinched easy for we ll be playing the continuous circuit in a week but wife says you won t squeal and I ll take chances Yours sincerely as always Presidio So Carrington told the superintendent to drop the matter The Great Courvatals Monsieur and Madame showed their new tricks to the booking agent and secured a forty weeks engagement at a salary which only Presidio s confidence could have asked Presidio liked New York and exploited it in as many directions as possible With his new fashionable clothing and his handsome face he was admitted to resorts of a character his boldest dreams had never before penetrated He especially liked the fine restaurants None so jocund so frank and free as Presidio in ordering the best at the best places missus Presidio did not accompany him she was enjoying the more poignant pleasure of shopping with a responsible theater manager as her reference At a restaurant one midday as Presidio was leisurely breakfasting he became aware that he was the object of furtive observation by a young lady seated with an elderly companion at a table somewhat removed Furtive doings were in his line and he made a close study of the party never turning more than a scant half face to do so The manner of the young lady was puzzling None so keen as Presidio in reading expression but hers he could not understand That she was not trying to flirt with him he decided promptly and definitively yet her looks were intended to attract his attention and to do so secretly The elderly companion when the couple was leaving the restaurant stopped in the vestibule to allow an attendant to adjust her wrap and Presidio seized that chance to pass close to the young lady moving as slowly as he dared without seeming to be concerned in her actions Her head was averted but Presidio distinctly heard her breathe rather than whisper Pass by the house to morrow afternoon Presidio pondered He was supposed to know where her house was he was unwelcome to some one there he was mistaken for some one else Carrington When he told his wife about it she was in a fever of romantic excitement Bruising knocks in the world close approaches to the shades of the prison house hardships which would have banished romance from a nature less robustly romantic had for missus Presidio but more glowingly suffused with the tints of romance all life but her own mister Carrington has done us right Willie she declared once in Manila when we simply had to get to Hong Kong and here where we wouldn t have had no show on earth if he hadn t lent you the clothes and cash for the start There s something doing here Willie and I m all lit up with excitement Presidio who of course had followed the young lady to learn where she lived passed the house the next day the sedatest looking man on the sedate block Presently a maid came from the house gave him a beckoning nod and hurried on round the corner There she slipped him a note saying as she walked on I was to give you this mister Carrington Presidio took the note to his wife and she declared for opening it It was sealed and addressed to another person but to let such an informality as opening another s letters stand in the way of knowing what was going on around them would have been foreign to the nature of Presidio activities This was the note Dear Porter Your letters to papa will not be answered I heard him say so to mamma yesterday He is angry that you wrote to him on the very day I returned from Europe He will send me back there if you try to see me as you say you will but dear even at that cost I must see you once more I have never forgotten never ceased to love but there is no hope A companion accompanies me always the one you saw in the restaurant but the maid who will hand you this is trustworthy and will bring me any message you give to her If you can arrange for a moment s meeting it will give me something to cherish in my memory through the remainder of my sad and hopeless life Only for a moment dear Caroline missus Presidio wept Here was romance sadder and therefore better than any she had ever read better even than that in the one act dramas which followed their turns on the stage Have you ever studied his writing she asked her husband and promptly divining her plan he replied I made a few copies of his signature on the Manila hotel register You never know what will turn up After a pause he added eagerly Better yet there was some of his writing in the overcoat I borrowed from his rooms Write to her make an appointment and have him on hand to keep it Here was work right in Presidio s line his professional pride was fired and he wrote with grave application Darling Caroline Thank you sweetheart for words which have kept me from suicide Love of my life I can not live until we meet But only for a moment Nay for ever and ever That s beautiful declared missus Presidio looking over Willie s shoulder He continued I shall hand this to your maid but you must not meet me there it would be too dangerous Leave your house one half hour after receiving this and go around the corner where you will see a lady a relative of mine who will drive with you to a safe tryst Trust her and heaven speed the hour With undying love Porter This was all written in a good imitation of Carrington s rather unusual handwriting and approved by missus Presidio who however thought there should be some reference to the young lady s home as a beetled tower and to her father as several things which Presidio feared might not be esteemed polite in the social plane they were operating in He passed the house the next day and the maid soon appeared He learned from her that her mistress s companion was not at home and then hopeful because of this opportune absence hurried off leaving missus Presidio round the corner in a carriage He went to a club where he had ascertained Carrington usually was at that hour and sent in the card of M Courvatal on which he wrote Presidio Carrington came out to him at once My dear mister Presidio this is so kind of you he said regarding his caller with interest We ve not met since Manila I hope missus Presidio is well and that your professional engagements prosper I went to see you perform last night and was delighted Thank you the caller said much pleased with this reception I ll be sending the balance of my little debt to you as soon as the wife has her dressmaking bills settled Pray do not incommode the wife The amount you have already sent was a pleasant surprise Can I be of any service to you to day Well it s like this mister Carrington I have an appointment for you this afternoon For me With Miss Caroline Curtis What do you mean Don t be offended sir Come with me and see what you ll see If I try any game pitch into me that s all The man s manner was now so earnest that Carrington without a word started with him In the club entrance Presidio whispered Follow don t walk with me There s not much chance that any one here will recognize me but if I was pinched on any old score you d better not be in my company He went ahead and Carrington followed They had walked down Fifth Avenue several blocks when mister Francis Holt cut in between them and shadowed Presidio with elaborate caution Carrington saw this and mused I think I know that young man who has so plainly got friend Presidio under observation Surely it s Holt a year or two after me What can he Hello I say Holt saw the intention of Presidio to turn off the avenue toward a little church round the corner and advancing suddenly laid a strong hand on Presidio s shoulder saying Come quietly with me and I ll make no fuss but if you don t I ll call a policeman Carrington overtook them Holt was excited wild eyed disheveled and seemed not to have slept for a week Presidio coolly awaited events Hello Holt exclaimed Carrington How are you old chap Haven t seen you for years Good heavens this is lucky cried Holt Carrington since the night your rooms were plundered I ve been on the track of this villain I was bound to explain the mystery of that night determined to prove that I could unravel a plot detect a crime Do you understand This is the fellow who rifled your room Robbed you Yes I know old fellow Carrington replied soothingly for he saw that Holt was half hysterical from excitement He s always robbing me this chap is It s a habit with him I ve come rather to like it Walk along with us and I ll tell you all about it They turned the corner and walked down the side street but only Holt talked of his sleepless nights and tireless days solving his first crime case A carriage drove up to the curb and missus Presidio stepped out At a wink from Presidio Carrington stepped in Betty said Presidio to his wife shake hands with an old friend of mine and of mister Carrington s I want you to know him mister Holt shake hands with Madame Courvatal my wife Why mister Holt glad to meet you personally exclaimed Betty This is the gent Willie I ve told you about comes to the show every night just before our turn and goes out as soon as we are off Glad you like the turn so much Presidio said smiling oddly Holt with his hand to his brow was gasping The carriage door opened and Carrington s head emerged Oh Holt come here Holt with a painfully dazed expression went to the carriage My dear Carrington said to some one inside who was struggling to hide this is mister Francis Holt one of my oldest and dearest friends He s the discreetest fellow I know and will arrange the whole matter in a minute You must darling Fate has offered us a chance for life s happiness and as I say Holt like a good fellow go into the parsonage and explain who I am and who Miss Caroline Curtis is Your people know all the Curtises and we re going to get married and don t protest darling like a good chap Holt go and for God s sake man don t stare like that You know us and can vouch for us Tell the parson that the Curtises and Carringtons are always marrying each other Holt will you move An hour later a little banquet was served in the private dining room of a hotel and missus Carrington was explaining between tears and laughter how good kind Madame Courvatal had told her that everything was ready for a wedding and that she would be a cruel woman indeed not to make such a loving lover happy and she couldn t make up her mind to say yes and it was hard to say no just after receiving Porter s despairing note My note dear asked Carrington but Presidio coughed so loudly she did not hear her husband s question Holt drank to the bride and groom several times before he began soberly to believe he was not in a dream mister and missus Presidio beamed broadly and declared that life without romance was no kind of a life for honest folk to live Holt exclaimed Carrington when the train carriage was announced you ve been a brick about all this I don t know how to show my appreciation I ll tell you how suggested Presidio Let mister Holt be the one to tell mister Curtis He deserves the privilege of informing the governor The very thing Holt old chap cried Carrington Will you do it You re awfully kind answered Holt but I think this old friend could do it with more art and understanding What my Willie cried Willie s wife He ll do it to the Queen s taste Won t you Willie I will in company with mister Holt my friend and your admirer He sits in front every night he added in explanation to Carrington As the carriage with the happy pair drove away to the station Presidio with compulsive ardor took the arm of mister Francis Holt and together they marched up the avenue to inform mister Curtis of the marriage of his daughter TWO CASES OF GRIP BY M QUAD What s this What s this exclaimed mister Bowser as he came home the other evening and found missus Bowser lying on the sofa and looking very much distressed The doctor says it s the grip a second attack she explained I was taken with a chill and headache about noon and Grip Second attack That s all nonsense missus Bowser Nobody can have the grip a second time But the doctor says so Then the doctor is an idiot and I ll tell him so to his face I know what s the matter with you You ve been walking around the backyard barefoot or doing some other foolish thing I expected it however No woman is happy unless she s flat down about half the time How on earth any of your sex manage to live to be twenty years old is a mystery to me The average woman has no more sense than a rag baby I haven t been careless she replied I know better Of course you have If you hadn t been you wouldn t be where you are Grip be hanged Well it s only right that you should suffer for it Call it what you wish but don t expect any sympathy from me While I use every precaution to preserve my health you go sloshing around in your bare feet or sit on a cake of ice to read a dime novel or do some other tomfool thing to flatten you out I refuse to sympathize with you missus Bowser absolutely and teetotally refuse to utter one word of pity missus Bowser had nothing to say in reply mister Bowser ate his dinner alone took advantage of the occasion to drive a few nails and make a great noise and by and by went off to his club and was gone until midnight Next morning missus Bowser felt a bit better and made a heroic attempt to be about until he started for the office The only reference he made to her illness was to say If you live to be three hundred years old you may possibly learn something about the laws of health and be able to keep out of bed three days in a week missus Bowser was all right at the end of three or four days and nothing more was said Then one afternoon at three o clock a carriage drove up and a stranger assisted mister Bowser into the house He was looking pale and ghastly and his chin quivered and his knees wabbled What is it mister Bowser she exclaimed as she met him at the door Bed doctor death he gasped in reply missus Bowser got him to bed and examined him for bullet holes or knife wounds There were none He had no broken limbs He hadn t fallen off a horse or been half drowned When she had satisfied herself on these points she asked How were you taken W with a c chill he gasped with a c chill and a b backache I thought so mister Bowser you have the grip a second attack As I have some medicine left there s no need to send for the doctor I ll have you all right in a day or two Get the doctor at once wailed mister Bowser or I m a dead man Such a backache So cold missus Bowser if I should d die I hope Emotion overcame mister Bowser and he could say no more The doctor came and pronounced it a second attack of the grip but a very mild one When he had departed missus Bowser didn t accuse mister Bowser with putting on his summer flannels a month too soon with forgetting his umbrella and getting soaked through with leaving his rubbers at home and having damp feet all day She didn t express her wonder that he hadn t died years ago nor predict that when he reached the age of Methuselah he would know better than to roll in snow banks or stand around in mud puddles She didn t kick over chairs or slam doors or leave him alone When mister Bowser shed tears she wiped them away When he moaned she held his hand When he said he felt that the grim specter was near and wanted to kiss the baby good by she cheered him with the prediction that he would be a great deal better next day mister Bowser didn t get up next day though the doctor said he could He lay in bed and sighed and uttered sorrowful moans and groans He wanted toast and preserves he had to have help to turn over he worried about a relapse he had to have a damp cloth on his forehead he wanted to have a council of doctors and he read the copy of his last will and testament over three times mister Bowser was all right next morning however When missus Bowser asked him how he felt he replied How do I feel Why as right as a trivet of course When a man takes the care of himself that I do when he has the nerve and will power I have he can throw off most anything You would have died missus Bowser but I was scarcely affected It was just a play spell I d like to be real sick once just to see how it would seem Cholera I suppose it was but outside of feeling a little tired I wasn t at all affected And the dutiful missus Bowser looked at him and swallowed it all and never said a word to hurt his feelings ALPHABET OF CELEBRITIES BY OLIVER HERFORD E is for Edison making believe He s

a regular et cetera et cetera Voice from across the reading table A slave to tobacco Not I Singular the way you women misuse nouns I am rather a chosen acolyte in the temple of Nicotiana Daily aye thrice daily well call it six then do I make burnt offering Now some use censers of clay others employ censers of rare white earth finely carved and decked with silver and gold My particular censer as you see is a plain honest briar a root dug from the banks of the blue Garonne whose only glory is its grain and color The original tint if you remember was like that of new cut cedar but use I ve been smoking this one only two years now has given it gloss and depth of tone which put the finest mahogany to shame Let me rub it on my sleeve Now look There are no elaborate mummeries about our service in the temple of Nicotiana No priest or pastor no robed muezzin or gowned prelate calls me to the altar Neither is there fixed hour or prescribed point of the compass towards which I must turn Whenever the mood comes and the spirit listeth I make devotion There are various methods numerous brief litanies Mine is a common and simple one I take the cut Indian leaf in the left palm so and roll it gently about with the right thus Next I pack it firmly in the censer s hollow bowl with neither too firm nor too light a pressure Any fire will do The torch need not be blessed Thanks I have a match Now we are ready With the surplus breath of life you draw in the fragrant spirit of the weed With slow reluctant outbreathing you loose it on the quiet air Behold That which was but a dead thing lives Perhaps we have released the soul of some brave red warrior who long years ago fell in glorious battle and mingled his dust with the unforgetting earth Each puff may give everlasting liberty to some dead and gone aboriginal If you listen you may hear his far off chant Through the curling blue wreaths you may catch a glimpse of the happy hunting grounds to which he has now gone That is the part of the service whose losing or gaining depends upon yourself The first whiff is the invocation the last the benediction When you knock out the ashes you should feel conscious that you have done a

none	none	 You must know gentlemen that there lived some years ago in the city of Perigueux 
6709-74022-0001	train-other-500	an honest notary public the descendant of a very ancient and broken down family and the occupant of one of those old weather beaten tenements which remind you of the times of your great grandfather
6709-74022-0002	train-other-500	He was a man of an unoffending quiet disposition the father of a family
none	none	 though not the head of it for in that family 
6709-74022-0003	train-other-500	the hen over crowed the cock and the neighbors when they spake of the notary shrugged their shoulders and exclaimed Poor fellow his spurs want sharpening In fine you understand me gentlemen he was hen pecked
none	none	 Well finding no peace at home he sought it elsewhere as was very natural for him to do 
6709-74022-0005	train-other-500	and at length discovered a place of rest far beyond the cares and clamors of domestic life This was a little Cafe Estaminet a short way out of the city whither he repaired every evening to smoke his pipe drink sugar water
6709-74022-0006	train-other-500	and play his favorite game of domino There he met the boon companions he most loved heard all the floating chitchat of the day laughed when he was in merry mood found consolation when he was sad
6709-74022-0007	train-other-500	and at all times gave vent to his opinions without fear of being snubbed short by a flat contradiction Now the notary s bosom friend was a dealer in claret and cognac
6709-74022-0008	train-other-500	who lived about a league from the city and always passed his evenings at the Estaminet He was a gross corpulent fellow raised from a full blooded Gascon breed and sired by a comic actor of some reputation in his way
6709-74022-0009	train-other-500	He was remarkable for nothing but his good humor his love of cards and a strong propensity to test the quality of his own liquors by comparing them with those sold at other places
6709-74022-0010	train-other-500	As evil communications corrupt good manners the bad practices of the wine dealer won insensibly upon the worthy notary and before he was aware of it he found himself weaned from domino and sugar water
none	none	 and addicted to piquet and spiced wine 
6709-74022-0011	train-other-500	Indeed it not unfrequently happened that after a long session at the Estaminet the two friends grew so urbane
none	none	 that they would waste a full half hour at the door 
6709-74022-0012	train-other-500	in friendly dispute which should conduct the other home Though this course of life agreed well enough with the sluggish phlegmatic temperament of the wine dealer
6709-74022-0013	train-other-500	it soon began to play the very deuse with the more sensitive organization of the notary and finally put his nervous system completely out of tune He lost his appetite became gaunt and haggard
none	none	 and could get no sleep 
6709-74022-0014	train-other-500	Legions of blue devils haunted him by day and by night strange faces peeped through his bed curtains and the nightmare snorted in his ear The worse he grew the more he smoked and tippled
6709-74022-0015	train-other-500	and the more he smoked and tippled why as a matter of course the worse he grew
none	none	 His wife alternately stormed remonstrated entreated but all in vain 
6709-74022-0016	train-other-500	She made the house too hot for him he retreated to the tavern she broke his long stemmed pipes upon the andirons he substituted a short stemmed one which for safe keeping he carried in his waistcoat pocket
6709-74022-0017	train-other-500	Thus the unhappy notary ran gradually down at the heel What with his bad habits and his domestic grievances he became completely hipped He imagined that he was going to die and suffered in quick succession
6709-74022-0018	train-other-500	all the diseases that ever beset mortal man Every shooting pain was an alarming symptom every uneasy feeling after dinner a sure prognostic of some mortal disease In vain did his friends endeavor to reason
6709-74022-0019	train-other-500	and then to laugh him out of his strange whims for when did ever jest or reason cure a sick imagination His only answer was Do let me alone I know better than you what ails me Well gentlemen
6709-74022-0020	train-other-500	things were in this state when one afternoon in December as he sat moping in his office wrapped in an overcoat with a cap on his head and his feet thrust into a pair of furred slippers a cabriolet stopped at the door
6709-74022-0021	train-other-500	and a loud knocking without aroused him from his gloomy revery It was a message from his friend the wine dealer who had been suddenly attacked with a violent fever and growing worse and worse had now sent in the greatest haste for the notary
6709-74022-0022	train-other-500	to draw up his last will and testament The case was urgent and admitted neither excuse nor delay and the notary tying a handkerchief round his face and buttoning up to the chin jumped into the cabriolet and suffered himself
none	none	 though not without some dismal presentiments and misgivings of heart 
6709-74022-0023	train-other-500	to be driven to the wine dealer s house When he arrived he found everything in the greatest confusion On entering the house he ran against the apothecary who was coming down stairs with a face as long as your arm
none	none	 and a few steps farther he met the housekeeper for the wine dealer was an old bachelor 
6709-74022-0024	train-other-500	running up and down and wringing her hands for fear that the good man should die without making his will He soon reached the chamber of his sick friend and found him tossing about in a paroxysm of fever and calling aloud for a draught of cold water
6709-74022-0025	train-other-500	The notary shook his head he thought this a fatal symptom for ten years back the wine dealer had been suffering under a species of hydrophobia which seemed suddenly to have left him
6709-74022-0026	train-other-500	When the sick man saw who stood by his bedside he stretched out his hand and exclaimed Ah my dear friend have you come at last You see it is all over with me
6709-74022-0027	train-other-500	You have arrived just in time to draw up that that passport of mine
none	none	 Ah grand diable 
6709-74022-0028	train-other-500	how hot it is here Water water water Will nobody give me a drop of cold water
6709-74022-0029	train-other-500	As the case was an urgent one the notary made no delay in getting his papers in readiness and in a short time the last will and testament of the wine dealer was drawn up in due form the notary guiding the sick man s hand as he scrawled his signature at the bottom
none	none	 As the evening wore away the wine dealer grew worse and worse and at length became delirious mingling in his incoherent ravings 
6709-74022-0030	train-other-500	the phrases of the Credo and Paternoster with the shibboleth of the dram shop and the card table
none	none	 Take care take care There now Credo in Pop ting a ling ling give me some of that Cent e dize Why you old publican this wine is poisoned I know your tricks Sanctam ecclesiam catholicam Well well we shall see Imbecile to have a tierce major and a seven of hearts and discard the seven By saint Anthony capot You are lurched ha ha I told you so I knew very well there there don t interrupt me Carnis resurrectionem et vitam eternam With these words upon his lips the poor wine dealer expired Meanwhile the notary sat cowering over the fire aghast 
6709-74022-0031	train-other-500	at the fearful scene that was passing before him and now and then striving to keep up his courage by a glass of cognac Already his fears were on the alert and the idea of contagion flitted to and fro through his mind
none	none	 In order to quiet these thoughts of evil import he lighted his pipe 
6709-74022-0032	train-other-500	and began to prepare for returning home At that moment the apothecary turned round to him and said Dreadful sickly time this The disorder seems to be spreading What disorder exclaimed the notary with a movement of surprise
6709-74022-0033	train-other-500	Two died yesterday and three to day continued the apothecary without answering the question Very sickly time sir very But what disorder is it What
none	none	 disease has carried off my friend here so suddenly 
6709-74022-0034	train-other-500	What disease Why scarlet fever to be sure And is it contagious Certainly Then I am a dead man exclaimed the notary putting his pipe into his waistcoat pocket
6709-74022-0035	train-other-500	and beginning to walk up and down the room in despair I am a dead man Now don t deceive me don t will you
none	none	 What what are the symptoms 
6709-74022-0036	train-other-500	A sharp burning pain in the right side said the apothecary
none	none	 O what a fool I was to come here 
6709-74022-0037	train-other-500	In vain did the housekeeper and the apothecary strive to pacify him he was not a man to be reasoned with he answered that he knew his own constitution better than they did and insisted upon going home without delay
none	none	 Unfortunately the vehicle he came in had returned to the city and the whole neighborhood was abed and asleep What was to be done 
6709-74022-0038	train-other-500	Nothing in the world but to take the apothecary s horse which stood hitched at the door patiently waiting his master s will Well gentlemen as there was no remedy our notary mounted
none	none	 this raw boned steed and set forth 
6709-74022-0039	train-other-500	upon his homeward journey The night was cold and gusty and the wind right in his teeth Overhead the leaden clouds were beating to and fro and through them the newly risen moon seemed to be tossing
none	none	 and drifting along like a cock boat in the surf 
6709-74022-0040	train-other-500	now swallowed up in a huge billow of cloud and now lifted upon its bosom and dashed with silvery spray The trees by the road side groaned with a sound of evil omen and before him lay three mortal miles
6709-74022-0041	train-other-500	beset with a thousand imaginary perils Obedient to the whip and spur the steed leaped forward by fits and starts now dashing away in a tremendous gallop and now relaxing into a long hard trot while the rider
6709-74022-0042	train-other-500	filled with symptoms of disease and dire presentiments of death urged him on as if he were fleeing before the pestilence In this way by dint of whistling and shouting and beating right and left one mile of the fatal three was safely passed
6709-74022-0043	train-other-500	The apprehensions of the notary had so far subsided that he even suffered the poor horse to walk up hill but these apprehensions were suddenly revived again with tenfold violence by a sharp pain in the right side which seemed to pierce him like a needle
6709-74022-0044	train-other-500	It is upon me at last groaned the fear stricken man Heaven be merciful to me the greatest of sinners And must I die in a ditch after all He get up get up And away went horse and rider at full speed
6709-74022-0045	train-other-500	hurry scurry up hill and down panting and blowing like a whirlwind At every leap the pain in the rider s side seemed to increase At first it was a little point like the prick of a needle then it spread to the size of a half franc piece
6709-74022-0046	train-other-500	then covered a place as large as the palm of your hand It gained upon him fast The poor man groaned aloud in agony faster and faster sped the horse over the frozen ground farther and farther spread the pain over his side To complete the dismal picture the storm commenced
none	none	 snow mingled with rain 
6709-74022-0047	train-other-500	But snow and rain and cold were naught to him for though his arms and legs were frozen to icicles he felt it not the fatal symptom was upon him he was doomed to die not of cold but of scarlet fever
6709-74022-0048	train-other-500	At length he knew not how more dead than alive he reached the gate of the city A band of ill bred dogs that were serenading at a corner of the street seeing the notary dash by joined in the hue and cry and ran barking and yelping at his heels
6709-74022-0049	train-other-500	It was now late at night and only here and there a solitary lamp twinkled from an upper story But on went the notary
none	none	 down this street and up that till at last he reached his own door There was a light in his wife s bedroom 
6709-74022-0050	train-other-500	The good woman came to the window alarmed at such a knocking and howling and clattering at her door so late at night and the notary was too deeply absorbed in his own sorrows to observe that the lamp cast the shadow of two heads on the window curtain
6709-74022-0051	train-other-500	Let me in let me in Quick quick he exclaimed almost breathless from terror and fatigue Who are you that come to disturb a lone woman at this hour of the night cried a sharp voice from above
none	none	 Begone about your business and let quiet people sleep Come down and let me in I am your husband Don t you know my voice 
6709-74022-0052	train-other-500	Quick I beseech you for I am dying here in the street After a few moments of delay and a few more words of parley the door was opened and the notary stalked into his domicile pale and haggard in aspect and as stiff and straight as a ghost
6709-74022-0053	train-other-500	Cased from head to heel in an armor of ice as the glare of the lamp fell upon him he looked like a knight errant mailed in steel But in one place his armor was broken On his right side was a circular spot
6709-74022-0054	train-other-500	as large as the crown of your hat and about as black My dear wife he exclaimed with more tenderness than he had exhibited for many years
none	none	 Reach me a chair 
6709-74022-0055	train-other-500	My hours are numbered I am a dead man Alarmed at these exclamations his wife stripped off his overcoat
none	none	 Something fell from beneath it and was dashed to pieces on the hearth 
6709-74022-0056	train-other-500	It was the notary s pipe He placed his hand upon his side and lo it was bare to the skin Coat waistcoat and linen were burnt through and through
none	none	 and there was a blister on his side as large as your hand 
6709-74022-0057	train-other-500	The mystery was soon explained symptom and all The notary had put his pipe into his pocket without knocking out the ashes And so my story ends
none	none	 Is that all asked the radical when the story teller had finished 
6709-74022-0058	train-other-500	That is all Well what does your story prove That is more than I can tell All I know is that the story is true
none	none	 And did he die said the nice little man in gosling green 
6709-74022-0059	train-other-500	Yes he died afterwards replied the story teller rather annoyed by the question
none	none	 And what did he die of continued gosling green following him up What did he die of why he died of a sudden HOLLY SONG BY CLINTON SCOLLARD Care is but a broken bubble Trill the carol troll

BY JOHN PAUL Lyrics to Inez and Jane Dolores and Ethel and May Senoritas distant as Spain And damsels just over the way It is not that I m jealous nor that Of either Dolores or Jane Of some girl in an

horse must caracole free With the pretty when spurning the plain Should the team work fall wholly on me While he soars with Dolores and Jane I am neither Dolores nor Jane But to lighten a little my

errun the cup Of maidenhood my candor owns Till some skilled Mentor opens up A regular school for chaperones THE CAMP MEETING BY BAYNARD RUST HALL The camp was furnished with several stands for preaching exhorting jumping and jerking but still one place was the pulpit above all others This was a large scaffold secured between two noble sugar trees and railed in to prevent from falling over in a swoon or springing over in an ecstasy its cover the dense foliage of the trees whose trunks formed the graceful and massive columns Here was said to be also the altar but I could not see its horns or any sacrifice and the pen which I did see a place full of clean straw where were put into fold stray sheep willing to return It was at this pulpit with its altar and pen the regular preaching was done around here the congregation assembled hence orders were issued here happened the hardest fights and were gained the greatest victories being the spot where it was understood Satan fought in person and here could be seen gestures the most frantic and heard noises the most unimaginable and often the most appalling It was the place in short where most crowded either with praiseworthy intentions of getting some religion or with unholy purposes of being amused we of course designing neither one nor the other but only to see philosophically and make up an opinion At every grand outcry a simultaneous rush would however take place from all parts of the camp proper and improper towards the pulpit altar and pen till the crowding by increasing the suffocation and the fainting would increase the tumult and the uproar but this in the estimation of many devotees only rendered the meeting more lively and interesting By considering what was done at this central station one may approximate the amount of spiritual labor done in a day and then a week in the whole camp one About day break on Sabbath a horn blasted us up for public prayer and exhortation the exercises continuing nearly two hours two Before breakfast another blast for family and private prayer and then every tent became in camp language a bethel of struggling Jacobs and prevailing Israels every tree an altar and every grove a secret closet till the air all became religious words and phrases and vocal with Amens three After a proper interval came a horn for the forenoon service then was delivered the sermon and that followed by an appendix of some half dozen exhortations let off right and left and even behind the pulpit that all might have a portion in due season four We had private and secret prayer again before dinner some clambering into thick trees to be hid but forgetting in their simplicity that they were heard and betrayed But religious devotion excuses all errors and mistakes five The afternoon sermon with its bob tail string of exhortations six Private and family prayer about tea time seven But lastly we had what was termed a precious season in the third regular service at the principia of the camp This season began not long after tea and was kept up long after I left the ground which was about midnight And now sermon after sermon and exhortation after exhortation followed like shallow foaming roaring waters till the speakers were exhausted and the assembly became an uneasy and billowy mass now hushing to a sobbing quiescence and now rousing by the groans of sinners and the triumphant cries of folks that had jist got religion and then again subsiding to a buzzy state occasioned by the whimpering and whining voices of persons giving spiritual advice and comfort How like a volcanic crater after the evomition of its lava in a fit of burning cholic and striving to resettle its angry and tumultuating stomach It is time however to speak of the three grand services and their concomitants and to introduce several master spirits of the camp Our first character is the Reverend Elder Sprightly This gentleman was of good natural parts and in a better school of intellectual discipline and more fortunate circumstances he must have become a worthy minister of some more tasteful literary and evangelical sect As it was he had only become what he never got beyond a very smart man and his aim had become one to enlarge his own people And in this work so great was his success that to use his own modest boastfulness in his sermon to day although folks said when he came to the Purchase that a single corn crib would hold his people yet bless the Lord they had kept spreading and spreading till all the corn cribs in Egypt weren t big enough to hold them He was very happy at repartee as Robert Dale Owen well knows and not slow inexpert in the arts of taking off and giving them their own This trait we shall illustrate by an instance mister Sprightly was by accident once present where a Campbellite Baptist that had recently taken out a right for administering six doses of lobelia red pepper and steam to men s bodies and a plunge into cold water for the good of their souls was holding forth against all Doctors secular and sacred and very fiercely against Sprightly s brotherhood Doctor Lobelia s text was found somewhere in Pope Campbell s New Testament as it suited the following discourse introduced with the usual inspired preface DOCTOR LOBELIA S SERMON Well I never rub d my back agin a collige nor git no sheepskin and allow the Apostuls didn t nither Did anybody ever hear of Peter and Poll a goin to them new fangled places and gitten skins to preach by No sirs I allow not no sirs we don t pretend to loguk this here new testament s sheepskin enough for me And don t Prisbeteruns and tother baby sprinklurs have reskorse to loguk and skins to show how them what s emerz d didn t go down into the water and come up agin And as to Sprightly s preachurs don t they dress like big bugs and go ridin about the Purchis on hunder dollur hossis a spunginin on poor priest riden folks and a eatin fried chickin fixins so powerful fast that chickins has got skerse in these diggins and then what ain t fried makes tracks and hides when they sees them a comin But dear bruthrun we don t want store cloth and yaller buttins and fat hossis and chickin fixins and the like doins no sirs we only wants your souls we only wants beleevur s baptism we wants prim prim yes Apostul s Christianity the Christianity of Christ and them times when Christians was Christians and tuk up thare cross and went down into the water and was buried in the gineine sort of baptism by emerzhin That s all we wants and I hope all s convinced that s the true way and so let all come right out from among them and git beleevur s baptism and so now if any brothur wants to say a word I m done and I ll make way for him to preach Anticipating this common invitation our friend Sprightly indignant at this unprovoked attack of Doctor Lobelia had in order to disguise himself exchanged his clerical garb for a friend s blue coatee bedizzened with metal buttons and also had erected a very tasteful and sharp coxcomb on his head out of hair usually reposing sleek and quiet in the most saint like decorum and then at the bid from the pulpit stump out stepped mister Sprightly from the opposite spice wood grove and advanced with a step so smirky and dandyish as to create universal amazement and whispered demands Why who s that And some of his very people who were present as they told me did not know their preacher till his clear sharp voice came upon the hearing when they showed by the sudden lifting of hands and eyebrows how near they were to exclaiming Well I never Stepping on to the consecrated stump our friend without either preliminary hymn or prayer commenced thus My friends I only intend to say a few words in answer to the pious brother that s just sat down and shall not detain but a few minutes The pious brother took a good deal of time to tell what we soon found out ourselves that he never went to college and don t understand logic He boasts too of having no sheepskin to preach by but I allow any sensible buck sheep would have died powerful sorry if he d ever thought his hide would come to be handled by some preachers The skin of the knowingest old buck couldn t do some folks any good some things salt won t save I rather allow Johnny Calvin s boys and tother baby sprinklers ain t likely to have they idees physicked out of them by steam logic and doses of No six They can t be steamed up so high as to want cooling by a cold water plunge But I want to say a word about Sprightly s preachers because I have some slight acquaintance with that there gentleman and don t choose to have them all run down for nothing The pious brother brings several grave charges first they ride good horses Now don t every man woman and child in the Purchase know that Sprightly and his preachers have hardly any home and that they live on horseback The money most folks spend in land these men spend for a good horse and don t they need a good horse to stand mud and swim floods And is it any sin for a horse to be kept fat that does so much work The book says a merciful man is merciful to his beast and that we mustn t muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn Step round that fence corner and take a peep dear friends at a horse hung on the stake what s he like A wooden frame with a dry hide stretched over it What s he live on Ay that s the pint Well what s them buzzards after look at them sailing up there Now who owns that live carrion the pious brother that s just preached to us just now And I want to know if it wouldn t be better for him to give that dumb brute something to cover his bones before he talks against hunder dollur hossis and the like The next charge is wearing good clothes Friends don t all folks when they come to meeting put on their best clothes and wouldn t it be wrong if preachers came in old torn coats and dirty shirts It wouldn t do no how Well Sprightly and his preachers preach near about every day and oughtn t they always to look decent Take then a peep at the pious brother that makes this charge his coat is out at the elbow and has only three or four buttons left and his arm where he wipes his nose and mouth is shiny as a looking glass his trousers are crawling up to show he s got no stockings on and his face has got a crop of beard two weeks old and couldn t be cleaned by baby sprinklin yes look at them there matters and say if Sprightly s preachers ain t more like the apostles in decency than the pious brother is A word now about chickin fixins and doins And I say it would be a charity to give the pious brother sich a feed now and then for he looks half starved and savage as a meat ax and I advise that old hen out thare clucking up her brood not to come this way just now if she don t want all to disappear But I say that Sprightly s preachers are so much beliked in the Purchase that folks are always glad to see them and make a pint of giving them the best out of love an that s more than can be said for some folks here The pious brother says he only wants our souls then what makes him peddle about Thomsonian physic Why don t he and Campbell make steam and No six as free as preaching I read of a quack doctor once who used to give his advice free gratis for nothing to any one what would buy a box of his pills but as I see the pious brother is crawling round the fence to his anatomical horse and physical saddle bags I have nothing to say and so dear friends I bid you all good by Such was reverend Elder Sprightly who preached to us on Sabbath morning at the Camp Hence it is not remarkable that in common with many worthy persons he should think his talents properly employed in using up Johnny Calvin and his boys especially as no subject is better for popularity at a camp meeting He gave us accordingly first that affecting story of Calvin and Servetus in which the latter figured to day like a Christian Confessor and martyr and the former as a diabolical persecutor many moving incidents being introduced not found in history and many ingenious inferences and suppositions tending to blacken the Reformer s character Judging from the frequency of the deep groans loud amens and noisy hallelujahs of the congregation during the narrative had Calvin suddenly thrust in among us his hatchet face and goat s beard he would have been hissed and pelted nay possibly been lynched and soused in the branch while the excellent Servetus would have been toted on our shoulders and feasted in the tents on fried ham cold chicken fixins and horse sorrel pies Here is a specimen of mister S s mode of exciting triumphant exclamation amens groans et cetera against Calvin and his followers Dear sisters don t you love the tender little darling babes that hang on your parental bosoms amen Yes I know you do amen amen Yes I know I know it Amen amen hallelujah Now don t it make your parental hearts throb with anguish to think those dear infantile darlings might some day be out burning brush and fall into the flames and be burned to death deep groans Yes it does it does But oh sisters oh mothers how can you think your babes mightn t get religion and die and be burned for ever and ever O forbid amen groans But oho only think only think oh would you ever a had them darling infantile sucklings born if you had a known they were to be burned in a brush heap No no groans shrieks What what what if you had foreknown they must have gone to hell hoho hoho amen And does anybody think He is such a tyrant as to make spotless innocent babies just to damn them No in a voice of thunder No sisters no no mothers No no sinners no He ain t such a tyrant Let John Calvin burn torture and roast but He never foreordained babies as Calvin says to damnation damnation echoed by hundreds Hallelujah tis a free salvation Glory a free salvation Here mister S battered the rail of the pulpit with his fists and kicked the bottom with his feet many screamed some cried amen others groaned and hissed and more than a dozen females of two opposite colors arose and clapped their hands as if engaged in starching et cetera et cetera No h o tis a free a free a free salvation away with Calvin tis for all all ALL Yes shout it out clap on rejoice rejoice oho oho sinners sinners sinners oh ho oho et cetera et cetera Here was maintained for some minutes the most edifying uproar of shouting bellowing crying clapping and stamping mingled with hysterical laughing termed out there holy laughing and even dancing and barking called also holy till at the partial subsidence of the bedlam the orator resumed his eloquence It is singular mister S overlooked an objection to the divine Providence arising from his own illustration That children do sometimes perish by being burnt and drowned is undeniable yet is not their existence prevented and that in the very case where the sisters were induced to say they would have prevented their existence But in justice to mister S we must say that he seemed to have anticipated the objection and to have furnished the reply for said he in one part of his discourse God did not wish to foreknow some things But our friend s mode of avoiding a predestined death if such an absurdity be supposed deserves all praise for the facility and simplicity of the contrivance Let us said he for argument s sake grant that I the reverend Elder Sprightly am foreordained to be drowned in the river at Smith s Ferry next Thursday morning at twenty two minutes after ten o clock and suppose I know it and suppose I am a free moral voluntary accountable agent as Calvinists say do you think I m going to be drowned No I would stay at home all day and you ll never ketch the reverend Elder Sprightly at Smith s Ferry nor near the river neither Reader is it any wonder Calvinism is on the decline Logic it can stand but human nature thus excited in opposition it can not stand Hence throughout our vast assembly to day this unpopular ism in spite of Calvin and the Epistle to the Romans was put down if not by acclamation yet by exclamation by shouting by roaring by groaning and hissing by clapping and stamping by laughing and crying and whining and thus the end of the sermon was gained and the preacher glorified The introductory discourse in the afternoon was by the reverend Remarkable Novus This was a gentleman I had often the pleasure of entertaining at my house in Woodville and he was a Christian in sentiment and feeling for though properly and decidedly a warm friend to his own sect he was charitably disposed toward myself and others that differed from him ecclesiastically His talents were moderate but his voice was transcendently excellent It was rich deep mellow liquid and sonorous and capable of any inflections It could preserve its melody in an unruffled flow at a pitch far beyond the highest point reached by the best cultivated voice His fancy naturally capricious was indulged without restraint yet not being a learned or well read man he mistook words for ideas and hence employed without stint all the terms in his vocabulary for the commonest thoughts He believed too like most of his brotherhood that excitement and agitation were necessary to conversion and of the essence of religion and this with a proneness to delight in the music and witchery of his own wonderful voice made mister Novus an eccentric preacher and induced him often to excel at camp meetings the very extravagances of his clerical brethren whom more than once he has ridiculed and condemned at my fireside The camp meeting was in fact too great a temptation for my friend s temperament and the very theater for the full display of his magnificent voice and naturally this afternoon off he set at a tangent interrupting the current of his sermon by extemporaneous bursts of warning entreaty and exhortation Here is something like his discourse yet done by me in a subdued tone as I repeat are most extravaganzas of the ecclesiastical and spiritual sort not only here but in all other parts of the work My text dear hearers said he on this auspicious and solemn and heaven ordered occasion is that exhortation of the inspired apostle Walk worthy of your vocation And what my dear brethren what do you imagine and conjecture our holy penman meant by walking Think ye he meant a physical walking and a moving and a going backward and forward thus represented by mister N s proceeding or rather marching a la militaire several times from end to end of the staging No sirs it was not a literal walking and locomotion a moving and agitating of the natural legs and limbs No sirs no but it was a moral a spiritual a religious ay yes a philosophical and metaphorically figurative walking our holy apostle meant Philosophic did I say Yes philosophic did I say For religion is the most philosophical thing in the universe ay throughout the whole expansive infinitude of the divine empire Tell me deluded infidels and mistaken unbelievers tell me ain t philosophy what s according to the consistency of nature s regular laws and what s more onsentaneous and homogeneous to man s sublimated moral nature than religion Yes tell me Yes yes I am for a philosophical religion and a philosophical religion is for me ay we are mutually made and formed for this beautiful reciprocality And yet some say we make too much noise even some of our respected Woodville merchants meaning the author But what s worth making a noise about in the dark mundane of our terrestrial sphere if religion ain t People always and everywhere in all places make most noise about what they opine to be most precious See yon banner streaming with golden stars and glorious stripes over congregated troops on the Fourth of July that ever memorable that never to be forgotten day which celebrates the grand annual anniversary of our nation s liberty and independence when our forefathers and ancestors burst asunder and tore forever off the iron chains of political thraldom and rose in plenitude ay in the magnificence of their grandeur and crushed their oppressors yes and hurled down dark despotism from the lofty pinnacle of its summit altitude where she was seated on her liberty crushing throne and hurled her out of her iron chariot as her wheels thundered over the prostrate slaves of power Amen Yes hark we make a noise about that But what s civil liberty to religious liberty and emancipated disenthraldom from the dark despotism of yonder terrific prince of darkness whose broad black piniony wings spread wide o er the aerial concave like a dense cloud upon a murky sky A a men And ain t it ye men of yards and measures philosophical to make a noise about this Amen yes Yes yes and I ain t ashamed to rejoice and shout aloud Ay as long as the prophet was ordered to stamp with his foot I will stamp with my foot here he stamped till the platform trembled for its safety and to smite with his hand I will smite with my hand slapping alternate hands on alternate thighs Yes and I will shout too and cry aloud and spare not glory for ever and here his voice rang out like the sweet clear tones of a bugle And therefore my dear sisters and brethren let us walk worthy of our vocation not with the natural legs of the physical corporation but in the apostolical way with the metaphysical and figurative legs of the mind here mister N caught some one smiling Take care sinner take care curl not the scornful nose I m willing to be a fool for religion s sake but turn not up the scornful nose do its ministers no harm Sinner mark me in yon deep and tangled grove where tall aspiring trees wave green and lofty heads in the free air of balmy skies there sinner an hour ago when the sonorous horn called on our embattled hosts to go to private prayer an hour ago in yonder grove I knelt and prayed for you hooh yes I prayed some poor soul might be given for my hire and he promised me one Glory glory ah give him one laughing sinner take care I ll have you Grant it amen ooohoo Look out I m going to fire assuming the attitude of rifle shooting bang may He send that through your heart may it pierce clean home through joints and marrow and let all people say amen and here amen was said and not in the tame style of the American Archbishop of Canterbury s cathedral be assured but whether the spiritual bullet hit the chap aimed at I never learned if it did his groans were inaudible in the alarming thunder of that amen Ay ay that s the way that s the way don t be ashamed of your vocation that s the way to walk and let your light shine Now some wise folks despise light and call for miracles but when we can t have one kind of light let us be philosophical and take another For my part when I m bogging about these dark woods far away in the silent somber shadows I rejoice in sunshine and would prefer it of choice rather than all other celestial and translucent luminaries but when the gentle fanning zephyrs of the shadowy night breathe soft among the trembling leaves and sprays of the darkening forests then I rejoice in moonshine and when the moonshine dims and pales away with the waning silvery queen of heaven in her azure zone I look up to the blue concave of the circular vault and rejoice in starlight No no NO any light give us any light rather than none Ah do good Yes yes we are the light of the world and so let us let our light shine whether sunshine or moonshine or starlight oohoo and then the poor benighted sinner bogging about this terraqueous but dark and mundane sphere will have a light like a pole star of the distant north to point and guide him to the sunlit climes of yonder world of bright and blazing bliss A a amen Such is part of the sermon His concluding prayer ended thus Divine names omitted Oh come down come come down down now to night do wonders then come down in might come down in power let salvation roll Come down come and let the earthquaking mighty noise of thy thundering chariot wheels be heard and felt and seen and experienced in the warring elements of our spiritualized hearts During the prayer many petitions and expressions were so rapturously and decidedly encored that our friend kindly repeated them and sometimes like public singers with handsome variations and many petitions by amateur zealots were put forth without any notice of the current prayer offered by mister N yet evidently having in view some elegancy of his sermon And not a few petitions I regret to say seemed to misapprehend the drift and scope of the preacher One of this sort was the earnest ejaculations of an old and worthy brother who in a hollow sepulchral and rather growly voice bellowed out in a very beautiful part of the grand prayer Oohhoo take away moonshine But our first performance was to be at night and at the first toot of the tin horn we assembled in expectation of a good time For one All day preparation had been making for the night and the actors seemed evidently in restraint as in mere rehearsal two The night better suits displays and scenes of any kind but three The African was to preach and rumor had said he was a most powerful big preacher that could stir up folks mighty quick and use up the ole feller in less than no time After prefatory prayers and hymns and pithy exhortations by several brothers of the Circassian breed our dusky divine the reverend Mizraim Ham commenced his sermon founded on the duel between David and Goliath This discourse we shall condense into a few pages although the comedy or mellow drama for it greatly mellowed and relaxed the muscles required for its entire action a full hour There was indeed a prologue but the rest was mainly dialogue in which mister Ham wonderfully personated all the different speakers varying his tone manner attitude et cetera as varying characters and circumstances demanded We fear much of the spirit has evaporated in this condensation but that evil is unavoidable reverend MIZRAIM HAM S DISCOURSE Bruthurn and sisturn tention if you pleases while I want you for to understand this here battul most partiklur zact or may be you moughtn t

on with your old irun pot hat on you ll git belly full mighty quick You nasty leetle raskul I ll kum and kill you dead as chopped sassudge Here the preacher represented the advance of the parties and gave a florid and wonderfully effective description of the closing act partly by words and partly by pantomime exhibiting innumerable marches and counter marches to get to windward and all the postures and gestures and defiances till at last he personated David putting his hand into a bag for a stone and then making his cotton handkerchief into a sling he whirled it with fury half a dozen times around his head and then let fly with much skill at Goliath and at the same instant halloing with the frenzy of a madman Hurraw for lilly Davy At that cry he with his left hand struck himself a violent slap on the forehead to represent the blow of the sling stone hitting the giant and then in person of Goliath he dropped quasi dead upon the platform amid the deafening plaudits of the congregation all of whom some spiritually some sympathetically and some carnally took up the preacher s triumph shout Hurraw for lilly Davy How the reverend Mizraim Ham made his exit from the boards I could not see perhaps he rolled or crawled off But he did not suffer decapitation like ole Golly since in ten minutes his woolly pate suddenly popped up among the other sacred heads that were visible over the front railing of the rostrum as all kept moving to and fro in the wild tossings of religious frenzy Scarcely had mister Ham fallen at his post when a venerable old warrior with matchless intrepidity stepped into the vacated spot and without a sign of fear carried on the contest against the Arch Fiend whose great ally had been so recently overthrown i e Goliath not mister Ham Yet excited as evidently was this veteran he still could not forego his usual introduction stating how old he was where he was born where he obtained religion how long he had been a preacher how many miles he had traveled in a year and when he buried his wife all of which edifying truths were received with the usual applauses of a devout and enlightened assembly But this introduction over which did not occupy more than fifteen or twenty minutes he began his attack in fine style waxing louder and louder as he proceeded till he exceeded all the old gentlemen to holler I ever heard and indeed old ladies either EXTRACT FROM HIS DISCOURSE Yes sinners you ll all have to fall and be knock d down some time or nuther like the great giant we ve heern tell on when the Lord s sarvints come and fight agin you Oho sinner sinner oh I hope you may be knock d down to night now this moment and afore you die and go to judgment Yes oho yes oh I say judgment for it s appinted once to die and then the judgment oho oh And what a time ther ll be then You ll see all these here trees and them are stars and yonder silver moon afire and all the alliments a meltin and runnin down with fervent heat ah I have elsewhere stated that the unlearned preachers out there are by the vulgar not the poor but the vulgar supposed to be more favored in preaching than man made preachers and that the sign of an unlearned preacher s inspiration being in full blast is his inhalations which puts an ah to the end of sentences members words and even exclamations till his breath is all gone and no more can be sucked in Oho hoah fervent heat ah and the trumpit a soundin ah and the dead arisin ah and all on us a flyin ah to be judged ah O hoah sinner sinner sinner sinner ah And what do I see away thar ah down the Mississippi ah thar s a man jist done a killin ah another ah and up he goes with his bloody dagger ah And what s that I see to the East ah where proud folks live clothed in purple ah and fine linen ah I see em round a table a drinkin a decoction of Indian herb ah and up they go with cups in thar hands ah and see ohoah see in yonder doggery some a dancin ah and fiddlin ah and up they go ah with cards ah and fiddle ah et cetera et cetera Here the tempest around drowned the voice of the old hero although from the frantic violence of his gestures the frightful distortion of his features and the Pythonic foam of his mouth he was plainly blazing away at the enemy The uproar however so far subsided as to allow my hearing his closing exhortation which was this Yes I say fall down fall down all of you on your knees shout cry aloud spare not stamp with the foot smite with the hand down down that s it down brethren down preachers down sisters pray away take it by storm fire away fire away not one at a time not two together ah a single shot the devil will dodge ah give it to him all at once fire a whole platoon at him And then such platoon firing as followed If Satan stood that he can stand much more than the worthy folks thought he could And indeed the effect was wonderful more than forty thoughtless sinners that came for fun and twice as many backsliders were instantly knocked over and there all lay some with violent jerkings and writhings of body and some uttering the most piercing and dismaying shrieks and groans The fact is I was nearly knocked down myself You mister Carlton Yes indeed but not by the hail of spiritual shot falling so thick around me it was by a sudden rush towards my station where I stood mounted on a stump And this rush was occasioned by a wish to see a stout fellow lying on the straw in the pen a little to my left groaning and praying and yet kicking and pummelling away as if scuffling with a sturdy antagonist Near him were several men and women at prayer and one or more whispering into his ear while on a small stump above stood a person superintending the contest and so as to insure victory to the right party Now the prostrate man who like a spirited tom cat seemed to fight best on his back was no other than our celebrated New Purchase bully Rowdy Bill And this being reported through the congregation the rush had taken place by which I was so nearly overturned I contrived however to regain my stand shared indeed now with several others we hugging one another and standing on tip toes and our necks elongated as possible and thus we managed to have a pretty fair view of matters About this time the Superintendent in a very loud voice cried out Let him alone brothers let him alone sisters keep on praying it s a hard fight the devil s got a tight grip yet He don t want to lose poor Bill but he ll let go soon Bill s gittin the better on him fast Pray away Rowdy Bill be it known was famous as a gouger and so expert was he in his antioptical vocation that in a few moments he usually bored out an antagonist s eyes or made him cry peccavi Indeed could he on the present occasion have laid hold of his unseen foe s head spiritually we mean he would figuratively of course soon have caused him to ease off or let go entirely his metaphorical grip So however thought one friend in the assembly Bill s wife For Bill was a man after her own heart and she often said that with fair play she sentimentally allowed her Bill could lick ary a man in the varsal world and his weight in wild cats to boot Hence the kind hearted creature hearing that Bill was actually fighting with the evil one had pressed in from the outskirts to see fair play but now hearing Bill was in reality down and apparently undermost and above all the words of the Superintendent declaring that the fiend had a tight grip of the poor fellow her excitement would no longer be controlled and collecting her vocal energies she screamed out her common exhortation to Bill and which when heeded had heretofore secured him immediate victories Gouge him Billy gouge him Billy gouge him This spirited exclamation was instantly shouted by Bill s cronies and partizans mischievously maybe for we have no right to judge of men s motives in meetings but a few friends doubtless of the old fellow cried out in very irreverent tone Bite him devil bite him Upon which the faithful wife in a tone of voice that beggars description reiterated her Gouge him et cetera in which she was again joined by her husband s allies and that to the alarm of his invisible foe for Bill now rose to his knees and on uttering some mystic jargon symptomatic of conversion he was said to have got religion and then all his new friends and spiritual guides united in fresh prayers and shouts of thanksgiving It was now very late at night and joining a few other citizens of Woodville we were soon in our saddles and buried in the darkness of the forest For a long time however the uproar of the spiritual elements at the camp continued at intervals to swell and diminish on the hearing and often came a yell that rose far above the united din of other screams and outcries Nay at the distance of nearly two miles could be distinguished a remarkable and sonorous oh like the faintly heard explosion of a mighty elocutional class practising under a master And yet my comrades who had heard this peculiar cry more than once all declared that this wonderful oh ing was performed by the separate voice of our townsman Eolus Letherlung esquire CONCLUSION A camp meeting of this sort is all things considered the very best contrivance for making the largest number of converts in the shortest possible time and also for enlarging most speedily the bounds of a Church Visible and Militant A RHYME FOR CHRISTMAS BY JOHN CHALLING Publication delayed by the author s determined but futile attempt to find the rhyme If Browning only were here This yule ish time o the year This mule ish time o the year Stubbornly still refusing To add to the rhymes we ve been using Since the first Christmas glee One might say chantingly Rendered by rudest hinds Of the pelt clad shepherding kinds Who didn t know Song from b U double l s foot Pah Haply the old Egyptian ptah Though I d hardly wager a baw Bee or a bumble for that And that s flat But the thing that I want to get at Is a rhyme for Christmas Nay nay nay nay not isthmus The t and the h sounds covertly are Gnawing the nice auracular Senses until one may hear them gnar And the terminal too for m a s is m u s So that will not do for us Try for it sigh for it cry for it die for it O but if Browning were here to apply for it He d rhyme you Christmas He d make a mist pass Over something o ruther Or find you the rhyme s very brother In lovers that kissed fast To baffle the moon as he d lose the t final In fas t as it blended with to mark the spinal Elision tip clipt as exquisitely nicely And hyper exactingly sliced to precisely The extremest technical need Or he d twist glass Or he d have a kissed lass Or shake neath our noses some great giant fist mass No matter If Robert were here he could do it Though it took us till Christmas next year to see through it MY CIGARETTE one BY CHARLES F LUMMIS My cigarette The amulet That charms afar unrest and sorrow The magic wand that far beyond To day can conjure up to morrow Like love s desire thy crown of fire So softly with the twilight blending And ah meseems a poet s dreams Are in thy wreaths of smoke ascending My cigarette Can I forget How Kate and I in sunny weather Sat in the shade the elm tree made And rolled the fragrant weed together I at her side beatified To hold and guide her fingers willing She rolling slow the paper s snow Putting my heart in with the

My dreams so fair that used to be The promises of youth s bright clime So changed alas come back to me Sweet memories of that hopeful time Before I learned with doubt oppressed There are no birds in next year s nest The seed I sowed in fragrant spring The summer s sun to vivify With his warm kisses ripening To golden harvest by and by Got caught by drought like all the rest There are no birds in next year s nest The stock I bought at eighty nine Broke down next day to twenty eight Some squatters jumped my silver mine My own convention smashed my slate No more in futures I ll invest There are no birds in next year s nest THE DUBIOUS FUTURE BY BILL NYE Without wishing to alarm the American people or create a panic I desire briefly and seriously to discuss the great question Whither are we drifting and what is to be the condition of the coming man We can not shut our eyes to the fact that mankind is passing through a great era of change even womankind is not built as she was a few brief years ago And is it not time fellow citizens that we pause to consider what is to be the future of the American Food itself has been the subject of change both in the matter of material and preparation This must affect the consumer in such a way as to some day bring about great differences Take for instance the oyster one of our comparatively modern food and game fishes and watch the effects of science upon him At one time the oyster browsed around and ate what he could find in Neptune s back yard and we had to eat him as we found him Now we take a herd of oysters off the trail all run down and feed them artificially till they swell up to a fancy size and bring a fancy price Where will this all lead at last I ask as a careful scientist Instead of eating apples as Adam did we work the fruit up into apple jack and pie while even the simple oyster is perverted and instead of being allowed to fatten up in the fall on acorns and ancient mariners spurious flesh is put on his bones by the artificial osmose and dialysis of our advanced civilization How can you make an oyster stout or train him down by making him jerk a health lift so many hours every day or cultivate his body at the expense of his mind without ultimately not only impairing the future usefulness of the oyster himself but at the same time affecting the future of the human race who feed upon him I only use the oyster as an illustration and I do not wish to cause alarm but I say that if we stimulate the oyster artificially and swell him up by scientific means we not only do so at the expense of his better nature and keep him away from his family but we are making our mark on the future race of men Oyster fattening is now of course in its infancy Only a few years ago an effort was made at saint Louis to fatten cove oysters while in the can but the system was not well understood and those who had it in charge only succeeded in making the can itself more plump But now oysters are kept on ground feed and given nothing to do for a few weeks and even the older and overworked sway backed and rickety oysters of the dim and murky past are made to fill out and many of them have to put a gore in the waistband of their shells I only speak of the oyster incidentally as one of the objects toward which science has turned its attention and I assert with the utmost confidence that the time will come unless science should get a set back when the present hunting case oyster will give place to the open face oyster grafted on the octopus and big enough to feed a hotel Further than that the oyster of the future will carry in a hip pocket a flask of vinegar half a dozen lemons and two little Japanese bottles one of which will contain salt and the other pepper and there will be some way provided by which you can tell which is which But are we improving the oyster now That is a question we may well ask ourselves Is this a healthy fat which we are putting on him or is it bloat And what will be the result in the home life of the oyster We take him from all domestic influences whatever in order to make a swell of him by our modern methods but do we improve his condition morally and what is to be the great final result on man The reader will see by the questions I ask that I am a true scientist Give me an overcoat pocket full of lower case interrogation marks and a medical report to run to and I can speak on the matter of science and advancement till Reason totters on her throne But food and oysters do not alone affect the great pregnant future Our race is being tampered with not only by means of adulterations political combinations and climatic changes but even our methods of relaxation are productive of peculiar physical conditions malformations and some more things of the same kind Cigarette smoking produces a flabby and endogenous condition of the optic nerve and constant listening at a telephone always with the same ear decreases the power of the other ear till it finally just stands around drawing its salary but actually refusing to hear anything Carrying an eight pound cane makes a man lopsided and the muscular and nervous strain that is necessary to retain a single eyeglass in place and keep it out of the soup year after year draws the mental stimulus that should go to the thinker itself until at last the mind wanders away and forgets to come back or becomes atrophied and the great mental strain incident to the work of pounding sand or coming in when it rains is more than it is equal to Playing billiards accompanied by the vicious habit of pounding on the floor with the butt of the cue ever and anon produces at last optical illusions phantasmagoria and visions of pink spiders with navy blue abdomens Baseball is not alone highly injurious to the umpire but it also induces crooked fingers bone spavin and hives among habitual players Jumping the rope induces heart disease Poker is unduly sedentary in its nature Bicycling is highly injurious especially to skittish horses Boating induces malaria Lawn tennis can not be played in the house Archery is apt to be injurious to those who stand around and watch the game and pugilism is a relaxation that jars heavily on some natures Foot ball produces what may be called the endogenous or ingrowing toenail stringhalt and mania Copenhagen induces a melancholy and the game of bean bag is unduly exciting Horse racing is too brief and transitory as an outdoor game requiring weeks and months for preparation and lasting only long enough for a quick person to ejaculate Scat The pitcher s arm is a new disease the outgrowth of base ball the lawn tennis elbow is another result of a popular open air amusement and it begins to look as though the coming American would hear with one overgrown telephonic ear while the other will be rudimentary only He will have an abnormal base ball arm with a lawn tennis elbow a powerful foot ball kicking leg with the superior toe driven back into the palm of his foot He will have a highly trained biceps muscle over his eye to retain his glass and that eye will be trained to shoot a curved glance over a high hat and witness anything on the stage Other features grow abnormal or shrink up from the lack of use as a result of our customs For instance the man whose business it is to get along a crowded street with the utmost speed will have finally a hard sharp horn growing on each elbow and a pair of spurs growing out of each ankle These will enable him to climb over a crowd and get there early Constant exposure to these weapons on the part of the pedestrian will harden the walls of the thorax and abdomen until the coming man will be an impervious man The citizen who avails himself of all modern methods of conveyance will ride from his door on the horse car to the elevated station where an elevator will elevate him to the train and a revolving platform will swing him on board or possibly the street car will be lifted from the surface track to the elevated track and the passenger will retain his seat all the time Then a man will simply hang out a red card like an express card at his door and a combination car will call for him take him to the nearest elevated station elevate him car and all to the track take him where he wants to go and call for him at any hour of the night to bring him home He will do his exercising at home chiefly taking artificial sea baths jerking a rowing machine or playing on a health lift till his eyes hang out on his cheeks and he need not do any walking whatever In that way the coming man will be over developed above the legs and his lower limbs will look like the desolate stems of a frozen geranium Eccentricities of limb will be handed over like baldness from father to son among the dwellers in the cities where every advantage in the way of rapid transit is to be had until a metropolitan will be instantly picked out by his able digestion and rudimentary legs just as we now detect the gentleman from the interior by his wild endeavors to overtake an elevated train In fact mister Edison has now perfected or announced that he is on the road to the perfection of a machine which I may be pardoned for calling a storage think tank This will enable a brainy man to sit at home and with an electric motor and a perfected phonograph he can think into a tin dipper or funnel which will by the aid of electricity and a new style of foil record and preserve his ideas on a sheet of soft metal so that when any one says to him A penny for your thoughts he can go to his valise and give him a piece of his mind Thus the man who has such wild and beautiful thoughts in the night and never can hold on to them long enough to turn on the gas and get his writing materials can set this thing by the head of his bed and when the poetic thought comes to him in the stilly night he can think into a hopper and the genius of Franklin and Edison together will enable him to fire it back at his friends in the morning while they eat their pancakes and glucose syrup from Vermont or he can mail the sheet of tinfoil to absent friends who may put it into their phonographs and utilize it In this way the world may harness the gray matter of its best men and it will be no uncommon thing to see a dozen brainy men tied up in a row in the back office of an intellectual syndicate dropping pregnant thoughts into little electric coffee mills for a couple of hours a day after which they can put on their coats draw their pay and go home All this will reduce the quantity of exercise both mental and physical Two men with good brains could do the thinking for sixty million of people and feel perfectly fresh and rested the next day Take four men we will say two to do the day thinking and two more to go on deck at night and see how much time the rest of the world would have to go fishing See how politics would become simplified Conventions primaries bargains and sales campaign bitterness and vituperation all might be wiped out A pair of political thinkers could furnish one hundred million of people with logical conclusions enough to last them through the campaign and put an unbiased opinion into a man s house each day for less than he now pays for gas Just before election you could go into your private office throw in a large dose of campaign whisky light a campaign cigar fasten your buttonhole to the wall by an elastic band so that there would be a gentle pull on it and turn the electricity on your mechanical thought supply It would save time and money and the result would be the same as it is now This would only be the beginning of course and after a while every qualified voter who did not feel like exerting himself so much need only give his name and proxy to the salaried thinker employed by the National Think Retort and Supply Works We talk a great deal about the union of church and state but that is not so dangerous after all as the mixture of politics and independent thought Will the coming voter be an automatic legless hairless mollusk with an abnormal ear constantly glued to the tube of a big tank full of symmetrical ideas furnished by a national bureau of brains in the employ of the party in power UTAH BY EUGENE FIELD Bowed was the old man s snow white head A troubled look was on his face Why come you sir I gently said Unto this solemn burial place I come to weep a while for one Whom in her life I held most dear Alas her sands were quickly run And now she lies a sleeping here Oh tell me of your precious wife For she was very dear I know It must have been a blissful life You led with her you treasure so My wife is mouldering in the ground In yonder house she s spinning now And lo this moment may be found A driving home the family cow And see she s standing at the stile And leans from out the window wide And loiters on the sward a while Her forty babies by her side Old man you must be mad I cried Or else you do but jest with me How is it that your wife has died And yet can here and living be How is it while she drives the cow She s hanging out her window wide And loiters as you said just now With forty babies by her side The old man raised his snowy head I have a sainted wife in Heaven I am a Mormon sir he said My sainted wife on earth are seven TALK BY JOHN PAUL It seems to me that talk should be Like water sprinkled sparingly Then ground that late lay dull and dried Smiles up at you revivified And flowers of speech touched by the dew Put forth fresh root and bud anew But I m not sure that any flower

drifts vanish And then the grass is gone JACK BALCOMB S PLEASANT WAYS BY MEREDITH NICHOLSON There comes a time in the life of young men when their college fraternity pins lie forgotten in the collar button box and the spiking of freshmen ceases to be a burning issue Tippecanoe was one of the few freshwater colleges that barred women but this was not its only distinction for its teaching was sound its campus charming and the town of which it was the chief ornament a quiet place noted from the beginning of things for its cultivated people It is no longer so very laudable for a young man to pay his way through college and Morris Leighton had done this easily and without caring to be praised or martyrized for doing so He had enjoyed his college days he had been popular with town and gown and he had managed to get his share of undergraduate fun while leading his classes He had helped in the college library he had twisted the iron letter press on the president s correspondence late into the night he had copied briefs for a lawyer after hours but he had pitched for the nine and hustled for his frat and he had led class rushes with ardor and success He had now been for several years in the offices of Knight Kittredge and Carr at Mariona only an hour s ride from Tippecanoe and he still kept in touch with the college Michael Carr fully appreciated a young man who took the law seriously and who could sit down in a court room on call mornings when need be and turn off a demurrer without paraphrasing it from a text book missus Carr too found Morris Leighton useful and she liked him because he always responded unquestioningly to any summons to fill up a blank at her table and if mister Carr was reluctant at the last minute to attend a lecture on Egyptian Burial Customs missus Carr could usually summon Morris Leighton by telephone in time to act as her escort Young men were at a premium in Mariona as in most other places and it was something to have one of the species of an accommodating turn and very presentable within telephone range missus Carr was grateful and so it must be said was her husband who did not care to spend his evenings digging up Egyptians that had been a long time dead or listening to comic operas It was through missus Carr that Leighton came to be well known in Mariona she told her friends to ask him to call and there were now many homes besides hers that he visited It sometimes occurred to Morris Leighton that he was not getting ahead in the world very fast He knew that his salary from Carr was more than any other young lawyer of his years earned by independent practice but it seemed to him that he ought to be doing better He had not drawn on his mother s small resources since his first year at college he had made his own way and a little more but he experienced moments of restlessness in which the difficulties of establishing himself in his profession loomed large and formidable An errand to a law firm in one of the fashionable new buildings that had lately raised the Mariona sky line led him one afternoon past the office of his college classmate Jack Balcomb J Arthur Balcomb was the inscription on the door Suite B Room one Leighton had seen little of Balcomb for a year or more and his friend s name on the ground glass door arrested his eye Two girls were busily employed at typewriters in the anteroom and one of them extended a blank card to Morris and asked him for his name The girl disappeared into the inner room and came back instantly followed by Balcomb who seized Morris s hand dragged him in and closed the door Well old man Balcomb shouted I m glad to see you It s downright pleasant to have a fellow come in occasionally and feel no temptation to take his watch Sink into yonder soft yielding leather and allow me to offer you one of these plutocratic perfectos Only the elect get these I can tell you In that drawer there I keep a brand made out of car waste and hemp rope that does very well for ordinary commercial sociability Got a match All right smoke up and tell me what you re doing to make the world a better place to live in as old Prexy used to say at college I m digging at the law at the same old stand I can t say that I m flourishing like Jonah s gourd as you seem to be Morris cast his eyes over the room which was handsomely furnished There was a good rug on the floor and the desk and table were of heavy oak an engraving of Thomas Jefferson hung over Balcomb s desk and on the opposite side of the room was a table covered with financial reference books Well I tell you old man declared Balcomb you ve got to fool all the people all the time these days to make it go Those venerable whiskers around town whine about the good old times and how a young man s got to go slow but sure There s nothing in it and they wouldn t be in it either if they had to start in again no siree What is your game just now Jack if it isn t impertinent It s hard to keep track of you I remember very well that you started in to learn the wholesale drug business Oh tush don t refer to that an thou lovest me That is one of the darkest pages of my life Those people down there in South High Street thought I was a jay and they sent me out to help the shipping clerk Wouldn t that jar you Overalls and a hand truck Wow I couldn t get out of that fast enough Then you know I went to Chicago and spent a year in a broker s office and I guess I learned a few up there Oh rather They sent me into the country to sell mining stock and I made a record They kept the printing presses going overtime to keep me supplied Say they got afraid of me I was too good He stroked his vandyke beard complacently and flicked the ash from his cigar What s your line now Real estate mortgages lending money to the poor How do you classify yourself You do me a cruel wrong Morris a cruel wrong You read my sign on the outer wall Well that s a bluff There s nothing in real estate per se as old Doc Bridges used to say at college And the loan business has all gone to the bad people are too rich farmers are rolling in real money and have it to lend There was nothing for little Willie in petty brokerages I m scheming promoting and I take my slice off of everything that passes That certainly sounds well You ve learned fast You had an ambition to be a poet when you were in college I think I still have a few pounds of your verses in my traps somewhere Balcomb threw up his head and laughed in self pity I believe I was bitten with the literary tarantula for a while but I ve lived it down I hope Prexy used to predict a bright literary future for me in those days You remember when I made Phi Beta Kappa how he took both my hands and wept over me Balcomb he says you re an honor to the college I suppose he d weep again if he knew I d only forgotten about half the letters of the Greek alphabet left them as one might say several thousand parasangs to the rear in my mad race for daily sustenance Well I may not leave any vestiges on the sands of time but please God I shan t die hungry not if I keep my health Dear old Prexy He was a nice old chump though a trifle somnolent in his chapel talks Well we needn t pull the planks out of the bridge we ve crossed on I got a lot out of college that I m grateful for They did their best for us said Morris Oh yes it was well enough but if I had it to do over Tippecanoe wouldn t see me not much It isn t what you learn in college it s the friendships you make and all that sort of thing that counts A western man ought to go east to college and rub up against eastern fellows The atmosphere at the freshwater colleges is pretty jay Fred Waters left Tippecanoe and went to Yale and got in with a lot of influential fellows down there chaps whose fathers are in big things in New York Fred has a fine position now just through his college pull and first thing you know he ll pick up an heiress and be fixed for life Fred s a winner all right He s also an ass said Leighton I remember him of old An ass of the large gray and long eared species I ll grant you that all right enough but look here old man you ve got to overlook the fact that a fellow occasionally lifts his voice and brays Man does not live by the spirit alone he needs bread and bread s getting hard to get I ve noticed it replied Leighton who had covered all this ground before in talks with Balcomb and did not care to go into it further And then you remember Balcomb went on in enjoyment of his own reminiscences I wooed the law for a while But I guess what I learned wouldn t have embarrassed Chancellor Kent I really had a client once I didn t see a chance of getting one any other way so I hired him He was a coon I employed him for two dollars to go to the Grand Opera House and buy a seat in the orchestra when Sir Henry Irving was giving The Merchant of Venice He went to sleep and snored and they threw him out with rude insolent and angry hands after the second act and I brought suit against the management for damages basing my claim on the idea that they had spurned my dusky brother on account of his race color and previous condition of servitude The last clause was a joke He had never done any work in his life except for the state He was a very sightly coon too now that I recall him The show was as I said The Merchant of Venice and I ll leave it to anybody if my client wasn t at least as pleasing to the eye as Sir Henry in his Shylock togs I suppose if it had been Othello race feeling would have run so high that Sir Henry would hardly have escaped lynching Well to return My client got loaded on gin about the time the case came up on demurrer and gave the snap away and I dropped out of the practice to avoid being disbarred And it was just as well My landlord had protested against my using the office at night for poker purposes so I passed up the law and sought the asphodel fields of promotion Les affaires font l homme as old Professor Garneau used to say at college So here I am and I m glad I shook the law I d got tired of eating coffee and rolls at the Berlin bakery three times a day Why Morris old man he went on volubly there were days when the loneliness in my office grew positively oppressive You may remember that room I had in the old Adams and Harper Block It gave upon a courtyard where the rats from a livery stable came to disport themselves on rainy days I grew to be a dead shot with the flobert rifle but lawsy there s mighty little consideration for true merit in this world Just because I winged a couple of cheap hack horses one day when my nerves weren t steady the livery people made me stop and one of my fellow tenants in the old rookery threatened to have me arrested for conducting a shooting gallery without a license He was a dentist and he said the snap of the rifle worried his victims The two typewriting machines outside clicked steadily Some one knocked at the door Come in shouted Balcomb One of the typewriter operators entered with a brisk air of business and handed a telegram to Balcomb who tore it open nonchalantly As he read it he tossed the crumpled envelope over his shoulder in an absent minded way By Jove he exclaimed slapping his leg as though the news were important Then to the girl who waited with note book and pencil in hand Never mind don t wait I ll dictate the answer later How did it work he asked turning to Leighton who had been looking over the books on the table How did what work The fake It was a fake telegram That girl s trained to bring in a message every time I have a caller If the caller stays thirty minutes it s two messages in other words I m on a fifteen minute schedule I tip a boy in the telegraph office to keep me supplied with blanks It s a great scheme There s nothing like a telegram to create the impression that your office is a seething caldron of business Old Prexy was in town the other day I don t suppose he ever got a dose of electricity in his life unless he had been sorely bereft of a member of his family and was summoned to the funeral baked meats Say he must have thought I had a private wire Leighton sat down and fanned himself with his hat You ll be my death yet You have the cheek of a nice fresh new baggage check Balcomb Your cigar isn t burning well Morris Won t you try another No I like my guests to be comfortable I m comfortable enough I m even entertained Go ahead and let me see the rest of the show Oh we haven t exactly a course of stunts here Those are nice girls out there I ve broken them of the chewing gum habit and they can answer anxious inquiries at the door now without danger of strangulation They seem speedy on the machine Your correspondence must be something vast Um yes It has to be Every cheap skate of a real estate man keeps one stenographer My distinction is that I keep two They re easy advertising Now that little one in the pink shirt waist that brought in the message from Mars a moment ago is a wonder of intelligence Do you know what she s doing now Trying to break the machine I should guess from the racket Bah It s the Lord s Prayer You mean it s a sort of prayer machine Not on your life Maude hasn t any real work to do just now and she s running off the Lord s Prayer I know by the way it clicks When she strikes our daily bread the machine always gives a little gasp See The rule of the office is that they must have some diddings doing all the time The big one with red hair is a perfect marvel at the Declaration of Independence She ll be through addressing circulars in a little while and will run off into All men are created equal a blooming lie by the way without losing a stroke You have passed the poetry stage beyond a doubt But I should think the strain of keeping all this going would be wearing on your sensitive poetical nature And it must cost something Oh yes Balcomb pursed his lips and stroked his fine soft beard But it s worth it I m not playing for small stakes I m looking for Christmas trees Now they ve got their eyes on me These old Elijahs that have been the bone and sinew of the town for so long that they think they own it are about done for You can t sit in a bank here any more and look solemn and turn people down because your corn hurts or because the chinch bugs have got into the wheat in Dakota or the czar has bought the heir apparent a new toy pistol You ve got to present a smiling countenance to the world and give the glad hand to everybody you re likely to need in your business I jolly everybody That comes easy for you but I didn t know you could make an asset of it It s part of my working capital Now you d better cut loose from old man Carr and move up here and get a suite near me I ve got more than I can do I m always needing a lawyer organizing companies legality of bonds and so on Dignified work Lots of out of town people come here and I ll put you in touch with them I threw a good thing to Van Cleve only the other day Bond foreclosure suit for some fellows in the East that I sell stuff to They wrote and asked me the name of a good man I thought of you old college days and all that but Van Cleve had just done me a good turn and I had to let him have it But you d better come over You ll never know the world s in motion in that musty old hole of Carr s You get timid and afraid to go near the water by staying on shore so long But say Morris you seem to be getting along pretty well in the social push Your name looks well in the society column How do you work it anyhow Don t expect me to give the snap away The secret s valuable And I m not really inside I am only peering through the pickets Tush Get thee hence I saw you in a box at the theater the other night evidently missus Carr s party There s nothing like mixing business with pleasure Ah me He yawned and stroked his beard and laughed with a fine showing of white teeth I don t see what s pricking you with small pins of envy You were there with about the gayest crowd I ever saw at a theater and it looked like your own party Don t say a word implored Balcomb putting out his hand Members of the board of managers of the state penitentiary their wives their cousins and their aunts Say weren t those beauteous whiskers My eye Well the evening netted me about five hundred plunks and I got to see the show and to eat a good supper in the bargain Some reformers were to appear before them that night officially and my friends wanted to keep them busy I was called into the game to do something hence these tears Lawsy I earned my money Did you see those women about two million per cent pure jay You ought to cut out that sort of thing it isn t nice Oh you needn t be so virtuous Carr keeps a whole corps of rascals to spread apple butter on the legislature corn bread You d better speak to him about it He d probably tell missus Carr to ask you to dinner right away Oh that will come in time I don t expect to do everything at once You may see me up there some time and when you do don t shy off like a colt at the choo choos By the way I d like to be one of the bright particular stars of the Dramatic Club if you can fix it You remember that amateur theatricals are rather in my line I do At college you were one of the most persistent Thespians we had and one of the worst But let social matters go You haven t told me how to get rich quick yet I haven t had the nerve to chuck the law as you have Well continued Balcomb expansively a fellow has got to take what he can when he can One swallow doesn t make a summer one sucker doesn t make a spring so we must catch the birdling en route or en passant as our dear professor of modern languages used to try to get us to remark Say between us old college friends I cleared up a couple of thousand last week just too easy for any use You know Singerly the popular undertaker Egyptian secret of embalming lady and gentleman attendants night and day always wears a spray of immortelles in his lapel and a dash of tuberose essence on his handkerchief Well Singerly and I operated together in the smoothest way you ever saw Excuse me He lay back and howled Well there was an old house up here on High Street just where it begins to get good very exclusive old families and all that It belonged to an estate and I got an option on it just for fun I began taking Singerly up there to look at it We d measure it and step it off and stop and palaver on the sidewalk In a day or two those people up there began to take notice and to do me the honor to call on me You see my boy an undertaking shop even a fashionable one for a neighbor isn t pleasant it wouldn t add as one might say to the sauce piquante of life and as a reminder of our mortality a trifle depressing as you will admit He took the cigar from his mouth and examined the burning end of it thoughtfully I sold the option to one of Singerly s prospective neighbors for the matter of eleven hundred He s a retired wholesale grocer and didn t need the money Seems to me you re cutting pretty near the dead line Jack That s not a pretty sort of hold up You might as well take a sandbag and lie in wait by night Great rhubarb You make me tired I m not robbing the widow and the orphan but a fat old Dutchman who doesn t ask anything of life but his sauerkraut and beer And you do You d better give your ethical sense a good tonic before you butt into the penal code Come off I ve got a better scheme even than the Singerly deal The school board s trying to locate a few schools in up town districts Very undesirable neighbors I rather think I can make a couple of turns there This is all strictly inter nos as Professor Morton used to say in giving me as a special mark of esteem a couple of hundred extra lines of Virgil to keep me in o nights He looked at his watch and gave the stem key a few turns before returning it to his pocket You ll have to excuse me old man I ve got a date with Adams over at the Central States Trust Company He s a right decent chap when you know how to handle him I want to get them to finance a big apartment house scheme I ve got an idea for a flat that will make the town sit up and gasp Don t linger on my account Jack I only stopped in to see whether you kept your good spirits I feel as though I d had a shower bath Come along Several men were waiting to see Balcomb in the outer office and he shook hands with all of them and begged them to come again taking care to mention that he had been called to the Central States Trust Company and had to hurry away He called peremptorily to the passing elevator car to wait and as he and Leighton squeezed into it he continued his half of an imaginary conversation in a tone that was audible to every passenger I could have had those bonds if I had wanted them but I knew there was a cloud on them the county was already over its legal limit I guess those saint Louis fellows will be sorry they were so enterprising here we are And then in a lower tone to Leighton That was for old man Dameron s benefit Did you see him jammed back in the corner of the car Queer old party and as tight as a drum When I can work off some assessable and non interest bearing bonds on him it ll be easy to sell Uncle Sam s Treasury a gold brick They say the old man has a daughter who is finer than gold yea than much fine gold I m going to look her up if I ever get time You d better come over soon and pick out an office Verbum sat sapienti as our loving teacher used to say So long Leighton walked back to his office in good humor and better contented with his own lot THE WICKED ZEBRA three BY FRANK ROE BATCHELDER The zebra always seems malicious He kicks and bites most all the time I fear that he s not

6035-74040-0000	train-other-500	THE BRAKEMAN AT CHURCH BY ROBERT J BURDETTE One bright winter morning the twenty ninth day of December Anno Domini eighteen seventy nine
6035-74040-0001	train-other-500	I was journeying from Lebanon Indiana where I had sojourned Sunday to Indianapolis I did not see the famous cedars and I supposed they had been used up for lead pencils and moth proof chests
6035-74040-0002	train-other-500	and relics and souvenirs for Lebanon is right in the heart of the holy land That part of Indiana was settled by Second Adventists and they have sprinkled goodly names all over their heritage
none	none	 As the train clattered along stopping at every station to trade off some people who were tired of traveling for some other people who were tired of staying at home 
6035-74040-0003	train-other-500	I got out my writing pad pointed a pencil and wondered what manner of breakfast I would be able to serve for the ever hungry Hawkeye next morning
6035-74040-0004	train-other-500	I was beginning to think I would have to disguise some left overs under a new name as the thrifty housekeeper knows how to do
6035-74040-0005	train-other-500	when my colleague my faithful yoke fellow who has many a time found for me a spring of water in the desert place the Brakeman came down the aisle of the car
6035-74040-0006	train-other-500	He glanced at the tablet and pencil as I would look at his lantern put my right hand into a cordial compress that abode with my fingers for ten minutes after he went away and seating himself easily on the arm of the seat
none	none	 put the semaphore all right for me 
6035-74040-0007	train-other-500	by saying Say I went to church yesterday Good boy I said and what church did you attend Guess was his reply Some Union Mission chapel I ventured
none	none	 N no 
6035-74040-0008	train-other-500	he said I don t care to run on these branch roads very much I don t get a chance to go to church every Sunday and when I can go I like to run on the main line where your trip is regular
none	none	 and you make schedule time and don t have to wait on connections 
6035-74040-0009	train-other-500	I don t care to run on a branch Good enough I reckon but I don t like it Episcopal I guessed Limited express he said all parlor cars vestibuled and two dollars extra for a seat
6035-74040-0010	train-other-500	fast time and only stop at the big stations Elegant line but too rich for a brakeman All the trainmen in uniform conductor s punch and lanterns silver plated
none	none	 train boys fenced up by themselves and not allowed to offer anything but music 
6035-74040-0011	train-other-500	Passengers talk back at the conductor Trips scheduled through the whole year so when you get aboard you know just where you re going and how long it will take you Most systematic road in the country and has a mighty nice class of travel
6035-74040-0012	train-other-500	Never hear of a receiver appointed on that line But I didn t ride in the parlor car yesterday Universalist I suggested Broad gauge the Brakeman chuckled
6035-74040-0013	train-other-500	does too much complimentary business to be prosperous Everybody travels on a pass Conductor doesn t get a cash fare once in fifty miles Stops at all way stations and won t run into anything but a union depot
6035-74040-0014	train-other-500	No smoking car allowed on the train because the company doesn t own enough brimstone to head a match Train orders are rather vague though and I ve noticed the trainmen don t get along very well with the passengers
none	none	 No I didn t go on the broad gauge though I have some good friends on that road who are the best people in the world 
6035-74040-0015	train-other-500	Been running on it all their lives Presbyterian I hinted
none	none	 Narrow gauge eh 
6035-74040-0016	train-other-500	said the Brakeman pretty track straight as a rule tunnel right through the heart of a mountain rather than go around it spirit level grade strict rules too passengers have to show their tickets before they get on the train
6035-74040-0017	train-other-500	cars a little bit narrow for sleepers have to sit one in a seat and no room in the aisle to dance No stop over tickets allowed
none	none	 passenger must go straight through to the station he s ticketed for 
6035-74040-0018	train-other-500	or stay off the car When the car s full gates are shut cars built at the shops to hold just so many and no more allowed on That road is run right up to the rules and you don t often hear of an accident on it
6035-74040-0019	train-other-500	Had a head on collision at Schenectady union station and run over a weak bridge at Cincinnati not many years ago but
none	none	 nobody hurt and no passengers lost Great road May be you rode with the Agnostics I tried 
6035-74040-0020	train-other-500	The Brakeman shook his head emphatically
none	none	 Scrub road he said 
6035-74040-0021	train-other-500	dirt road bed and no ballast no time card and no train dispatcher All trains run wild and every engineer makes his own time just as he pleases
6035-74040-0022	train-other-500	A sort of smoke if you want to road Too many side tracks every switch wide open all the time switchman sound asleep and the target lamp dead out Get on where you please and get off when you want
6035-74040-0023	train-other-500	Don t have to show your tickets and the conductor has no authority to collect fare No sir I was offered a pass but I don t like the line I don t care to travel over a road that has no terminus
6035-74040-0024	train-other-500	Do you know I asked a division superintendent where his road run to
none	none	 and he said he hoped to die if he knew 
6035-74040-0025	train-other-500	I asked him if the general superintendent could tell me and he said he didn t believe they had a general superintendent and if they had he didn t know any more about the road than the passengers did
none	none	 I asked him who he reported to and he said Nobody 
6035-74040-0026	train-other-500	I asked a conductor who he got his orders from and he said he didn t take no orders from any living man or dead ghost And when I asked the engineer who gave him orders
6035-74040-0027	train-other-500	he said he d just like to see any man on this planet try to give him orders black and white or verbal he said he d run that train to suit himself or he d run it into the ditch Now you see
6035-74040-0028	train-other-500	I m not much of a theologian but I m a good deal of a railroad man and I don t want to run on a road that has no schedule makes no time has no connections starts anywhere and runs nowhere
6035-74040-0029	train-other-500	and has neither signal man train dispatcher or superintendent Might be all right but I ve railroaded too long to understand it
none	none	 Did you try the Methodist 
6035-74040-0030	train-other-500	Now you re shoutin he cried with enthusiasm
none	none	 that s the hummer 
6035-74040-0031	train-other-500	Fast time and crowds of passengers Engines carry a power of steam and don t you forget it Steam gauge shows a hundred and enough all the time Lively train crews too
none	none	 When the conductor shouts All a b o a r d you can hear him to the next hallelujah station 
6035-74040-0032	train-other-500	Every train lamp shines like a head light Stop over privileges on all tickets
none	none	 passenger can drop off the train any time he pleases 
6035-74040-0033	train-other-500	do the station a couple of days and hop on to the next revival train that comes thundering along with an evangelist at the throttle Good whole souled companionable conductors
6035-74040-0034	train-other-500	ain t a road on earth that makes the passengers feel more at home No passes issued on any account everybody pays full traffic rate for his own ticket Safe road too well equipped
6035-74040-0035	train-other-500	Wesleyanhouse air brakes on every train It s a road I m fond of but I didn t begin this week s run with it I began to feel that I was running ashore I tried one more lead
none	none	 May be you went with the Baptists 
6035-74040-0036	train-other-500	Ah ha he shouted
none	none	 now you re on the Shore line River Road eh 
6035-74040-0037	train-other-500	Beautiful curves lines of grace at every bend and sweep of the river all steel rail and rock ballast single track and not a siding from the round house to the terminus Takes a heap of water to run it though
6035-74040-0038	train-other-500	double tanks at every station and there isn t an engine in the shops that can run a mile or pull a pound with less than two gauges Runs through a lovely country river on one side and the hills on the other
none	none	 and it s a steady climb up grade all the way until the run ends where the river begins 
6035-74040-0039	train-other-500	at the fountain head
none	none	 Yes sir I ll take the River Road every time for a safe trip 
6035-74040-0040	train-other-500	sure connections good time and no dust blowing in when you open a window
none	none	 And yesterday morning when the conductor came around taking up fares with a little basket punch I didn t ask him to pass me I paid my fare like a little Jonah twenty five cents for a ninety minute run with a concert by the passengers thrown in I tell you what it is Pilgrim never mind your baggage you just secure your passage on the River Road if you want to go to But just here the long whistle announced a station and the Brakeman hurried to the door shouting Zions VILLE ZIONS ville All out for Zionsville This train makes no stops between here and Indianapolis HOW mister TERRAPIN LOST HIS BEARD BY ANNE VIRGINIA CULBERTSON 
6709-74041-0000	train-other-500	The cook house stood at some little distance from the big house and every evening after supper it was full of light and noise and laughter
none	none	 The light came from the fire on the huge hearth above which hung the crane and the great iron pots which Eliza the cook declared were indispensable in the practice of her art To be sure there was a cook stove but Liza was wedded to old ways 
6709-74041-0001	train-other-500	and maintained there was nothing stove cooked that could hope to rival the rich and nutty flavor of ash cake or greens
none	none	 b iled slow an long over de ha th wid a piece er bacon in de pot 
6709-74041-0002	train-other-500	The noise and laughter came from a circle of dusky and admiring friends
none	none	 for Aunt Liza was a great favorite with everybody on the plantation 
6709-74041-0003	train-other-500	and though hunchbacked and homely had nevertheless had her pick as she was fond of boasting of the likeliest looking men on the place and though she had been twice wedded and twice widowed
6709-74041-0004	train-other-500	aspirants were not wanting for the position now vacant for a third time
none	none	 Indeed not long before a member of the family on going to the cook house to see why dinner was so late had discovered one Sam 
6709-74041-0005	train-other-500	the burly young ox cart driver on his knees pleading very earnestly with the elderly and humpbacked little cook while dinner simmered on and on unnoticed and forgotten
none	none	 When remonstrated with she said that she was bleeged ter have company tin times ez well ez de res er folks and intimated that in affairs of the heart 
6709-74041-0006	train-other-500	these things were apt to happen at any time or place
none	none	 and that if a gentleman chose an inopportune moment twan t her fault 
6709-74041-0007	train-other-500	and no one could with any show of reason expect her not to pay attention to him She ruled everybody her white folks included
none	none	 though just how she did it no one could say 
6709-74041-0008	train-other-500	unless she was one of those commanding spirits and born leaders who sometimes appear even in the humblest walks of life It is possible that her uncommonly strong will compelled the affections of her male admirers
6709-74041-0009	train-other-500	but it is also possible that she condescended to flatter and it is certain that she fed them well One night between supper and bedtime the children heard the sound of a banjo proceeding from the cook house
none	none	 They had never ventured into Aunt Liza s domain before but the plinketty plunk of the banjo 
6709-74041-0010	train-other-500	the sound of patting and the thud of feet keeping time to the music drew them irresistibly Aunt Nancy was there in the circle about the embers as was also her old time foe Aunt Phrony
6709-74041-0011	train-other-500	and the banjo was in the hands of Tim a plow boy celebrated as being the best picker for miles around
none	none	 Lastly there were Aunt Liza and her latest conquest Sam 
6709-74041-0012	train-other-500	whose hopes she could not have entirely quenched
none	none	 or he would not have beamed so complacently on the assembled company There was a hush as the three little heads appeared in the doorway but the children begged them to go on and so Tim picked away for dear life and Sam did a wonderful double shuffle with the pigeon wing thrown in Then Tim sang a plantation song about Cindy Ann that ran something like this I se gwine down ter Richmond I ll tell you w at hit s for I se gwine down ter Richmond Fer ter try an end dis war Refrain An a you good by Cindy Cindy Good by Cindy Ann An a you good by Cindy Cindy I se gwine ter Rappahan I oon ma y a po gal I ll tell de reason w y Her neck so long an skinny I se feared she nuver die Refrain I oon ma y a rich gal I ll tell de reason w y Bekase she dip so much snuff Her mouf is nuver dry Refrain I ru rr ma y a young gal A apple in her han Dan ter ma y a widdy Wid a house an a lot er lan Refrain At the reference to a widdy he winked at the others and looked significantly at Sam and Aunt Liza Then he declared it was the turn of the ladies to amuse the gentlemen Aunt Nancy and Aunt Phrony cried Hysh Go way man W at ken we all do Done too ol fer foolishness leave dat ter de gals But Liza was not inclined to leave the entertainment of gentlemen to gals whom she declared to be for the most part wu fless trunnel baid trash Come come Sis Phrony an you too Sis Nancy said she you knows dar ain nu rr pusson on de place kin beat you bofe in der marter uv tellin tales I ain nuver have de knack myse f but I knows a good tale w en I years hit an I bin gittin myse f fixed fer one uver sence you comed in The children added their petitions seconded by Tim and Sam 
6709-74041-0013	train-other-500	Aunt Nancy looked as if she were feeling around in the dusk of half forgotten things for a dimly remembered story
none	none	 perceiving which the nimbler witted Aunt Phrony made haste to say that she believed she knew a story 
6709-74041-0014	train-other-500	which might please the company if they were not too hard to suit
none	none	 They politely protested that such was far from being the case whereupon she began the story of how the Terrapin lost his beard Um umph snorted Aunt Nancy who uver year tell uv a tarr pin

and the dawn Of literature And eminently sure Informs his age What printed page Is destined to be great His word is Fate And what he writes Is greater far Than all the books He writes of are His pen Is dipped in boom Or doom And when He says one book is rot And that another s not That ends it He Is pure infallibility And any book he judges must Be blessed or cussed By all mankind Except the blind Who will not see The master s modest mastery His fiat stands Against the uplifted hands Of thousands who protest And buy the books That they like best But what of that He knows where he is at And they don t And why Shouldn t he be high Above them as the clouds Are high above the brooks For God He made the Critic And man he makes the books See Gee whiz What a puissant potentate the Critic is THE ASSOCIATED WIDOWS BY KATHARINE M ROOF The confirmed bachelor sat apart fairly submerged by a sea of Sunday papers yet a peripheral consciousness of the ladies presence was revealed in his embryonic smile He folded over a voluminous sheet containing an account of the latest murder and glanced at a half page picture labeled The Scene of the Crime Was there ever yet a woman that could keep a secret he demanded apparently of the newspaper Now if this poor fellow had only kept his little plans to himself but of course he had to go and tell some woman Looks like the man didn t know how to keep his secret that time returned missus Pendleton with a smile calculated to soften harsh judgments against her sex There are some secrets woman can keep observed Elsie Howard Her gaze happened to rest upon missus Pendleton s golden hair For instance demanded the confirmed bachelor His name was Barlow Oh her age for one thing Elsie withdrew her observant short sighted eyes from missus Pendleton s crowning glory and a smile barely touched the corners of her expressively inexpressive mouth missus Pendleton glanced up faintly suspicious of that last remark mister Barlow laughed uproariously In the two years that he had been a guest in missus Howard s boarding house he had come to regard Miss Elsie as a wit and it was his habit like the Italians at the opera to give his applause before the closing phrases were delivered I guess that s right You hit it that time That s one secret a woman can keep He chuckled appreciatively missus Pendleton laughed less spontaneously than usual and said It certainly was a dangerous subject that she had been looking for silver hairs amongst the gold herself lately And again Elsie s eyes were attracted to the hairs under discussion For three months now she had questioned that hair At night it seemed above reproach in its infantile fairness but in the crude unkind daylight there was a garish insistence about it that troubled the eye At that moment the door opened and missus Hilary came in with her bonnet on She glanced around with frigid greeting So I m not late to dinner after all I had thought you would be at table The tram was so slow I was sorry I had not walked and saved the fare She spoke with an irrational rising and falling of syllables that at once proclaimed her nationality She was a short compact little woman with rosy cheeks abundant hair and a small tight mouth missus Hilary was a miniature painter by choice and a wife and mother by accident She was subject to lapses in which she unquestionably forgot the twins existence She recalled them suddenly now Has any one seen Gladys and Gwendolen Dear dear I wonder where they are They wouldn t go to church with me Those children are such a responsibility But they are such happy children said gentle little missus Howard who had come in at the beginning of this speech In her heart missus Howard dreaded the long legged all pervasive twins but she pitied the widowed and impoverished little artist So sad she was wont to say to her intimates in describing her lodger a young widow left all alone in a foreign country But one would hardly call America a foreign country to an Englishwoman one friend had interpolated at this point Yes I know missus Howard had acknowledged but she seems foreign Her husband was an American I believe and he evidently left her with almost nothing He must have been very unkind to her she has such a dislike of Americans She wasn t able to give the regular price for the rooms but I couldn t refuse her I felt so sorry for her missus Howard liked to feel sorry for people Yet she was apt to find herself at sea in attempting to sympathize with missus Hilary She was a sweet faced tired looking little woman with a vague smile and dreamy eyes About five years ago missus Howard had had reverses and had been forced by necessity to live to violate the sanctity of her hearth and home grossly speaking she had been obliged to take boarders no feasible alternative seeming to suggest itself The old house in Eleventh Street in which she had embarked upon this cheerless career had never been a home for her or her daughter Yet an irrepressible sociability of nature enabled her to find a certain pleasure in the life impossible to her more reserved daughter As they all sat around now in the parlor into which the smell of the Sunday turkey had somehow penetrated a few more guests wandered in and sat about provisionally on the impracticable parlor furniture waiting for the dinner signal missus Howard bravely tried to keep up the simulation of social interchange with which she ever pathetically strove to elevate the boarding house intercourse into the decency of a chosen association Suddenly there came a thump and a crash against the door and the twins burst in their jackets unbuttoned their dusty picture hats awry Oh mater mater they cried tumultuously dancing about her Such sport mater We fed the elephant And the rabbits And a monkey carried off Gwendolen s gloves Children exclaimed missus Hilary impotently looking from one to the other where have you been She pronounced it bean To the park mater To see the animals Oh mater you should see the ducky little baby lion What is it that they call you inquired a perpetually smiling young kindergartner who had just taken possession of a top floor hall room missus Hilary glanced at her slightingly What is it that they call me Why mater of course Ah yes the girl acquiesced pleasantly I remember now it s English of course Oh no returned missus Hilary instructively it s not English it s Latin The kindergartner was silent missus Pendleton suppressed a chuckle that strongly suggested her mammy mister Barlow grinned and Elsie Howard s mouth twitched They are such picturesque children missus Howard put in hastily I wonder you don t paint them oftener I declare I just wish I could paint missus Pendleton contributed sweetly I think it s such pretty work missus Hilary was engrossed in the task of putting the twins to rights I don t know what to do with them they are quite unmanageable she sighed It s so bad for them bringing them up in a lodging house missus Howard flushed and missus Pendleton s eyes flashed The dinner bell rang and Elsie Howard rose with a little laugh An English mother with American children What do you expect missus Hilary missus Hilary was busy retying a withered blue ribbon upon the left side of Gladys brow She looked up to explain They are only half American you know But their manners are getting quite ruined with these terrible American children Then they filed down into the basement dining room for the noon dinner Horrid rude little Cockney missus Pendleton whispered in Elsie Howard s ear The girl smiled faintly Oh she doesn t know she is rude She is just English missus Howard over the characterless soup wondered what it was about the little English artist that seemed so different Conversation with missus Hilary developed such curious and unexpected difficulties missus Howard looked compassionately over at the kindergartner who with the hopefulness of inexperience started one subject after another with her unresponsive neighbor What quality was it in missus Hilary that invariably brought both discussion and pleasantry to a standstill Elsie upon whom missus Howard depended for clarification of her thought would only describe it as English In her attempts to account for this alien presence in her household missus Howard inevitably took refuge in the recollection of missus Hilary s widowhood This moving thought occurring to her now caused her to glance in the direction of missus Pendleton s black dress and her face lightened missus Pendleton was of another sort missus Pendleton had proved as missus Howard always expressed it quite an acquisition to our circle She felt almost an affection for the merry sociable talkative Southern woman with her invariable good spirits her endless fund of appropriate platitude and her ready superficial sympathy missus Pendleton had come through a cousin of a friend of a friend of missus Howard s and these vague links furnished unlimited material for conversation between the two women missus Pendleton was originally from Savannah and the names which flowed in profusion from her lips were of unimpeachable aristocracy Pendleton was a very good name in the South missus Howard had remarked to Elsie and went on to cite instances and associations Besides those already mentioned the household consisted of three old maids who had been with missus Howard from her first year a pensive art student with paintable hair a deaf old gentleman whose place at table was marked by a bottle of lithia tablets a chinless bank clerk who had jokes with the waitress and a silent man who spoke only to request food mister Barlow occupied and frankly enjoyed the place between Miss Elsie and missus Pendleton He found the widow s easy witticisms stock anecdotes and hackneyed quotations of unfailing interest and her obvious coquetry irresistible mister Barlow took life and business in a most un American spirit of leisure He never found fault with the food or the heating arrangements and never precipitated disagreeable arguments at table All things considered he was probably the most contented spirit in the house The talk at table revolved upon newspaper topics the weather the health of the household and a comparison of opinions about plays and actresses At election times it was strongly tinged with politics and on Sundays popular preachers were introduced with some expression as to what was and was not good taste in the pulpit Among the feminine portion a fair amount of time was devoted to a review of the comparative merits of shops missus Pendleton s conversation however had a somewhat wider range for she had traveled Just what topics were favored in those long undertone conversations with mister Barlow only Elsie Howard could have told as the seat on the other side of the pair was occupied by the deaf old gentleman There were many covert glances and much suppressed laughter but neither of the two old maids opposite were able to catch the drift of the low voiced dialogue so it remained a tantalizing mystery missus Pendleton when pleased to be general in her attentions proved to be as missus Howard had said an acquisition She spoke most entertainingly of Egypt of Japan and Hawaii Yet all these experiences seemed tinged with a certain sadness as they had evidently been associated with the last days of the late mister Pendleton They had crossed the Pyrenees when poor mister Pendleton was so ill he had to be carried every inch of the way In Egypt sometimes it seemed like he couldn t last another day But I always did say while there is life there is hope she would recall pensively and the doctors all said the only hope for his life was in constant travel and so we were always as you might say seeking fresh fields and pastures new Then missus Howard s gentle eyes would fill with sympathy Poor missus Pendleton she would often say to Elsie after one of these distressing allusions How terrible it must have been Think of seeing some one you love dying that way by inches before your eyes She must have been very fond of him too She always speaks of him with so much feeling Yes said Elsie with untranslatable intonation I wonder what he died of I don t know returned her mother regretfully She had no curiosity but she had a refined and well bred interest in diseases I never heard her mention it and I didn t like to ask Poor missus Howard missus Pendleton was wont to say with her facile sympathy So hard for her to have to take strangers into her home I believe she was left without anything at her husband s death mighty hard for a woman at her age How long has her husband been dead the other boarder to whom she spoke would sometimes inquire missus Pendleton thought he must have been dead some time although she had never heard them say exactly You never hear Elsie speak of him she added so I reckon she doesn t remember him right well As the winter wore on the tendency to tete a tete between missus Pendleton and mister Barlow became more marked They lingered nightly in the chilly parlor in the glamour of the red lamp after the other guests had left It was discovered that they had twice gone to the theater together The art student had met them coming in late As a topic of conversation among the boarders the affair was more popular than food complaints A subtile atmosphere of understanding enveloped the two It became so marked at last that even missus Hilary perceived it although Elsie always insisted that Gladys had told her One afternoon in the spring as missus Pendleton was standing on the door step preparing to fit the latch key into the lock the door opened and a man came out uproariously followed by Gladys and Gwendolen who in some inexplicable way always had the effect of a crowd of children The man was tall and not ill looking missus Pendleton was attired in trailing black velveteen a white feather boa and a hat covered with tossing plumes and the hair underneath was aggressively golden A potential smile hovered about her lips and her glance lingered in passing Inside the house she bent a winning smile upon Gwendolen who was the less sophisticated of the two children Who s your caller honey That s the pater replied Gwendolen with her mouth full of candy He brought us some sweets You may have one if you wish Your your father translated missus Pendleton with a gasp She was obliged to lean against the wall for support The twins nodded their jaws locked with caramel He doesn t come very often Gladys managed to get out indistinctly I wish he would I suppose his business keeps him away suggested missus Pendleton Gladys glanced up from a consideration of the respective attractions of a chocolate cream and caramel He says it is incompatibility of humor she repeated glibly Gladys was more than half American Of humor missus Pendleton s face broke up into ripples of delight She flew at once to missus Howard s private sitting room arriving all out of breath and exploded her bomb immediately My dear did you know that missus Hilary is not a widow Not a widow repeated missus Howard with dazed eyes I met her husband right now at the door He was telling the children good by He isn t any more dead than I am Not dead repeated missus Howard collapsing upon the nearest chair with all the prostration a news bearer s heart could desire And she was always talking about what he used to do and used to think and used to say Why why I can t believe it True as preachin declared missus Pendleton adding that you could have knocked her down with a feather when she discovered it Elsie Howard came into her mother s room just then and missus Pendleton repeated the exciting news adding Gladys says they don t live together because of incompatibility of humor Elsie smiled and remarked that it certainly was a justifiable ground for separation and unkindly went off leaving the subject undeveloped The next day missus Howard had a caller It was the friend whose cousin had a friend that had known missus Pendleton In the process of conversation the caller remarked casually So missus Pendleton has got her divorce at last missus Howard smiled vaguely and courteously Some connection of our missus Pendleton I don t think I have heard her mention it Dear me isn t it dreadful how common divorce is getting to be The guest stared You don t mean to say why my dear missus Howard is it possible you don t know It is your missus Pendleton missus Howard remained looking at her friend Once or twice her lips moved but no words came Her husband is dead she said at last faintly The caller laughed Then he must have died yesterday Why didn t you know that was the reason she spent last year in Colorado For her husband s health gasped missus Howard clinging to the last shred of her six months belief in missus Pendleton s widowhood I always had an impression that it was there he died The other woman laughed heartlessly Did she tell you he was dead missus Howard collected her scattered faculties and tried to think No she said at last Now that you speak of it I don t believe she ever did But she certainly gave that impression She seemed to be always telling of his last illness and his last days She never actually mentioned the details of his death but then how could she poor thing She couldn t of course That would have been asking too much missus Howard s guest went off again into peals of unseemly laughter When her caller had left missus Howard climbed up to the chilly skylight room occupied by her daughter and dropped upon the bed exclaiming Well I never would have believed it of missus Pendleton Elsie who was standing before her mirror regarded her mother in the glass What s up Has she eloped with Billie Barlow at last missus Howard tried to say it but became inarticulate with emotion After five minutes of preamble and exclamation her daughter was in possession of the fact That explains about her hair was Elsie s only comment I am so relieved to have it settled at last Why didn t she tell me wailed missus Howard Oh people don t always tell those things missus Howard was silent As they passed the parlor door on their way down to dinner missus Pendleton s merry laugh rang out and Elsie caught a glimpse of the golden hair under the red lamp and the fugitive glimpse of mister Barlow s bald spot About two days later as the girl came in from an afternoon s shopping and was on her way upstairs her mother called to her Something in the sound of it attracted her attention She hurried down the few steps and into her mother s room missus Howard was sitting over by the window in the fading light with a strange look upon her face An open telegram lay in her lap Elsie went up to her quickly What is it mother missus Howard handed her the telegram Your father she said Elsie Howard read the simple announcement in silence Then she looked up the last trace of an old bitterness in her faint smile We will miss him she said Elsie cried her mother It was a tone the girl had never heard from her before Her eyes fell No it wasn t nice to say it I am sorry But I can t forget what life was with him She raised her eyes to her mother s It was simply hell mother you can t have forgotten You have said it yourself so often We can not deny that it is a relief to know Hush Elsie never let me hear you say anything like that again Forgive me mother said the girl with quick remorse I never will I don t think I have ever felt that death makes such things so different and I didn t realize how you would look at it My child he was your father said missus Howard in a low voice Then Elsie saw the tears in her mother s eyes Such a shock to her missus Pendleton murmured sympathetically to Elsie I know Miss Elsie I can feel for her Elsie mechanically thought of the last hours of mister Pendleton then recalled herself with a start Death always is a shock missus Pendleton finished gracefully even when one most expects it You must let me know if there is anything I can do Later in the evening she communicated the astonishing news to missus Hilary who ejaculated freely Only fancy and How very extraordinary Didn t you think he had been dead a hundred years exclaimed missus Pendleton One never can tell in the states responded missus Hilary conservatively Divorce is so common over here It isn t the thing at all in England you know missus Pendleton stared But they were not divorced only separated Do you never do that in England Divorced people are not received at court you know explained missus Hilary missus Pendleton s glance lingered upon the Englishwoman s immobile face and a laugh broke into her words But when you are in Rome you do as the Romans is that it missus Hilary But the shot glanced off harmlessly from the thick armor of British literalness In Rome divorce doesn t exist at all she graciously informed her companion The Romish church does not permit it you know The American woman looked at the Englishwoman more in sorrow than in anger How she reflected is one to be revenged like a lady upon an Englishwoman It was about a week later that missus Pendleton finding herself alone with missus Howard and Elsie made the final announcement I hope you all will be ready to dance at my wedding next month It s going to be very quiet but I couldn t think of being married without you and Miss Elsie and mister Barlow he feels just like I do about it WOMEN AND BARGAINS BY NINA R ALLEN Show me the woman who in her heart of hearts does not delight in a bargain and I will tell you that she is a dead woman I who write this after having triumphantly passed bargain counters of every description untempted by ribbons worth twenty five cents but selling for nineteen insensible to dimities that had sold for nineteen cents but were offered at six and a fourth cents a yard and though I have a weakness for good cooking utensils blind to the attractions of a copper tea kettle whose former price was now cut in two at last fell a victim to a green and white wicker chair This is how it happened I asked the price Eight dollars replied the shop keeper No It was a ten dollar chair But he had said eight It was a mistake Nevertheless he would keep his word I could have it for eight What heart of woman could resist a bargain like this Besides I thought such honesty ought to be encouraged It is but too uncommon in this wicked world And well I really wanted the chair How could a woman help wanting it when she found that the salesman had made an error of two dollars It was a ten dollar chair the shop keeper repeated I saw the tag marked Lax Jxxx Mxx There could be no doubt of it I gazed and gazed but finally went on like the seamen of Ulysses deafening myself to the siren voice And though I had hesitated I might not have been lost but returning by the same route I saw a neighboring druggist rush into that store bareheaded as I now suppose to change a bill Need I say that I then thought he had come for my chair Need I say that I then and there bought that chair Thus have I brought shame on a judicious parent not my mother who has conscientiously labored to teach me that the way of the bargain hunter is hard As well might man attempt to deprive the cat of its mew or the dog of its bark as to eliminate from the female breast the love of bargains It has been burned in with the centuries Eve poor soul doubtless never knew the happiness of swarming with other women round a big table piled with remnants of rumpled table linen mis mated towels and soiled dresser scarfs or the pleasure of carrying off the bolt of last fall s ribbon on which another woman had her eye nor had she the proud satisfaction of bringing home to her unfortunate partner a shirt with a bosom like a checker board that had been marked down to sixty three cents But history since her day is not lacking in bargains of various kinds of which woman has had her share though no doubt Anniversary Sales Sensational Mill End Sales and Railroad Wreck Sales are comparatively modern A woman s pleasure in a good bargain is akin to the rapture engendered in the feminine bosom by successful smuggling It is perhaps a purer joy The satisfaction of acquiring something one does not need or of buying an article which one may have some use for in the future simply because it is cheap or because missus X paid seventeen cents more for the same thing at a bargain sale can not be understood by a mere man Once in a while some stupid masculine creature endeavors to show his wife that she is losing the use of her money by tying it up in embroideries for decorating cotton which is still in the fields of the South or laying it out in summer dress goods when snow storms can not be far distant The use of her money forsooth What is money for except to spend And if she didn t buy embroideries and dimities she would purchase something else with it So she goes on hunting bargains or rather profiting by those that come in her way for generally it is not necessary to search for them These little snares of the merchant are only too common in this age when everything from cruisers to clothes pins and pianos to prunes may often be had at a stupendous sacrifice A man usually goes to a shop where he believes that he will run little or no risk of being deceived in the quality of the goods even though prices be higher there than at some other places A woman thinks she knows a bargain when she sees it She is aware that the store keeper has craftily spread his web of bargains hoping that when lured into his shop she will buy other things not bargains But she determines beforehand that she will not be cajoled into purchasing anything but the particular bargain of her desire unless unless she sees something else which she really wants And generally she sees something else which she really wants Most women are tolerably good judges of a bargain and therefore have some ground for their confidence in themselves I have seen a Christmas bargain table containing china and small ornaments of various wares completely honeycombed of its actual bargains by veteran bargain hunters who left unpurchased as if by instinct goods from the regular stock offered at usual prices Bargains are a boon to the woman of moderate means The deepest joys of bargain hunting are not known to the rich though they by no means disdain a bargain To them is not given the delight of saving long and waiting for a bargain sale and at last possessing the thin white china or net curtains ardently desired and still out of reach at regular prices But they have some compensation They have the advantage not only of ready money which makes a bargain available at any time but also that of leisure While my lady of the slender purse is still getting the children ready for school or exhorting Bridget not to burn the steak that will be entrusted to her tender mercies they can swoop down upon a bargain and bear it away victoriously A fondness for bargains is not without its dangers for with some people the appetite grows with what it feeds on to the detriment of their purses as well as of their outlook on life To them all the world becomes a bargain counter A few years ago in a city which shall be nameless two women looked into the windows of a piano store In one was an ancient instrument marked seventeen ninety six in the other a beautiful modern piano labeled eighteen ninety six Why said one of the gazers to her companion indicating the latter I d a good deal rather pay the difference for this one wouldn t you This is no wild invention of fiction but a bald fact So strong had the ruling passion become in that feminine heart Upon a friend of mine the bargain habit has taken so powerful a hold that almost any sort of a bargain appeals to her She is the owner of a fine parrot yet not long ago she bought another which had cost fifteen dollars but was offered to her for ten Its feathers were bedraggled and grimy for it had followed its mistress about like a dog it proved to be so cross that at first it had to be fed from the end of a stick and though represented as a brilliant talker its discourse was found to be limited to Wow and Rah Rah but it was a bargain To be sure she didn t really need two parrots but had she not saved five dollars on this one The most elusive kind of bargain is that set forth in alluring advertisements as a small lot perhaps three four or two dozen articles of a kind offered at a price unprecedentedly low When you reach the store you are generally told that they whatever they may be are all gone The other woman so often arrives earlier than you apparently that finally you come to doubt their existence Once in a while if you are eminent among your fellows by some gift of nature as is an acquaintance of mine you may chase down one of these will o the wisps He yes it is he for what woman would own to a number ten foot even for the sake of a bargain saw a fire sale advertised with men s shoes offered at a dollar a pair He went to the store Sure enough a fire had occurred somewhere but not there It was sufficiently near however for a fire sale A solitary box was brought out whose edges were scorched as by a match passed over them within was a pair of number ten shoes Number tens alone whether one pair or more I wot not represented their gigantic fire sale And I can not say how many men had come only to be confronted with tens before this masculine Cinderella triumphantly filled their capacious maws with his number ten feet and gleefully carried off what may have been the only bargain in the shop In spite of the suspicions of some doubting Thomases who regard all bargains as snares and delusions it is certain that many real bargains are offered among the numerous things advertised as such but to profit by them I may add one must have an aptitude either natural or acquired for bargains P S I have just learned that my wicker chair would not have been very cheap at six dollars FABLE BY RALPH WALDO EMERSON The mountain and the squirrel Had a quarrel And the former called the latter Little Prig Bun replied You are

WOMAN HATER REFORMED BY ROY FARRELL GREENE He said to sue for maiden s heart And hand required too much of art In framing phrases making pleas And swearing vows on bended knees Till death or court decree doth part One s oh so apt to get the cart Before the horse and at the start Break down It s torture by degrees He said to sue Yet when sweet Susan coy but smart Safe landed him and Cupid s dart Went through his breast as through a cheese And pierced his heart with perfect ease He well I ll not the words impart He said to Sue HOW mister TERRAPIN LOST HIS PLUMAGE AND WHISTLE BY ANNE VIRGINIA

little rills of poesie That flow from Helicon Sometimes escape into the sea And rest there all unknown While others finding surer guides Fall into happier ways And go to swell the rising tides That make the Poet s bays BILL NATIONS BY BILL ARP You never knowd Bill I rekun Hes gone to Arkensaw and I don t know whether hes ded or alive He was a good feller Bill was as most all whisky drinkers are Me and him both used to love it powerful especially Bill We soaked it when we could git it and when we coudent we hankered after it amazingly I must tell you a little antidote on Bill tho I dident start to tell you about that We started on a little jurney one day in June and took along a bottle of old rye and there was so many springs and wells on the road that it was mighty nigh gone before dinner We took our snack and Bill drained the last drop for he said we would soon git to Joe Paxton s and that Joe always kept some Shore enuff Joe dident have a drop and we concluded as we was mighty dry to go on to Jim Alford s and stay all night We knew that Jim had it for he always had it So we whipped up and the old Bay had to travel for I tell you when a man wants whiskey everything has to bend to the gittin of it Shore enuff Jim had some He was mity glad to see us and he knowd what we wanted for he knowd how it was hisself So he brought out an old fashend glass decanter and a shugar bowl and a tumbler and a spoon and says he Now boys jest wait a minit till you git rested sorter for it ain t good to take whiskey on a hot stomack I ve jest been readin a piece in Grady s newspaper about a frog the darndest frog that perhaps ever come from a tadpole It was found up in Kanetucky and is as big as a peck measure Bill do you take this paper and read it aloud to us I m a poor hand to read and I want to hear it I ll be hanged if it ain t the darndest frog I ever hearn of He laid the paper on my knees and I begun to read thinkin it was a little short anticdote but as I turned the paper over I found it was mighty nigh a column I took a side glance at Bill and I saw the little dry twitches a jumpin about on his countenance He was mighty nigh dead for a drink I warent so bad off myself and I was about half mad with him for drainin the bottle before dinner so I just read along slow and stopped two or three times to clear my throat just to consume time Pretty soon Bill got up and commenced walkin about and he would look at the dekanter like he would give his daylights to choke the corn juice out of it I read along slowly Old Alford was a listnin and chawin his tobakker and spittin out of the door Bill come up to me his face red and twitchin and leanin over my shoulder he seed the length of the story and I will never forgit his pitiful tone as he whispered Skip some Bill for heaven s sake skip some My heart relented and I did skip some and hurried through and we all jined in a drink but I ll never forgit how Bill looked when he whispered to me to skip some Bill skip some I ve got over the like of that boys and I hope Bill has too but I don t know I wish in my soul that everybody had quit it for you may talk about slavery and penitentiary and chain gangs and the Yankees and General Grant and a devil of a wife but whiskey is the worst master that ever a man had over him I know how it is myself But there is one good thing about drinkin I almost wish every man was a reformed drunkard No man who hasn t drank liker knows what a luxury cold water is I have got up in the night in cold wether after I had been spreein around and gone to the well burnin up with thirst feeling like the gallows and the grave and the infernal regions was too good for me and when I took up the bucket in my hands and with my elbows a tremblin like I had the shakin ager put the water to my lips it was the most delicious satisfyin luxurius draft that ever went down my throat I have stood there and drank and drank until I could drink no more and gone back to bed thankin God for the pure innocent and coolin beverig and cursin myself from my inmost soul for ever touchin the accursed whisky In my torture of mind and body I have made vows and promises and broken em within a day But if you want to know the luxury of cold water get drunk and keep at it until you get on fire and then try a bucket full with your shirt on at the well in the middle of the night You won t want a gourd full you ll feel like the bucket ain t big enuf and when you begin to drink an earthquake couldn t stop you My fathers how good it was I know a hundred men who will swear to the truth of what I say but you see its a thing they don t like to talk about It s too humiliatin But I dident start to talk about drinkin In fact I ve forgot what I did start to tell you My mind is sorter addled now a days anyhow and I hav to jes let my tawkin tumble out permiskuous I ll take another whet at it afore long and fill up the gaps THE SKELETON IN THE CLOSET BY EDWARD EVERETT HALE This paper was first published in the Galaxy in eighteen sixty six I see that an old chum of mine is publishing bits of confidential Confederate History in Harper s Magazine It would seem to be time then for the pivots to be disclosed on which some of the wheelwork of the last six years has been moving The science of history as I understand it depends on the timely disclosure of such pivots which are apt to be kept out of view while things are moving I was in the Civil Service at Richmond Why I was there or what I did is nobody s affair And I do not in this paper propose to tell how it happened that I was in New York in October eighteen sixty four on confidential business Enough that I was there and that it was honest business That business done as far as it could be with the resources intrusted to me I prepared to return home And thereby hangs this tale and as it proved the fate of the Confederacy For of course I wanted to take presents home to my family Very little question was there what these presents should be for I had no boys nor brothers The women of the Confederacy had one want which overtopped all others They could make coffee out of beans pins they had from Columbus straw hats they braided quite well with their own fair hands snuff we could get better than you could in the old concern But we had no hoop skirts skeletons we used to call them No ingenuity had made them No bounties had forced them The Bat the Greyhound the Deer the Flora the J C Cobb the Varuna and the Fore and Aft all took in cargoes of them for us in England But the Bat and the Deer and the Flora were seized by the blockaders the J C Cobb sunk at sea the Fore and Aft and the Greyhound were set fire to by their own crews and the Varuna our Varuna was never heard of Then the State of Arkansas offered sixteen townships of swamp land to the first manufacturer who would exhibit five gross of a home manufactured article But no one ever competed The first attempts indeed were put to an end when Schofield crossed the Blue Lick and destroyed the dams on Yellow Branch The consequence was that people s crinolines collapsed faster than the Confederacy did of which that brute of a Grierson said there was never anything of it but the outside Of course then I put in the bottom of my new large trunk in New York not a duplex elliptic for none were then made but a Belmonte of thirty springs for my wife I bought for her more common wear a good Belle Fontaine For Sarah and Susy each I got two Dumb Belles For Aunt Eunice and Aunt Clara maiden sisters of my wife who lived with us after Winchester fell the fourth time I got the Scotch Harebell two of each For my own mother I got one Belle of the Prairies and one Invisible Combination Gossamer I did not forget good old Mamma Chloe and Mamma Jane For them I got substantial cages without names With these tied in the shapes of figure eights in the bottom of my trunk as I said I put in an assorted cargo of dry goods above and favored by a pass and Major Mulford s courtesy on the flag of truce boat I arrived safely at Richmond before the autumn closed I was received at home with rapture But when the next morning I opened my stores this became rapture doubly enraptured Words can not tell the silent delight with which old and young black and white surveyed these fairy like structures yet unbroken and unmended Perennial summer reigned that autumn day in that reunited family It reigned the next day and the next It would have reigned till now if the Belmontes and the other things would last as long as the advertisements declare and what is more the Confederacy would have reigned till now President Davis and General Lee but for that great misery which all families understand which culminated in our great misfortune I was up in the cedar closet one day looking for an old parade cap of mine which I thought though it was my third best might look better than my second best which I had worn ever since my best was lost at the Seven Pines I say I was standing on the lower shelf of the cedar closet when as I stepped along in the darkness my right foot caught in a bit of wire my left did not give way in time and I fell with a small wooden hat box in my hand full on the floor The corner of the hat box struck me just below the second frontal sinus and I fainted away When I came to myself I was in the blue chamber I had vinegar on a brown paper on my forehead the room was dark and I found mother sitting by me glad enough indeed to hear my voice and to know that I knew her It was some time before I fully understood what had happened Then she brought me a cup of tea and I quite refreshed said I must go to the office Office my child said she Your leg is broken above the ankle you will not move these six weeks Where do you suppose you are Till then I had no notion that it was five minutes since I went into the closet When she told me the time five in the afternoon I groaned in the lowest depths For in my breast pocket in that innocent coat which I could now see lying on the window seat were the duplicate despatches to mister Mason for which late the night before I had got the Secretary s signature They were to go at ten that morning to Wilmington by the Navy Department s special messenger I had taken them to insure care and certainty I had worked on them till midnight and they had not been signed till near one o clock Heavens and earth and here it was five o clock The man must be half way to Wilmington by this time I sent the doctor for Lafarge my clerk Lafarge did his prettiest in rushing to the telegraph But no A freshet on the Chowan River or a raid by Foster or something or nothing had smashed the telegraph wire for that night And before that despatch ever reached Wilmington the navy agent was in the offing in the Sea Maid But perhaps the duplicate got through No breathless reader the duplicate did not get through The duplicate was taken by Faucon in the Ino I saw it last week in doctor Lieber s hands in Washington Well all I know is that if the duplicate had got through the Confederate government would have had in March a chance at eighty three thousand two hundred and eleven muskets which as it was never left Belgium So much for my treading into that blessed piece of wire on the shelf of the cedar closet up stairs What was the bit of wire Well it was not telegraph wire If it had been it would have broken when it was not wanted to Don t you know what it was Go up in your own cedar closet and step about in the dark and see what brings up round your ankles Julia poor child cried her eyes out about it When I got well enough to sit up and as soon as I could talk and plan with her she brought down seven of these old things antiquated Belmontes and Simplex Elliptics and horrors without a name and she made a pile of them in the bedroom and asked me in the most penitent way what she should do with them You can t burn them said she fire won t touch them If you bury them in the garden they come up at the second raking If you give them to the servants they say Thank e missus and throw them in the back passage If you give them to the poor they throw them into the street in front and do not say Thank e Sarah sent seventeen over to the sword factory and the foreman swore at the boy and told him he would flog him within an inch of his life if he brought any more of his sauce there and so and so sobbed the poor child I just rolled up these wretched things and laid them in the cedar closet hoping you know that some day the government would want something and would advertise for them You know what a good thing I made out of the bottle corks In fact she had sold our bottle corks for four thousand two hundred and sixteen dollars of the first issue We afterward bought two umbrellas and a cork screw with the money Well I did not scold Julia It was certainly no fault of hers that I was walking on the lower shelf of her cedar closet I told her to make a parcel of the things and the first time we went to drive I hove the whole shapeless heap into the river without saying mass for them But let no man think or no woman that this was the end of troubles As I look back on that winter and on the spring of eighteen sixty five I do not mean the steel spring it seems to me only the beginning I got out on crutches at last I had the office transferred to my house so that Lafarge and Hepburn could work there nights and communicate with me when I could not go out but mornings I hobbled up to the Department and sat with the Chief and took his orders Ah me shall I soon forget that damp winter morning when we all had such hope at the office One or two of the army fellows looked in at the window as they ran by and we knew that they felt well and though I would not ask Old Wick as we had nicknamed the Chief what was in the wind I knew the time had come and that the lion meant to break the net this time I made an excuse to go home earlier than usual rode down to the house in the Major s ambulance I remember and hopped in to surprise Julia with the good news only to find that the whole house was in that quiet uproar which shows that something bad has happened of a sudden What is it Chloe said I as the old wench rushed by me with a bucket of water Poor mister George I fraid he s dead sah And there he really was dear handsome bright George Schaff the delight of all the nicest girls of Richmond he lay there on Aunt Eunice s bed on the ground floor where they had brought him in He was not dead and he did not die He is making cotton in Texas now But he looked mighty near it then The deep cut in his head was the worst I then had ever seen and the blow confused everything When McGregor got round he said it was not hopeless but we were all turned out of the room and with one thing and another he got the boy out of the swoon and somehow it proved his head was not broken No but poor George swears to this day it were better it had been if it could only have been broken the right way and on the right field For that evening we heard that everything had gone wrong in the surprise There we had been waiting for one of those early fogs and at last the fog had come And Jubal Early had that morning pushed out every man he had that could stand and they lay hid for three mortal hours within I don t know how near the picket line at Fort Powhatan only waiting for the shot which John Streight s party were to fire at Wilson s Wharf as soon as somebody on our left centre advanced in force on the enemy s line above Turkey Island stretching across to Nansemond I am not in the War Department and I forget whether he was to advance en barbette or by echelon of infantry But he was to advance somehow and he knew how and when he advanced you see that other man lower down was to rush in and as soon as Early heard him he was to surprise Powhatan you see and then if you have understood me Grant and Butler and the whole rig of them would have been cut off from their supplies would have had to fight a battle for which they were not prepared with their right made into a new left and their old left unexpectedly advanced at an oblique angle from their centre and would not that have been the end of them Well that never happened And the reason it never happened was that poor George Schaff with the last fatal order for this man whose name I forget the same who was afterward killed the day before High Bridge undertook to save time by cutting across behind my house from Franklin to Green Streets You know how much time he saved they waited all day for that order George told me afterward that the last thing he remembered was kissing his hand to Julia who sat at her bedroom window He said he thought she might be the last woman he ever saw this side of heaven Just after that it must have been his horse that white Messenger colt old Williams bred went over like a log and poor George was pitched fifteen feet head foremost against a stake there was in that lot Julia saw the whole She rushed out with all the women and had just brought him in when I got home And that was the reason that the great promised combination of December eighteen sixty four never came off at all I walked out in the lot after McGregor turned me out of the chamber to see what they had done with the horse There he lay as dead as old Messenger himself His neck was broken And do you think I looked to see what had tripped him I supposed it was one of the boys bandy holes It was no such thing The poor wretch had tangled his hind legs in one of those infernal hoop wires that Chloe had thrown out in the piece when I gave her her new ones Though I did not know it then those fatal scraps of rusty steel had broken the neck that day of Robert Lee s army That time I made a row about it I felt too badly to go into a passion But before the women went to bed they were all in the sitting room together I talked to them like a father I did not swear I had got over that for a while in that six weeks on my back But I did say the old wires were infernal things and that the house and premises must be made rid of them The aunts laughed though I was so serious and tipped a wink to the girls The girls wanted to laugh but were afraid to And then it came out that the aunts had sold their old hoops tied as tight as they could tie them in a great mass of rags They had made a fortune by the sale I am sorry to say it was in other rags but the rags they got were new instead of old it was a real Aladdin bargain The new rags had blue backs and were numbered some as high as fifty dollars The rag man had been in a hurry and had not known what made the things so heavy I frowned at the swindle but they said all was fair with a peddler and I own I was glad the things were well out of Richmond But when I said I thought it was a mean trick Lizzie and Sarah looked demure and asked what in the world I would have them do with the old things Did I expect them to walk down to the bridge themselves with great parcels to throw into the river as I had done by Julia s Of course it ended as such things always do by my taking the work on my own shoulders I told them to tie up all they had in as small a parcel as they could and bring them to me Accordingly the next day I found a handsome brown paper parcel not so very large considering and strangely square considering which the minxes had put together and left on my office table They had a great frolic over it They had not spared red tape nor red wax Very official it looked indeed and on the left hand corner in Sarah s boldest and most contorted hand was written Secret service We had a great laugh over their success And indeed I should have taken it with me the next time I went down to the Tredegar but that I happened to dine one evening with young Norton of our gallant little navy and a very curious thing he told us We were talking about the disappointment of the combined land attack I did not tell what upset poor Schaff s horse indeed I do not think those navy men knew the details of the disappointment O Brien had told me in confidence what I have written down probably for the first time now But we were speaking in a general way of the disappointment Norton finished his cigar rather thoughtfully and then said Well fellows it is not worth while to put in the newspapers but what do you suppose upset our grand naval attack the day the Yankee gunboats skittled down the river so handsomely Why said Allen who is Norton s best beloved friend they say that you ran away from them as fast as they did from you Do they said Norton grimly If you say that I ll break your head for you Seriously men continued he that was a most extraordinary thing You know I was on the Ram But why she stopped when she stopped I knew as little as this wineglass does and Callender himself knew no more than I We had not been hit We were all right as a trivet for all we knew when skree she began blowing off steam and we stopped dead and began to drift down under those batteries Callender had to telegraph to the little Mosquito or whatever Walter called his boat and the spunky little thing ran down and got us out of the scrape Walter did it right well if he had had a monitor under him he could not have done better Of course we all rushed to the engine room What in thunder were they at there All they knew was they could get no water into her boiler Now fellows this is the end of the story As soon as the boilers cooled off they worked all right on those supply pumps May I be hanged if they had not sucked in somehow a long string of yarn and cloth and if you will believe me a wire of some woman s crinoline And that French folly of a sham Empress cut short that day the victory of the Confederate navy and old Davis himself can t tell when we shall have such a chance again Some of the men thought Norton lied But I never was with him when he did not tell the truth I did not mention however what I had thrown into the water the last time I had gone over to Manchester And I changed my mind about Sarah s secret service parcel It remained on my table That was the last dinner our old club had at the Spotswood I believe The spring came on and the plot thickened We did our work in the office as well as we could I can speak for mine and if other people but no matter for that The third of April came and the fire and the right wing of Grant s army I remember I was glad then that I had moved the office down to the house for we were out of the way there Everybody had run away from the Department and so when the powers that be took possession my little sub bureau was unmolested for some days I improved those days as well as I could burning carefully what was to be burned and hiding carefully what was to be hidden One thing that happened then belongs to this story As I was at work on the private bureau it was really a bureau as it happened one I had made Aunt Eunice give up when I broke my leg I came to my horror on a neat parcel of coast survey maps of Georgia Alabama and Florida They were not the same Maury stole when he left the National Observatory but they were like them Now I was perfectly sure that on that fatal Sunday of the flight I had sent Lafarge for these that the President might use them if necessary in his escape When I found them I hopped out and called for Julia and asked her if she did not remember his coming for them Certainly she said it was the first I knew of the danger Lafarge came asked for the key of the office told me all was up walked in and in a moment was gone And here on the file of April threed was Fafarge s line to me I got the secret service parcel myself and have put it in the President s own hands I marked it Gulf coast as you bade me What could Lafarge have given to the President Not the soundings of Hatteras Bar Not the working drawings of the first monitor I had all these under my hand Could it be Julia what did we do with that stuff of Sarah s that she marked secret service As I live we had sent the girls old hoops to the President in his flight And when the next day we read how he used them and how Pritchard arrested him we thought if he had only had the right parcel he would have found the way to Florida That is really the end of this memoir But I should not have written it but for something that happened just now on the piazza You must know some of us wrecks are up here at the Berkeley baths My uncle has a place near here Here came to day John Sisson whom I have not seen since Memminger ran and took the clerks with him Here we had before both the Richards brothers the great paper men you know who started the Edgerly Works in Prince George s County just after the war began After dinner Sisson and they met on the piazza Queerly enough they had never seen each other before though they had used reams of Richards paper in correspondence with each other and the treasury had used tons of it in the printing of bonds and bank bills Of course we all fell to talking of old times old they seem now though it is not a year ago Richards said Sisson at last what became of that last order of ours for water lined pure linen government calendered paper of surete We never got it and I never knew why Did you think Kilpatrick got it said Richards rather gruffly None of your chaff Richards Just tell where the paper went for in the loss of that lot of paper as it proved the bottom dropped out of the Treasury tub On that paper was to have been printed our new issue of ten per cent convertible you know and secured on that up country cotton which Kirby Smith had above the Big Raft I had the printers ready for near a month waiting for that paper The plates were really very handsome I ll show you a proof when we go up stairs Wholly new they were made by some Frenchman we got who had worked for the Bank of France I was so anxious to have the thing well done that I waited three weeks for that paper and by Jove I waited just too long We never got one of the bonds off and that was why we had no money in March Richards threw his cigar away I will not say he swore between his teeth but he twirled his chair round brought it down on all fours both his elbows on his knees and his chin in both hands mister Sisson said he if the Confederacy had lived I would have died before I ever told what became of that order of yours But now I have no secrets I believe and I care for nothing I do not know now how it happened We knew it was an extra nice job And we had it on an elegant little new French Fourdrinier which cost us more than we shall ever pay The pretty thing ran like oil the day before That day I thought all the devils were in it The more power we put on the more the rollers screamed and the less we put on the more sulkily the jade stopped I tried it myself every way back current I tried forward current high feed low feed I tried it on old stock I tried it on new and mister Sisson I would have made better paper in a coffee mill We drained off every drop of water We washed the tubs free from size Then my brother there worked all night with the machinists taking down the frame and the rollers You would not believe it sir but that little bit of wire and he took out of his pocket a piece of this hateful steel which poor I knew so well by this time that little bit of wire had passed in from some hoop skirt passed the pickers passed the screens through all the troughs up and down through what we call the lacerators and had got itself wrought in where if you know a Fourdrinier machine you may have noticed a brass ring riveted to the cross bar and there this cursed little knife for you see it was a knife by that time had been cutting to pieces the endless wire web every time the machine was started You lost your bonds mister Sisson because some Yankee woman cheated one of my rag men On that story I came up stairs Poor Aunt Eunice She was the reason I got no salary on the first of April I thought I would warn other women by writing down the story That fatal present of mine in those harmless hourglass parcels was the ruin of the Confederate navy army ordinance and treasury and it led to the capture of the poor President too But Heaven be praised no one shall say that my office did not do its duty THE LOST INVENTOR four BY WALLACE IRWIN Patriotic fellow citizens and did you ever note How we honor mister Fulton who devised the choo choo boat How we glorify our Edison who made

on poetry because I runs to news But I appreciates a man that loves his glass of booze And Omar here likes a good red wine although he s pretty mum On liquors which is better yet like whisky gin or rum Perhaps his missus won t allow him things like that to touch And he doesn t like to own it Well I don t blame Omar much Then I likes a man what s partial to the ladies young or old And Omar seems to seek em much as me and you seek gold I only hope for his sake that his wife don t learn his game Or she ll put a chain on Omar and that would be a shame His language is some florid but I guess it

not precisely in our bailiwick but in the neighborhood of great comic interest It was really a case of a good deal of aggravation and the defendants fearing the result employed four of the ablest lawyers practicing at the M bar to defend them The offense charged was only assault and battery but the evidence showed a conspiracy to inflict great violence on the person of the prosecutor who had done nothing to provoke it and that the attempt to effect it was followed by severe injury to him The prosecutor was an original He had been an old field school master and was as conceited and pedantic a fellow as could be found in a summer s day even in that profession It was thought the policy of the defense to make as light of the case as possible and to cast as much ridicule on the affair as they could J E and W M led the defense and although the talents of the former were rather adapted to grave discussion than pleasantry he agreed to doff his heavy armor for the lighter weapons of wit and ridicule M was in his element He was at all times and on all occasions at home when fun was to be raised the difficulty with him was rather to restrain than to create mirth and laughter The case was called and put to the jury The witness one Burwell Shines was called for the prosecution A broad grin was upon the faces of the counsel for the defense as he came forward It was increased when the clerk said Burrell Shines come to the book and the witness with deliberate emphasis remarked My Christian name is not Burrell but Burwell though I am vulgarly denominated by the former epithet Well said the clerk Bur well Shines come to the book and be sworn He was sworn and directed to take the stand He was a picture He was dressed with care His toilet was elaborate and befitting the magnitude and dignity of the occasion the part he was to fill and the high presence into which he had come He was evidently favorably impressed with his own personal pulchritude yet with an air of modest deprecation as if he said by his manner After all what is beauty that man should be proud of it and what are fine clothes that the wearers should put themselves above the unfortunate mortals who have them not He advanced with deliberate gravity to the stand There he stood his large bell crowned hat with nankeen colored nap an inch long in his hand which hat he carefully handed over the bar to the clerk to hold until he should get through his testimony He wore a blue single breasted coat with new brass buttons a vest of bluish calico nankeen pants that struggled to make both ends meet but failed by a few inches in the legs yet made up for it by fitting a little better than the skin everywhere else His head stood upon a shirt collar that held it up by the ears and a cravat something smaller than a table cloth bandaged his throat his face was narrow long and grave with an indescribable air of ponderous wisdom which as Fox said of Thurlow proved him necessarily a hypocrite as it was impossible for any man to be as wise as he looked Gravity and decorum marked every lineament of his countenance and every line of his body All the wit of Hudibras could not have moved a muscle of his face His conscience would have smitten him for a laugh almost as soon as for an oath His hair was roached up and stood as erect and upright as his body and his voice was slow deep in linked sweetness long drawn out and modulated according to the camp meeting standard of elocution Three such men at a country frolic would have turned an old Virginia reel into a dead march He was one of Carlyle s earnest men Cromwell would have made him ensign of the Ironsides and ex officio chaplain at first sight He took out his pocket handkerchief slowly unfolded it from the shape in which it came from the washerwoman s and awaited the interrogation As he waited he spat on the floor and nicely wiped it out with his foot The solicitor told him to tell about the difficulty in hand He gazed around on the court then on the bar then on the jury then on the crowd addressing each respectively as he turned May it please your honor gentlemen of the bar gentlemen of the jury audience Before proceeding to give my testimonial observations I must premise that I am a member of the Methodist Episcopal otherwise called Wesleyan persuasion of Christian individuals One bright Sabbath morning in May the fifteenth day of the month the past year while the birds were singing their matutinal songs from the trees I sallied forth from the dormitory of my seminary to enjoy the reflections so well suited to that auspicious occasion I had not proceeded far before my ears were accosted with certain Bacchanalian sounds of revelry which proceeded from one of those haunts of vicious depravity located at the cross roads near the place of my boyhood and fashionably denominated a doggery No sooner had I passed beyond the precincts of this diabolical rendezvous of rioting debauchees than I heard behind me the sounds of approaching footsteps as if in pursuit Having heard previously sundry menaces which had been made by these preposterous and incarnadine individuals of hell now on trial in prospect of condign punishment fulminated against the longer continuance of my corporeal salubrity for no better reason than that I reprobated their criminal orgies and not wishing my reflections to be disturbed I hurried my steps with a gradual accelerated motion Hearing however their continued advance and the repeated shoutings articulating the murderous accents Kill him Kill Shadbelly with his praying clothes on which was a profane designation of myself and my religious profession and casting my head over my left shoulder in a manner somehow reluctantly thus throwing his head to one side and perceiving their near approximation I augmented my speed into what might be denominated a gentle slope and subsequently augmented the same into a species of dog trot But all would not do Gentlemen the destroyer came As I reached the fence and was about propelling my body over the same felicitating myself on my prospect of escape from my remorseless pursuers they arrived and James William Jones called by nickname Buck Jones that red headed character now at the bar of this honorable court seized a fence rail grasped it in both hands and standing on tip toe hurled the same with mighty emphasis against my cerebellum which blow felled me to the earth Straightway like ignoble curs upon a disabled lion these bandit ruffians and incarnadine assassins leaped upon me some pelting some bruising some gouging everything by turns and nothing long as the poet hath it and one of them which one unknown to me having no eyes behind inflicted with his teeth a grievous wound upon my person where I need not specify At length when thus prostrate on the ground one of those bright ideas common to minds of men of genius struck me I forthwith sprang to my feet drew forth my cutto circulated the same with much vivacity among their several and respective corporeal systems and every time I circulated the same I felt their iron grasp relax As cowardly recreants even to their own guilty friendships two of these miscreants though but slightly perforated by my cutto fled leaving the other two whom I had disabled by the vigor and energy of my incisions prostrate and in my power These lustily called for quarter shouting out Enough or in their barbarous dialect being as corrupt in language as in morals Nuff which quarter I magnanimously extended them as unworthy of my farther vengeance and fit only as subject of penal infliction at the hands of the offended laws of their country to which laws I do now consign them hoping such mercy for them as their crimes will permit which in my judgment having read the code is not much This is my statement on oath fully and truly nothing extenuating and naught setting down in malice and if I have omitted anything in form or substance I stand ready to supply the omission and if I have stated anything amiss I will cheerfully correct the same limiting the averment with appropriate modifications provisions and restrictions The learned counsel may now proceed more particularly to interrogate me of and respecting the premises After this oration Burwell wiped the perspiration from his brow and the counsel for the state took him Few questions were asked him however by that official he confining himself to a recapitulation in simple terms of what the witness had declared and procuring Burwell s assent to his translation Long and searching was the cross examination by the defendant s counsel but it elicited nothing favorable to the defense and nothing shaking but much to confirm Burwell s statement After some other evidence the examination closed and the argument to the jury commenced The solicitor very briefly adverted to the leading facts deprecated any attempt to turn the case into ridicule admitted that the witness was a man of eccentricity and pedantry but harmless and inoffensive a man evidently of conscientiousness and respectability that he had shown himself to be a peaceable man but when occasion demanded a brave man that there was a conspiracy to assassinate him upon no cause except an independence which was honorable to him and an attempt to execute the purpose in pursuance of previous threats and severe injury by several confederates on a single person and this on the Sabbath and when he was seeking to avoid them W M rose to reply All Screamersville turned out to hear him William was a great favorite the most popular speaker in the country had the versatility of a mocking bird an aptitude for burlesque that would have given him celebrity as a dramatist and a power of acting that would have made his fortune on the boards of a theater A rich treat was expected but it didn t come The witness had taken all the wind out of William s sails He had rendered burlesque impossible The thing as acted was more ludicrous than it could be as described The crowd had laughed themselves hoarse already and even M s comic powers seemed and were felt by himself to be humble imitations of a greater master For once in his life M dragged his subject heavily along The matter began to grow serious fun failed to come when M called it up M closed between a lame argument a timid deprecation and some only tolerable humor He was followed by E in a discursive argumentative sarcastic drag net sort of speech which did all that could be done for the defense The solicitor briefly closed seriously and confidently confining himself to a repetition of the matters first insisted and answering some of the points of the counsel It was an ominous fact that a juror before the jury retired under leave of the court recalled a witness for the purpose of putting a question to him the question was how much the defendants were worth the answer was about two thousand dollars The jury shortly after returned into the court with a verdict which sized their pile THE PRAYER OF CYRUS BROWN BY SAM WALTER FOSS The proper way for a man to pray Said Deacon Lemuel Keyes And the only proper attitude Is down upon his knees No I should say the way to pray Said reverend doctor Wise Is standing straight with outstretched arms And rapt and upturned eyes Oh no no no said Elder Slow Such posture is too proud A man should pray with eyes fast closed And head contritely bowed It seems to me his hands should be Austerely clasped in front With both thumbs pointing toward the ground Said reverend doctor Blunt Las year I fell in Hodgkin s well Head first said Cyrus Brown With both my heels a stickin up My head a pinting down An I made a prayer right then an there Best prayer I ever said The prayingest prayer I ever prayed A standing on my head Well told and dramatically strong it breathes again the spirit of Dumas and Bulwer Lytton Portland Oregonian The Palace of Danger A STORY OF LA POMPADOUR By MABEL WAGNALLS Author of Stars of the Opera Miserere et cetera There have been few groups of characters who have been used more frequently in fiction than the members of the court
