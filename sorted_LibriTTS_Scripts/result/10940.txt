Dress During the Middle Ages and During the Renaissance Period By Paul Lacroix Bibliophile Jacob Curator of the Imperial Library of the Arsenal Paris Illustrated with Nineteen Chromolithographic Prints by F Kellerhoven and upwards of Four Hundred Engravings on Wood Preface The several successive editions of The Arts of the Middle Ages and Period of the Renaissance sufficiently testify to its appreciation by the public The object of that work was to introduce the reader to a branch of learning to which access had hitherto appeared only permitted to the scientific That attempt which was a bold one succeeded too well not to induce us to push our researches further In fact art alone cannot acquaint us entirely with an epoch The arts considered in their generality are the true expressions of society They tell us its tastes its ideas and its character We thus spoke in the preface to our first work and we find nothing to modify in this opinion Art must be the faithful expression of a society since it represents it by its works as it has created them undeniable witnesses of its spirit and manners for future generations But it must be acknowledged that art is only the consequence of the ideas which it expresses it is the fruit of civilisation not its origin To understand the Middle Ages and the Renaissance it is necessary to go back to the source of its art and to know the life of our fathers these are two inseparable things which entwine one another and become complete one by the other The Manners and Customs of the Middle Ages this subject is of the greatest interest not only to the man of science but to the man of the world also In it too we retrace not only one single period but two periods quite distinct one from the other In the first the public and private customs offer a curious mixture of barbarism and civilisation We find barbarian Roman and Christian customs and character in presence of each other mixed up in the same society and very often in the same individuals Everywhere the most adverse and opposite tendencies display themselves What an ardent struggle during that long period and how full too of emotion is its picture Society tends to reconstitute itself in every aspect She wants to create so to say from every side property authority justice c c in a word everything which can establish the basis of public life and this new order of things must be established by means of the elements supplied at once by the barbarian Roman and Christian world a prodigious creation the working of which occupied the whole of the Middle Ages Hardly does modern society civilised by Christianity reach the fullness of its power than it divides itself to follow different paths Ancient art and literature resuscitates because custom insensibly takes that direction Under that influence everything is modified both in private and public life The history of the human race does not present a subject more vast or more interesting It is a subject we have chosen to succeed our first book and which will be followed by a similar study on the various aspects of Religious and Military Life This work devoted to the vivid and faithful description of the Manners and Customs of the Middle Ages and Renaissance answers fully to the requirements of contemporary times We are in fact no longer content with the chronological narration and simple nomenclatures which formerly were considered sufficient for education We no longer imagine that the history of our institutions has less interest than that of our wars nor that the annals of the humbler classes are irrelevant to those of the privileged orders We go further still What is above all sought for in historical works nowadays is the physiognomy the inmost character of past generations How did our fathers live is a daily question What institutions had they What were their political rights Can you not place before us their pastimes their hunting parties their meals and all sorts of scenes sad or gay which composed their home life We should like to follow them in public and private occupations and to know their manner of living hourly as we know our own In a high order of ideas what great facts serve as a foundation to our history and that of the modern world We have first royalty which weak and debased under the Merovingians rises and establishes itself energetically under Pepin and Charlemagne to degenerate under Louis le Debonnaire and Charles le Chauve After having dared a second time to found the Empire of the Caesars it quickly sees its sovereignty replaced by feudal rights and all its rights usurped by the nobles and has to struggle for many centuries to recover its rights one by one Feudalism evidently of Germanic origin will also attract our attention and we shall draw a rapid outline of this legislation which barbarian at the onset becomes by degrees subject to the rules of moral progress We shall ascertain that military service is the essence itself of the fief and that thence springs feudal right On our way we shall protest against civil wars and shall welcome emancipation and the formation of the communes Following the thousand details of the life of the people we shall see the slave become serf and the serf become peasant We shall assist at the dispensation of justice by royalty and nobility at the solemn sittings of parliaments and we shall see the complicated details of a strict ceremonial which formed an integral part of the law develop themselves before us The counters of dealers fairs and markets manufactures commerce and industry also merit our attention we must search deeply into corporations of workmen and tradesmen examining their statutes and initiating ourselves into their business Fashion and dress are also a manifestation of public and private customs for that reason we must give them particular attention And to accomplish the work we have undertaken we are lucky to have the conscientious studies of our old associates in the great work of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance to assist us such as those of Emile Begin Elzear Blaze Depping Benjamin Guerard Le Roux de Lincy H Martin Mary Lafon Francisque Michel A Monteil Rabutau Ferdinand Sere Horace de Viel Castel A de la Villegille Vallet de Viriville As in the volume of the Arts of the Middle Ages engraving and chromo lithography will come to our assistance by reproducing by means of strict fac similes the rarest engravings of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and the most precious miniatures of the manuscripts

Division of the Territory and Prerogatives attached to Landed Possessions Freemen and Tenants The Laeti the Colon the Serf and the Labourer who may be called the Origin of the Modern Lower Classes Formation of Communities Right of Mortmain The period known as the Middle Ages says the learned Benjamin Guerard is the produce of Pagan civilisation of Germanic barbarism and of Christianity It began in four hundred seventy six on the fall of Agustulus and ended in fourteen fifty three at the taking of Constantinople by Mahomet II and consequently the fall of two empires that of the West and that of the East marks its duration Its first act which was due to the Germans was the destruction of political unity and this was destined to be afterwards replaced by religions unity Then we find a multitude of scattered and disorderly influences growing on the ruins of central power The yoke of imperial dominion was broken by the barbarians but the populace far from acquiring liberty fell to the lowest degrees of servitude Instead of one despot it found thousands of tyrants and it was but slowly and with much trouble that it succeeded in freeing itself from feudalism Nothing could be more strangely troubled than the West at the time of the dissolution of the Empire of the Caesars nothing more diverse or more discordant than the interests the institutions and the state of society which were delivered to the Germans Figs one and two In fact it would be impossible in the whole pages of history to find a society formed of more heterogeneous or incompatible elements On the one side might be placed the Goths Burgundians Vandals Germans Franks Saxons and Lombards nations or more strictly hordes accustomed to rough and successful warfare and on the other the Romans including those people who by long servitude to Roman dominion had become closely allied with their conquerors Fig three There were on both sides freemen freedmen colons and slaves different ranks and degrees being however observable both in freedom and servitude This hierarchical principle applied itself even to the land which was divided into freeholds tributary lands lands of the nobility and servile lands thus constituting the freeholds the benefices the fiefs and the tenures It may be added that the customs and to a certain degree the laws varied according to the masters of the country so that it can hardly be wondered at that everywhere diversity and inequality were to be found and as a consequence that anarchy and confusion ruled supreme Illustration Figs one and two Costumes of the Franks from the Fourth to the Eighth Centuries collected by H de Vielcastel from original Documents in the great Libraries of Europe Illustration Fig three Costumes of Roman Soldiers Fig four Costume of German Soldiers From Miniatures on different Manuscripts from the Sixth to the Twelfth Centuries The Germans Fig four had brought with them over the Rhine none of the heroic virtues attributed to them by Tacitus when he wrote their history with the evident intention of making a satire on his countrymen Amongst the degenerate Romans whom those ferocious Germans had subjugated civilisation was reconstituted on the ruins of vices common in the early history of a new society by the adoption of a series of loose and dissolute habits both by the conquerors and the conquered Illustration Fig five Costumes of Slaves or Serfs from the Sixth to the Twelfth Centuries collected by H de Vielcastel from original Documents in the great Libraries of Europe In fact the conquerors contributed the worse share Fig five for whilst exercising the low and debasing instincts of their former barbarism they undertook the work of social reconstruction with a sort of natural and innate servitude To them liberty the desire for which caused them to brave the greatest dangers was simply the right of doing evil of obeying their ardent thirst for plunder Long ago in the depths of their forests they had adopted the curious institution of vassalage When they came to the West to create States instead of reducing personal power every step in their social edifice from the top to the bottom was made to depend on individual superiority To bow to a superior was their first political principle and on that principle feudalism was one day to find its base Servitude was in fact to be found in all conditions and ranks equally in the palace of the sovereign as in the dwellings of his subjects The vassal who was waited on at his own table by a varlet himself served at the table of his lord the nobles treated each other likewise according to their rank and all the exactions which each submitted to from his superiors and required to be paid to him by those below him were looked upon not as onerous duties but as rights and honours The sentiment of dignity and of personal independence which has become so to say the soul of modern society did not exist at all or at least but very slightly amongst the Germans If we could doubt the fact we have but to remember that these men so proud so indifferent to suffering or death would often think little of staking their liberty in gambling in the hope that if successful their gain might afford them the means of gratifying some brutal passion Illustration Fig six King or Chief of Franks armed with the Seramasax from a Miniature of the Ninth Century drawn by H de Vielcastel When the Franks took root in Gaul their dress and institutions were adopted by the Roman society Fig six This had the most disastrous influence in every point of view and it is easy to prove that civilisation did not emerge from this chaos until by degrees the Teutonic spirit disappeared from the world As long as this spirit reigned neither private nor public liberty existed Individual patriotism only extended as far as the border of a man s family and the nation became broken up into clans Gaul soon found itself parcelled off into domains which were almost independent of one another It was thus that Germanic genius became developed Illustration Fig seven The King of the Franks in the midst of the Military Chiefs who formed his Treuste or armed Court dictates the Salic Law Code of the Barbaric Laws Fac simile of a Miniature in the Chronicles of saint Denis a Manuscript of the Fourteenth Century Library of the Arsenal The advantages of acting together for mutual protection first established itself in families If any one suffered from an act of violence he laid the matter before his relatives for them jointly to seek reparation The question was then settled between the families of the offended person and the offender all of whom were equally associated in the object of vindicating a cause which interested them alone without recognising any established authority and without appealing to the law If the parties had sought the protection or advice of men of power the quarrel might at once take a wider scope and tend to kindle a feud between two nobles In any case the King only interfered when the safety of his person or the interests of his dominions were threatened Penalties and punishments were almost always to be averted by a money payment A son for instance instead of avenging the death of his father received from the murderer a certain indemnity in specie according to legal tariff and the law was thus satisfied The tariff of indemnities or compensations to be paid for each crime formed the basis of the code of laws amongst the principal tribes of Franks a code essentially barbarian and called the Salic law or law of the Salians Fig seven Such however was the spirit of inequality among the German races that it became an established principle for justice to be subservient to the rank of individuals The more powerful a man was the more he was protected by the law the lower his rank the less the law protected him The life of a Frank by right was worth twice that of a Roman the life of a servant of the King was worth three times that of an ordinary individual who did not possess that protecting tie On the other hand punishment was the more prompt and rigorous according to the inferiority of position of the culprit In case of theft for instance a person of importance was brought before the King s tribunal and as it respected the rank held by the accused in the social hierarchy little or no punishment was awarded In the case of the same crime by a poor man on the contrary the ordinary judge gave immediate sentence and he was seized and hung on the spot Inasmuch as no political institutions amongst the Germans were nobler or more just than those of the Franks and the other barbaric races we cannot accept the creed of certain historians who have represented the Germans as the true regenerators of society in Europe The two sources of modern civilisation are indisputably Pagan antiquity and Christianity After the fall of the Merovingian kings great progress was made in the political and social state of nations These kings who were but chiefs of undisciplined bands were unable to assume a regal character properly so called Their authority was more personal than territorial for incessant changes were made in the boundaries of their conquered dominions It was therefore with good reason that they styled themselves kings of the Franks and not kings of France Charlemagne was the first who recognised that social union so admirable an example of which was furnished by Roman organization and who was able with the very elements of confusion and disorder to which he succeeded to unite direct and consolidate diverging and opposite forces to establish and regulate public administrations to found and build towns and to form and reconstruct almost a new world Fig eight We hear of him assigning to each his place creating for all a common interest making of a crowd of small and scattered peoples a great and powerful nation in a word rekindling the beacon of ancient civilisation When he died after a most active and glorious reign of forty five years he left an immense empire in the most perfect state of peace Fig nine But this magnificent inheritance was unfortunately destined to pass into unworthy or impotent hands so that society soon fell back into anarchy and confusion The nobles in their turn invested with power were continually at war and gradually weakened the royal

nine Portrait of Charlemagne whom the Song of Roland names the King with the Grizzly Beard Fac simile of an Engraving of the End of the Sixteenth Century The revolution in society which took place under the Carlovingian dynasty had for its especial object that of rendering territorial what was formerly personal and as it were of destroying personality in matters of government The usurpation of lands by the great having been thus limited by the influence of the lesser holders everybody tried to become the holder of land Its possession then formed the basis of social position and as a consequence individual servitude became lessened and society assumed a more stable condition The ancient laws of wandering tribes fell into disuse and at the same time many distinctions of caste and race disappeared as they were incompatible with the new order of things As there were no more Salians Ripuarians nor Visigoths among the free men so there were no more colons laeti nor slaves amongst those deprived of liberty Illustrations Figs ten and eleven Present State of the Feudal Castle of Chateau Gaillard aux Andelys which was considered one of the strongest Castles of France in the Middle Ages and was rebuilt in the Twelfth Century by Richard Coeur de Lion Heads of families on becoming attached to the soil naturally had other wants and other customs than those which they had delighted in when they were only the chiefs of wandering adventurers The strength of their followers was not now so important to them as the security of their castles Fortresses took the place of armed bodies and at this time every one who wished to keep what he had entrenched himself to the best of his ability at his own residence The banks of rivers elevated positions and all inaccessible heights were occupied by towers and castles surrounded by ditches which served as strongholds to the lords of the soil Figs ten and eleven These places of defence soon became points for attack Out of danger at home many of the nobles kept watch like birds of prey on the surrounding country and were always ready to fall not only upon their enemies but also on their neighbours in the hope either of robbing them when off their guard or of obtaining a ransom for any unwary traveller who might fall into their hands Everywhere society was in ambuscade and waged civil war individual against individual without peace or mercy Such was the reign of feudalism It is unnecessary to point out how this system of perpetual petty warfare tended to reduce the power of centralisation and how royalty itself was weakened towards the end of the second dynasty When the descendants of Hugh Capet wished to restore their power by giving it a larger basis they were obliged to attack one after the other all these strongholds and practically to re annex each fief city and province held by these petty monarchs in order to force their owners to recognise the sovereignty of the King Centuries of war and negotiations became necessary before the kingdom of France could be as it were reformed Illustration Fig twelve Knights and Men at arms cased in Mail in the Reign of Louis le Gros from a Miniature in a Psalter written towards the End of the Twelfth Century The corporations and the citizens had great weight in restoring the monarchical power as well as in forming French nationality but by far the best influence brought to bear in the Middle Ages was that of Christianity The doctrine of one origin and of one final destiny being common to all men of all classes constantly acted as a strong inducement for thinking that all should be equally free Religious equality paved the way for political equality and as all Christians were brothers before God the tendency was for them to become as citizens equal also in law This transformation however was but slow and followed concurrently the progress made in the security of property At the onset the slave only possessed his life and this was but imperfectly guaranteed to him by the laws of charity laws which however year by year became of greater power He afterwards became colon or labourer Figs thirteen and fourteen working for himself under certain conditions and tenures paying fines or services which it is true were often very extortionate At this time he was considered to belong to the domain on which he was born and he was at least sure that that soil would not be taken from him and that in giving part of his time to his master he was at liberty to enjoy the rest according to his fancy The farmer afterwards became proprietor of the soil he cultivated and master not only of himself but of his lands certain trivial obligations or fines being all that was required of him and these daily grew less and at last disappeared altogether Having thus obtained a footing in society he soon began to take a place in provincial assemblies and he made the last bound on the road of social progress when the vote of his fellow electors sent him to represent them in the parliament of the kingdom Thus the people who had begun by excessive servitude gradually climbed to power Illustration Fig thirteen Labouring Colons Twelfth Century after a Miniature in a Manuscript of the Ste Chapelle of the National Library of Paris We will now describe more in detail the various conditions of persons of the Middle Ages The King who held his rights by birth and not by election enjoyed relatively an absolute authority proportioned according to the power of his abilities to the extent of his dominions and to the devotion of his vassals Invested with a power which for a long time resembled the command of a general of an army he had at first no other ministers than the officers to whom he gave full power to act in the provinces and who decided arbitrarily in the name of and representing the King on all questions of administration One minister alone approached the King and that was the chancellor who verified sealed and dispatched all royal decrees and orders As early however as the seventh century a few officers of state appeared who were specially attached to the King s person or household a count of the palace who examined and directed the suits brought before the throne a mayor of the palace who at one time raised himself from the administration of the royal property to the supreme power an arch chaplain who presided over ecclesiastical affairs a lord of the bedchamber charged with the treasure of the chamber and a count of the stables charged with the superintendence of the stables Illustration Fig fourteen Labouring Colons Twelfth Century after a Miniature in a Manuscript of the Ste Chapelle of the National Library of Paris For all important affairs the King generally consulted the grandees of his court but as in the five or six first centuries of monarchy in France the royal residence was not permanent it is probable the Council of State was composed in part of the officers who followed the King and in part of the noblemen who came to visit him or resided near the place he happened to be inhabiting It was only under the Capetians that the Royal Council took a permanent footing or even assembled at stated periods In ordinary times that is to say when he was not engaged in war the King had few around him besides his family his personal attendants and the ministers charged with the dispatch of affairs As he changed from one of his abodes to another he only held his court on the great festivals of the year Illustration Fig fifteen The Lords and Barons prove their Nobility by hanging their Banners and exposing their Coats of arms at the Windows of the Lodge of the Heralds After a Miniature of the Tournaments of King Rene Fifteenth Century MSS of the National Library of Paris Up to the thirteenth century there was strictly speaking no taxation and no public treasury The King received through special officers appointed for the purpose tributes either in money or in kind which were most variable but often very heavy and drawn almost exclusively from his personal and private properties In cases of emergency only he appealed to his vassals for pecuniary aid A great number of the grandees who lived far from the court either in state offices or on their own fiefs had establishments similar to that of the King Numerous and considerable privileges elevated them above other free men The offices and fiefs having become hereditary the order of nobility followed as a consequence and it then became highly necessary for families to keep their genealogical histories not only to gratify their pride but also to give them the necessary titles for the feudal advantages they derived by birth Fig fifteen Without this right of inheritance society which was still unsettled in the Middle Ages would soon have been dissolved This great principle sacred in the eyes both of great and small maintained feudalism and in so doing it maintained itself amidst all the chaos and confusion of repeated revolutions and social disturbances We have already stated and we cannot sufficiently insist upon this important point that from the day on which the adventurous habits of the chiefs of Germanic origin gave place to the desire for territorial possessions the part played by the land increased insensibly towards defining the position of the persons holding it Domains became small kingdoms over which the lord assumed the most absolute and arbitrary rights A rule was soon established that the nobility was inherent to the soil and consequently that the land ought to transmit to its possessors the rights of nobility This privilege was so much accepted that the long tenure of a fief ended by ennobling the commoner Subsequently by a sort of compensation which naturally followed lands on which rent had hitherto been paid became free and noble on passing to the possession of a noble At last however the contrary rule prevailed which caused the lands not to change quality in changing owners the noble could still possess the labourers s lands without losing his nobility but the labourer could be proprietor of a fief without thereby becoming a noble To the comites who according to Tacitus attached themselves to the fortunes of the Germanic chiefs succeeded the Merovingian leudes whose assembly formed the King s Council These leudes were persons of great importance owing to the number of their vassals and although they composed his ordinary Council they did not hesitate at times to declare themselves openly opposed to his will Illustration Fig sixteen Knight in War harness after a Miniature in a Psalter written and illuminated under Louis le Gros The name of leudes was abandoned under the second of the then French dynasties and replaced by that of fideles which in truth soon became a common designation of both the vassals of the Crown and those of the nobility Under the kings of the third dynasty the kingdom was divided into about one hundred and fifty domains which were called great fiefs of the crown and which were possessed in hereditary right by the members of the highest nobility placed immediately under the royal sovereignty and dependence Illustration Fig seventeen King Charlemagne receiving the Oath of Fidelity and Homage from one of his great Feudatories or High Barons Fac simile of a Miniature in Cameo of the Chronicles of saint Denis Manuscript of the Fourteenth Century Library of the Arsenal Vassals emanating directly from the King were then generally designated by the title of barons and mostly possessed strongholds The other nobles indiscriminately ranked as chevaliers or cnights a generic title to which was added that of banneret The fiefs of hauberk were bound to supply the sovereign with a certain number of knights covered with coats of mail and completely armed All knights were mounted in war Fig sixteen but knights who were made so in consequence of their high birth must not be confounded with those who became knights by some great feat in arms in the house of a prince or high noble nor with the members of the different orders of chivalry which were successively instituted such as the Knights of the Star the Genet the Golden Fleece Saint Esprit saint John of Jerusalem c Originally the possession of a benefice or fief meant no more than the privilege of enjoying the profits derived from the land a concession which made the holder dependent upon the proprietor He was in fact his man to whom he owed homage Fig seventeen service in case of war and assistance in any suit the proprietor might have before the King s tribunal The chiefs of German bands at first recompensed their companions in arms by giving them fiefs of parts of the territory which they had conquered but later on everything was equally given to be held in fief namely dignities offices rights and incomes or titles It is important to remark and it is in this alone that feudalism shows its social bearing that if the vassal owed obedience and devotion to his lord the lord in exchange owed protection to the vassal The rank of free man did not necessarily require the possession of land but the position of free men who did not hold fiefs was extremely delicate and often painful for they were by natural right dependent upon those on whose domain they resided In fact the greater part of these nobles without lands became by choice the King s men and remained attached to his service If this failed them they took lands on lease so as to support themselves and their families and to avoid falling into absolute servitude In the event of a change of proprietor they changed with the land into new hands Nevertheless it was not uncommon for them to be so reduced as to sell their freedom but in such cases they reserved the right should better times come of re purchasing their liberty by paying one fifth more than the sum for which they had sold it We thus see that in olden times as also later freedom was more or less the natural consequence of the possession of wealth or power on the part of individuals or families who considered themselves free in the midst of general dependence During the tenth century indeed if not impossible it was at least difficult to find a single inhabitant of the kingdom of France who was not the man of some one and who was either tied by rules of a liberal order or else was under the most servile obligations The property of the free men was originally the aleu which was under the jurisdiction of the royal magistrates The aleu gradually lost the greater part of its franchise and became liable to the common charges due on lands which were not freehold In ancient times all landed property of a certain extent was composed of two distinct parts one occupied by the owner constituted the domain or manor the other divided between persons who were more or less dependent formed what were called tenures These tenures were again divided according to the position of those who occupied them if they were possessed by free men who took the name of vassals they were called benefices or fiefs if they were let to laeti colons or serfs they were then called colonies or demesnes Illustration Fig eighteen Ploughmen Fac simile of a Miniature in a very ancient Anglo Saxon Manuscript published by Shaw with legend God Spede ye Plough and send us Korne enow The laeti occupied a rank between the colon and the serf They had less liberty than the colon over whom the proprietor only had an indirect and very limited power The colon only served the land whilst the laeti whether agriculturists or servants served both the land and the owner Fig eighteen They nevertheless enjoyed the right of possession and of defending themselves or prosecuting by law The serf on the contrary had neither city tribunal nor family The laeti had besides the power of purchasing their liberty when they had amassed sufficient for the purpose Serfs occupied the lowest position in the social ladder Fig nineteen They succeeded to slaves thus making thanks to Christianity a step towards liberty Although the civil laws barely protected them those of the Church continually stepped in and defended them from arbitrary despotism The time came when they had no direct masters and when the almost absolute dependence of serfs was changed by the nobles requiring them to farm the land and pay tithes and fees And lastly they became farmers and regular taxes took the place of tithes and fees The colons laeti and serfs all of whom were more or less tillers of the soil were so to speak the ancestors of the people of modern times those who remained devoted to agriculture were the ancestors of our peasants and those who gave themselves up to trades and commerce in the towns were the originators of the middle classes Illustration Fig nineteen Serf or Vassal of Tenth Century from Miniatures in the Dialogues of saint Gregory Manuscript No nine thousand nine hundred seventeen Royal Library of Brussels As early as the commencement of the third royal dynasty we find in the rural districts as well as in the towns a great number of free men and as the charters concerning the condition of lands and persons became more and more extended the tyranny of the great was reduced and servitude decreased During the following centuries the establishment of civic bodies and the springing up of the middle classes Fig twenty made the acquisition of liberty more easy and more general Nevertheless this liberty was rather theoretical than practical for if the nobles granted it nominally they gave it at the cost of excessive fines and the community which purchased at a high price the right of self administration did not get rid of any of the feudal charges imposed upon it Illustration Fig twenty Bourgeois at the End of Thirteenth Century Fac simile of Miniature in Manuscript No six thousand eight hundred twenty in the National Library of Paris Fortunately for the progress of liberty the civic bodies as if they had been providentially warned of the future in store for them never hesitated to accept from their lords civil or ecclesiastical conditions onerous though they were which enabled them to exist in the interior of the cities to which they belonged They formed a sort of small state almost independent for private affairs subject to the absolute power of the King and more or less tied by their customs or agreements with the local nobles They held public assemblies and elected magistrates whose powers embraced both the administration of civil and criminal justice police finance and the militia They generally had fixed and written laws Protected by ramparts each possessed a town hall hotel de ville a seal a treasury and a watch tower and it could arm a certain number of men either for its own defence or for the service of the noble or sovereign under whom it held its rights In no case could a community such as this exist without the sanction of the King who placed it under the safeguard of the Crown At first the kings blinded by a covetous policy only seemed to see in the issue of these charters an excellent pretext for extorting money If they consented to recognise them and even to help them against their lords it was on account of the enormous sacrifices made by the towns Later on however they affected on the contrary the greatest generosity towards the vassals who wished to incorporate themselves when they had understood that these institutions might become powerful auxiliaries against the great titulary feudalists but from the reign of Louis XI when the power of the nobles was much diminished and no longer inspired any terror to royalty the kings turned against their former allies the middle classes and deprived them successively of all the prerogatives which could prejudice the rights of the Crown The middle classes it is true acquired considerable influence afterwards by participation in the general and provincial councils After having victoriously struggled against the clergy and nobility in the assemblies of the three states or orders they ended by defeating royalty itself Louis le Gros in whose orders the style or title of bourgeois first appears eleven thirty four is generally looked upon as the founder of the franchise of communities in France but it is proved that a certain number of communities or corporations were already formally constituted before his accession to the throne The title of bourgeois was not however given exclusively to inhabitants of cities It often happened that the nobles with the intention of improving and enriching their domains opened a kind of asylum under the attractive title of Free Towns or New Towns where they offered to all wishing to establish themselves lands houses and a more or less extended share of privileges rights and liberties These congregations or families soon became boroughs and the inhabitants though agriculturists took the name of bourgeois Illustration Fig twenty one Costume of a Vilain or Peasant Fifteenth Century from a Miniature of La Danse Macabre Manuscript seven thousand three hundred ten of the National Library of Paris There was also a third kind of bourgeois whose influence on the extension of royal power was not less than that of the others There were free men who under the title of bourgeois of the King bourgeois du Roy kept their liberty by virtue of letters of protection given them by the King although they were established on lands of nobles whose inhabitants were deprived of liberty Further when a vilain that is to say the serf of a noble bought a lease of land in a royal borough it was an established custom that after having lived there a year and a day without being reclaimed by his lord and master he became a bourgeois of the King and a free man In consequence of this the serfs and vilains Fig twenty one emigrated from all parts in order to profit by these advantages to such a degree that the lands of the nobles became deserted by all the serfs of different degrees and were in danger of remaining uncultivated The nobility in the interests of their properties and to arrest this increasing emigration devoted themselves to improving the condition of persons placed under their dependence and attempted to create on their domains boroughs analogous to those of royalty But however liberal these ameliorations might appear to be it was difficult for the nobles not only to concede privileges equal to those emanating from the throne but also to ensure equal protection to those they thus enfranchised In spite of this however the result was that a double current of enfranchisement was established which resulted in the daily diminution of the miserable order of serfs and which whilst it emancipated the lower orders had the immediate result of giving increased weight and power to royalty both in its own domains and in those of the nobility and their vassals These social revolutions did not of course operate suddenly nor did they at once abolish former institutions for we still find that after the establishment of communities and corporations several orders of servitude remained At the close of the thirteenth century on the authority of Philippe de Beaumanoir the celebrated editor of Coutumes de Beauvoisis there were three states or orders amongst the laity namely the nobleman Fig twenty two the free man and the serf All noblemen were free but all free men were not necessarily noblemen Generally nobility descended from the father and franchise from the mother But according to many other customs of France the child as a general rule succeeded to the lower rank of his parents There were two orders of serfs one rigorously held in the absolute dependence of his lord to such a degree that the latter could appropriate during his life or after death if he chose all he possessed he could imprison him ill treat him as he thought proper without having to answer to any one but God the other though held equally in bondage was more liberally treated for unless he was guilty of some evil doing the lord could ask of him nothing during his life but the fees rents or fines which he owed on account of his servitude If one of the latter class of serfs married a free woman everything which he possessed became the property of his lord The same was the case when he died for he could not transmit any of his goods to his children and was only allowed to dispose by will of a sum of about five sous or about twenty five francs of modern money As early as the fourteenth century serfdom or servitude no longer existed except in mortmain of which we still have to speak Illustration The Court of Mary of Anjou Wife of Charles VII Her chaplain the learned Robert Blondel presents her with the allegorical Treatise of the Twelve Perils of Hell Which he composed for her fourteen fifty five Fac simile of a miniature from this work Bibl de l Arsenal Paris Mortmain consisted of the privation of the right of freely disposing of one s person or goods He who had not the power of going where he would of giving or selling of leaving by will or transferring his property fixed or movable as he thought best was called a man of mortmain Illustration Fig twenty two Italian Nobleman of the Fifteenth Century From a Playing card engraved on Copper about fourteen sixty Cabinet des Estampes National Library of Paris This name was apparently chosen because the hand considered the symbol of power and the instrument of donation was deprived of movement paralysed in fact struck as by death It was also nearly in this sense that men of the Church were also called men of mortmain because they were equally forbidden to dispose either in life or by will after death of anything belonging to them There were two kinds of mortmain real and personal one concerning land and the other concerning the person that is to say land held in mortmain did not change quality whatever might be the position of the person who occupied it and a man of mortmain did not cease to suffer the inconveniences of his position on whatever land he went to establish himself The mortmains were generally subject to the greater share of feudal obligations formerly imposed on serfs these were particularly to work for a certain time for their lord without receiving any wages or else to pay him the tax when it was due on certain definite occasions as for example when he married when he gave a dower to his daughter when he was taken prisoner of war when he went to the Holy Land c c What particularly characterized the condition of mortmains was that the lords had the right to take all their goods when they died without issue or when the children held a separate household and that they could not dispose of anything they possessed either by will or gift beyond a certain sum The noble who franchised mortmains imposed on them in almost all cases very heavy conditions consisting of fees labours and fines of all sorts In fact a mortmain person to be free not only required to be franchised by his own lord but also by all the nobles on whom he was dependent as well as by the sovereign If a noble franchised without the consent of his superiors he incurred a fine as it was considered a dismemberment or depreciation of the fief As early as the end of the fourteenth century the rigorous laws of mortmain began to fall into disuse in the provinces though if the name began to disappear the condition itself continued to exist The free men whether they belonged to the middle class or to the peasantry were nevertheless still subject to pay fines or obligations to their lords of such a nature that they must be considered to have been practically in the same position as mortmains In fact this custom had been so deeply rooted into social habits by feudalism that to make it disappear totally at the end of the eighteenth century it required three decrees of the National Convention July seventeen and October two seventeen ninety three and eight Ventose year II that is March two seventeen ninety four It is only just to state that twelve or fourteen years earlier Louis XVI had done all in his power towards the same purpose by suppressing mortmain both real or personal on the lands of the Crown and personal mortmain i e the

Municipalities in Italy Germany and France Municipal Institutions and Associations The Community The Middle Class Cities Cites Bourgeoises Origin of National Unity So as to understand the numerous charges dues and servitudes often as quaint as iniquitous and vexations which weighed on the lower orders during the Middle Ages we must remember how the upper class who assumed to itself the privilege of oppression on lands and persons under the feudal System was constituted The Roman nobles heirs to their fathers agricultural dominions succeeded for the most part in preserving through the successive invasions of the barbarians the influence attached to the prestige of birth and wealth they still possessed the greater part of the land and owned as vassals the rural populations The Grerman nobles on the contrary had not such extended landed properties but they appropriated all the strongest positions The dukes counts and marquises were generally of German origin The Roman race mixed with the blood of the various nations it had subdued was the first to infuse itself into ancient Society and only furnished barons of a secondary order These heterogeneous elements brought together with the object of common dominion constituted a body who found life and motion only in the traditions of Rome and ancient Germany From these two historical sources as is very judiciously pointed out by M Mary Lafon issued all the habits of the new society and particularly the rights and privileges assumed by the nobility These rights and privileges which we are about to pass summarily in review were numerous and often curious amongst them may be mentioned the rights of treasure trove the rights of wreck the rights of establishing fairs or markets rights of marque of sporting c The rights of treasure trove were those which gave full power to dukes and counts over all minerals found on their properties It was in asserting this right that the famous Richard Coeur de Lion King of England met his death Adhemar Viscount of Limoges had discovered in a field a treasure of which no doubt public report exaggerated the value for it was said to be large enough to model in pure gold and life size a Roman emperor and the members of his family at table Adhemar was a vassal of the Duke of Guienne and as a matter of course set aside what was considered the sovereign s share in his discovery but Richard refusing to concede any part of his privilege claimed the whole treasure On the refusal of the viscount to give it up he appeared under arms before the gates of the Castle of Chalus where he supposed that the treasure was hidden On seeing the royal standard the garrison offered to open the gates No answered Richard since you have forced me to unfurl my banner I shall only enter by the breach and you shall all be hung on the battlements The siege commenced and did not at first seem to favour the English for the besieged made a noble stand One evening as his troops were assaulting the place in order to witness the scene Richard was sitting at a short distance on a piece of rock protected with a target that is a large shield covered with leather and blades of iron which two archers held over him Impatient to see the result of the assault Richard pushed down the shield and that moment decided his fate eleven ninety nine An archer of Chalus who had recognised him and was watching from the top of the rampart sent a bolt from a crossbow which hit him full in the chest The wound however would perhaps not have been mortal but shortly after having carried the place by storm and in his delight at finding the treasure almost intact he gave himself up madly to degrading orgies during which he had already dissipated the greater part of his treasure and died of his wound twelve days later first having however graciously pardoned the bowman who caused his death The right of shipwrecks which the nobles of seaboard countries rarely renounced and of which they were the more jealous from the fact that they had continually to dispute them with their vassals and neighbours was the pitiless and barbaric right of appropriating the contents of ships happening to be wrecked on their shores Illustration Figs twenty four and twenty five Varlet or Squire carrying a Halberd with a thick Blade and Archer in Fighting Dress drawing the String of his Crossbow with a double handled Winch From the Miniatures of the Jouvencel and the Chroniques of Froissart Manuscripts of the Fifteenth Century Imperial Library of Paris When the feudal nobles granted to their vassals the right of assembling on certain days in order to hold fairs and markets they never neglected to reserve to themselves some tax on each head of cattle as well as on the various articles brought in and put up for sale As these fairs and markets never failed to attract a great number of buyers and sellers this formed a very lucrative tax for the noble Fig twenty six Illustration Fig twenty six Flemish Peasants at the Cattle Market Miniature of the Chroniques de Hainaut Manuscripts of the Fifteenth Century vol ii fol two hundred four Library of the Dukes of Burgundy Brussels The right of marque or reprisal was a most barbarous custom A famous example is given of it In ten twenty two William the Pious Count of Angouleme before starting for a pilgrimage to Rome made his three brothers who were his vassals swear to live in honourable peace and good friendship But notwithstanding their oath two of the brothers having invited the third to the Easter festivities seized him at night in his bed put out his eyes so that he might not find the way to his castle and cut out his tongue so that he might not name the authors of this horrible treatment The voice of God however denounced them and the Count of Angouleme shuddering with horror referred the case to his sovereign the Duke of Aquitaine William IV who immediately came and by fire and sword exercised his right of marque on the lands of the two brothers leaving them nothing but their lives and limbs after having first put out their eyes and cut out their tongues so as to inflict on them the penalty of retaliation The right of sporting or hunting was of all prerogatives that dearest to and most valued by the nobles Not only were the severest and even cruellest penalties imposed on vilains who dared to kill the smallest head of game but quarrels frequently arose between nobles of different degrees on the subject some pretending to have a feudal privilege of hunting on the lands of others Fig twenty seven From this tyrannical exercise of the right of hunting which the least powerful of the nobles only submitted to with the most violent and bitter feelings sprung those old and familiar ballads which indicate the popular sentiment on the subject In some of these songs the inveterate hunters are condemned by the order of Fairies or of the Fates either to follow a phantom stag for everlasting or to hunt like King Artus in the clouds and to catch a fly every hundred years The right of jurisdiction which gave judicial power to the dukes and counts in cases arising in their domains had no appeal save to the King himself and this was even often contested by the nobles as for instance in the unhappy case of Enguerrand de Coucy Enguerrand had ordered three young Flemish noblemen who were scholars at the Abbey of saint Nicholas des Bois to be seized and hung because not knowing that they were on the domain of the Lord of Coucy they had killed a few rabbits with arrows saint Louis called the case before him Enguerrand answered to the call but only to dispute the King s right and to claim the judgment of his peers The King without taking any notice of the remonstrance ordered Enguerrand to be locked up in the big tower of the Louvre and was nearly applying the law of retaliation to his case Eventually he granted him letters of pardon after condemning him to build three chapels where masses were continually to be said for the three victims to give the forest where the young scholars had been found hunting to the Abbey of saint Nicholas des Bois to lose on all his estates the rights of jurisdiction and sporting to serve three years in the Holy Land and to pay to the King a fine of twelve thousand five hundred pounds tournois It must be remembered that Louis IX although most generous in cases relating simply to private interests was one of the most stubborn defenders of royal prerogatives A right which feudalists had the greatest interest in observing and causing to be respected because they themselves might with their wandering habits require it at any moment was that of safe convoy or guidance This right was so powerful that it even applied itself to the lower orders and its violation was considered the most odious crime thus in the thirteenth century the King of Aragon was severely abused by all persons and all classes because in spite of this right he caused a Jew to be burned so as not to have to pay a debt which the man claimed of him Illustration Fig twenty seven Nobleman in Hunting Costume preceded by his Servant trying to find the Scent of a Stag From a Miniature in the Book of Gaston Phoebus Des Deduitz de la Chasse des Bestes Sauvaiges Manuscript of the Fourteenth Century National Library of Paris The right of the Crown should also be mentioned which consisted of a circle of gold ornamented in various fashions according to the different degrees of feudal monarchy which vassals had to present to their lord on the day of his investiture The right of seal was a fee or fine they had to pay for the charters which their lord caused to be delivered to them The duty of aubaine was the fine or due paid by merchants either in kind or money to the feudal chief when they passed near his castle landed in his ports or exposed goods for sale in his markets The nobles of second order possessed among their privileges that of wearing spurs of silver or gold according to their rank of knighthood the right of receiving double rations when prisoners of war the right of claiming a year s delay when a creditor wished to seize their land and the right of never having to submit to torture after trial unless they were condemned to death for the crime they had committed If a great baron for serious offences confiscated the goods of a noble who was his vassal the latter had a right to keep his palfrey the horse of his squire various pieces of his harness and armour his bed his silk robe his wife s bed one of her dresses her ring her cloth stomacher c The nobles alone possessed the right of having seats of honour in churches and in chapels Fig twenty eight and to erect therein funereal monuments and we know that they maintained this right so rigorously and with so much effrontery that fatal quarrels at times arose on questions of precedence The epitaphs the placing of tombs the position of a monument were all subjects for conflicts or lawsuits The nobles enjoyed also the right of disinheritance that is to say of claiming the goods of a person dying on their lands who had no direct heir the right of claiming a tax when a fief or domain changed hands the right of common oven or requiring vassals to make use of the mill the oven or the press of the lord At the time of the vintage no peasant might sell his wine until the nobles had sold theirs Everything was a source of privilege for the nobles Kings and councils waived the necessity of their studying in order to be received as bachelors of universities If a noble was made a prisoner of war his life was saved by his nobility and his ransom had practically to be raised by the vilains of his domains The nobles were also exempted from serving in the militia nor were they obliged to lodge soldiers c They had a thousand pretexts for establishing taxes on their vassals who were generally considered taxable and to be worked at will Thus in the domain of Montignac the Count of Perigord claimed among other things as follows for every case of censure or complaint brought before him ten deniers for a quarrel in which blood was shed sixty sols if blood was not shed seven sols for use of ovens the sixteenth loaf of each baking for the sale of corn in the domain forty three setiers besides these six setiers of rye one hundred sixty one setiers of oats three setiers of beans one pound of wax eight capons seventeen hens and thirty seven loads of wine There were a multitude of other rights due to him including the provostship fees the fees on deeds the tolls and furnaces of towns the taxes on salt on leather corn nuts fees for the right of fishing for the right of sporting which last gave the lord a certain part or quarter of the game killed and in addition the dime or tenth part of all the corn wine c c Illustration Fig twenty eight Jean Jouvenel des Ursins Provost of the Merchants of Paris and Michelle de Vitry his Wife in the Reign of Charles VI Fragment of a Picture of the Period which was in the Chapel of the Ursinus and is now in the Versailles Museum This worthy noble gathered in besides all this during the religious festivals of the year certain tributes in money on the estate of Montignac alone amounting to as much as twenty thousand pounds tournois One can judge by this rough sketch of the income he must have had both in good and bad years from his other domains in the rich county of Perigord It must not be imagined that this was an exceptional case all over the feudal territory the same state of things existed and each lord farmed both his lands and the persons whom feudal right had placed under his dependence Illustration Fig twenty nine Dues on Wines granted to the Chapter of Tournai by King Chilperic From the Windows of the Cathedral of Tournai Fifteenth Century To add to these already excessive rates and taxes there were endless dues under all shapes and names claimed by the ecclesiastical lords Figs twenty nine and thirty And not only did the nobility make without scruple these enormous exactions but the Crown supported them in avenging any act however opposed to all sense of justice so that the nobles were really placed above the great law of equality without which the continuance of social order seemed normally impossible The history of the city of Toulouse gives us a significant example on this subject Illustration Fig thirty The Bishop of Tournai receiving the Tithe of Beer granted by King Chilperic From the Windows of the Cathedral of Tournai Fifteenth Century On Easter Day thirteen thirty five some students of the university who had passed the night of the anniversary of the resurrection of our Saviour in drinking left the table half intoxicated and ran about the town during the hours of service beating pans and cauldrons and making such a noise and disturbance that the indignant preachers were obliged to stop in the middle of their discourses and claimed the intervention of the municipal authorities of Toulouse One of these the lord of Gaure went out of church with five sergeants and tried himself to arrest the most turbulent of the band But as he was seizing him by the body one of his comrades gave the lord a blow with a dagger which cut off his nose lips and part of his chin This occurrence aroused the whole town Toulouse had been insulted in the person of its first magistrate and claimed vengeance The author of the deed named Aimeri de Berenger was seized judged condemned and beheaded and his body was suspended on the spikes of the Chateau Narbonnais

thousand three hundred ninety five National Library of Paris Toulouse had to pay dearly for the respect shown to its municipal dignity The parents of the student presented a petition to the King against the city for having dared to execute a noble and to hang his body on a gibbet in opposition to the sacred right which this noble had of appealing to the judgment of his peers The Parliament of Paris finally decided the matter with the inflexible partiality to the rights of rank and confiscated all the goods of the inhabitants forced the principal magistrates to go on their knees before the house of Aimeri de Berenger and ask pardon themselves to take down the body of the victim and to have it publicly and honourably buried in the burial ground of the Daurade Such was the sentence and humiliation to which one of the first towns of the south was subjected for having practised immediate justice on a noble whilst it would certainly have suffered no vindication if the culprit condemned to death had belonged to the middle or lower orders We must nevertheless remember that heavy dues fell upon the privileged class themselves to a certain degree and that if they taxed their poor vassals without mercy they had in their turn often to reckon with their superiors in the feudal hierarchy Albere or right of shelter was the principal charge imposed upon the noble When a great baron visited his lands his tenants were not only obliged to give him and his followers shelter but also provisions and food the nature and quality of which were all arranged beforehand with the most extraordinary minuteness The lesser nobles took advantage sometimes of the power they possessed to repurchase this obligation but the rich on the contrary were most anxious to seize the occasion of proudly displaying before their sovereign all the pomp in their power at the risk even of mortgaging their revenues for several years and of ruining their vassals History is full of stories bearing witness to the extravagant prodigalities of certain nobles on such occasions Payments in kind fell generally on the abbeys up to eleven fifty eight That of saint Denis which was very rich in lands was charged with supplying the house and table of the King This tax which became heavier and heavier eventually fell on the Parisians who only succeeded in ridding themselves of it in thirteen seventy four when Charles V made all the bourgeois of Paris noble In the twelfth century all furniture made of wood or iron which was found in the house of the Bishop at his death became the property of the King But in the fourteenth century the abbots of saint Denis saint Germain des Pres saint Genevieve Fig thirty two and a few priories in the neighbourhood of Paris were only required to present the sovereign with two horse loads of produce annually so as to keep up the old system of fines This system of rents and dues of all kinds was so much the basis of social organization in the Middle Ages that it sometimes happened that the lower orders benefited by it Thus the bed of the Bishop of Paris belonged after his death to the poor invalids of the Hotel Dieu The canons were also bound to leave theirs to that hospital as an atonement for the sins which they had committed The Bishops of Paris were required to give two very sumptuous repasts to their chapters at the feasts of saint Eloi and saint Paul The holy men of saint Martin were obliged annually on the tenth of November to offer to the first President of the Court of Parliament two square caps and to the first usher a writing desk and a pair of gloves The executioner too received from various monastic communities of the capital bread bottles of wine and pigs heads and even criminals who were taken to Montfaucon to be hung had the right to claim bread and wine from the nuns of saint Catherine and the Filles Dieux as they passed those establishments on their way to the gibbet Illustration Fig thirty two Front of the Ancient Church of the Abbey of Sainte Genevieve in Paris founded by Clovis and rebuilt from the Eleventh to Thirteenth Centuries State of the Building before its Destruction at the End of the Last Century Fines were levied everywhere at all times and for all sorts of reasons Under the name of epices the magistrates judges reporters and counsel who had at first only received sweetmeats and preserves as voluntary offerings eventually exacted substantial tribute in current coin Scholars who wished to take rank in the University sent some small pies costing ten sols to each examiner Students in philosophy or theology gave two suppers to the president eight to the other masters besides presenting them with sweetmeats c It would be an endless task to relate all the fines due by apprentices and companions before they could reach mastership in their various crafts nor have we yet mentioned certain fines which from their strange or ridiculous nature prove to what a pitch of folly men may be led under the influence of tyranny vanity or caprice Thus we read of vassals descending to the humiliating occupation of beating the water of the moat of the castle in order to stop the noise of the frogs during the illness of the mistress we elsewhere find that at times the lord required of them to hop on one leg to kiss the latch of the castle gate or to go through some drunken play in his presence or sing a somewhat broad song before the lady At Tulle all the rustics who had married during the year were bound to appear on the Puy or Mont saint Clair At twelve o clock precisely three children came out of the hospital one beating a drum violently the other two carrying a pot full of dirt a herald called the names of the bride grooms and those who were absent or were unable to assist in breaking the pot by throwing stones at it paid a fine At Perigueux the young couples had to give the consuls a pincushion of embossed leather or cloth of different colours a woman marrying a second time was required to present them with an earthen pot containing twelve sticks of different woods a woman marrying for the third time a barrel of cinders passed thirteen times through the sieve and thirteen spoons made of wood of fruit trees and lastly one coming to the altar for the fifth time was obliged to bring with her a small tub containing the excrement of a white hen The people of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance period were literally tied down with taxes and dues of all sorts says M Mary Lafon If a few gleams of liberty reached them it was only from a distance and more in the hope of the future than as regarded the present As an example of the way people were treated a certain Lord of Laguene spoken of in the old chronicles of the south may be mentioned Every year this cunning baron assembled his tenants in the village square A large maypole was planted and on the top was attached a wren The lord pointing to the little bird declared solemnly that if any vilain succeeded in piercing him with an arrow he should be exempt from that year s dues The vilains shot away but to the great merriment of their lord never hit and so had to continue paying the dues Illustration Fig thirty three Ramparts of the Town of Aigues Mortes one of the Municipalities of Languedoc One can easily understand how such a system legalised by law hampered the efforts for freedom which a sense of human dignity was constantly raising in the bosoms of the oppressed The struggle was long often bloody and at times it seemed almost hopeless for on both sides it was felt that the contest was between two principles which were incompatible and one of which must necessarily end by annihilating the other Any compromise between the complete slavery and the personal freedom of the lower orders could only be a respite to enable these implacable adversaries to reinforce themselves so as to resume with more vigour than ever this desperate combat the issue of which was so long to remain doubtful Illustration Louis IV Leaving Alexandria on the twenty fourth of April fifteen oh seven To chastise the city of Genoa From a miniature by Jean Marot No five thousand ninety one Bibl nat le de Paris These efforts to obtain individual liberty displayed themselves more particularly in towns but although they became almost universal in the west they had not the same importance or character everywhere The feudal system had not everywhere produced the same consequences Thus whilst in ancient Gaul it had absorbed all social vitality we find that in Germany the place of its origin the Teutonic institutions of older date gave a comparative freedom to the labourers In southern countries again we find the same beneficial effect from the Roman rule On that long area of land reaching from the southern slope of the Cevennes to the Apennines the hand of the barbarian had weighed much less heavily than on the rest of Europe In those favoured provinces where Roman organization had outlived Roman patronage it seems as if ancient splendour had never ceased to exist and the elegance of customs re flourished amidst the ruins There a sort of urban aristocracy always continued as a balance against the nobles and the counsel of elected prud hommes the syndics jurors or capitouls who in the towns replaced the Roman honorati and curiales still were considered by kings and princes as holding some position in the state The municipal body larger more open than the old ward no longer formed a corporation of unwilling aristocrats enchained to privileges which ruined them The principal cities on the Italian coast had already amassed enormous wealth by commerce and displayed the most remarkable ardour activity and power The Eternal City which was disputed by emperors popes and barons of the Roman States bestirred itself at times to snatch at the ancient phantom of republicanism and this phantom was destined soon to change into reality and another Rome or rather a new Carthage the lovely Venice arose free and independent from the waves of the Adriatic Fig thirty four In Lombardy so thickly colonised by the German conquerors feudalism on the contrary weighed heavily but there too the cities were populous and energetic and the struggle for supremacy continued for centuries in an uncompromising manner between the people and the nobles between the Guelphs and the Ghibellines In the north and east of the Gallic territory the instinct of resistance did not exist any the less though perhaps it was more intermittent In fact in these regions we find ambitious nobles forestalling the action of the King and in order to attach towns to themselves and their houses suppressing the most obnoxious of the taxes and at the same time granting legal guarantees For this the Counts of Flanders became celebrated and the famous Heribert de Vermandois was noted for being so exacting in his demands with the great and yet so popular with the small Illustration Fig thirty four View of saint Mark s Place Venice Sixteenth Century after Cesare Vecellio The eleventh century during which feudal power rose to its height was also the period when a reaction set in of the townspeople against the nobility The spirit of the city revived with that of the bourgeois a name derived from the Teutonic word burg habitation and infused a feeling of opposition to the system which followed the conquest of the Teutons But says M Henri Martin what reappeared was not the Roman municipality of the Empire stained by servitude although surrounded with glittering pomp and gorgeous arts but it was something coarse and almost semi barbarous in form though strong and generous at core and which as far as the difference of the times would allow rather reminds us of the small republics which existed previous to the Roman Empire Two strong impulses originating from two totally dissimilar centres of action irresistibly propelled this great social revolution with its various and endless aspects affecting all central Europe and being more or less felt in the west the north and the south On one side the Greek and Latin partiality for ancient corporations modified by a democratic element and an innate feeling of opposition characteristic of barbaric tribes and on the other the free spirit and equality of the old Celtic tribes rising suddenly against the military hierarchy which was the offspring of conquest Europe was roused by the double current of ideas which simultaneously urged her on to a new state of civilisation and more particularly to a new organization of city life Italy was naturally destined to be the country where the new trials of social regeneration were to be made but she presented the greatest possible variety of customs laws and governments including Emperor Pope bishops and feudal princes In Tuscany and Liguria the march towards liberty was continued almost without effort whilst in Lombardy on the contrary the feudal resistance was very powerful Everywhere however cities became more or less completely enfranchised though some more rapidly than others In Sicily feudalism swayed over the countries but in the greater part of the peninsula the democratic spirit of the cities influenced the enfranchisement of the rural population The feudal caste was in fact dissolved the barons were transformed into patricians of the noble towns which gave their republican magistrates the old title of consuls The Teutonic Emperor in vain sought to seize and turn to his own interest the sovereignty of the people who had shaken off the yokes of his vassals the signal of war was immediately given by the newly enfranchised masses and the imperial eagle was obliged to fly before the banners of the besieged cities Happy indeed might the cities of Italy have been had they not forgotten in their prosperity that union alone could give them the possibility of maintaining that liberty which they so freely risked in continual quarrels amongst one another Illustration Fig thirty five William Duke of Normandy accompanied by Eustatius Count of Boulogne and followed by his Knights in arms Military Dress of the Eleventh Century from Bayeux Tapestry said to have been worked by Queen Matilda The Italian movement was immediately felt on the other side of the Alps In Provence Septimanie and Aquitaine we find in the eleventh century cities which enjoyed considerable freedom Under the name of communities and universities which meant that all citizens were part of the one body they jointly interfered in the general affairs of the kingdom to which they belonged Their magistrates were treated on a footing of equality with the feudal nobility and although the latter at first would only recognise them as good men or notables the consuls knew how to make a position for themselves in the hierarchy If the consulate which was a powerful expression of the most prominent system of independence did no succeed in suppressing feudalism in Provence as in Italy it at least so transformed it that it deprived it of its most unjust and insupportable elements At Toulouse for instance where the consuls were by exception called capitouls that is to say heads of the chapters or councils of the city the lord of the country seemed less a feudal prince in his capital than an honorary magistrate of the bourgeoisie Avignon added to her consuls two podestats from the Latin potestas power At Marseilles the University of the high city was ruled by a republic under the presidency of the Count of Provence although the lower city was still under the sovereignty of a viscount Perigueux which was divided into two communities the great and the small fraternity took up arms to resist the authority of the Counts of Perigord and Arles under its podestats was governed for some time as a free and imperial town Amongst the constitutions which were established by the cities from the eleventh to the sixteenth centuries we find admirable examples of administration and government so that one is struck with admiration at the efforts of intelligence and patriotism often uselessly lavished on such small political arenas The consulate which nominally at least found its origin in the ancient grandeur of southern regions did not spread itself beyond Lyons In the centre of France at Poictiers Tours Moulin c the urban progress only manifested itself in efforts which were feeble and easily suppressed but in the north on the contrary in the provinces between the Seine and the Rhine and even between the Seine and the Loire the system of franchise took footing and became recognised In some places the revolution was effected without difficulty but in others it gave rise to the most determined struggles In Normandy for instance under the active and intelligent government of the dukes of the race of Roll or Rollon the middle class was rich and even warlike It had access to the councils of the duchy and when it was contemplated to invade England the Duke William Fig thirty five found support from the middle class both in money and men The case was the same in Flanders where the towns of Ghent Fig thirty six of Bruges of Ypres after being enfranchised but a short time developed with great rapidity But in the other counties of western France the greater part of the towns were still much oppressed by the counts and bishops If some obtained certain franchises these privileges were their ultimate ruin owing to the ill faith of their nobles A town between the Loire and the Seine gave the signal which caused the regeneration of the North The inhabitants of Mans formed a community or association and took an oath that they would obtain and maintain certain rights They rebelled about ten seventy and forced the count and his noble vassals to grant them the freedom which they had sworn to obtain though William of Normandy very soon restored the rebel city to order and dissolved the presumptuous community However the example soon bore fruit Cambrai rose in its turn and proclaimed the Commune and although its bishop aided by treason and by the Count of Hainault reduced it to obedience it only seemed to succumb for a time to renew the struggle with greater success at a subsequent period Illustration Fig thirty six Civic Guard of Ghent Brotherhood of saint Sebastian from a painting on the Wall of the Chapel of saint John and saint Paul Ghent near the Gate of Bruges We have just mentioned the Commune but we must not mistake the true meaning of this word which under a Latin form communitas expresses originally a Germanic idea and in its new form a Christian mode of living Societies of mutual defence guilds c had never disappeared from Germanic and Celtic countries and indeed knighthood itself was but a brotherhood of Christian warriors The societies of the Paix de Dieu and of the Treve de Dieu were encouraged by the clergy in order to stop the bloody quarrels of the nobility and formed in reality great religious guilds This idea of a body of persons taking some common oath to one another of which feudalism gave so striking an example could not fail to influence the minds of the rustics and the lower classes and they only wanted the opportunity which the idea of the Commune at once gave them of imitating their superiors They too took oaths and possessed their bodies and souls in common they seized by force of strategy the ramparts of their towns they elected mayors aldermen and jurors who were charged to watch over the interests of their association They swore to spare neither their goods their labour nor their blood in order to free themselves and not content with defending themselves behind barricades or chains which closed the streets they boldly took the offensive against the proud feudal chiefs before whom their fathers had trembled and they forced the nobles who now saw themselves threatened by this armed multitude to acknowledge their franchise by a solemn covenant It does not follow that everywhere the Commune was established by means of insurrection for it was obtained after all sorts of struggles and franchises were sold in some places for gold and in others granted by a more or less voluntary liberality Everywhere the object was the same everywhere they struggled or negotiated to upset by a written constitution or charter the violence and arbitrary rule under which they had so long suffered and to replace by an annual and fixed rent under the protection of an independent and impartial law the unlimited exactions and disguised plundering so long made by the nobility and royalty Circumstanced as they were what other means had they to attain this end but ramparts and gates a common treasury a permanent military force and magistrates who were both administrators judges and captains The hotel de ville or mansion house immediately became a sort of civic temple where the banner of the Commune the emblems of unity and the seal which sanctioned the municipal acts were preserved Then arose the watch towers where the watchmen were unceasingly posted night and day and whence the alarm signal was ever ready to issue its powerful sounds when danger threatened the city These watch towers the monuments of liberty became as necessary for the burghers as the clock towers of their cathedrals whose brilliant peals and joyous chimes gave zest to the popular feasts Fig thirty seven The mansion houses built in Flanders from the fourteenth to the sixteenth centuries under municipal influence are marvels of architecture Illustration Fig thirty seven Chimes of the Clock of saint Lambert of Liege Who is there who could thoroughly describe or even appreciate all the happy or unhappy vicissitudes relating to the establishment of the Communes We read of the Commune of Cambrai four times created four times destroyed and which was continually at war with the Bishops the Commune of Beauvais sustained on the contrary by the diocesan prelate against two nobles who possessed feudal rights over it Laon a commune bought for money from the bishop afterwards confirmed by the King and then violated by fraud and treachery and eventually buried in the blood of its defenders We read also of saint Quentin where the Count of Vermandois and his vassals voluntarily swore to maintain the right of the bourgeois and scrupulously respected their oath In many other localities the feudal dignitaries took alarm simply at the name of Commune and whereas they would not agree to the very best arrangements under this terrible designation they did not hesitate to adopt them when called either the laws of friendship the peace of God or the institutions of peace At Lisle for instance the bourgeois magistrates took the name of appeasers or watchers over friendship At Aire in Artois the members of friendship mutually not only helped one another against the enemy but also assisted one another in distress Illustration Fig thirty eight The Deputies of the burghers of Ghent in revolt against their Sovereign Louis II Count of Flanders

cities which dearly purchased their privileges The most terrible and sanguinary war was sustained by the bourgeois against their count and lord of the manor assisted by King Louis le Gros who had under similar circumstances just taken the part of the nobles of Laon From Amiens which having been triumphant became a perfect municipal republic the example propagated itself throughout the rest of Picardy the Isle of France Normandy Brittany and Burgundy and by degrees without any revolutionary shocks reached the region of Lyons where the consulate a characteristic institution of southern Communes ended From Flanders also the movement spread in the direction of the German Empire and there too the struggle was animated and victorious against the aristocracy until at last the great system of enfranchisement prevailed and the cities of the west and south formed a confederation against the nobles whilst those in the north formed the famous Teutonic Hanse so celebrated for its maritime commerce The centre of France slowly followed the movement but its progress was considerably delayed by the close influence of royalty which sometimes conceded large franchises and sometimes suppressed the least claims to independence The kings who willingly favoured Communes on the properties of their neighbours did not so much care to see them forming on their own estates unless the exceptional position and importance of any town required a wise exercise of tolerance Thus Orleans situated in the heart of the royal domains was roughly repulsed in its first movement whilst Mantes which was on the frontier of the Duchy of Normandy and still under the King of England had but to ask in order to receive its franchise from the King of France It was particularly in the royal domains that cities were to be found which although they did not possess the complete independence of communes had a certain amount of liberty and civil guarantees They had neither the right of war the watch tower nor the exclusive jurisdiction over their elected magistrates for the bailiffs and the royal provosts represented the sovereign amongst them Fig thirty nine Illustration Fig thirty nine

could the kings consent to the organization of an independent political System although that city succeeded in creating for itself a municipal existence The middle class influence originated in a Gallo Roman corporation The Company of Nautes or the Corporation of the Water Trade formed a centre round which were successively attached various bodies of different trades Gradually a strong concourse of civic powers was established which succeeded in electing a municipal council composed of a provost of merchants four aldermen and twenty six councillors of the town This council afterwards succeeded in overstepping the royal influence at difficult times and was destined to play a prominent part in history There also sprang up a lower order of towns or boroughs than these bourgeois cities which were especially under the Crown Not having sufficient strength to claim a great amount of liberty they were obliged to be satisfied with a few privileges conceded to them by the nobles for the most part with a political end These were the Free Towns or New Towns which we have already named However it came about it is certain that although during the tenth century feudal power was almost supreme in Europe as early as the twelfth century the municipal system had gained great weight and was constantly progressing until the policy of the kingdom became developed on a more and more extended basis so that it was then necessary for it to give up its primitive nature and to participate in the great movement of consolidisation and national unity In this way the position of the large towns in the state relatively lost their individual position and became somewhat analogous as compared with the kingdom at large to that formerly held by bourgeois in the cities Friendly ties arose between provinces and distinct and rival interests were effaced by the general aspiration towards common objects The towns were admitted to the states general and the citizens of various regions mixed as representatives of the Tiers Etat Three orders thus met who were destined to struggle for predominance in the future We must call attention to the fact that as M Henri Martin says by an apparent contradiction the fall of the Communes declared itself in inverse ratio to the progress of the Tiers Etat By degrees as the government became more settled from the great fiefs being absorbed by the Crown and as parliament and other courts of appeal which emanated from the middle class extended their high judiciary and military authority so the central power organized under monarchical form must necessarily have been less disposed to tolerate the local independence of the Communes The State replaced the Commune for everything concerning justice war and administration No doubt some valuable privileges were lost but that was only an accidental circumstance for a great social revolution was produced which cleared off at once all the relics of the old age and when the work of reconstruction terminated homage was rendered to the venerable name of Commune which became uniformly applied to all towns boroughs or villages into which the new spirit of the same municipal system was infused Illustration Fig forty Various Arms of the Fifteenth Century Private Life in the Castles the Towns and the Rural Districts The Merovingian Castles Pastimes of the Nobles Hunting War

Arsenal Although historical documents are not very explicit respecting those remote times it is only sufficient to study carefully a very small portion of the territory in order to form some idea of the manners and customs of the Franks for in the royal domain we find the existence of all classes from the sovereign himself down to the humblest slave As regards the private life however of the different classes in this elementary form of society we have but approximate and very imperfect notions It is clear however that as early as the beginning of the Merovingian race there was much more luxury and comfort among the upper classes than is generally supposed All the gold and silver furniture all the jewels and all the rich stuffs which the Gallo Romans had amassed in their sumptuous dwellings had not been destroyed by the barbarians The Frank Kings had appropriated the greater part and the rest had fallen into the hands of the chiefs of companies in the division of spoil A well known anecdote namely that concerning the Vase of Soissons Fig forty one which King Clovis wished to preserve and which a soldier broke with an axe proves that many gems of ancient art must have disappeared owing to the ignorance and brutality of the conquerors although it is equally certain that the latter soon adopted the tastes and customs of the native population At first they appropriated everything that flattered their pride and sensuality This is how the material remains of the civilisation of the Gauls were preserved in the royal and noble residences the churches and the monasteries Gregory of Tours informs us that when Fredegonde wife of Chilperic gave the hand of her daughter Rigouthe to the son of the Gothic king fifty chariots were required to carry away all the valuable objects which composed the princess s dower A strange family scene related by the same historian gives us an idea of the private habits of the court of that terrible queen of the Franks The mother and daughter had frequent quarrels which sometimes ended in the most violent encounters Fredegonde said one day to Rigouthe Why do you continually trouble me Here are the goods of your father take them and do as you like with them And conducting her to a room where she locked up her treasures she opened a large box filled with valuables After having pulled out a great number of jewels which she gave to her daughter she said I am tired put your own hands in the box and take what you find Rigouthe bent down to reach the objects placed at the bottom of the box upon which Fredegonde immediately lowered the lid on her daughter and pressed upon it with so much force that the eyes began to start out of the princess s head A maid began screaming Help my mistress is being murdered by her mother and Rigouthe was saved from an untimely end It is further related that this was only one of the minor crimes attributed by history to Fredegonde the Terrible who always carried a dagger or poison about with her Amongst the Franks as amongst all barbaric populations hunting was the pastime preferred when war was not being waged The Merovingian nobles were therefore determined hunters and it frequently happened that hunting occupied whole weeks and took them far from their homes and families But when the season or other circumstances prevented them from waging war against men or beasts they only cared for feasting and gambling To these occupations they gave themselves up with a determination and wildness well worthy of those semi civilised times It was the custom for invited guests to appear armed at the feasts which were the more frequent inasmuch as they were necessarily accompanied with religious ceremonies It often happened that these long repasts followed by games of chance were stained with blood either in private quarrels or in a general melee One can easily imagine the tumult which must have arisen in a numerous assembly when the hot wine and other fermented drinks such as beer c had excited every one to the highest pitch of unchecked merriment Illustration Fig forty two Costumes of the Women of the Court from the Sixth to the Tenth Centuries from Documents collected by H de Vielcastel in the great Libraries of Europe Some of the Merovingian kings listened to the advice of the ministers of the Catholic religion and tried to reform these noisy excesses and themselves abandoned the evil custom For this purpose they received at their tables bishops who blessed the assembly at the commencement of the meal and were charged besides to recite chapters of holy writ or to sing hymns out of the divine service so as to edify and occupy the minds of the guests Gregory of Tours bears witness to the happy influence of the presence of bishops at the tables of the Frank kings and nobles he relates too that Chilperic who was very proud of his theological and secular knowledge liked when dining to discuss or rather to pronounce authoritatively his opinion on questions of grammar before his companions in arms who for the most part neither knew how to read nor write he even went as far as to order three ancient Greek letters

Hotel de Cluny which then extended from the hill of saint Genevieve as far as the Seine but they frequently left it for their numerous villas in the neighbourhood on which occasions they were always accompanied by their treasury All these residences were built on the same plan High walls surrounded the palace The Roman atrium preserved under the name of proaulium preau ante court was placed in front of the salutorium hall of reception where visitors were received The consistorium or great circular hall surrounded with seats served for legislation councils public assemblies and other solemnities at which the kings displayed their royal pomp The trichorium or dining room was generally the largest hall in the palace two rows of columns divided it into three parts one for the royal family one for the officers of the household and the third for the guests who were always very numerous No person of rank visiting the King could leave without sitting at his table or at least draining a cup to his health The King s hospitality was magnificent especially on great religious festivals such as Christmas and Easter The royal apartments were divided into winter and summer rooms In order to regulate the temperature hot or cold water was used according to the season this circulated in the pipes of the hypocauste or the subterranean furnace which warmed the baths The rooms with chimneys were called epicaustoria stoves and it was the custom hermetically to close these when any one wished to be anointed with ointments and aromatic essences In the same manner as the Gallo Roman houses the palaces of the Frank kings and principal nobles of ecclesiastical or military order had thermes or bath rooms to the thermes were attached a colymbum or washhouse a gymnasium for bodily exercise and a hypodrome or covered gallery for exercise which must not be confounded with the hippodrome a circus where horse races took place Sometimes after the repast in the interval between two games of dice the nobles listened to a bard who sang the brilliant deeds of their ancestors in their native tongue Under the government of Charlemagne the private life of his subjects seems to have been less rough and coarse although they did not entirely give up their turbulent pleasures Science and letters for a long time buried in monasteries reappeared like beautiful exiles at the imperial court and social life thereby gained a little charm and softness Charlemagne had created in his palace under the direction of Alcuin a sort of academy called the School of the Palace which followed him everywhere The intellectual exercises of this school generally brought together all the members of the imperial family as well as all the persons of the household Charlemagne in fact was himself one of the most attentive followers of the lessons given by Alcuin He was indeed the principal interlocutor and discourser at the discussions which were on all subjects religions literary and philosophical Illustration Fig forty four Costumes of the Nobility from the Seventh to the Ninth Centuries from Documents gathered by H de Vielcastel from the great Libraries of Europe Charlemagne took as much pains with the administration of his palace as he did with that of his States In his Capitulaires a work he wrote on legislature we find him descending to the minutest details in that respect For instance he not only interested himself in his warlike and hunting equipages but also in his kitchen and pleasure gardens He insisted upon knowing every year the number of his oxen horses and goats he calculated the produce of the sale of fruits gathered in his orchards which were not required for the use of his house he had a return of the number of fish caught in his ponds he pointed out the shrubs best calculated for ornamenting his garden and the vegetables which were required for his table c The Emperor generally assumed the greatest simplicity in his dress His daily attire consisted of a linen shirt and drawers and a woollen tunic fastened with a silk belt Over this tunic he threw a cloak of blue stuff very long behind and before but very short on each side thus giving freedom to his arms to use his sword which he always wore On his feet he wore bands of stuffs of various colours crossed over one another and covering his legs also In winter when he travelled or hunted on horseback he threw over his shoulders a covering of otter or sheepskin The changes in fashion which the custom of the times necessitated but to which he would never submit personally induced him to issue several strenuous orders which however in reality had hardly any effect He was most simple as regards his food and drink and made a habit of having pious or historical works read to him during his repasts He devoted the morning which with him began in summer at sunrise and in winter earlier to the political administration of his empire He dined at twelve with his family the dukes and chiefs of various nations first waited on him and then took their places at the table and were waited on in their turn by the counts prefects and superior officers of the court who dined after them When these had finished the different chiefs of the household sat down and they were succeeded lastly by servants of the lower order who often did not dine till midnight and had to content themselves with what was left When occasion required however this powerful Emperor knew how to maintain the pomp and dignity of his station but as soon as he had done what was necessary either for some great religious festival or otherwise he returned as if by instinct to his dear and native simplicity It must be understood that the simple tastes of Charlemagne were not always shared by the princes and princesses of his family nor by the magnates of his court Fig forty five Poets and historians have handed down to us descriptions of hunts feasts and ceremonies at which a truly Asiatic splendour was displayed Eginhard however assures us that the sons and daughters of the King were brought up under their father s eye in liberal studios that to save them from the vice of idleness Charlemagne required his sons to devote themselves to all bodily exercises such as horsemanship handling of arms c and his daughters to do needlework and to spin From what is recorded however of the frivolous habits and irregular morals of these princesses it is evident that they but imperfectly realised the end of their education Illustration Fig forty five Costumes of the Ladies of the Nobility in the Ninth Century from a Miniature in the Bible of Charles the Bold National Library of Paris Science and letters which for a time were brought into prominence by Charlemagne and also by his son Louis who was very learned and was considered skilful in translating and expounding Scripture were however after the death of these two kings for a long time banished to the seclusion of the cloisters owing to the hostile rivalry of their successors which favoured the attacks of the Norman pirates All the monuments and relics of the Gallo Roman civilisation which the great Emperor had collected disappeared in the civil wars or were gradually destroyed by the devastations of the northerners The vast empire which Charlemagne had formed became gradually split up so that from a dread of social destruction in order to protect churches and monasteries as well as castles and homesteads from the attacks of internal as well as foreign enemies towers and impregnable fortresses began to rise in all parts of Europe and particularly in France Illustration Fig forty six Towers of the Castle of Semur and of the Castle of Nogent le Rotrou Present Condition Specimens of Towers of the Thirteenth Century During the first period of feudalism that is to say from the middle of the ninth to the middle of the twelfth centuries the inhabitants of castles had little time to devote to the pleasures of private life They had not only to be continually under arms for the endless quarrels of the King and the great chiefs but they had also to oppose the Normans on one side and the Saracens on the other who being masters of the Spanish peninsula spread like the rising tide in the southern counties of Languedoc and Provence It is true that the Carlovingian warriors obtained a handsome and rich reward for these long and sanguinary efforts for at last they seized upon the provinces and districts which had been originally entrusted to their charge and the origin of their feudal possession was soon so far forgotten that their descendants pretended that they held the lands which they had really usurped regardless of their oath from heaven and their swords It is needless to say that at that time the domestic life in these castles must have been dull and monotonous although according to M Guizot the loneliness which was the resuit of this rough and laborious life became by degrees the pioneer of civilisation When the owner of the fief left his castle his wife remained there though in a totally different position from that which women generally held She remained as mistress representing her husband and was charged with the defence and honour of the fief This high and exalted position in the centre of domestic life often gave to women an opportunity of displaying dignity courage virtue and intelligence which would otherwise have remained hidden and no doubt contributed greatly to their moral development and to the general improvement of their condition Illustration Fig forty seven Woman under the Safeguard of Knighthood allegorical Scene Costume of the End of the Fifteenth Century from a Miniature in a Latin Psalm Book Manuscript No one hundred seventy five National Library of Paris The importance of children and particularly of the eldest son was greater in feudal houses than elsewhere The eldest son of the noble was in the eyes of his father and of all his followers a prince and heir presumptive and the hope and glory of the dynasty These feelings and the domestic pride and affection of the various members one to another united to give families much energy and power Add to this the influence of Christian ideas and it will be understood how this lonely dull and hard castle life was nevertheless favourable to the development of domestic society and to that improvement in the condition of women which plays such a great part in the history of our civilisation Illustration Fig forty eight Court of Love in Provence in the Fourteenth Century Manuscript of the National Library of Paris Whatever opinion may be formed of chivalry it is impossible to deny the influence which this institution exercised on private life in the Middle Ages It considerably modified custom by bringing the stronger sex to respect and defend the weaker These warriors who were both simple and externally rough and coarse required association and intercourse with women to soften them Fig forty seven In taking women and helpless widows under their protection they were necessarily more and more thrown in contact with them A deep feeling of veneration for woman inspired by Christianity and above all by the worship of the Virgin Mary ran throughout the songs of the troubadours and produced a sort of sentimental reverence for the gentle sex which culminated in the authority which women had in the courts of love Fig forty eight We have now reached the reign of Philip Augustus that is to say the end of the twelfth century This epoch is remarkable not only for its political history but also for its effect on civilisation Christianity had then considerably influenced the world arts sciences and letters animated by its influence again began to appear and to add charms to the leisure of private life The castles were naturally the first to be affected by this poetical and intellectual regeneration although it has been too much the custom to exaggerate the ignorance of those who inhabited them We are too apt to consider the warriors of the Middle Ages as totally devoid of knowledge and as hardly able to sign their names as far as the kings and princes are concerned This is quite an error for many of the knights composed poems which exhibit evidence of their high literary culture It was in fact the epoch of troubadours who might be called professional poets and actors who went from country to country and from castle to castle relating stories of good King Artus of Brittany and of the Knights of the Round Table repeating historical poems of the great Emperor Charlemagne and his followers These minstrels were always accompanied by jugglers and instrumentalists who formed a travelling troop Fig forty nine having no other mission than to amuse and instruct their feudal hosts After singing a few fragments of epics or after the lively recital of some ancient fable the jugglers would display their art or skill in gymnastic feats or conjuring which were the more appreciated by the spectators in that the latter were more or less able to compete with them These wandering troops acted small comedies taken from incidents of the times Sometimes too the instrumentalists formed an orchestra and dancing commenced It may be here remarked that dancing at this epoch consisted of a number of persons forming large circles and turning to the time of the music or the rhythm of the song At least the dances of the nobles are thus represented in the MSS of the Middle Ages To these amusements were added games of calculation and chance the fashion for which had much increased and particularly such games as backgammon draughts and chess to which certain knights devoted all their leisure From the reign of Philip Augustus a remarkable change seems to have taken place in the private life of kings princes and nobles Although his domains and revenues had always been on the increase this monarch never displayed in ordinary circumstances at least much magnificence The accounts of his private expenses for the years twelve oh two and twelve oh three have been preserved which enable us to discover some curious details bearing witness to the extreme simplicity of the court at that period The household of the King or royal family was still very small one chancellor one chaplain a squire a butler a few Knights of the Temple and some sergeants at arms were the only officers of the palace The king and princes of his household only changed apparel three times during the year Illustration Fig forty nine King David playing on the Lyre surrounded by four Musicians Costumes of the Thirteenth Century from a Miniature in a Manuscript Psalter in the Imperial Library Paris The children of the King slept in sheets of serge and their nurses were dressed in gowns of dark coloured woollen stuff called brunette The royal cloak which was of scarlet was jewelled but the King only wore it on great ceremonies At the same time enormous expenses were incurred for implements of war arrows helmets with visors chariots and for the men at arms whom the King kept in his pay Louis IX personally kept up almost similar habits The Sire de Joinville tells us in his Chronicles that the holy King on his return from his first crusade in order to repair the damage done to his treasury by the failure of this expedition would no longer wear costly furs nor robes of scarlet and contented himself with common stuffs trimmed with hare skin He nevertheless did not diminish the officers of his household which had already become numerous and being no doubt convinced that royalty required magnificence he surrounded himself with as much pomp as the times permitted Under the two Philips his successors this magnificence increased and descended to the great vassals who were soon imitated by the knights bannerets There seemed to be a danger of luxury becoming so great and so general in all classes of feudal society that in twelve ninety four an order of the King was issued regulating in the minutest details the expenses of each person according to his rank in the State or the fortune which he could prove But this law had the fate of all such enactments and was either easily evaded or was only partially enforced and that with great difficulty Another futile attempt to put it in practice was made in thirteen oh six when the splendour of dress of equipages and of table had become still greater and more ruinous and had descended progressively to the bourgeois and merchants It must be stated in praise of Philip le Bel Fig fifty that notwithstanding the failure of his attempts to arrest the progress of luxury he was not satisfied with making laws against the extravagances of his subjects for we find that he studied a strict economy in his own household which recalled the austere times of Philip Augustus Thus in the curious regulations relating to the domestic arrangements of the palace the Queen Jeanne de Navarre was only allowed two ladies and three maids of honour in her suite and she is said to have had only two four horse carriages one for herself and the other for these ladies In another place these regulations require that a butler specially appointed should buy all the cloth and furs for the king take charge of the key of the cupboards where these are kept know the quantity given to the tailors to make clothes and check the accounts when the tailors send in their claims for the price of their work Illustration Fig fifty King Philip le Bel in War dress on the Occasion of his entering Paris in thirteen oh four after having conquered the Communes of Flanders Equestrian Statue placed in Notre Dame Paris and destroyed in seventeen seventy two Fac simile of a Woodcut from Thevet s Cosmographie Universelle fifteen seventy five After the death of the pious Jeanne de Navarre to whom perhaps we must attribute the wise measures of her husband Philip le Bel the expenses of the royal household materially increased especially on the occasions of the marriages of the three young sons of the King from thirteen oh five to thirteen oh seven Gold diamonds pearls and precious stones were employed profusely both for the King s garments and for those of the members of the royal family The accounts of thirteen oh seven mention considerable sums paid for carpets counterpanes robes worked linen c A chariot of state ornamented and covered with paintings and gilded like the back of an altar is also mentioned and must have been a great change to the heavy vehicles used for travelling in those days Down to the reign of saint Louis the furniture of castles had preserved a character of primitive simplicity which did not however lack grandeur The stone remained uncovered in most of the halls or else it was whitened with mortar and ornamented with moulded roses and leaves coloured in distemper Against the wall and also against the pillars supporting the arches arms and armour of all sorts were hung arranged in suits and interspersed with banners and pennants or emblazoned standards In the great middle hall or dining room there was a long massive oak table with benches and stools of the same wood At the end of this table there was a large arm chair overhung with a canopy of golden or silken stuff which was occupied by the owner of the castle and only relinquished by him in favour of his superior or sovereign Often the walls of the hall of state were hung with tapestry representing groves with cattle heroes of ancient history or events in the romance of chivalry The floor was generally paved with hard stone or covered with enamelled tiles It was carefully strewn with scented herbs in summer and straw in winter Philip Augustus ordered that the Hotel Dieu of Paris should receive the herbs and straw which was daily removed from the floors of his palace It was only very much later that this troublesome system was replaced by mats and carpets The bedrooms were generally at the top of the towers and had little else by way of furniture besides a very large bed with or without curtains a box in which clothes were kept and which also served as a seat and a priedieu chair which sometimes contained prayer and other books of devotion These lofty rooms whose thick walls kept out the heat in summer and the cold in winter were only lighted by a small window or loophole closed with a square of oiled paper or of thin horn A great change took place in the abodes of the nobility in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries Fig fifty one We find for instance in Sauval s History and Researches of the Antiquities of the City of Paris that the abodes of the kings of the first dynasty had been transformed into Palaces of Justice by Philip le Bel the same author also gives us a vivid description of the Chateau du Louvre and the Hotel saint Paul which the kings inhabited when their court was in the capital But even without examining into all the royal abodes it will suffice to give an account of the Hotel de Boheme which after having been the home of the Sires de Nesles of Queen Blanche of Castille and other great persons was given by Charles VI in thirteen eighty eight to his brother the famous Duke Louis of Orleans Illustration Fig fifty one The Knight and his Lady Costumes of the Court of Burgundy in the Fourteenth Century Furnished Chamber

porters lodges the stores the guard rooms the wood yard or the glass stores nor of the servants nor of the place where hypocras was made neither shall I describe the tapestry room the linen room nor the laundry nor indeed any of the various conveniences which were then to be found in the yards of that palace as well as in the other abodes of the princes and nobles I shall simply remark that amongst the many suites of rooms which composed it two occupied the two first stories of the main building the first was raised some few steps above the ground floor of the court and was occupied by Valentine de Milan and her husband Louis of Orleans generally occupied the second Each of these suites of rooms consisted of a great hall a chamber of state a large chamber a wardrobe some closets and a chapel The windows of the halls were thirteen and a half feet A high by four and a half wide The state chambers were eight toises that is about fifty feet and a half long The duke and duchess s chambers were six toises by three that is about thirty six feet by eighteen the others were seven toises and a half square all lighted by long and narrow windows of wirework with trellis work of iron the wainscots and the ceilings were made of Irish wood the same as at the Louvre Footnote A French feet In this palace there was a room used by the duke hung with cloth of gold bordered with vermilion velvet embroidered with roses the duchess had a room hung with vermilion satin embroidered with crossbows which were on her coat of arms that of the Duke of Burgundy was hung with cloth of gold embroidered with windmills There were besides eight carpets of glossy texture with gold flowers one representing The Seven Virtues and the Seven Vices another the history of Charlemagne another that of saint Louis There were also cushions of cloth of gold twenty four pieces of vermilion leather of Aragon and four carpets of Aragon leather to be placed on the floor of rooms in summer The favourite arm chair of the princess is thus described in an inventory A chamber chair with four supports painted in fine vermilion the seat and arms of which are covered with vermilion morocco or cordovan worked and stamped with designs representing the sun birds and other devices bordered with fringes of silk and studded with nails Among the ornamental furniture were A large vase of massive silver for holding sugar plums or sweetmeats shaped like a square table supported by four satyrs also of silver a fine wooden casket covered with vermilion cordovan nailed and bordered with a narrow gilt band shutting with a key Illustration Fig fifty two Bronze Chandeliers of the Fourteenth Century Collection of M Ach Jubinal In the daily life of Louis of Orleans and his wife everything corresponded with the luxury of their house Thus for the amusement of their children two little books of pictures were made illuminated with gold azure and vermilion and covered with vermilion leather of Cordova which cost sixty sols parisis i e four hundred francs But it was in the custom of New Year s gifts that the duke and duchess displayed truly royal magnificence as we find described in the accounts of their expenses For instance in thirteen eighty eight they paid four hundred francs of gold for sheets of silk to give to those who received the New Year s gifts from the King and Queen In fourteen oh two one hundred pounds tournois were given to Jehan Taienne goldsmith for six silver cups presented to Jacques de Poschin the Duke s squire To the Sire de la Tremouille Valentine gives a cup and basin of gold to Queen Isabella a golden image of saint John surrounded with nine rubies one sapphire and twenty one pearls to Mademoiselle de Luxembourg another small golden sacred image surrounded with pearls and lastly in an account of thirteen ninety four headed Portion of gold and silver jewels bought by Madame la Duchesse d Orleans as a New Year s gift we find a clasp of gold studded with one large ruby and six large pearls given to the King three paternosters for the King s daughters and two large diamonds for the Dukes of Burgundy and Berry Illustration Fig fifty three Styli used in writing in the Fourteenth Century Such were the habits in private life of the royal princes under Charles VI and it can easily be shown that the example of royalty was followed not only by the court but also in the remotest provinces The great tenants or vassals of the crown each possessed several splendid mansions in their fiefs the Dukes of Burgundy at Souvigny at Moulins and at Bourbon l Archambault the Counts of Champagne at Troyes the Dukes of Burgundy at Dijon and all the smaller nobles made a point of imitating their superiors From the fifteenth to the sixteenth centuries the provinces which now compose France were studded with castles which were as remarkable for their interior architecture as for the richness of their furniture and it may be asserted that the luxury which was displayed in the dwellings of the nobility was the evidence if not the resuit of a great social revolution in the manners and customs of private life At the end of the fourteenth century there lived a much respected noble of Anjou named Geoffroy de Latour Landry who had three daughters In his old age he resolved that considering the dangers which might surround them in consequence of their inexperience and beauty he would compose for their use a code of admonitions which might guide them in the various circumstances of life Illustration A Young Mother s Retinue Representing the Parisian costumes at the end of the fourteenth century Fac simile of a miniature from the latin Terence of King Charles VI From a manuscript in the Bibl de l Arsenal This book of domestic maxims is most curious and instructive from the details which it contains respecting the manners and customs mode of conduct and fashions of the nobility of the period Fig fifty four The author mostly illustrates each of his precepts by examples from the life of contemporary personages Illustration Fig fifty four Dress of Noble Ladies and Children in the Fourteenth Century Miniature in the Merveilles du Monde Manuscript National Library of Paris The first advice the knight gives his daughters is to begin the day with prayer and in order to give greater weight to his counsel he relates the following anecdote A noble had two daughters the one was pious always saying her prayers with devotion and regularly attending the services of the church she married an honest man and was most happy The other on the contrary was satisfied with hearing low mass and hurrying once or twice through the Lord s Prayer after which she went off to indulge herself with sweetmeats She complained of headaches and required careful diet She married a most excellent knight but one evening taking advantage of her husband being asleep she shut herself up in one of the rooms of the palace and in company with the people of the household began eating and drinking in the most riotous and excessive manner The knight awoke and surprised not to find his wife by his side got up and armed with a stick betook himself to the scene of festivity He struck one of the domestics with such force that he broke his stick in pieces and one of the fragments flew into the lady s eye and put it out This caused her husband to take a dislike to her and he soon placed his affections elsewhere My pretty daughters the moralising parent proceeds be courteous and meek for nothing is more beautiful nothing so secures the favour of God and the love of others Be then courteous to great and small speak gently with them I have seen a great lady take off her cap and bow to a simple ironmonger One of her followers seemed astonished I prefer she said to have been too courteous towards that man than to have been guilty of the least incivility to a knight Illustration Fig fifty five Noble Lady and Maid of Honour and two Burgesses with Hoods Fourteenth Century from a Miniature in the Merveilles du Monde Manuscript in the Imperial Library of Paris Latour Landry also advised his daughters to avoid outrageous fashions in dress Do not be hasty in copying the dress of foreign women I will relate a story on this subject respecting a bourgeoise of Guyenne and the Sire de Beaumanoir The lady said to him Cousin I come from Brittany where I saw my fine cousin your wife who was not so well dressed as the ladies of Guyenne and many other places The borders of her dress and of her bonnet are not in fashion The Sire answered Since you find fault with the dress and cap of my wife and as they do not suit you I shall take care in future that they are changed but I shall be careful not to choose them similar to yours Understand madam that I wish her to be dressed according to the fashion of the good ladies of France and this country and not like those of England It was these last who first introduced into Brittany the large borders the bodices opened on the hips and the hanging sleeves I remember the time and saw it myself and I have little respect for women who adopt these fashions Respecting the high head dresses which cause women to resemble stags who are obliged to lower their heads to enter a wood the knight relates what took place in thirteen ninety two at the fete of saint Marguerite There was a young and pretty woman there quite differently dressed from the others every one stared at her as if she had been a wild beast One respectable lady approached her and said My friend what do you call that fashion She answered It is called the gibbet dress Indeed but that is not a fine name answered the old lady Very soon the name of gibbet dress got known all round the room and every one laughed at the foolish creature who was thus bedecked This head dress did in fact owe its name to its summit which resembled a gibbet These extracts from the work of this honest knight suffice to prove that the customs of French society had as early as the end of the fourteenth century taken a decided character which was to remain subject only to modifications introduced at various historical periods Amongst the customs which contributed most to the softening and elegance of the feudal class we must cite that of sending into the service of the sovereign for some years all the youths of both sexes under the names of varlets pages squires and maids of honour No noble of whatever wealth or power ever thought of depriving his family of this apprenticeship and its accompanying chivalric education Up to the end of the twelfth century the number of domestic officers attached to a castle was very limited we have seen for instance that Philip Augustus contented himself with a few servants and his queen with two or three maids of honour Under Louis IX this household was much increased and under Philippe le Bel and his sons the royal household had become so considerable as to constitute quite a large assemblage of young men and women Under Charles VI the household of Queen Isabella of Bavaria alone amounted to forty five persons without counting the almoner the chaplains and clerks of the chapel who must have been very numerous since the sums paid to them amounted to the large amount of four hundred and sixty francs of gold per annum Illustration Fig fifty six Court of the Ladies of Queen Anne of Brittany Miniature representing this lady weeping on account of the absence of her husband during the Italian war Manuscript of the Epistres Envoyees au Roi Sixteenth Century obtained by the Coislin Fund for the Library of saint Germain des Pres in Paris now in the Library of saint Petersburg Under Charles VIII Louis XII and Francis I the service of the young nobility which was called apprenticeship of honour or virtue had taken a much wider range for the first families of the French nobility were most eager to get their children admitted into the royal household either to attend on the King or Queen or at any rate on one of the princes of the royal blood Anne of Brittany particularly gave special attention to her female attendants Fig fifty six She was the first says Brantome in his work on Illustrious Women who began to form the great court of ladies which has descended to our days for she had a considerable retinue both of adult ladies and young girls She never refused to receive any one on the contrary she inquired of the gentlemen of the court if they had any daughters ascertained who they were and asked for them It was thus that the Admiral de Graville Fig fifty seven confided to the good Queen the education of his daughter Anne who at this school of the Court of Ladies became one of the most distinguished women of her day The same Queen as Duchess of Brittany created a company of one hundred Breton gentlemen who accompanied her everywhere They never failed says the author of Illustrious Women when she went to mass or took a walk to await her return on the little terrace of Blois which is still called the Perche aux Bretons She gave it this name herself for when she saw them she said There are my Bretons on the perch waiting for me We must not forget that this queen who became successively the wife of Charles VIII and of Louis XII had taken care to establish a strict discipline amongst the young men and women who composed her court She rightly considered herself the guardian of the honour of the former and of the virtue of the latter therefore as long as she lived her court was renowned for purity and politeness noble and refined gallantry and was never allowed to degenerate into imprudent amusements or licentious and culpable intrigues Unfortunately the moral influence of this worthy princess died with her Although the court of France continued to gather around it almost every sort of elegance and although it continued during the whole of the sixteenth century the most polished of European courts notwithstanding the great external and civil wars yet it afforded at the same time a sad example of laxity of morals which had a most baneful influence on public habits so much so that vice and corruption descended from class to class and contaminated all orders of society If we wished to make investigations into the private life of the lower orders in those times we should not succeed as we have been able to do with that of the upper classes for we have scarcely any data to throw light upon their sad and obscure history Bourgeois and peasants were as we have already shown long included together with the miserable class of serfs a herd of human beings without individuality without significance who from their birth to their death whether isolated or collectively were the property of their masters What must have been the private life of this degraded multitude bowed down under the most tyrannical and humiliating dependence we can scarcely imagine it was in fact but a purely material existence which has left scarcely any trace in history Illustration Fig fifty seven Louis de Mallet Lord of Graville Admiral of France fourteen eighty seven in Costume of War and Tournament from an Engraving of the Sixteenth Century National Library of Paris Cabinet des Estampes Many centuries elapsed before the dawn of liberty could penetrate the social strata of this multitude thus oppressed and denuded of all power of action The development was slow painful and dearly bought but at last it took place first of all towns sprang up and with them or rather by their influence the inhabitants became possessed of social life The agricultural population took its social position many generations later As we have already seen the great movement for the creation of communes and bourgeoisies only dates from the unsettled period ranging from the eleventh to the thirteenth centuries and simultaneously we see the bourgeois appear already rich and luxurious parading on all occasions their personal opulence Their private life could only be an imitation of that in the chateaux by degrees as wealth strengthened and improved their condition and rendered them independent we find them trying to procure luxuries equal or analogous to those enjoyed by the upper classes and which appeared to them the height of material happiness In all times the small have imitated the great It was in vain that the great obstinately threatened by the exercise of their prerogatives to try and crush this tendency to equality which alarmed them by issuing pecuniary edicts summary laws coercive regulations and penal ordinances by the force of circumstances the arbitrary restrictions which the nobility laid upon the lower classes gradually disappeared and the power of wealth displayed itself in spite of all their efforts to suppress it In fact occasions were not wanting in which the bourgeois class was able to refute the charge of unworthiness with which the nobles sought to stamp it When taking a place in the council of the King or employed in the administration of the provinces many of its members distinguished themselves by firmness and wisdom when called upon to assist in the national defence they gave their blood and their gold with noble self denial and lastly they did not fail to prove themselves possessed of those high and delicate sentiments of which the nobility alone claimed the hereditary possession Illustration Fig fifty eight Burgess of Ghent and his Wife in ceremonial Attire kneeling in Church from a painted Window belonging to a Chapel in that Town Fifteenth Century The bourgeois says Arnaud de Marveil one of the most famous troubadours of the thirteenth century have divers sorts of merits some distinguish themselves by deeds of honour others are by nature noble and behave accordingly There are others thoroughly brave courteous frank and jovial who although poor find means to please by graceful speech frequenting courts and making themselves agreeable there these well versed in courtesy and politeness appear in noble attire and figure conspicuously at the tournaments and military games proving themselves good judges and good company Down to the thirteenth century however rich their fathers or husbands might be the women of the bourgeoisie were not permitted without incurring a fine to use the ornaments and stuffs exclusively reserved for the nobility During the reigns of Philip Augustus and Louis IX although these arbitrary laws were not positively abolished a heavy blow was inflicted on them by the marks of confidence esteem and honour which these monarchs found pleasure in bestowing on the bourgeoisie We find the first of these kings when on the point of starting for a crusade choosing six from amongst the principal members of the parloir aux bourgeois it was thus that the first Hotel de Ville situated in the corner of the Place de la Greve was named to be attached to the Council of Regency to whom he specially confided his will and the royal treasure His grandson made a point of following his grandsire s example and Louis IX showed the same appreciation for the new element which the Parisian bourgeoisie was about to establish in political life by making the bourgeois Etienne Boileau one of his principal ministers of police and the bourgeois Jean Sarrazin his chamberlain Under these circumstances the whole bourgeoisie gloried in the marks of distinction conferred upon their representatives and during the following reign the ladies of this class proud of their immense fortunes but above all proud of the municipal powers held by their families bedecked themselves regardless of expense with costly furs and rich stuffs notwithstanding that they were forbidden by law to do so Then came an outcry on the part of the nobles and we read as follows in an edict of Philippe le Bel who inclined less to the bourgeoisie than to the nobles and who did not spare the former in matters of taxation No bourgeois shall have a chariot nor wear gold precious stones or crowns of gold or silver Bourgeois not being either prelates nor dignitaries of state shall not have tapers of wax A bourgeois possessing two thousand pounds tournois or more may order for himself a dress of twelve sous six deniers and for his wife one worth sixteen sous at the most The sou which was but nominal money may be reckoned as representing twenty francs and the denier one franc but allowance must be made for the enormous difference in the value of silver which would make twenty francs in the thirteenth century represent upwards of two hundred francs of present currency Illustration Fig fifty nine The new born Child from a Miniature in the Histoire de la Belle Helaine Manuscript of the Fifteenth Century National Library of Paris But these regulations as to the mode of living were so little or so carelessly observed that all the successors of Philippe le Bel thought it necessary to re enact them and indeed Charles VII one century later was obliged to censure the excess of luxury in dress by an edict which was however no better enforced than the rest It has been shown to the said lord the King Charles VII that of all nations of the habitable globe there are none so changeable outrageous and excessive in their manner of dress as the French nation and there is no possibility of discovering by their dress the state or calling of persons be they princes nobles bourgeois or working men because all are allowed to dress as they think proper whether in gold or silver silk or wool without any regard to their calling At the end of the thirteenth century a rich merchant of Valenciennes went to the court of the King of France wearing a cloak of furs covered with gold and pearls seeing that no one offered him a cushion he proudly sat on his cloak On leaving he did not attempt to take up the cloak and on a servant calling his attention to the fact he remarked It is not the custom in my country for people to carry away their cushions with them Respecting a journey made by Philippe le Bel and his wife Jeanne de Navarre to the towns of Bruges and Ghent the historian Jean Mayer relates that Jeanne on seeing the costly array of the bourgeois of those two rich cities exclaimed I thought I was the only queen here but I see more than six hundred In spite of the laws the Parisian bourgeoisie soon rivalled the Flemish in the brilliancy of their dress Thus in the second half of the fourteenth century the famous Christine de Pisan relates that having gone to visit the wife of a merchant during her confinement it was not without some amazement that she saw the sumptuous furniture of the apartment in which this woman lay in bed Fig fifty nine The walls were hung with precious tapestry of Cyprus on which the initials and motto of the lady were embroidered the sheets were of fine linen of Rheims and had cost more than three hundred pounds the quilt was a new invention of silk and silver tissue the carpet was like gold The lady wore an elegant dress of crimson silk and rested her head and arms on pillows ornamented with buttons of oriental pearls It should be remarked that this lady was not the wife of a large merchant such as those of Venice and Genoa but of a simple retail dealer who was not above selling articles for four sous such being the case we need not be surprised that Christine should have considered the anecdote worthy of being immortalised in a book It must not however be assumed that the sole aim of the bourgeoisie was that of making a haughty and pompous display This is refuted by the testimony of the Menagier de Paris a curious anonymous work the author of which must have been an educated and enlightened bourgeois The Menagier which was first published by the Baron Jerome Pichon is a collection of counsels addressed by a husband to his young wife as to her conduct in society in the world and in the management of her household The first part is devoted to developing the mind of the young housewife and the second relates to the arrangements necessary for the welfare of her house It must be remembered that the comparatively trifling duties relating to the comforts of private life which devolved on the wife were not so numerous in those days as they are now but on the other hand they required an amount of practical knowledge on the part of the housewife which she can nowadays dispense with Under this head the Menagier is full of information After having spoken of the prayers which a Christian woman should say morning and evening the author discusses the great question of dress which has ever been of supreme importance in the eyes of the female sex Know dear sister the friendly name he gives his young wife that in the choice of your apparel you must always consider the rank of your parents and mine as also the state of my fortune Be respectably dressed without devoting too much study to it without too much plunging into new fashions Before leaving your room see that the collar of your gown be well adjusted and is not put on crooked Illustration Fig sixty Sculptured Comb in Ivory of the Sixteenth Century Sauvageot Collection Then he dilates on the characters of women which are too often wilful and unmanageable on this point for he is not less profuse in examples than the Chevalier de Latour Landry he relates an amusing anecdote worthy of being repeated and remembered I have heard the bailiff of Tournay relate that he had found himself several times at table with men long married and that he had wagered with them the price of a dinner under the following conditions the company was to visit the abode of each of the husbands successively and any one who had a wife obedient enough immediately without contradicting or making any remark to consent to count up to four would win the bet but on the other hand those whose wives showed temper laughed or refused to obey would lose Under these conditions the company gaily adjourned to the abode of Robin whose wife called Marie had a high opinion of herself The husband said before all Marie repeat after me what I shall say Willingly sire Marie say One two three But by this time Marie was out of patience and said And seven and twelve and fourteen Why you are making a fool of me So that husband lost his wager The company next went to the house of Maitre Jean whose wife Agnescat well knew how to play the lady Jean said Repeat after me one And two answered Agnescat disdainfully so he lost his wager Tassin then tried and said to dame Tassin Count one Go upstairs she answered if you want to teach counting I am not a child Another said Go away with you you must have lost your senses or similar words which made the husbands lose their wagers Those on the contrary who had well behaved wives gained their wager and went away joyful This amusing quotation suffices to show that the author of the Menagier de Paris wished to adopt a jocose style with a view to enliven the seriousness of the subject he was advocating The part of his work in which he discusses the administration of the house is not less worthy of attention One of the most curious chapters of the work is that in which he points out the manner in which the young bourgeoise is to behave towards persons in her service Rich people in those days in whatever station of life were obliged to keep a numerous retinue of servants It is curious to find that so far back as the period to which we allude there was in Paris a kind of servants registry office where situations were found for servant maids from the country The bourgeois gave up the entire management of the servants to his wife but on account of her extreme youth the author of the work in question recommends his wife only to engage servants who shall have been chosen by Dame Agnes the nun whom he had placed with her as a kind of governess or companion Before engaging them he says know whence they come in what houses they have been if they have acquaintances in town and if they are steady Discover what they are capable of doing and ascertain that they are not greedy or inclined to drink If they come from another country try to find out why they left it for generally it is not without some serious reason that a woman decides upon a change of abode When you have engaged a maid do not permit her to take the slightest liberty with you nor allow her to speak disrespectfully to you If on the contrary she be quiet in her demeanour honest modest and shows herself amenable to reproof treat her as if she were your daughter Superintend the work to be done and choose among your servants those qualified for each special department If you order a thing to be done immediately do not be satisfied with the following answers It shall be done presently or to morrow early otherwise be sure that you will have to repeat your orders Illustration Fig sixty one Dress of Maidservants in the Thirteenth Century Miniature in a Manuscript of the National Library of Paris To these severe instructions upon the management of servants the bourgeois adds a few words respecting their morality He recommends that they be not permitted to use coarse or indecent language or to insult one another Fig sixty one Although he is of opinion that necessary time should be given to servants at their meals he does not approve of their remaining drinking and talking too long at table concerning which practice he quotes a proverb in use at that time Quand varlet presche a table et cheval paist en gue il est temps qu on l en oste assez y a este which means that when a servant talks at table and a horse feeds near a watering place it is time he should be removed he has been there long enough Illustration Fig sixty two Hotel des Ursins Paris built during the Fourteenth Century restored in the Sixteenth and now destroyed State of the North Front at the End of the last Century The manner in which the author concludes his instruction proves his kindness of heart as well as his benevolence If one of your servants fall sick it is your duty setting everything else aside to see to his being cured It was thus that a bourgeois of the fifteenth century expressed himself and as it is clear that he could only have been inspired to dictate his theoretical teachings by the practical experience which he must have gained for the most part among the middle class to which he belonged we must conclude that in those days the bourgeoisie possessed considerable knowledge of moral dignity and social propriety It must be added that by the side of the merchant and working bourgeoisie who above all owed their greatness to the high functions of the municipality the parliamentary bourgeoisie had raised itself to power and that from the fourteenth century it played a considerable part in the State holding at several royal courts at different periods and at last almost hereditarily the highest magisterial positions The very character of these great offices of president or of parliamentary counsel barristers c proves that the holders must have had no small amount of intellectual culture In this way a refined taste was created among this class which the protection of kings princes and lords had alone hitherto encouraged We find for example the Grosliers at Lyons the De Thous and Seguiers in Paris regardless of their bourgeois origin becoming judicious and zealous patrons of poets scholars and artists A description of Paris published in the middle of the fifteenth century describes amongst the most splendid residences of the capital the hotels of Juvenal des Ursins Fig sixty two of Bureau de Dampmartin of Guillaume Seguin of Mille Baillet of Martin Double and particularly that of Jacques Duchie situated in the Rue des Prouvaires in which were collected at great cost collections of all kinds of arms musical instruments rare birds tapestry and works of art In each church in Paris and there were upwards of a hundred the principal chapels were founded by celebrated families of the ancient bourgeoisie who had left money for one or more masses to be said daily for the repose of the souls of their deceased members In the burial grounds and principally in that of the Innocents the monuments of these families of Parisian bourgeoisie were of the most expensive character and were inscribed with epitaphs in which the living vainly tried to immortalise the deeds of the deceased Every one has heard of the celebrated tomb of Nicholas Flamel and Pernelle his wife Fig sixty three the cross of Bureau the epitaph of Yolande Bailly who died in fifteen fourteen at the age of eighty eight and who saw or might have seen two hundred and ninety five children descended from her In fact the religious institutions of Paris afford much curious and interesting information relative to the history of the bourgeoisie For instance Jean Alais who levied a tax of one denier on each basket of fish brought to market and thereby amassed an enormous fortune left the whole of it at his death for the purpose of erecting a chapel called saint Agnes which soon after became the church of saint Eustace He further directed that by way of expiation his body should be thrown into the sewer which drained the offal from the market and covered with a large stone this sewer up to the end of the last century was still called Pont Alais Illustration Fig sixty three Nicholas Flamel and Pernelle his Wife from a Painting executed at the End of the Fifteenth Century under the Vaults of the Cemetery of the Innocents in Paris Very often when citizens made gifts during their lifetime to churches or parishes the donors reserved to themselves certain privileges which were calculated to cause the motives which had actuated them to be open to criticism Thus in thirteen oh four the daughters of Nicholas Arrode formerly provost of the merchants presented to the church of saint Jacques la Boucherie the house and grounds which they inhabited but one of them reserved the right of having a key of the church that she might go in whenever she pleased Guillaume Haussecuel in fourteen oh five bought a similar right for the sum of eighteen sols parisis per annum equal to twenty five francs and Alain and his wife whose house was close to two chapels of the church undertook not to build so as in any way to shut out the light from one of the chapels on condition that they might open a small window into the chapel and so be enabled to hear the service without leaving their room Illustration Fig sixty four Country Life Fac simile of a Woodcut in a folio Edition of Virgil published at Lyons in fifteen seventeen We thus see that the bourgeoisie especially of Paris gradually took a more prominent position in history and became so grasping after power that it ventured at a period which does not concern us here to aspire to every sort of distinction and to secure an important social standing What had been the exception during the sixteenth century became the rule two centuries later We will now take a glance at the agricultural population Fig sixty four who as we have already stated were only emancipated from serfdom at the end of the eighteenth century But whatever might have been formerly the civil condition of the rural population everything leads us to suppose that there were no special changes in their private and domestic means of existence from a comparatively remote period down to almost the present time A small poem of the thirteenth century entitled De l Oustillement au Vilain gives a clear though rough sketch of the domestic state of the peasantry Strange as it may seem it must be acknowledged that with a few exceptions resulting from the progress of time it would not be difficult even at the present day to find the exact type maintained in the country districts farthest away from the capital and large towns at all events they were faithfully represented at the time of the revolution of seventeen eighty nine Illustration Fig sixty five Sedentary Occupations of the Peasauts Fac simile from an Engraving on Wood attributed to Holbein in the Cosmographie of Munster Basle fifteen fifty two folio We gather from this poem which must be considered an authentic and most interesting document that the manse or dwelling of the villain comprised three distinct buildings the first for the corn the second for the hay and straw the third for the man and his family In this rustic abode a fire of vine branches and faggots sparkled in a large chimney furnished with an iron pot hanger a tripod a shovel large fire irons a cauldron and a meat hook Next to the fireplace was an oven and in close proximity to this an enormous bedstead on which the villain his wife his children and even the stranger who asked for hospitality could all be easily accommodated a kneading trough a table a bench a cheese cupboard a jug and a few baskets made up the rest of the furniture The villain also possessed other utensils such as a ladder a mortar a hand mill for every one then was obliged to grind his own corn a mallet some nails some gimlets fishing lines hooks and baskets c Illustration Fig sixty six Villains before going to Work receiving their Lord s Orders Miniature in the Proprietaire des Choses Manuscript of the Fifteenth Century Library of the Arsenal in Paris His working implements were a plough a scythe a spade a hoe large shears a knife and a sharpening stone he had also a waggon with harness for several horses so as to be able to accomplish the different tasks required of him under feudal rights either by his proper lord or by the sovereign for the villain was liable to be called upon to undertake every kind of work of this sort His dress consisted of a blouse of cloth or skin fastened by a leather belt round the waist an overcoat or mantle of thick woollen stuff which fell from his shoulders to half way down his legs shoes or large boots short woollen trousers and from his belt there hung his wallet and a sheath for his knife Figs sixty six and seventy one He generally went bareheaded but in cold weather or in rain he wore a sort of hat of similar stuff to his coat or one of felt with a broad brim He seldom wore mouffles or padded gloves except when engaged in hedging A small kitchen garden which he cultivated himself was usually attached to the cottage which was guarded by a large watch dog There was also a shed for the cows whose milk contributed to the sustenance of the establishment and on the thatched roof of this and his cottage the wild cats hunted the rats and mice The family were never idle even in the bad season and the children were taught from infancy to work by the side of their parents Fig sixty five If then we find so much resemblance between the abodes of the villains of the thirteenth century and those of the inhabitants of the poorest communes of France in the present day we may fairly infer that there must be a great deal which is analogous between the inhabitants themselves of the two periods for in the chateaux as well as in the towns we find the material condition of the dwellings modifying itself conjointly with that of the moral condition of the inhabitants Illustration Fig sixty seven The egotistical and envious Villain From a Miniature in Proverbes et Adages c Manuscript of the La Valliere Fund in the National Library of Paris with this legend Attrapez y sont les plus fins Qui trop embrasse mal estraint The cleverest burn their fingers at it And those who grasp all may lose all Another little poem entitled On the Twenty four Kinds of Villains composed about the same period as the one above referred to gives us a graphic description of the varieties of character among the feudal peasants One example is given of a man who will not tell a traveller the way but merely in a surly way answers You know it better than I Fig sixty seven Another sitting at his door on a Sunday laughs at those passing by and says to himself when he sees a gentleman going hawking with a bird on his wrist Ah that bird will eat a hen to day and our children could all feast upon it Another is described as a sort of madman who equally despises God the saints the Church and the nobility His neighbour is an honest simpleton who stopping in admiration before the doorway of Notre Dame in Paris in order to admire the statues of Pepin Charlemagne and their successors has his pocket picked of his purse Another villain is supposed to make trade of pleading the cause of others before Messire le Bailli he is very eloquent in trying to show that in the time of their ancestors the cows had a free right of pasture in such and such a meadow or the sheep on such and such a ridge then there is the miser and the speculator who converts all his possessions into ready money so as to purchase grain against a bad season but of course the harvest turns out to be excellent and he does not make a farthing but runs away to conceal his ruin and rage There is also the villain who leaves his plough to become a poacher There are many other curious examples which altogether tend to prove that there has been but little change in the villager class since the first periods of History Illustration Fig sixty eight The covetous and avaricious Villain From a Miniature in Proverbes et Adages c Manuscript in the National Library of Paris with this legend Je suis icy levant les yeulx Eu ce haut lieu des attendens En convoitant pour avoir mieulx Prendre la lune avec les dens Even on this lofty height We yet look higher As nothing will satisfy us But to clutch the moon Notwithstanding the miseries to which they were generally subject the rural population had their days of rest and amusement which were then much more numerous than at present At that period the festivals of the Church were frequent and rigidly kept and as each of them was the pretext for a forced holiday from manual labour the peasants thought of nothing after church but of amusing themselves they drank talked sang danced and above all laughed for the laugh of our forefathers quite rivalled the Homeric laugh and burst forth with a noisy joviality Fig sixty nine The wakes or evening parties which are still the custom in most of the French provinces and which are of very ancient origin formed important events in the private lives of the peasants It was at these that the strange legends and vulgar superstitions which so long fed the minds of the ignorant classes were mostly created and propagated It was there that those extraordinary and terrible fairy tales were related as well as those of magicians witches spirits c It was there that the matrons whose great age justified their experience insisted on proving by absurd tales that they knew all the marvellous secrets for causing happiness or for curing sickness Consequently in those days the most enlightened rustic never for a moment doubted the truth of witchcraft In fact one of the first efforts at printing was applied to reproducing the most ridiculous stories under the title of the Evangile des Conuilles ou Quenouilles and which had been previously circulated in manuscript and had obtained implicit belief The author of this remarkable collection asserts that the matrons in his neighbourhood had deputed him to put together in writing the sayings suitable for all conditions of rural life which were believed in by them and were announced at the wakes The absurdities and childish follies which he has dared to register under their dictation are almost incredible The Evangile des Quenouilles which was as much believed in as Holy Writ tells us amongst other secrets which it contains for the advantage of the reader that a girl wishing to know the Christian name of her future husband has but to stretch the first thread she spins in the morning across the doorway and that the first man who passes and touches the thread will necessarily have the same name as the man she is destined to marry Another of the stories in this book was that if a woman on leaving off work on Saturday night left her distaff loaded she might be sure that the thread she would obtain from it during the following week would only produce linen of bad quality which could not be bleached this was considered to be proved by the fact that the Germans wore dark brown coloured shirts and it was known that the women never unloaded their distaffs from Saturday to Monday Should a woman enter a cow house to milk her cows without saying God and saint Bridget bless you she was thought to run the risk of the cows kicking and breaking the milk pail and spilling the milk Illustration Fig sixty nine Village Feast Fac simile of a Woodcut of the Sandrin ou Verd Galant facetious Work of the End of the Sixteenth Century edition of sixteen oh nine This silly nonsense compiled like oracles was printed as late as fourteen ninety three Eighty years later a gentleman of Brittany named Noel du Fail Lord of Herissaye councillor in the Parliament of Rennes published under the title of Rustic and Amusing Discourses a work intended to counteract the influence of the famous Evangile des Quenouilles This new work was a simple and true sketch of country habits and proved the elegance and artless simplicity of the author as well as his accuracy of observation He begins thus Occasionally having to retire into the country more conveniently and uninterruptedly to finish some business on a particular holiday as I was walking I came to a neighbouring village where the greater part of the old and young men were assembled in groups of separate ages for according to the proverb Each seeks his like The young were practising the bow jumping wrestling running races and playing other games The old were looking on some sitting under an oak with their legs crossed and their hats lowered over their eyes others leaning on their elbows criticizing every performance and refreshing the memory of their own youth and taking a lively interest in seeing the gambols of the young people The author states that on questioning one of the peasants to ascertain who was the cleverest person present the following dialogue took place The one you see leaning on his elbow hitting his boots which have white strings with a hazel stick is called Anselme he is one of the rich ones of the village he is a good workman and not a bad writer for the flat country and the one you see by his side with his thumb in his belt hanging from which is a large game bag containing spectacles and an old prayer book is called Pasquier one of the greatest wits within a day s journey nay were I to say two I should not be lying Anyhow he is certainly the readiest of the whole company to open his purse to give drink to his companions And that one I asked with the large Milanese cap on his head who holds an old book That one he answered who is scratching the end of his nose with one hand and his beard with the other That one I replied and who has turned towards us Why said he that is Roger Bontemps a merry careless fellow who up to the age of fifty kept the parish school but changing his first trade he has become a wine grower However he cannot resist the feast days when he brings us his old books and reads to us as long as we choose such works as the Calondrier des Bergers Fables d Esope Le Roman de la Rose Matheolus Alain Chartier Les Vigiles du feu Roy Charles Les deux Grebans and others Neither with his old habit of warbling can he help singing on Sundays in the choir and he is called Huguet The other sitting near him looking over his shoulder into his book and wearing a sealskin belt with a yellow buckle is another rich peasant of the village not a bad villain named Lubin who also lives at home and is called the little old man of the neighbourhood After this artistic sketch the author dilates on the goodman Anselme He says This good man possessed a moderate amount of knowledge was a goodish grammarian a musician somewhat of a sophist and rather given to picking holes in others Some of Anselme s conversation is also given and after beginning by describing in glowing terms the bygone days which he and his contemporaries had seen and which he stated to be very different to the present he goes on to say I must own my good old friends that I look back with pleasure on our young days at all events the mode of doing things in those days was very superior and better in every way to that of the present O happy days O fortunate times when our fathers and grandfathers whom may God absolve were still among us As he said this he would raise the rim of his hat He contented himself as to dress with a good coat of thick wool well lined according to the fashion and for feast days and other important occasions one of thick cloth lined with some old gabardine Illustration Fig seventy The Shepherds celebrating the Birth of the Messiah by Songs and Dances Fifteenth Century Fac simile of an Engraving on Wood from a Book of Hours printed by Anthony Verard So we see says M Le Roux de Lincy at the end of the fifteenth century that the old peasants complained of the changes in the village customs and of the luxury which every one wished to display in his furniture or apparel On this point it seems that there has been little or no change We read that from the time of Homer down to that of the excellent author of Rustic Discourses and even later the old people found fault with the manners of the present generation and extolled those of their forefathers which they themselves had criticized in their own youth Illustration Fig seventy one Purse or Leather Bag with Knife

man has endeavoured to add to his food something which pleased his taste He does not wait to be hungry but he anticipates that feeling and aggravates it by condiments and seasonings In a word his greediness has created on this score a very complicated and wide spread science which amongst nations which are considered civilised has become most important and is designated the culinary art At all times the people of every country have strained the nature of the soil on which they lived by forcing it to produce that which it seemed destined ever to refuse them Such food as human industry was unable to obtain from any particular soil or from any particular climate commerce undertook to bring from the country which produced it This caused Rabelais to say that the stomach was the father and master of industry We will rapidly glance over the alimentary matters which our forefathers obtained from the animal and vegetable kingdom and then trace the progress of culinary art and examine the rules of feasts and such matters as belong to the epicurean customs of the Middle Ages Aliments Bread The Gauls who principally inhabited deep and thick forests fed on herbs and fruits and particularly on acorns It is even possible that the veneration in which they held the oak had no other origin This primitive food continued in use at least in times of famine up to the eighth century and we find in the regulations of saint Chrodegand that if in consequence of a bad year the acorn or beech nut became scarce it was the bishop s duty to provide something to make up for it Eight centuries later when Rene du Bellay Bishop of Mans came to report to Francis I the fearful poverty of his diocese he informed the king that the inhabitants in many places were reduced to subsisting on acorn bread Illustration Figs seventy two and seventy three Corn threshing and Bread making Miniatures from the Calendar of a Book of Hours Manuscript of the Sixteenth Century In the earliest times bread was cooked under the embers The use of ovens was introduced into Europe by the Romans who had found them in Egypt But notwithstanding this importation the old system of cooking was long after employed for in the tenth century Raimbold abbot of the monastery of saint Thierry near Rheims ordered in his will that on the day of his death bread cooked under the embers panes subcinericios should be given to his monks By feudal law the lord was bound to bake the bread of his vassals for which they were taxed but the latter often preferred to cook their flour at home in the embers of their own hearths rather than to carry it to the public oven Illustration Fig seventy four The Miller From an Engraving of the Sixteenth Century by J Amman It must be stated that the custom of leavening the dough by the addition of a ferment was not universally adopted amongst the ancients For this reason as the dough without leaven could only produce a heavy and indigestible bread they were careful in order to secure their loaves being thoroughly cooked to make them very thin These loaves served as plates for cutting up the other food upon and when they thus became saturated with the sauce and gravy they were eaten as cakes The use of the tourteaux small crusty loaves which were at first called tranchoirs and subsequently tailloirs remained long in fashion even at the most splendid banquets Thus in thirteen thirty six the Dauphin of Vienna Humbert II had besides the small white bread four small loaves to serve as tranchoirs at table The Menagier de Paris mentions des pains de tranchouers half a foot in diameter and four fingers deep and Froissart the historian also speaks of tailloirs It would be difficult to point out the exact period at which leavening bread was adopted in Europe but we can assert that in the Middle Ages it was anything but general Yeast which according to Pliny was already known to the Gauls was reserved for pastry and it was only at the end of the sixteenth century that the bakers of Paris used it for bread At first the trades of miller and baker were carried on by the same person Figs seventy four and seventy five The man who undertook the grinding of the grain had ovens near his mill which he let to his lord to bake bread when he did not confine his business to persons who sent him their corn to grind Illustration Fig seventy five The Baker From an Engraving of the Sixteenth Century by J Amman At a later period public bakers established themselves who not only baked the loaves which were brought to them already kneaded but also made bread which they sold by weight and this system was in existence until very recently in the provinces Charlemagne in his Capitulaires statutes fixed the number of bakers in each city according to the population and saint Louis relieved them as well as the millers from taking their turn at the watch so that they might have no pretext for stopping or neglecting their work which he considered of public utility Nevertheless bakers as a body never became rich or powerful Figs seventy six and seventy seven It is pretty generally believed that the name of boulanger baker originated from the fact that the shape of the loaves made at one time was very like that of a round ball But loaves varied so much in form quality and consequently in name that in his Dictionary of Obscure Words the learned Du Cange specifies at least twenty sorts made during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries and amongst them may be mentioned the court loaf the pope s loaf the knight s loaf the squire s loaf the peer s loaf the varlet s loaf c Illustration Fig seventy six Banner of the Corporation of Bakers of Paris Illustration Fig seventy seven Banner of the Corporation of Bakers of Arras The most celebrated bread was the white bread of Chailly or Chilly a village four leagues ten miles south of Paris which necessarily appeared at all the tables of the elite of the fourteenth century The pain mollet or soft bread made with milk and butter although much in use before this only became fashionable on the arrival of Marie de Medicis in France sixteen hundred on account of this Tuscan princess finding it so much to her taste that she would eat no other The ordinary market bread of Paris comprised the rousset bread made of meslin and employed for soup the bourgeoisie bread and the chaland or customer s bread which last was a general name given to all descriptions which were sent daily from the neighbouring villages to the capital Amongst the best known varieties we will only mention the Corbeil bread the dog bread the bread of two colours which last was composed of alternate layers of wheat and rye and was used by persons of small means there was also the Gonesse bread which has maintained its reputation to this day The table loaves which in the provinces were served at the tables of the rich were of such a convenient size that one of them would suffice for a man of ordinary appetite even after the crust was cut off which it was considered polite to offer to the ladies who soaked it in their soup For the servants an inferior bread was baked called common bread In many counties they sprinkled the bread before putting it into the oven with powdered linseed a custom which still exists They usually added salt to the flour excepting in certain localities especially in Paris where on account of its price they only mixed it with the expensive qualities The wheats which were long most esteemed for baking purposes were those of Brie Champagne and Bassigny while those of the Dauphine were held of little value because they were said to contain so many tares and worthless grains that the bread made from them produced headache and other ailments An ancient chronicle of the time of Charlemagne makes mention of a bread twice baked or biscuit This bread was very hard and easier to keep than any other description It was also used as now for provisioning ships or towns threatened with a siege as well as in religious houses At a later period delicate biscuits were made of a sort of dry and crumbling pastry which retained the original name As early as the sixteenth century Rheims had earned a great renown for these articles of food Bread made with barley oats or millet was always ranked as coarse food to which the poor only had recourse in years of want Fig seventy eight Barley bread was besides used as a kind of punishment and monks who had committed any serious offence against discipline were condemned to live on it for a certain period Rye bread was held of very little value although in certain provinces such as Lyonnais Forez and Auvergne it was very generally used among the country people and contributed says Bruyerin Champier in his treatise De re Cibaria to preserve beauty and freshness amongst women At a later period the doctors of Paris frequently ordered the use of bread made half of wheat and half of rye as a means of preserving the health Black wheat or buck wheat which was introduced into Europe by the Moors and Saracens when they conquered Spain quickly spread to the northern provinces especially to Flanders where by its easy culture and almost certain yield it averted much suffering from the inhabitants who were continually being threatened with famine It was only later that maize or Turkey wheat was cultivated in the south and that rice came into use but these two kinds of grain both equally useless for bread were employed the one for fattening poultry and the other for making cakes which however were little appreciated Illustration Fig seventy eight Cultivation of Grain in use amongst the Peasants and the Manufacture of Barley and Oat Bread Fac simile of a Woodcut in an edition of Virgil published at Lyons in fifteen seventeen Vegetables and Plants Used in Cooking From the most ancient historical documents we find that at the very earliest period of the French monarchy fresh and dried vegetables were the ordinary food of the population Pliny and Columella attribute a Gallic origin to certain roots and among them onions and parsnips which the Romans cultivated in their gardens for use at their tables It is evident however that vegetables were never considered as being capable of forming solid nutriment since they were almost exclusively used by monastic communities when under vows of extreme abstinence A statute of Charlemagne in which the useful plants which the emperor desired should be cultivated in his domains are detailed shows us that at that period the greater part of our cooking vegetables were in use for we find mentioned in it fennel garlic parsley shallot onions watercress endive lettuce beetroot cabbage leeks carrots artichokes besides long beans broad beans peas or Italian vetches and lentils In the thirteenth century the plants fit for cooking went under the general appellation of aigrun and amongst them at a later date were ranked oranges lemons and other acid fruits saint Louis added to this category even fruits with hard rinds such as walnuts filberts and chestnuts and when the guild of the fruiterers of Paris received its statutes in sixteen oh eight they were still called vendors of fruits and aigrun The vegetables and cooking plants noticed in the Menagier de Paris which dates from the fourteenth century and in the treatise De Obsoniis of Platina the name adopted by the Italian Bartholomew Sacchi which dates from the fifteenth century do not lead us to suppose that alimentary horticulture had made much progress since the time of Charlemagne Moreover we are astonished to find the thistle placed amongst choice dishes though it cannot be the common thistle that is meant but probably this somewhat general appellation refers to the vegetable marrow which is still found on the tables of the higher classes or perhaps the artichoke which we know to be only a kind of thistle developed by cultivation and which at that period had been recently imported About the same date melons begin to appear but the management of this vegetable fruit was not much known It was so imperfectly cultivated in the northern provinces that in the middle of the sixteenth century Bruyerin Champier speaks of the Languedocians as alone knowing how to produce excellent sucrins thus called say both Charles Estienne and Liebault in the Maison Rustique because gardeners watered them with honeyed or sweetened water The water melons have never been cultivated but in the south Cabbages the alimentary reputation of which dates from the remotest times were already of several kinds most of which have descended to us amongst them may be mentioned the apple headed the Roman the white the common white head the Easter cabbage c but the one held in the highest estimation was the famous cabbage of Senlis whose leaves says an ancient author when opened exhaled a smell more agreeable than musk or amber This species no doubt fell into disuse when the plan of employing aromatic herbs in cooking which was so much in repute by our ancestors was abandoned Illustration Fig seventy nine Coat of arms of the Grain measurers of Ghent on their

unwholesome vegetable because it was said that the inhabitants of Forez who ate much of it were subject to periodical fevers which might really have been caused by noxious emanation from the ponds with which that country abounded Lentils now considered so wholesome were also long looked upon as a doubtful vegetable according to Liebault they were difficult to digest and otherwise injurious they inflamed the inside affected the sight and brought on the nightmare c On the other hand small fresh beans especially those sold at Landit fair were used in the most delicate repasts peas passed as a royal dish in the sixteenth century when the custom was to eat them with salt pork Turnips were also most esteemed by the Parisians This vegetable is to them says Charles Estienne what large radishes are to the Limousins The best were supposed to come from Maisons Vaugirard and Aubervilliers Lastly there were four kinds of lettuces grown in France according to Liebault in fifteen seventy four the small the common the curled and the Roman the seed of the last named was sent to France by Francois Rabelais when he was in Rome with Cardinal du Bellay in fifteen thirty seven and the salad made from it consequently received the name of Roman salad which it has ever since retained In fact our ancestors much appreciated salads for there was not a banquet without at least three or four different kinds Fruits Western Europe was originally very poor in fruits and it only improved by foreign importations mostly from Asia by the Romans The apricot came from Armenia the pistachio nuts and plums from Syria the peach and nut from Persia the cherry from Cerasus the lemon from Media the filbert from the Hellespont and chestnuts from Castana a town of Magnesia We are also indebted to Asia for almonds the pomegranate according to some came from Africa to others from Cyprus the quince from Cydon in Crete the olive fig pear and apple from Greece The statutes of Charlemagne show us that almost all these fruits were reared in his gardens and that some of them were of several kinds or varieties A considerable period however elapsed before the finest and more luscious productions of the garden became as it were almost forced on nature by artificial means Thus in the sixteenth century we find Rabelais Charles Estienne and La Framboisiere physician to Henry IV praising the Corbeil peach which was only an inferior and almost wild sort and describing it as having dry and solid flesh not adhering to the stone The culture of this fruit which was not larger than a damask plum had then according to Champier only just been introduced into France It must be remarked here that Jacques Coythier physician to Louis XI in order to curry favour with his master who was very fond of new fruits took as his crest an apricot tree from which he was jokingly called Abri Coythier Illustration Fig eighty Cultivation of Fruit from a Miniature of the Proprietaire de Choses Manuscript of the Fifteenth Century in the Library of the Arsenal of Paris It must be owned that great progress has been made in the culture of the plum the pear and the apple Champier says that the best plums are the royale the perdrigon and the damas of Tours Olivier de Serres mentions eighteen kinds amongst which however we do not find the celebrated Reine Claude greengage which owes its name to the daughter of Louis XII first wife of Francis I Of pears the most esteemed in the thirteenth century were the hastiveau which was an early sort and no doubt the golden pear now called saint Jean the caillou or chaillou a hard pear which came from Cailloux in Burgundy and l angoisse agony so called on account of its bitterness which however totally disappeared in cooking In the sixteenth century the palm is given to the cuisse dame or madame the bon chretien brought it is said by saint Francois de Paule to Louis XI the bergamote which came from Bergamo in Lombardy the tant bonne so named from its aroma and the caillou rosat our rosewater pear Amongst apples the blandureau hard white of Auvergne the rouveau and the paradis of Provence are of oldest repute This reminds us of the couplet by the author of the Street Cries of Paris thirteenth century Primes ai pommes de rouviau Et d Auvergne le blanc duriau Give me first the russet apple And the hard white fruit of Auvergne The quince which was so generally cultivated in the Middle Ages was looked upon as the most useful of all fruits Not only did it form the basis of the farmers dried preserves of Orleans called cotignac a sort of marmalade but it was also used for seasoning meat The Portugal quince was the most esteemed and the cotignac of Orleans had such a reputation that boxes of this fruit were always given to kings queens and princes on entering the towns of France It was the first offering made to Joan of Arc on her bringing reinforcements into Orleans during the English siege Several sorts of cherries were known but these did not prevent the small wild or wood cherry from being appreciated at the tables of the citizens whilst the cornouille or wild cornelian cherry was hardly touched excepting by the peasants thence came the proverbial expression more particularly in use at Orleans when a person made a silly remark He has eaten cornelians i e he speaks like a rustic In the thirteenth century chestnuts from Lombardy were hawked in the streets but in the sixteenth century the chestnuts of the Lyonnais and Auvergne were substituted and were to be found on the royal table Four different sorts of figs in equal estimation were brought from Marseilles Nismes Saint Andeol and Pont Saint Esprit and in Provence filberts were to be had in such profusion that they supplied from there all the tables of the kingdom The Portuguese claim the honour of having introduced oranges from China however in an account of the house of Humbert Dauphin of Viennois in thirteen thirty three that is long before the expeditions of the Portuguese to India mention is made of a sum of money being paid for transplanting orange trees Illustration Figs eighty one and eighty two Culture of the Vine and Treading the Grape Miniatures taken from the Calendar of a Prayer Book in Manuscript of the Sixteenth Century In the time of Bruyerin Champier physician to Henry II raspberries were still completely wild the same author states that wood strawberries had only just at that time been introduced into gardens by which he says they had attained a larger size though they at the same time lost their quality The vine acclimatised and propagated by the Gauls ever since the followers of Brennus had brought it from Italy five hundred years before the Christian era never ceased to be productive and even to constitute the natural wealth of the country Fig eighty one and eighty two In the sixteenth century Liebault enumerated nineteen sorts of grapes and Olivier de Serres twenty four amongst which notwithstanding the eccentricities of the ancient names we believe that we can trace the greater part of those plants which are now cultivated in France For instance it is known that the excellent vines of Thomery near Fontainebleau which yield in abundance the most beautiful table grape which art and care can produce were already in use in the reign of Henry IV Fig eighty three Illustration Fig eighty three The Winegrower drawn and engraved in the Sixteenth Century by J Amman In the time of the Gauls the custom of drying grapes by exposing them to the sun or to a certain amount of artificial heat was already known and very soon after the same means were adopted for preserving plums an industry in which then as now the people of Tours and Rheims excelled Drying apples in an oven was also the custom and formed a delicacy which was reserved for winter and spring banquets Dried fruits were also brought from abroad as mentioned in the Book of Street Cries in Paris Figues de Melites sans fin J ai roisin d outre mer roisin Figs from Malta without end And grapes from over the sea Butchers Meat According to Strabo the Gauls were great eaters of meat especially of pork whether fresh or salted Gaul says he feeds so many flocks and above all so many pigs that it supplies not only Rome but all Italy with grease and salt meat The second chapter of the Salic law comprising nineteen articles relates entirely to penalties for pig stealing and in the laws of the Visigoths we find four articles on the same subject Illustration Fig eighty four Swineherd Illustration Fig eighty five A Burgess at Meals Miniatures from the Calendar of a Book of Hours Manuscript of the Sixteenth Century In those remote days in which the land was still covered with enormous forests of oak great facilities were offered for breeding pigs whose special liking for acorns is well known Thus the bishops princes and lords caused numerous droves of pigs to be fed on their domains both for the purpose of supplying their own tables as well as for the fairs and markets At a subsequent period it became the custom for each household whether in town or country to rear and fatten a pig which was killed and salted at a stated period of the year and this custom still exists in many provinces In Paris for instance there was scarcely a bourgeois who had not two or three young pigs During the day these unsightly creatures were allowed to roam in the streets which however they helped to keep clean by eating up the refuse of all sorts which was thrown out of the houses One of the sons of Louis le Gros while passing on the second of October eleven thirty one in the Rue du Martroi between the Hotel de Ville and the church of saint Gervais fractured his skull by a fall from his horse caused by a pig running between that animal s legs This accident led to the first order being issued by the provosts to the effect that breeding pigs within the town was forbidden Custom however deep rooted for centuries resisted this order and many others on the same subject which followed it for we find under Francis I a license was issued to the executioner empowering him to capture all the stray pigs which he could find in Paris and to take them to the Hotel Dieu when he should receive either five sous in silver or the head of the animal It is said that the holy men of saint Antoine in virtue of the privilege attached to the popular legend of their patron who was generally represented with a pig objected to this order and long after maintained the exclusive right of allowing their pigs to roam in the streets of the capital The obstinate determination with which every one tried to evade the administrative laws on this subject is explained in fact by the general taste of the French nation for pork This taste appears somewhat strange at a time when this kind of food was supposed to engender leprosy a disease with which France was at that time overrun Illustration Fig eighty six Stall of Carved Wood Fifteenth Century representing the Proverb Margaritas ante Porcos Throwing Pearls before Swine from Rouen Cathedral Pigs meat made up generally the greater part of the domestic banquets There was no great feast at which hams sausages and black puddings were not served in profusion on all the tables and as Easter Day which brought to a close the prolonged fastings of Lent was one of the great feasts this food formed the most important dish on that occasion It is possible that the necessity for providing for the consumption of that day originated the celebrated ham fair which was and is still held annually on the Thursday of Passion Week in front of Notre Dame where the dealers from all parts of France and especially from Normandy and Lower Brittany assembled with their swine Sanitary measures were taken in Paris and in the various towns in order to prevent the evil effects likely to arise from the enormous consumption of pork public officers called languayeurs were ordered to examine the animals to ensure that they had not white ulcers under the tongue these being considered the signs that their flesh was in a condition to communicate leprosy to those who partook of it For a long time the retail sale of pork was confined to the butchers like that of other meat Salt or fresh pork was at one time always sold raw though at a later period some retailers who carried on business principally among the lowest orders of the people took to selling cooked pork and sausages They were named charcuitiers or saucissiers This new trade which was most lucrative was adopted by so many people that parliament was forced to limit the number of charcuitiers who at last formed a corporation and received their statutes which were confirmed by the King in fourteen seventy five Amongst the privileges attached to their calling was that of selling red herrings and sea fish in Lent during which time the sale of pork was strictly forbidden Although they had the exclusive monopoly of selling cooked pork they were at first forbidden to buy their meat of any one but of the butchers who alone had the right of killing pigs and it was only in fifteen thirteen that the charcuitiers were allowed to purchase at market and sell the meat raw in opposition to the butchers who in consequence gradually gave up killing and selling pork Fig eighty seven Although the consumption of butchers meat was not so great in the Middle Ages as it is now the trade of a butcher to which extraordinary privileges were attached was nevertheless one of the industries which realised the greatest profits We know what an important part the butchers played in the municipal history of France as also of Belgium and we also know how great their political influence was especially in the fifteenth century Illustration Fig eighty seven The Pork butcher Charcutier Fac simile of a Miniature in a Charter of the Abbey of Solignac Fourteenth Century The existence of the great slaughter house of Paris dates back to the most remote period of monarchy The parish church of the corporation of butchers namely that of saint Pierre aux Boeufs in the city on the front of which were two sculptured oxen existed before the tenth century A Celtic monument was discovered on the site of the ancient part of Paris with a bas relief representing a wild bull carrying three cranes standing among oak branches Archaeology has chosen to recognise in this sculpture a Druidical allegory which has descended to us in the shape of the triumphal car of the Prize Ox Fig eighty eight The butchers who for centuries at least in France only killed sheep and pigs proved themselves most jealous of their privileges and admitted no strangers into their corporation The proprietorship of stalls at the markets and the right of being admitted as a master butcher at the age of seven years and a day belonged exclusively to the male descendants of a few rich and powerful families The Kings of France alone on their accession could create a new master butcher Since the middle of the fourteenth century the Grande Boucherie was the seat of an important jurisdiction composed of a mayor a master a proctor and an attorney it also had a judicial council before which the butchers could bring up all their cases and an appeal from which could only be considered by Parliament Besides this court which had to decide cases of misbehaviour on the part of the apprentices and all their appeals against their masters the corporation had a counsel in Parliament as also one at the Chatelet who were specially attached to the interests of the butchers and were in their pay Illustration Fig eighty eight The Holy Ox Celtic Monument found in Paris under the Choir of Notre Dame in seventeen eleven and preserved in the Musee de Cluny et des Thermes Although bound at all events with their money to follow the calling of their fathers we find many descendants of ancient butchers families of Paris in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries abandoning their stalls to fill high places in the state and even at court It must not be concluded that the rich butchers in those days occupied themselves with the minor details of their trade the greater number employed servants who cut up and retailed the meat and they themselves simply kept the accounts and were engaged in dealing through factors or foremen for the purchase of beasts for their stalls Fig eighty nine One can form an opinion of the wealth of some of these tradesmen by reading the enumeration made by an old chronicler of the property and income of Guillaume de Saint Yon one of the principal master butchers in thirteen seventy He was proprietor of three stalls in which meat was weekly sold to the amount of two hundred livres parisis the livre being equivalent to twenty four francs at least with an average profit of ten to fifteen per cent he had an income of six hundred livres parisis he possessed besides his family house in Paris four country houses well supplied with furniture and agricultural implements drinking cups vases cups of silver and cups of onyx with silver feet valued at one hundred francs or more each His wife had jewels belts purses and trinkets to the value of upwards of one thousand gold francs the gold franc was worth twenty four livres long and short gowns trimmed with fur and three mantles of grey fur Guillaume de Saint Yon had generally in his storehouses three hundred ox hides worth twenty four francs each at least eight hundred measures of fat worth three one two sols each in his sheds he had eight hundred sheep worth one hundred sols each in his safes five hundred or six hundred silver florins of ready money the florin was worth twelve francs which must be multiplied five times to estimate its value in present currency and his household furniture was valued at twelve thousand florins He gave a dowry of two thousand florins to his two nieces and spent three thousand florins in rebuilding his Paris house and lastly as if he had been a noble he used a silver seal Illustration Fig eighty nine The Butcher and his Servant drawn and engraved by J Amman Sixteenth Century We find in the Menagier de Paris curious statistics respecting the various butchers shops of the capital and the daily sale in each at the period referred to This sale without counting the households of the King the Queen and the royal family which were specially provisioned amounted to twenty six thousand six hundred twenty four oxen one hundred sixty two thousand seven hundred sixty sheep twenty seven thousand four hundred fifty six pigs and fifteen thousand nine hundred twelve calves per annum to which must be added not only the smoked and salted flesh of two hundred or three hundred pigs which were sold at the fair in Holy Week but also six thousand four hundred twenty sheep eight hundred twenty three oxen eight hundred thirty two calves and six hundred twenty four pigs which according to the Menagier were used in the royal and princely households Sometimes the meat was sent to market already cut up but the slaughter of beasts was more frequently done in the butchers shops in the town for they only killed from day to day according to the demand Besides the butchers there were tripe shops where the feet kidneys c were sold Illustration Figs ninety and ninety one Seal and Counter Seal of the Butchers of Bruges in thirteen fifty six from an impression on green wax preserved in the archives of that town According to Bruyerin Champier during the sixteenth century the most celebrated sheep in France were those of Berri and Limousin and of all butchers meat veal was reckoned the best In fact calves intended for the tables of the upper classes were fed in a special manner they were allowed for six months or even for a year nothing but milk which made their flesh most tender and delicate Contrary to the present taste kid was more appreciated than lamb which caused the rotisseurs frequently to attach the tail of a kid to a lamb so as to deceive the customer and sell him a less expensive meat at the higher price This was the origin of the proverb which described a cheat as a dealer in goat by halves In other places butchers were far from acquiring the same importance which they did in France and Belgium Figs ninety and ninety one where much more meat was consumed than in Spain Italy or even in Germany Nevertheless in almost all countries there were certain regulations sometimes eccentric but almost always rigidly enforced to ensure a supply of meat of the best quality and in a healthy state In England for instance butchers were only allowed to kill bulls after they had been baited with dogs no doubt with the view of making the flesh more tender At Mans it was laid down in the trade regulations that no butcher shall be so bold as to sell meat unless it shall have been previously seen alive by two or three persons who will testify to it on oath and anyhow they shall not sell it until the persons shall have declared it wholesome c To the many regulations affecting the interests of the public must be added that forbidding butchers to sell meat on days when abstinence from animal food was ordered by the Church These regulations applied less to the vendors than to the consumers who by disobeying them were liable to fine or imprisonment or to severe corporal punishment by the whip or in the pillory We find that Clement Marot was imprisoned and nearly burned alive for having eaten pork in Lent In fifteen thirty four Guillaume des Moulins Count of Brie asked permission for his mother who was then eighty years of age to cease fasting the Bishop of Paris only granted dispensation on condition that the old lady should take her meals in secret and out of sight of every one and should still fast on Fridays In a certain town says Brantome there had been a procession in Lent A woman who had assisted at it barefooted went home to dine off a quarter of lamb and a ham The smell got into the street the house was entered The fact being established the woman was taken and condemned to walk through the town with her quarter of lamb on the spit over her shoulder and the ham hung round her neck This species of severity increased during the times of religious dissensions Erasmus says He who has eaten pork instead of fish is taken to the torture like a parricide An edict of Henry II fifteen forty nine forbade the sale of meat in Lent to persons who should not be furnished with a doctor s certificate Charles IX forbade the sale of meat to the Huguenots and it was ordered that the privilege of selling meat during the time of abstinence should belong exclusively to the hospitals Orders were given to those who retailed meat to take the address of every purchaser although he had presented a medical certificate so that the necessity for his eating meat might be verified Subsequently the medical certificate required to be endorsed by the priest specifying what quantity of meat was required Even in these cases the use of butchers meat alone was granted pork poultry and game being strictly forbidden Poultry A monk of the Abbey of Cluny once went on a visit to his relations On arriving he asked for food but as it was a fast day he was told there was nothing in the house but fish Perceiving some chickens in the yard he took a stick and killed one and brought it to his relations saying This is the fish which I shall eat to day Eh but my son they said have you dispensation from fasting on a Friday No he answered but poultry is not flesh fish and fowls were created at the same time they have a common origin as the hymn which I sing in the service teaches me This simple legend belongs to the tenth century and notwithstanding that the opinion of this Benedictine monk may appear strange nowadays yet it must be acknowledged that he was only conforming himself to the opinions laid down by certain theologians In eight hundred seventeen the Council of Aix la Chapelle decided that such delicate nourishment could scarcely be called mortification as understood by the teaching of the Church In consequence of this an order was issued forbidding the monks to eat poultry except during four days at Easter and four at Christmas But this prohibition in no way changed the established custom of certain parts of Christendom and the faithful persisted in believing that poultry and fish were identical in the eyes of the Church and accordingly continued to eat them indiscriminately We also see in the middle of the thirteenth century saint Thomas Aquinas who was considered an authority in questions of dogma and of faith ranking poultry amongst species of aquatic origin Eventually this palpable error was abandoned but when the Church forbade Christians the use of poultry on fast days it made an exception out of consideration for the ancient prejudice in favour of teal widgeon moor hens and also two or three kinds of small amphibious quadrupeds Hence probably arose the general and absurd beliefs concerning the origin of teal which some said sprung from the rotten wood of old ships others from the fruits of a tree or the gum on fir trees whilst others thought they came from a fresh water shell analogous to that of the oyster and mussel As far back as modern history can be traced we find that a similar mode of fattening poultry was employed then as now and was one which the Gauls must have learnt from the Romans Amongst the charges in the households of the kings of France one item was that which concerned the poultry house and which according to an edict of saint Louis in twelve sixty one bears the name of poulaillier At a subsequent period this name was given to breeders and dealers in poultry Fig ninety two The Menagier tells as that as is the present practice chickens were fattened by depriving them of light and liberty and gorging them with succulent food Amongst the poultry yards in repute at that time the author mentions that of Hesdin a property of the Dukes of Luxemburg in Artois that of the King at the Hotel Saint Pol Rue Saint Antoine Paris that of Master Hugues Aubriot provost of Paris and that of Charlot no doubt a bourgeois of that name who also gave his name to an ancient street in that quarter called the Marais Illustration Fig ninety two The Poulterer drawn and engraved in the Sixteenth Century by J Amman Capons are frequently mentioned in poems of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries but the name of the poularde does not occur until the sixteenth We know that under the Roman rule the Gauls carried on a considerable trade in fattened geese This trade ceased when Gaul passed to new masters but the breeding of geese continued to be carefully attended to For many centuries geese were more highly prized than any other description of poultry and Charlemagne ordered that his domains should be well stocked with flocks of geese which were driven to feed in the fields like flocks of sheep There was an old proverb Who eats the king s goose returns the feathers in a hundred years This bird was considered a great delicacy by the working classes and bourgeoisie The rotisseurs Fig ninety four had hardly anything in their shops but geese and therefore when they were united in a company they received the name of oyers or oyeurs The street in which they were established with their spits always loaded with juicy roasts was called Rue des Oues geese and this street when it ceased to be frequented by the oyers became by corruption Rue Auxours Illustration Fig ninety three Barnacle Geese Fac simile of an Engraving on Wood from the Cosmographie Universelle of Munster folio Basle fifteen fifty two There is every reason for believing that the domestication of the wild duck is of quite recent date The attempt having succeeded it was wished to follow it up by the naturalisation in the poultry yard of two other sorts of aquatic birds namely the sheldrake tadorna and the moorhen but without success Some attribute the introduction of turkeys into France and Europe to Jacques Coeur treasurer to Charles VII whose commercial connections with the East were very extensive others assert that it is due to King Rene Count of Provence but according to the best authorities these birds were first brought into France in the time of Francis I by Admiral Philippe de Chabot and Bruyerin Champier asserts that they were not known until even later It was at about the same period that guinea fowls were brought from the coast of Africa by Portuguese merchants and the travelling naturalist Pierre Belon who wrote in the year fifteen fifty five asserts that in his time they had already so multiplied in the houses of the nobles that they had become quite common Illustration Fig ninety four The Poultry dealer Fac simile of an Engraving on Wood after Cesare Vecellio The pea fowl played an important part in the chivalric banquets of the Middle Ages Fig ninety five According to old poets the flesh of this noble bird is food for the brave A poet of the thirteenth century says that thieves have as much taste for falsehood as a hungry man has for the flesh of the peacock In the fourteenth century poultry yards were still stocked with these birds but the turkey and the pheasant gradually replaced them as their flesh was considered somewhat hard and stringy This is proved by the fact that in fifteen eighty one La Nouvelle Coutume du Bourbonnois only reckons the value of these beautiful birds at two sous and a half or about three francs of present currency Illustration Fig ninety five State Banquet Serving the Peacock Fac simile of a Woodcut in an edition of Virgil folio published at Lyons in fifteen seventeen Game Our forefathers included among the birds which now constitute feathered game the heron the crane the crow the swan the stork the cormorant and the bittern These supplied the best tables especially the first three which were looked upon as exquisite food fit even for royalty and were reckoned as thorough French delicacies There were at that time heronries as at a later period there were pheasantries People also ate birds of prey and only rejected those which fed on carrion Swans which were much appreciated were very common on all the principal rivers of France especially in the north a small island below Paris had taken its name from these birds and has maintained it ever since It was proverbially said that the Charente was bordered with swans and for this same reason Valenciennes was called Val des Cygnes or the Swan Valley Some authors make it appear that for a long time young game was avoided owing to the little nourishment it contained and its indigestibility and assert that it was only when some French ambassadors returned from Venice that the French learnt that young partridges and leverets were exquisite and quite fit to appear at the most sumptuous banquets The Menagier gives not only various receipts for cooking them but also for dressing chickens when game was out of season so as to make them taste like young partridges There was a time when they fattened pheasants as they did capons it was a secret says Liebault only known to the poultry dealers but although they were much appreciated the pullet was more so and realised as much as two crowns each this does not mean the gold crown but a current coin worth three livres Plovers which sometimes came from Beauce in cart loads were much relished they were roasted without being drawn as also were turtle doves and larks for says an ancient author larks only eat small pebbles and sand doves grains of juniper and scented herbs and plovers feed on air At a later period the same honour was conferred on woodcocks Thrushes starlings blackbirds quail and partridges were in equal repute according to the season The bec figue a small bird like a nightingale was so much esteemed in Provence that there were feasts at which that bird alone was served prepared in various ways but of all birds used for the table none could be compared to the young cuckoo taken just as it was full fledged As far as we can ascertain the Gauls had a dislike to the flesh of rabbits and they did not even hunt them for according to Strabo Southern Gaul was infested with these mischievous animals which destroyed the growing crops and even the barks of the trees There was considerable change in this respect a few centuries later for every one in town or country reared domesticated rabbits and the wild ones formed an article of food which was much in request In order to ascertain whether a rabbit is young Strabo tells us we should feel the first joint of the fore leg when we shall find a small bone free and movable This method is adopted in all kitchens in the present day Hares were preferred to rabbits provided they were young for an old French proverb says An old hare and an old goose are food for the devil Illustration Fig ninety six The way to skin and cut up a Stag Fac simile of a Miniature of Phoebus and his Staff for hunting Wild Animals Manuscript of the Fifteenth Century National Library of Paris The hedgehog and squirrel were also eaten As for roe and red deer they were according to doctor Bruyerin Ohampier morsels fit for kings and rich people Fig ninety six The doctor speaks of fried slices of the young horn of the stag as the daintiest of food and the Menagier de Paris shows how as early as the fourteenth century beef was dished up like bear s flesh venison for the use of kitchens in countries where the black bear did not exist This proves that bear s flesh was in those days considered good food Milk Butter Eggs and Cheese These articles of food the first which nature gave to man were not always and everywhere uniformly permitted or prohibited by the Church on fast days The faithful were for several centuries left to their own judgment on the subject In fact there is nothing extraordinary in eggs being eaten in Lent without scruple considering that some theologians maintained that the hens which laid them were animals of aquatic extraction It appears however that butter either from prejudice or mere custom was only used on fast days in its fresh state and was not allowed to be used for cooking purposes At first and especially amongst the monks the dishes were prepared with oil but as in some countries oil was apt to become very expensive and the supply even to fail totally animal fat or lard had to be substituted At a subsequent period the Church authorised the use of butter and milk but on this point the discipline varied much In the fourteenth century Charles V King of France having asked Pope Gregory XI for a dispensation to use milk and butter on fast days in consequence of the bad state of his health brought on owing to an attempt having been made to poison him the supreme Pontiff required a certificate from a physician and from the King s confessor He even then only granted the dispensation after imposing on that Christian king the repetition of a certain number of prayers and the performance of certain pious deeds In defiance of the severity of ecclesiastical authority we find in the Journal of a Bourgeois of Paris that in the unhappy reign of Charles VI fourteen twenty for want of oil butter was eaten in Lent the same as on ordinary non fast days In fourteen ninety one Queen Anne Duchess of Brittany in order to obtain permission from the Pope to eat butter in Lent represented that Brittany did not produce oil neither did it import it from southern countries Many northern provinces adopted necessity as the law and having no oil used butter and thence originated that famous toast with slices of bread and butter which formed such an important part of Flemish food These papal dispensations were however only earned at the price of prayers and alms and this was the origin of the troncs pour le beurre that is alms box for butter which are still to be seen in some of the Flemish churches Illustration Fig ninety seven The Manufacture of Oil drawn and engraved by J Amman in the Sixteenth Century It is not known when butter was first salted in order to preserve it or to send it to distant places but this process which is so simple and so natural dates no doubt from very ancient times it was particularly practised by the Normans and Bretons who enclosed the butter in large earthenware jars for in the statutes which were given to the fruiterers of Paris in fourteen twelve mention is made of salt butter in earthenware jars Lorraine only exported butter in such jars The fresh butter most in request for the table in Paris was that made at Vanvres which in the month of May the people ate every morning mixed with garlic The consumption of butter was greatest in Flanders I am surprised says Bruyerin Champier speaking of that country that they have not yet tried to turn it into drink in France it is mockingly called beurriere and when any one has to travel in that country he is advised to take a knife with him if he wishes to taste the good rolls of butter Illustration Fig ninety eight A Dealer in Eggs Fac simile of a Woodcut after Cesare Vecellio Sixteenth Century It is not necessary to state that milk and cheese followed the fortunes of butter in the Catholic world the same as eggs followed those of poultry But butter having been declared lawful by the Church a claim was put in for eggs Fig ninety eight and Pope Julius III granted this dispensation to all Christendom although certain private churches did not at once choose to profit by this favour The Greeks had always been more rigid on these points of discipline than the people of the West It is to the prohibition of eggs in Lent that the origin of Easter eggs must be traced These were hardened by boiling them in a madder bath and were brought to receive the blessing of the priest on Good Friday and were then eaten on the following Sunday as a sign of rejoicing Ancient Gaul was celebrated for some of its home made cheeses Pliny praises those of Nismes and of Mount Lozere in Gevaudau Martial mentions those of Toulouse c A simple anecdote handed down by the monk of saint Gall who wrote in the ninth century proves to us that the traditions with regard to cheeses were not lost in the time of Charlemagne The Emperor in one of his travels alighted suddenly and without being expected at the house of a bishop It was on a Friday The prelate had no fish and did not dare to set meat before the prince He therefore offered him what he had got some boiled corn and green cheese Charles ate of the cheese but taking the green part to be bad he took care to remove it with his knife The Bishop seeing this took the liberty of telling his guest that this was the best part The Emperor tasting it found that the bishop was right and consequently ordered him to send him annually two cases of similar cheese to Aix la Chapelle The Bishop answered that he could easily send cheeses but he could not be sure of sending them in proper condition because it was only by opening them that you could be sure of the dealer not having deceived you in the quality of the cheese Well said the Emperor before sending them cut them through the middle so as to see if they are what I want you will only have to join the two halves again by means of a wooden peg and you can then put the whole into a case Under the kings of the third French dynasty a cheese was made at the village of Chaillot near Paris which was much appreciated in the capital In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries the cheeses of Champagne and of Brie which are still manufactured were equally popular and were hawked in the streets according to the Book of Street Cries in Paris J ai bon fromage de Champaigne Or i a fromage de Brie Buy my cheese from Champagne And my cheese from Brie Eustache Deschamps went so far as to say that cheese was the only good thing which could possibly come from Brie The Menagier de Paris praises several kinds of cheeses the names of which it would now be difficult to trace owing to their frequent changes during four hundred years but according to the Gallic author of this collection a cheese to be presentable at table was required to possess certain qualities in proverbial Latin Non Argus nee Helena nee Maria Magdalena c thus expressed in French rhyme Non mie pas blanc comme Helaine Non mie pas plourant comme

and of Brehemont in Touraine Charles Estienne praises those of Craponne in Auvergne the angelots of Normandy and the cheeses made from fresh cream which the peasant women of Montreuil and Vincennes brought to Paris in small wickerwork baskets and which were eaten sprinkled with sugar The same author names also the rougerets of Lyons which were always much esteemed but above all the cheeses of Europe he places the round or cylindrical ones of Auvergne which were only made by very clean and healthy children of fourteen years of age Olivier de Serres advises those who wish to have good cheeses to boil the milk before churning it a plan which is in use at Lodi and Parma where cheeses are made which are acknowledged by all the world to be excellent The parmesan which this celebrated agriculturist cites as an example only became the fashion in France on the return of Charles VIII from his expedition to Naples Much was thought at that time of a cheese brought from Turkey in bladders and of different varieties produced in Holland and Zetland A few of these foreign products were eaten in stews and in pastry others were toasted and sprinkled with sugar and powdered cinnamon

the Cosmographie Universelle of Munster folio Basle fifteen forty nine If the author of the Menagier is to be believed the women who sold milk by retail in the towns were well acquainted with the method of increasing its quantity at the expense of its quality He describes how his froumentee which consists of a sort of soup is made and states that when he sends his cook to make her purchases at the milk market held in the neighbourhood of the Rues de la Savonnerie des Ecrivains and de la Vieille Monnaie he enjoins her particularly to get very fresh cow s milk and to tell the person who sells it not to do so if she has put water to it for unless it be quite fresh or if there be water in it it will turn Fish and Shellfish Freshwater fish which was much more abundant in former days than now was the ordinary food of those who lived on the borders of lakes ponds or rivers or who at all events were not so far distant but that they could procure it fresh There was of course much diversity at different periods and in different countries as regards the estimation in which the various kinds of fish were held Thus Ausone who was a native of Bordeaux spoke highly of the delicacy of the perch and asserted that shad pike and tench should be left to the lower orders an opinion which was subsequently contradicted by the inhabitants of other parts of Gaul and even by the countrymen of the Latin poet Gregory of Tours who loudly praised the Geneva trout But a time arrived when the higher classes preferred the freshwater fish of Orchies in Flanders and even those of the Lyonnais Thus we see in the thirteenth century the barbel of Saint Florentin held in great estimation whereas two hundred years later a man who was of no use or a nonentity was said to resemble a barbel which is neither good for roasting nor boiling Illustration Fig one hundred The Pond Fisherman Fac simile of a Woodcut of the Cosmographie Universelle of Munster folio Basle fifteen forty nine In a collection

of Nantes the trout of Andeli and the dace of Aise The Menagier adds several others to the above list including blay shad roach and gudgeon but above all the carp which was supposed to be a native of Southern Europe and which must have been naturalised at a much later period in the northern waters Figs one hundred one hundred one and one hundred two Illustration Fig one hundred one The River Fisherman designed and engraved in the Sixteenth Century by J Amman Illustration Fig one hundred two Conveyance of Fish by Water and Land Fac simile of an Engraving in the Royal Statutes of the Provostship of Merchants fifteen twenty eight The most ancient documents bear witness that the natives of the sea coasts of Europe and particularly of the Mediterranean fed on the same fish as at present there were however a few other sea fish which were also used for food but which have since been abandoned Our ancestors were not difficult to please they had good teeth and their palates having become accustomed to the flesh of the cormorant heron and crane without difficulty appreciated the delicacy of the nauseous sea dog the porpoise and even the whale which when salted furnished to a great extent all the markets of Europe The trade in salted sea fish only began in Paris in the twelfth century when a company of merchants was instituted or rather re established on the principle of the ancient association of Nantes This association had existed from the period of the foundation under the Gauls of Lutetia the city of fluvial commerce Fig one hundred three and it is mentioned in the letters patent of Louis VII eleven seventy One of the first cargoes which this company brought in its boats was that of salted herrings from the coast of Normandy These herrings became a necessary food during Lent and Sor et blanc harene fres pouldre couvert de sel Herrings smoked fresh and salted was the cry of the retailers in the streets of Paris where this fish became a permanent article of consumption to an extent which can be appreciated from the fact that Saint Louis gave annually nearly seventy thousand herrings to the hospitals plague houses and monasteries Illustration Fig one hundred three A Votive Altar of the Nantes Parisiens or the Company for the Commercial Navigation of the Seine erected in Lutelia during the reign of Tiberius Fragments of this Altar which were discovered in seventeen eleven under the Choir of the Church of Notre Dame are preserved in the Museums of Cluny and the Palais des Thermes The profit derived from the sale of herrings at that time was so great that it soon became a special trade it was in fact the regular practice of the Middle Ages for persons engaged in any branch of industry to unite together and form themselves into a corporation Other speculators conceived the idea of bringing fresh fish to Paris by means of relays of posting conveyances placed along the road and they called themselves forains Laws were made to distinguish the rights of each of these trades and to prevent any quarrel in the competition In these laws all sea fish were comprised under three names the fresh the salted and the smoked sor Louis IX in an edict divides the dealers into two classes namely the sellers of fresh fish and the sellers of salt or smoked fish Besides salt and fresh herrings an enormous amount of salted mackerel which was almost as much used was brought from the sea coast in addition to flat fish gurnets skate fresh and salted whiting and codfish In an old document of the thirteenth century about fifty kinds of fish are enumerated which were retailed in the markets of the kingdom and a century later the Menagier gives receipts for cooking forty kinds amongst which appears under the name of craspois the salted flesh of the whale which was also called le lard de careme This coarse food which was sent from the northern seas in enormous slices was only eaten by the lower orders for according to a writer of the sixteenth century were it cooked even for twenty four hours it would still be very hard and indigestible The Proverbes of the thirteenth century which mention the freshwater fish then in vogue also names the sea fish most preferred and whence they came namely the shad from Bordeaux the congers from La Rochelle the sturgeon from Blaye the fresh herrings from Fecamp and the cuttle fish from Coutances At a later period the conger was not eaten from its being supposed to produce the plague The turbot John dory skate and sole which were very dear were reserved for the rich The fishermen fed on the sea dragon A great quantity of the small sea crayfish were brought into market and in certain countries these were called sante because the doctors recommended them to invalids or those in consumption on the other hand freshwater crayfish were not much esteemed in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries excepting for their eggs which were prepared with spice It is well known that pond frogs were a favourite food of the Gauls and Franks they were never out of fashion in the rural districts and were served at the best tables dressed with green sauce at the same period and especially during Lent snails which were served in pyramid shaped dishes were much appreciated so much so that nobles and bourgeois cultivated snail beds somewhat resembling our oyster beds of the present day The inhabitants of the coast at all periods ate various kinds of shell fish which were called in Italy sea fruit but it was only towards the twelfth century that the idea was entertained of bringing oysters to Paris and mussels were not known there until much later It is notorious that Henry IV was a great oyster eater Sully relates that when he was created a duke the king came without being expected to take his seat at the reception banquet but as there was much delay in going to dinner he began by eating some huitres de chasse which he found very fresh By huitres de chasse were meant those oysters which were brought by the chasse marees carriers who brought the fresh fish from the coast to Paris at great speed Beverages Beer is not only one of the oldest fermenting beverages used by man but it is also the one which was most in vogue in the Middle Ages If we refer to the tales of the Greek historians we find that the Gauls who like the Egyptians attributed the discovery of this refreshing drink to their god Osiris had two sorts of beer one called zythus made with honey and intended for the rich the other called corma in which there was no honey and which was made for the poor But Pliny asserts that beer in Gallie was called cerevisia and the grain employed for making it brasce This testimony seems true as from brasce or brasse comes the name brasseur brewer and from cerevisia cervoise the generic name by which beer was known for centuries and which only lately fell into disuse Illustration Fig one hundred four The Great Drinkers of the North Fac simile of a Woodcut of the Histoires des Pays Septentrionaux by Olaus Magnus sixteenmo Antwerp fifteen sixty After a great famine Domitian ordered all the vines in Gaul to be uprooted so as to make room for corn This rigorous measure must have caused beer to become even more general and although two centuries later Probus allowed vines to be replanted the use of beverages made from grain became an established custom but in time whilst the people still only drank cervoise those who were able to afford it bought wine and drank it alternately with beer However as by degrees the vineyards increased in all places having a suitable soil and climate the use of beer was almost entirely given up so that in central Gaul wine became so common and cheap that all could drink it In the northern provinces where the vine would not grow beer naturally continued to be the national beverage Fig one hundred four In the time of Charlemagne for instance we find the Emperor wisely ordered that persons knowing how to brew should be attached to each of his farms Everywhere the monastic houses possessed breweries but as early as the reign of saint Louis there were only a very few breweries in Paris itself and in spite of all the privileges granted to their corporation even these were soon obliged to leave the capital where there ceased to be any demand for the produce of their industry They reappeared in fourteen twenty eight probably in consequence of the political and commercial relations which had become established between Paris and the rich towns of the Flemish bourgeoisie and then either on account of the dearness of wine or the caprice of fashion the consumption of beer again became so general in France that according to the Journal d un Bourgeois de Paris it produced to the revenue two thirds more than wine It must be understood however that in times of scarcity as in the years fourteen fifteen and fourteen eighty two brewing was temporarily stopped and even forbidden altogether on account of the quantity of grain which was thereby withdrawn from the food supply of the people Fig one hundred five Illustration Fig one hundred five The Brewer designed and engraved in the Sixteenth Century by J Amman Under the Romans the real cervoise or beer was made with barley but at a later period all sorts of grain was indiscriminately used and it was only towards the end of the sixteenth century that adding the flower or seed of hops to the oats or barley which formed the basis of this beverage was thought of Estienne Boileau s Book of Trades edited in the thirteenth century shows us that besides the cervoise another sort of beer was known which was called godale This name we should imagine was derived from the two German words god ael which mean good beer and was of a stronger description than the ordinary cervoise this idea is proved by the Picards and Flemish people calling it double beer In any case it is from the word godale that the familiar expression of godailler to tipple is derived In fact there is hardly any sort of mixture or ingredient which has not been used in the making of beer according to the fashions of the different periods When on the return from the Crusades the use of spice had become the fashion beverages as well as the food were loaded with it Allspice juniper resin apples bread crumbs sage lavender gentian cinnamon and laurel were each thrown into it The English sugared it and the Germans salted it and at times they even went so far as to put darnel into it at the risk of rendering the mixture poisonous The object of these various mixtures was naturally to obtain high flavoured beers which became so much in fashion that to describe the want of merit of persons or the lack of value in anything no simile was more common than to compare them to small beer Nevertheless more delicate and less blunted palates were to be found which could appreciate beer sweetened simply with honey or scented with ambergris or raspberries It is possible however that these compositions refer to mixtures in which beer the produce of fermented grain was confounded with hydromel or fermented honey Both these primitive drinks claim an origin equally remote which is buried in the most distant periods of history and they have been used in all parts of the world being mentioned in the oldest historical records in the Bible the Edda and in the sacred books of India In the thirteenth century hydromel which then bore the name of borgerafre borgeraste or bochet was composed of one part of honey to twelve parts of water scented with herbs and allowed to ferment for a month or six weeks This beverage which in the customs and statutes of the order of Cluny is termed potus dulcissimus the sweetest beverage and which must have been both agreeable in taste and smell was specially appreciated by the monks who feasted on it on the great anniversaries of the Church Besides this an inferior quality of bochet was made for the consumption of the lower orders and peasants out of the honeycomb after the honey had been drained away or with the scum which rose during the fermentation of the better qualities Illustration Fig one hundred six The Vintagers after a Miniature of the Dialogues de Saint Gregoire Thirteenth Century Manuscript of the Royal Library of Brussels Cider in Latin sicera and perry can also both claim a very ancient origin since they are mentioned by Pliny It does not appear however that the Gauls were acquainted with them The first historical mention of them is made with reference to a repast which Thierry II King of Burgundy and Orleans five hundred ninety six six hundred thirteen son of Childebert and grandson of Queen Brunehaut gave to saint Colomban in which both cider and wine were used In the thirteenth century a Latin poet Guillaume le Breton says that the inhabitants of the Auge and of Normandy made cider their daily drink but it is not likely that this beverage was sent away from the localities where it was made for besides the fact that the Menagier only very curtly mentions a drink made of apples we know that in the fifteenth century the Parisians were satisfied with pouring water on apples and steeping them so as to extract a sort of half sour half sweet drink called depense Besides this Paulmier de Grandmesnil a Norman by birth a famous doctor and the author of a Latin treatise on wine and cider fifteen eighty eight asserts that half a century before cider was very scarce at Rouen and that in all the districts of Caux the people only drank beer Duperron adds that the Normans brought cider from Biscay when their crops of apples failed By whom and at what period the vine was naturalised in Gaul has been a long disputed question which in spite of the most careful research remains unsolved The most plausible opinion is that which attributes the honour of having imported the vine to the Phoenician colony who founded Marseilles Pliny makes mention of several wines of the Gauls as being highly esteemed He nevertheless reproaches the vine growers of Marseilles Beziers and Narbonne with doctoring their wines and with infusing various drugs into them which rendered them disagreeable and even unwholesome Fig one hundred six Dioscorides however approved of the custom in use among the Allobroges of mixing resin with their wines to preserve them and prevent them from turning sour as the temperature of their country was not warm enough thoroughly to ripen the grape Rooted up by order of Domitian in ninety two as stated above the vine only reappeared in Gaul under Protus who revoked in two hundred eighty two the imperial edict of his predecessor after which period the Gallic wines soon recovered their ancient celebrity Under the dominion of the Franks who held wine in great favour vineyard property was one of those which the barbaric laws protected with the greatest care We find in the code of the Salians and in that of the Visigoths very severe penalties for uprooting a vine or stealing a bunch of grapes The cultivation of the vine became general and kings themselves planted them even in the gardens of their city palaces In eleven sixty there was still in Paris near the Louvre a vineyard of such an extent that Louis VII could annually present six hogsheads of wine made from it to the rector of saint Nicholas Philip Augustus possessed about twenty vineyards of excellent quality in various parts of his kingdom The culture of the vine having thus developed the wine trade acquired an enormous importance in France Gascony Aunis and Saintonge sent their wines to Flanders Guyenne sent hers to England Froissart writes that in thirteen seventy two a merchant fleet of quite two hundred sail came from London to Bordeaux for wine This flourishing trade received a severe blow in the sixteenth century for an awful famine having invaded France in fifteen sixty six Charles IX did not hesitate to repeat the acts of Domitian and to order all the vines to be uprooted and their place to be sown with corn fortunately Henry III soon after modified this edict by simply recommending the governors of the provinces to see that the ploughs were not being neglected in their districts on account of the excessive cultivation of the vine Illustration Fig one hundred seven Interior of an Hostelry Fac simile of a Woodcut in a folio edition of Virgil published at Lyons in fifteen seventeen Although the trade of a wine merchant is one of the oldest established in Paris it does not follow that the retail sale of wine was exclusively carried on by special tradesmen On the contrary for a long time the owner of the vineyard retailed the wine which he had not been able to sell in the cask A broom a laurel wreath or some other sign of the sort hung over a door denoted that any one passing could purchase or drink wine within When the wine growers did not have the quality and price of their wine announced in the village or town by the public crier they placed a man before the door of their cellar who enticed the public to enter and taste the new wines Other proprietors instead of selling for people to take away in their own vessels established a tavern in some room of their house where they retailed drink Fig one hundred seven The monks who made wine extensively also opened these taverns in the monasteries as they only consumed part of their wine themselves and this system was universally adopted by wine growers and even by the king and the nobles The latter however had this advantage that whilst they were retailing their wines no one in the district was allowed to enter into competition with them This prescriptive right which was called droit de ban vin was still in force in the seventeenth century Saint Louis granted special statutes to the wine merchants in twelve sixty four but it was only three centuries later that they formed a society which was divided into four classes namely hotel keepers publichouse keepers tavern proprietors and dealers in wine a pot that is sold to people to take away with them Hotel keepers also called aubergistes accommodated travellers and also put up horses and carriages The dealers a pot sold wine which could not be drunk on their premises There was generally a sort of window in their door through which the empty pot was passed to be returned filled hence the expression still in use in the eighteenth century vente a huis coupe sale through a cut door Publichouse keepers supplied drink as well as nappe et assiette tablecloth and plate which meant that refreshments were also served And lastly the taverniers sold wine to be drunk on the premises but without the right of supplying bread or meat to their customers Figs one hundred eight and one hundred nine Illustration Fig one hundred eight Banner of the Corporation of the Publichouse keepers of Montmedy Illustration Fig one hundred nine Banner of the Corporation of the Publichouse keepers of Tonnerre The wines of France in most request from the ninth to the thirteenth centuries were those of Macon Cahors Rheims Choisy Montargis Marne Meulan and Orleanais Amongst the latter there was one which was much appreciated by Henry I and of which he kept a store to stimulate his courage when he joined his army The little fable of the Battle of Wines composed in the thirteenth century by Henri d Andelys mentions a number of wines which have to this day maintained their reputation for instance the Beaune in Burgundy the Saint Emilion in Gruyenne the Chablis Epernay Sezanne in Champagne c But he places above all with good reason according to the taste of those days the Saint Pourcain of Auvergne which was then most expensive and in great request Another French poet in describing the luxurious habits of a young man of fashion says that he drank nothing but Saint Pourcain and in a poem composed by Jean Bruyant secretary of the Chatelet of Paris in thirteen thirty two we find Du saint pourcain Que l on met en son sein pour sain Saint Pourcain wine which you imbibe for the good of your health Illustration Fig one hundred ten Banner of the Coopers of Bayonne Illustration Fig one hundred eleven Banner of the Coopers of La Rochelle Towards fourteen hundred the vineyards of Ai became celebrated for Champagne as those of Beaune were for Burgundy and it is then that we find according to the testimony of the learned Paulmier de Grandmesnil kings and queens making champagne their favourite beverage Tradition has it that Francis I Charles Quint Henry VIII and Pope Leon X all possessed vineyards in Champagne at the same time Burgundy that pure and pleasant wine was not despised and it was in its honour that Erasmus said Happy province she may well call herself the mother of men since she produces such milk Nevertheless the above mentioned physician Paulmier preferred to burgundy if not perhaps for their flavour yet for their wholesomeness the vines of the Ile de France or vins francais which agree he says with scholars invalids the bourgeois and all other persons who do not devote themselves to manual labour for they do not parch the blood like the wines of Gascony nor fly to the head like those of Orleans and Chateau Thierry nor do they cause obstructions like those of Bordeaux This is also the opinion of Baccius who in his Latin treatise on the natural history of wines fifteen ninety six asserts that the wines of Paris are in no way inferior to those of any other district of the kingdom These thin and sour wines so much esteemed in the first periods of monarchy and so long abandoned first lost favour in the reign of Francis I who preferred the strong and stimulating productions of the South Notwithstanding the great number of excellent wines made in their own country the French imported from other lands In the thirteenth century in the Battle of Wines we find those of Aquila Spain and above all those of Cyprus spoken of in high terms A century later Eustace Deschamps praised the Rhine wines and those of Greece Malmsey and Grenache In an edict of Charles VI mention is also made of the muscatel rosette and the wine of Lieppe Generally the Malmsey which was drunk in France was an artificial preparation which had neither the colour nor taste of the Cyprian wine Olivier de Serres tells us that in his time it was made with water honey clary juice beer grounds and brandy At first the same name was used for the natural wine mulled and spiced which was produced in the island of Madeira from the grapes which the Portuguese brought there from Cyprus in fourteen twenty The reputation which this wine acquired in Europe induced Francis I to import some vines from Greece and he planted fifty acres with them near Fontainebleau It was at first considered that this plant was succeeding so well that there were hopes says Olivier de Serres that France would soon be able to furnish her own Malmsey and Greek wines instead of having to import them from abroad It is evident however that they soon gave up this delusion and that for want of the genuine wine they returned to artificial beverages such as vin cuit or cooked wine which had at all times been cleverly prepared by boiling down new wine and adding various aromatic herbs to it Many wines were made under the name of herbes which were merely infusions of wormwood myrtle hyssop rosemary c mixed with sweetened wine and flavoured with honey The most celebrated of these beverages bore the pretentious name of nectar those composed of spices Asiatic aromatics and honey were generally called white wine a name indiscriminately applied to liquors having for their bases some slightly coloured wine as well as to the hypocras which was often composed of a mixture of foreign liqueurs This hypocras plays a prominent part in the romances of chivalry and was considered a drink of honour being always offered to kings princes and nobles on their solemn entry into a town Illustration Fig one hundred twelve Butler at his Duties Fac simile from a Woodcut in the Cosmographie Universelle of Munster folio Basle fifteen forty nine The name of wine was also given to drinks composed of the juices of certain fruits and in which grapes were in no way used These were the cherry the currant the raspberry and the pomegranate wines also the more made with the mulberry which was so extolled by the poets of the thirteenth century We must also mention the sour wines which were made by pouring water on the refuse grapes after the wine had been extracted also the drinks made from filberts milk of almonds the syrups of apricots and strawberries and cherry and raspberry waters all of which were refreshing and were principally used in summer and lastly tisane sold by the confectioners of Paris and made hot or cold with prepared barley dried grapes plums dates gum or liquorice This tisane may be considered as the origin of that drink which is now sold to the poor at a sous a glass and which most assuredly has not much improved since olden times It was about the thirteenth century that brandy first became known in France but it does not appear that it was recognised as a liqueur before the sixteenth The celebrated physician Arnauld de Villeneuve who wrote at the end of the thirteenth century to whom credit has wrongly been given for inventing brandy employed it as one of his remedies and thus expresses himself about it Who would have believed that we could have derived from wine a liquor which neither resembles it in nature colour or effect This eau de vin is called by some eau de vie and justly so since it prolongs life It prolongs health dissipates superfluous matters revives the spirits and preserves youth Alone or added to some other proper remedy it cures colic dropsy paralysis ague gravel c At a period when so many doctors alchemists and other learned men made it their principal occupation to try to discover that marvellous golden fluid which was to free the human race of all its original infirmities the discovery of such an elixir could not fail to attract the attention of all such manufacturers of panaceas It was therefore under the name of eau d or aqua auri that brandy first became known to the world a name improperly given to it implying as it did that it was of mineral origin whereas its beautiful golden colour was caused by the addition of spices At a later period when it lost its repute as a medicine they actually sprinkled it with pure gold leaves and at the same time that it ceased to be exclusively considered as a remedy it became a favourite beverage It was also employed in distilleries especially as the basis of various strengthening and exciting liqueurs most of which have descended to us some coming from monasteries and others from chateaux where they had been manufactured The Kitchen Soups broths and stews c The French word potage must originally have signified a soup composed of vegetables and herbs from the kitchen garden but from the remotest times it was applied to soups in general As the Gauls according to Athenaeus generally ate their meat boiled we must presume that they made soup with the water in which it was cooked It is related that one day Gregory of Tours was sitting at the table of King Chilperic when the latter offered him a soup specially made in his honour from chicken The poems of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries mention soups made of peas of bacon of vegetables and of groats In the southern provinces there were soups made of almonds and of olive oil When Du Gueselin went out to fight the English knight William of Blancbourg in single combat he first ate three sorts of soup made with wine in honour of the three persons in the Holy Trinity Illustration Fig one hundred thirteen Interior of a Kitchen of the Sixteenth Century Fac simile from a Woodcut in the Calendarium Romanum of Jean Staeffler folio Tubingen fifteen eighteen We find in the Menagier amongst a long list of the common soups the receipts for which are given soup made of dried peas and the water in which bacon has been boiled and in Lent salted whale water watercress soup cabbage soup cheese soup and gramose soup which was prepared by adding stewed meat to the water in which meat had already been boiled and adding beaten eggs and verjuice and lastly the souppe despourvue which was rapidly made at the hotels for unexpected travellers and was a sort of soup made from the odds and ends of the larder In those days there is no doubt but that hot soup formed an indispensable part of the daily meals and that each person took it at least twice a day according to the old proverb Soupe la soir soupe le matin C est l ordinaire du bon chretien Soup in the evening and soup in the morning Is the everyday food of a good Christian The cooking apparatus of that period consisted of a whole glittering array of cauldrons saucepans kettles and vessels of red and yellow copper which hardly sufficed for all the rich soups for which France was so famous Thence the old proverb En France sont les grands soupiers But besides these soups which were in fact looked upon as common and without spice a number of dishes were served under the generic name of soup which constituted the principal luxuries at the great tables in the fourteenth century but which do not altogether bear out the names under which we find them For instance there was haricot mutton a sort of stew thin chicken broth veal broth with herbs soup made of veal roe stag wild boar pork hare and rabbit soup flavoured with green peas c The greater number of these soups were very rich very expensive several being served at the same time and in order to please the eye as well as the taste they were generally made of various colours sweetened with sugar and sprinkled with pomegranate seeds and aromatic herbs such as marjoram sage thyme sweet basil savoury c Illustration Fig one hundred fourteen Coppersmith designed and engraved in the Sixteenth Century by J Amman These descriptions of soups were perfect luxuries and were taken instead of sweets As a proof of this we must refer to the famous soupe doree the description of which is given by Taillevent head cook of Charles VII in the following words Toast slices of bread throw them into a jelly made of sugar white wine yolk of egg and rosewater when they are well soaked fry them then throw them again into the rosewater and sprinkle them with sugar and saffron Illustration Fig one hundred fifteen

Sixteenth Century eleven Cauldron Fifteenth Century It is possible that even now this kind of soup might find some favour but we cannot say the same for those made with mustard hemp seed millet verjuice and a number of others much in repute at that period for we see in Rabelais that the French were the greatest soup eaters in the world and boasted to be the inventors of seventy sorts We have already remarked that broths were in use at the remotest periods for from the time that the practice of boiling various meats was first adopted it must have been discovered that the water in which they were so boiled became savoury and nourishing In the time of the great King Francis I says Noel du Fail in his Contes d Eutrapel in many places the saucepan was put on to the table on which there was only one other large dish of beef mutton veal and bacon garnished with a large bunch of cooked herbs the whole of which mixture composed a porridge and a real restorer and elixir of life From this came the adage The soup in the great pot and the dainties in the hotch potch At one time they made what they imagined to be strengthening broths for invalids though their virtue must have been somewhat delusive for after having boiled down various materials in a close kettle and at a slow fire they then distilled from this and the water thus obtained was administered as a sovereign remedy The common sense of Bernard Palissy did not fail to make him see this absurdity and to protest against this ridiculous custom Take a capon he says a partridge or anything else cook it well and then if you smell the broth you will find it very good and if you taste it you will find it has plenty of flavour so much so that you will feel that it contains something to invigorate you Distil this on the contrary and take the water then collected and taste it and you will find it insipid and without smell except that of burning This should convince you that your restorer does not give that nourishment to the weak body for which you recommend it as a means of making good blood and restoring and strengthening the spirits The taste for broths made of flour was formerly almost universal in France and over the whole of Europe it is spoken of repeatedly in the histories and annals of monasteries and we know that the Normans who made it their principal nutriment were surnamed bouilleux They were indeed almost like the Romans who in olden times before their wars with eastern nations gave up making bread and ate their corn simply boiled in water In the fourteenth century the broths and soups were made with millet flour and mixed wheats The pure wheat flour was steeped in milk seasoned with sugar saffron honey sweet wine or aromatic herbs and sometimes butter fat and yolks of eggs were added It was on account of this that the bread of the ancients so much resembled cakes and it was also from this fact that the art of the pastrycook took its rise Wheat made into gruel for a long time was an important ingredient in cooking being the basis of a famous preparation called fromentee which was a bouillie of milk made creamy by the addition of yolks of eggs and which served as a liquor in which to roast meats and fish There were besides several sorts of fromentee all equally esteemed and Taillevent recommended the following receipt which differs from the one above given First boil your wheat in water then put into it the juice or gravy of fat meat or if you like it better milk of almonds and by this means you will make a soup fit for fasts because it dissolves slowly is of slow digestion and nourishes much In this way too you can make ordiat or barley soup which is more generally approved than the said fromentee Illustration Fig one hundred sixteen Interior of a Kitchen Fac

amongst our ancestors The manufacture of sweet and savoury pastry was intrusted to the care of the good menagiers of all ranks and conditions and to the corporation of pastrycooks who obtained their statutes only in the middle of the sixteenth century the united skill of these both in Paris and in the provinces multiplied the different sorts of tarts and meat pies to a very great extent So much was this the case that these ingenious productions became a special art worthy of rivalling even cookery itself Figs one hundred seventeen one hundred eighteen and one hundred thirty One of the earliest known receipts for making pies is that of Gaces de la Bigne first chaplain of Kings John Charles V and Charles VI We find it in a sporting poem and it deserves to be quoted verbatim as a record of the royal kitchen of the fourteenth century It will be observed on perusing it that nothing was spared either in pastry or in cookery and that expense was not considered when it was a question of satisfying the appetite Trois perdriaulx gros et reffais Au milieu du pate me mets Mais gardes bien que tu ne failles A moi prendre six grosses cailles De quoi tu les apuyeras Et puis

that you must take a dozen skylarks which round the quail you must place And then you must take some thrushes and such other little birds as you can get to garnish the pie Further you must provide yourself with a little bacon which must not be in the least rank reasty and you must cut it into pieces of the size of a die and sprinkle them into the pie If you want it to be in quite good form you must put some sour grapes in and a very little salt Have eggs put into the paste and the crust made rather hard of the flour of pure wheat Put in neither spice nor cheese Put it into the oven just at the proper heat The bottom of which must be quite free from ashes And when it is baked enough isn t that a dish to feast on From this period all treatises on cookery are full of the same kind of receipts for making pies of young chickens of fresh venison of veal of eels of bream and salmon of young rabbits of pigeons of small birds of geese and of narrois a mixture of cod s liver and hashed fish We may mention also the small pies which were made of minced beef and raisins similar to our mince pies and which were hawked in the streets of Paris until their sale was forbidden because the trade encouraged greediness on the one hand and laziness on the other Ancient pastries owing to their shapes received the name of tourte or tarte from the Latin torta a large hunch of bread This name was afterwards exclusively used for hot pies whether they contained vegetables meat or fish But towards the end of the fourteenth century tourte and tarte was applied to pastry containing herbs fruits or preserves and pate to those containing any kind of meat game or fish Illustration Fig one hundred seventeen Banner of the Corporation of Pastrycooks of Caen Illustration Fig one hundred eighteen Banner of the Corporation of Pastrycooks of Bordeaux It was only in the course of the sixteenth century that the name of potage ceased to be applied to stews whose number equalled their variety for on a bill of fare of a banquet of that period we find more than fifty different sorts of potages mentioned The greater number of these dishes have disappeared from our books on cookery having gone out of fashion but there are two stews which were popular during many centuries and which have maintained their reputation although they do not now exactly represent what they formerly did The pot pourri which was composed of veal beef mutton bacon and vegetables and the galimafree a fricassee of poultry sprinkled with verjuice flavoured with spices and surrounded by a sauce composed of vinegar bread crumbs cinnamon ginger c Fig one hundred nineteen The highest aim of the cooks of the Taillevent school was to make dishes not only palatable but also pleasing to the eye These masters in the art of cooking might be said to be both sculptors and painters so much did they decorate their works their object being to surprise or amuse the guests by concealing the real nature of the disbes Froissart speaking of a repast given in his time says that there were a number of dishes so curious and disguised that it was impossible to guess what they were For instance the bill of fare above referred to mentions a lion and a sun made of white chicken a pink jelly with diamond shaped points and as if the object of cookery was to disguise food and deceive epicures Taillevent facetiously gives us a receipt for making fried or roast butter and for cooking eggs on the spit Illustration Fig one hundred nineteen Interior of Italian Kitchen Fac simile of a Woodcut in the Book on Cookery of Christoforo di Messisburgo Banchetti compositioni di Vivende fourto Ferrara fifteen forty nine The roasts were as numerous as the stews A treatise of the fourteenth century names about thirty beginning with a sirloin of beef which must have been one of the most common and ending with a swan which appeared on table in full plumage This last was the triumph of cookery inasmuch as it presented this magnificent bird to the eyes of the astonished guests just as if he were living and swimming His beak was gilt his body silvered resting on a mass of brown pastry painted green in order to represent a grass field Eight banners of silk were placed round and a cloth of the same material served as a carpet for the whole dish which towered above the other appointments of the table Illustration Fig one hundred twenty Hunting Meal Fac simile of a Miniature in the Manuscript of the Livre du Roy Modus National Library of Paris The peacock which was as much thought of then as it is little valued now was similarly arrayed and was brought to table amidst a flourish of trumpets and the applause of all present The modes of preparing other roasts much resembled the present system in their simplicity with this difference that strong meats were first boiled to render them tender and no roast was ever handed over to the skill of the carver without first being thoroughly basted with orange juice and rose water and covered with sugar and powdered spices We must not forget to mention the broiled dishes the invention of which is attributed to hunters and which Rabelais continually refers to as acting as stimulants and irresistibly exciting the thirst for wine at the sumptuous feasts of those voracious heroes Fig one hundred twenty The custom of introducing salads after roasts was already established in the fifteenth century However a salad of whatever sort was never brought to table in its natural state for besides the raw herbs dressed in the same manner as in our days it contained several mixtures such as cooked vegetables and the crests livers or brains of poultry After the salads fish was served sometimes fried sometimes sliced with eggs or reduced to a sort of pulp which was called carpee or charpie and sometimes it was boiled in water or wine with strong seasoning Near the salads in the course of the dinner dishes of eggs prepared in various ways were generally served Many of these are now in use such as the poached egg the hard boiled egg egg sauce c Illustration Fig one hundred twenty one Shop of a Grocer and Druggist from a Stamp of Vriese Seventeenth Century Seasonings We have already stated that the taste for spices much increased in Europe after the Crusades and in this rapid historical sketch of the food of the French people in the Middle Ages it must have been observed to what an extent this taste had become developed in France Fig one hundred twenty one This was the origin of sauces all or almost all of which were highly spiced and were generally used with boiled roast or grilled meats A few of these sauces such as the yellow the green and the cameline became so necessary in cooking that numerous persons took to manufacturing them by wholesale and they were hawked in the streets of Paris These sauce criers were first called saulciers then vinaigriers moustardiers and when Louis XII united them in a body as their business had considerably increased they were termed sauciers moutardiers vinaigriers distillers of brandy and spirits of wine and buffetiers from buffet a sideboard Illustration Fig one hundred twenty two The Cook drawn and engraved in the Sixteenth Century by J Amman But very soon the corporation became divided no doubt from the force of circumstances and on one side we find the distillers and on the other the master cooks and cooks or porte chapes as they were called because when they carried on their business of cooking they covered their dishes with a chape that is a cope or tin cover Fig one hundred twenty two so as to keep them warm The list of sauces of the fourteenth century given by the Menagier de Paris is most complicated but on examining the receipts it becomes clear that the variety of those preparations intended to sharpen the appetite resulted principally from the spicy ingredients with which they were flavoured and it is here worthy of remark that pepper in these days exclusively obtained from America was known and generally used long before the time of Columbus It is mentioned in a document of the time of Clotaire III six hundred sixty and it is clear therefore that before the discovery of the New World pepper and spices were imported into Europe from the East Mustard which was an ingredient in so many dishes was cultivated and manufactured in the thirteenth century in the neighbourhood of Dijon and Angers According to a popular adage garlic was the medicine theriaque of peasants town people for a long time greatly appreciated aillee which was a sauce made of garlic and sold ready prepared in the streets of Paris The custom of using anchovies as a flavouring is also very ancient This was also done with botargue and cavial two sorts of side dishes which consisted of fishes eggs chiefly mullet and sturgeon properly salted or dried and mixed with fresh or pickled olives The olives for the use of the lower orders were brought from Languedoc and Provence whereas those for the rich were imported from Spain and some from Syria It was also from the south of France that the rest of the kingdom was supplied with olive oil for which to this day those provinces have preserved their renown but as early as the twelfth and thirteenth centuries oil of walnuts was brought from the centre of France to Paris and this although cheaper was superseded by oil extracted from the poppy Truffles though known and esteemed by the ancients disappeared from the gastronomie collection of our forefathers It was only in the fourteenth century that they were again introduced but evidently without a knowledge of their culinary qualities since after being preserved in vinegar they were soaked in hot water and afterwards served up in butter We may also here mention sorrel and the common mushroom which were used in cooking during the Middle Ages On the strength of the old proverb Sugar has never spoiled sauce sugar was put into all sauces which were not piquantes and generally some perfumed water was added to them such as rose water This was made in great quantities by exposing to the sun a basin full of water covered over by another basin of glass under which was a little vase containing rose leaves This rose water was added to all stews pastries and beverages It is very doubtful as to the period at which white lump sugar became known in the West However in an account of the house of the Dauphin Viennois thirteen thirty three mention is made of white sugar and the author of the Menagier de Paris frequently speaks of this white sugar which before the discovery or rather colonisation of America was brought ready refined from the Grecian islands and especially from Candia Illustration Fig one hundred twenty three The Issue de Table Fac simile of a Woodcut in the Treatise of Christoforo di Messisburgo Banchetti compositioni di Vivende fourto Ferrara fifteen forty nine Verjuice or green juice which with vinegar formed the essential basis of sauces and is now extracted from a species of green grape which never ripens was originally the juice of sorrel another sort was extracted by pounding the green blades of wheat Vinegar was originally merely soured wine as the word vin aigre denotes The mode of manufacturing it by artificial means in order to render the taste more pungent and the quality better is very ancient It is needless to state that it was scented by the infusion of herbs or flowers roses elder cloves c but it was not much before the sixteenth century that it was used for pickling herbs or fruits and vegetables such as gherkins onions cucumber purslain c Salt which from the remotest periods was the condiment par excellence and the trade in which had been free up to the fourteenth century became from that period the subject of repeated taxation The levying of these taxes was a frequent cause of tumult amongst the people who saw with marked displeasure the exigencies of the excise gradually raising the price of an article of primary necessity We have already mentioned times during which the price of salt was so exorbitant that the rich alone could put it in their bread Thus in the reign of Francis I it was almost as dear as Indian spices Sweet Dishes Desserts c In the fourteenth century the first courses of a repast were called mets or assiettes the last entremets dorures issue de table desserte and boule hors The dessert consisted generally of baked pears medlars pealed walnuts figs dates peaches grapes filberts spices and white or red sugar plums At the issue de table wafers or some other light pastry were introduced which were eaten with the hypocras wine The boute hors which was served when the guests after having washed their hands and said grace had passed into the drawing room consisted of spices different from those which had appeared at dessert and intended specially to assist the digestion and for this object they must have been much needed considering that a repast lasted several hours Whilst eating these spices they drank Grenache Malmsey or aromatic wines Fig one hundred twenty three It was only at the banquets and great repeats that sweet dishes and dorures appeared and they seem to have been introduced for the purpose of exhibiting the power of the imagination and the talent in execution of the master cook The dorures consisted of jellies of all sorts and colours swans peacocks bitterns and herons on gala feasts were served in full feather on a raised platform in the middle of the table and hence the name of raised dishes As for the side dishes properly so called the long list collected in the Menagier shows us that they were served at table indiscriminately for stuffed chickens at times followed hashed porpoise in sauce lark pies succeeded lamb sausages and pike s eggs fritters appeared after orange preserve At a later period the luxury of side dishes consisted in the quantity and in the variety of the pastry Rabelais names sixteen different sorts at one repast Taillevent mentions pastry called covered pastry Bourbonnaise pastry double faced pastry pear pastry and apple pastry Platina speaks of the white pastry with quince elder flowers rice roses chestnuts c The fashion of having pastry is however of very ancient date for in the book of the Proverbs of the thirteenth century we find that the pies of Dourlens and the pastry of Chartres were then in great celebrity Illustration Fig one hundred twenty four The Table of a Baron as laid out in the Thirteenth Century Miniature from the Histoire de saint Graal Manuscript from the Imperial Library Paris In a charter of Robert le Bouillon Bishop of Amiens in thirteen eleven mention is made of a cake composed of puff flaky paste these cakes however are less ancient than the firm pastry called bean cake or king s cake which from the earliest days of monarchy appeared on all the tables not only at the feast of the Epiphany but also on every festive occasion Amongst the dry and sweet pastries from the small oven which appeared at the issue de table the first to be noticed were those made of almonds nuts c and such choice morsels which were very expensive then came the cream or cheesecakes the petits choux made of butter and eggs the echaudes of which the people were very fond and saint Louis even allowed the bakers to cook them on Sundays and feast days for the poor wafers which are older than the thirteenth century and lastly the oublies which under the names of nieules esterets and supplications gave rise to such an extensive trade that a corporation was established in Paris called the oublayeurs oublayers or oublieux whose statutes directed that none should be admitted to exercise the trade unless he was able to make in one day five hundred large oublies three hundred supplications and two hundred esterets Repasts and Feasts We have had to treat elsewhere of the rules and regulations of the repasts under the Merovingian and Carlovingian kings We have also spoken of the table service of the thirteenth century see chapter on Private Life The earliest author who has left us any documents on this curious subject is that excellent bourgeois to whom we owe the Menagier de Paris He describes for instance in its fullest details a repast which was given in the fourteenth century by the Abbe de Lagny to the Bishop of Paris the President of the Parliament the King s attorney and advocate and other members of his council in all sixteen guests We find from this account that my lord of Paris occupying the place of honour was in consequence of his rank served on covered dishes by three of his squires as was the custom for the King the royal princes the dukes and peers that Master President who was seated by the side of the bishop was also served by one of his own servants but on uncovered dishes and the other guests were seated at table according to the order indicated by their titles or charges The bill of fare of this feast which was given on a fast day is the more worthy of attention in that it proves to us what numerous resources cookery already possessed This was especially the case as regards fish notwithstanding that the transport of fresh sea fish was so difficult owing to the bad state of the roads First a quarter of a pint of Grenache was given to each guest on sitting down then hot

the Menagier de Paris M le Baron Jerome Pichon after giving us this curious account of the mode of living of the citizens of that day thus sums up the whole arrangements for the table in the fourteenth century The different provisions necessary for food are usually entrusted to the squires of the kitchen and were chosen purchased and paid for by one or more of these officials assisted by the cooks The dishes prepared by the cooks were placed by the help of the esquires on dressers in the kitchen until the moment of serving Thence they were carried to the tables Let us imagine a vast hall hung with tapestries and other brilliant stuffs The tables are covered with fringed table cloths and strewn with odoriferous herbs one of them called the Great Table is reserved for the persons of distinction The guests are taken to their seats by two butlers who bring them water to wash The Great Table is laid out by a butler with silver salt cellars Figs one hundred twenty six and one hundred twenty seven golden goblets with lids for the high personages spoons and silver drinking cups The guests eat at least certain dishes on tranchoirs or large slices of thick bread afterwards thrown into vases called couloueres drainers For the other tables the salt is placed on pieces of bread scooped out for that purpose by the intendants who are called porte chappes In the hall is a dresser covered with plate and various kinds of wine Two squires standing near this dresser give the guests clean spoons pour out what wine they ask for and remove the silver when used two other squires superintend the conveyance of wine to the dresser a varlet placed under their orders is occupied with nothing but drawing wine from the casks At that time wine was not bottled and they drew directly from the cask the amount necessary for the day s consumption The dishes consisting of three four five and even six courses called mets or assiettes are brought in by varlets and two of the principal squires and in certain wedding feasts the bridegroom walked in front of them The dishes are placed on the table by an asseeur placer assisted by two servants The latter take away the remains at the conclusion of the course and hand them over to the squires of the kitchen who have charge of them After the mets or assiettes the table cloths are changed and the entremets are then brought in This course is the most brilliant of the repast and at some of the princely banquets the dishes are made to imitate a sort of theatrical representation It is composed of sweet dishes of coloured jellies of swans of peacocks or of pheasants adorned with their feathers having the beak and feet gilt and placed on the middle of the table on a sort of pedestal To the entremets a course which does not appear on all bills of fare succeeds the dessert The issue or exit from table is mostly composed of hypocras and a sort of oublie called mestier or in summer when hypocras is out of season on account of its strength of apples cheeses and sometimes of pastries and sweetmeats The boute hors wines and spices end the repast The guests then wash their hands say grace and pass into the chambre de parement or drawing room The servants then sit down and dine after their masters They subsequently bring the guests wine and epices de chambre after which each retires home Illustration Figs one

and magnificence of the feasts of this period would have appeared paltry a century later when royal banquets were managed by Taillevent head cook to Charles VII The historian of French cookery Legrand d Aussy thus desoribes a great feast given in fourteen fifty five by the Count of Anjou third son of Louis II King of Sicily On the table was placed a centre piece which represented a green lawn surrounded with large peacocks feathers and green branches to which were tied violets and other sweet smelling flowers In the middle of this lawn a fortress was placed covered with silver This was hollow and formed a sort of cage in which several live birds were shut up their tufts and feet being gilt On its tower which was gilt three banners were placed one bearing the arms of the count the two others those of Mesdemoiselles de Chateaubrun and de Villequier in whose honour the feast was given The first course consisted of a civet of hare a quarter of stag which had been a night in salt a stuffed chicken and a loin of veal The two last dishes were covered with a German sauce with gilt sugar plums and pomegranate seeds At each end outside the green lawn was an enormous pie surmounted with smaller pies which formed a crown The crust of the large ones was silvered all round and gilt at the top each contained a whole roe deer a gosling three capons six chickens ten pigeons one young rabbit and no doubt to serve as seasoning or stuffing a minced loin of veal two pounds of fat and twenty six hard boiled eggs covered with saffron and flavoured with cloves For the three following courses there was a roe deer a pig a sturgeon cooked in parsley and vinegar and covered with powdered ginger a kid two goslings twelve chickens as many pigeons six young rabbits two herons a leveret a fat capon stuffed four chickens covered with yolks of eggs and sprinkled with powder de Duc spice a wild boar some wafers darioles and stars a jelly part white and part red representing the crests of the three above mentioned persons cream with Duc powder covered with fennel seeds preserved in sugar a white cream cheese in slices and strawberries and lastly plums stewed in rose water Besides these four courses there was a fifth entirely composed of the prepared wines then in vogue and of preserves These consisted of fruits and various sweet pastries The pastries represented stags and swans to the necks of which were suspended the arms of the Count of Anjou and those of the two young ladies In great houses dinner was announced by the sound of the hunting horn this is what Froissard calls corner l assiette but which was at an earlier period called corner l eau because it was the custom to wash the hands before sitting down to table as well as on leaving the dining room Illustration Fig

Collection of M Achille Jubinal For these ablutions scented water and especially rose water was used brought in ewers of precious and delicately wrought metals by pages or squires who handed them to the ladies in silver basins It was at about this period that is in the times of chivalry that the custom of placing the guests by couples was introduced generally a gentleman and lady each couple having but one cup and one plate hence the expression to eat from the same plate Historians relate that in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries at certain gala feasts the dishes were brought in by servants in full armour mounted on caparisoned horses but this is a custom exclusively attached to chivalry As early as those days powerful and ingenious machines were in use which lowered from the story above or raised from that below ready served tables which were made to disappear after use as if by enchantment At that period the table service of the wealthy required a considerable staff of retainers and varlets and at a later period this number was much increased Thus for instance when Louis of Orleans went on a diplomatic mission to Germany from his brother Charles VI this prince in order that France might be worthily represented abroad raised the number of his household to more than two hundred and fifty persons of whom about one hundred were retainers and table attendants Olivier de la Marche who in his Memoires gives the most minute details of the ceremonial of the court of Charles the Bold Duke of Burgundy tells us that the table service was as extensive as in the other great princely houses This extravagant and ruinous pomp fell into disuse during the reigns of Louis XI Charles VIII and Louis XII but reappeared in that of Francis I This prince after his first wars in Italy imported the cookery and the gastronomic luxury of that country where the art of good living especially in Venice Florence and Rome had reached the highest degree of refinement and magnificence Henry II and Francis II maintained the magnificence of their royal tables but after them notwithstanding the soft effeminacy of the manners at court the continued wars which Henry III and Charles IX had to sustain in their own states against the Protestants and the League necessitated a considerable economy in the households and tables of those kings It was only by fits and starts says Brantome that one was well fed during this reign for very often circumstances prevented the proper preparation of the repasts a thing much disliked by the courtiers who prefer open table to be kept at both court and with the army because it then costs them nothing Henry IV was neither fastidious nor greedy we must therefore come down to the reign of Louis XIII to find a vestige of the splendour of the banquets of Francis I Illustration Fig one hundred thirty Grand Ceremonial Banquet at the Court of France in the Fourteenth Century archaeological Restoration from Miniatures and Narratives of the

which dates its origin from the earliest times but which was particularly esteemed in the Middle Ages and was especially cultivated in the glorious days of chivalry Venery which is the earliest is defined by M Elzear Blaze as the science of snaring taking or killing one particular animal from amongst a herd Hawking came next This was not only the art of hunting with the falcon but that of training birds of prey to hunt feathered game Lastly l oisellerie fowling which according to the author of several well known works on the subject we are discussing had originally no other object than that of protecting the crops and fruits from birds and other animals whose nature it was to feed on them Venery will be first considered Sportsmen always pride themselves in placing Xenophon the general philosopher and historian at the head of sporting writers although his treatise on the chase translated from the Greek into Latin under the title of De Venatione which gives excellent advice respecting the training of dogs only speaks of traps and nets for capturing wild animals Amongst the Greeks Arrian and Oppian and amongst the Romans Gratius Faliscus and Nemesianus wrote on the same subject Their works however except in a few isolated or scattered passages do not contain anything about venery properly so called and the first historical information on the subject is to be found in the records of the seventh century Long after that period however they still hunted as it were at random attacking the first animal they met The sports of Charlemagne for instance were almost always of this description On some occasions they killed animals of all sorts by thousands after having tracked and driven them into an enclosure composed of cloths or nets This illustrious Emperor although usually at war in all parts of Europe never missed an opportunity of hunting so much so that it might be said that he rested himself by galloping through the forests He was on these occasions not only followed by a large number of huntsmen and attendants of his household but he was accompanied by his wife and daughters mounted on magnificent coursers and surrounded by a numerous and elegant court who vied with each other in displaying their skill and courage in attacking the fiercest animals It is even stated that Aix la Chapelle owes its origin to a hunting adventure of Charlemagne The Emperor one day while chasing a stag required to cross a brook which came in his path but immediately his horse had set his foot in the water he pulled it out again and began to limp as if it were hurt His noble rider dismounted and on feeling the foot found it was quite hot This induced him to put his hand into the water which he found to be almost boiling On that very spot therefore he caused a chapel to be erected in the shape of a horse s hoof The town was afterwards built and to this day the spring of hot mineral water is enclosed under a rotunda the shape of which reminds one of the old legend of Charlemagne and his horse The sons of Charlemagne also held hunting in much esteem and by degrees the art of venery was introduced and carried to great perfection It was not however until the end of the thirteenth century that an anonymous author conceived the idea of writing its principal precepts in an instructive poem called Le Dict de la Chace du Cerf In thirteen twenty eight another anonymous writer composed the Livre du Roy Modus which contains the rules for hunting all furred animals from the stag to the hare Then followed other poets and writers of French prose such as Gace de la Vigne thirteen fifty nine Gaston Phoebus thirteen eighty seven and Hardouin lord of Fontaine Guerin thirteen ninety four None of these however wrote exclusively on venery but described the different sports known in their day Towards thirteen forty Alphonse XI king of Castile caused a book on hunting to be compiled for his use but it was not so popular as the instruction of Gaston Phoebus Fig one hundred thirty two If hunting with hounds is known everywhere by the French name of the chase it is because the honour of having organized it into a system if not of having originated it is due to the early French sporting authors who were able to form a code of rules for it This also accounts for so many of the technical terms now in use in venery being of French origin as they are no others than those adopted by these ancient authors whose works so to speak have perpetuated them Illustration Fig one hundred thirty two Gaston Phoebus teaching the Art of Venery Fac simile of

approach Beasts Fac simile of a Miniature in the Manuscript of Phoebus Fifteenth Century The curious miniatures which accompany the text in the original manuscript of Gaston Phoebus and which have been reproduced in nearly all the ancient copies of this celebrated manuscript give most distinct and graphic ideas of the various modes of hunting We find for instance that the use of an artificial cow for approaching wild fowl was understood at that time the only difference being that a model was used more like a horse than a cow Fig one hundred thirty three we also see sportsmen shooting at bears wild boars stags and such live animals with arrows having sharp iron points intended to enter deep into the flesh notwithstanding the thickness of the fur and the creature s hard skin In the case of the hare however the missile had a heavy massive end probably made of lead which stunned him without piercing his body Fig one hundred thirty four In other cases the sportsman is represented with a crossbow seated in a cart all covered up with boughs by which plan he was supposed to approach the prey without alarming it any more than a swinging branch would do Fig one hundred thirty five Gaston Phoebus is known to have been one of the bravest knights of his time and after fighting he considered hunting as his greatest delight Somewhat ingenuously he writes of himself as a hunter that he doubts having any superior Like all his contemporaries he is eloquent as to the moral effect of his favourite pastime By hunting he says one avoids the sin of indolence and according to our faith he who avoids the seven mortal sins will be saved therefore the good sportsman will be saved Illustration Fig one hundred thirty four How to allure the Hare Fac simile of a Miniature in the Manuscript of Phoebus Fifteenth Century From the earliest ages sportsmen placed themselves under the protection of some special deity Among the Greeks and Romans it was Diana and Phoebe The Gauls who had adopted the greater number of the gods and goddesses of Rome invoked the moon when they sallied forth to war or to the chase but as soon as they penetrated the sacred obscurity of the forests they appealed more particularly to the goddess Ardhuina whose name of unknown origin has probably since been applied to the immense well stocked forests of Ardenne or Ardennes They erected in the depths of the woods monstrous stone figures in honour of this goddess such as the heads of stags on the bodies of men or women and to propitiate her during the chase they hung round these idols the feet the skins and the horns of the beasts they killed Cernunnos who was always represented with a human head surmounted by stags horns had an altar even in Lutetia which was no doubt in consequence of the great woods which skirted the banks of the Seine Illustration Fig one hundred thirty five How to take a Cart to allure Beasts Fac simile of a Miniature in the Manuscript of Phoebus Fifteenth Century The Gallic Cernunnos which we also find among the Romans since Ovid mentions the votary stags horns continued to be worshipped to a certain extent after the establishment of the Christian religion In the fifth century Germain an intrepid hunter who afterwards became Bishop of Auxerre possessed not far from his residence an oak of enormous diameter a thorough Cernunnos which he hung with the skins and other portions of animals he had killed in the chase In some countries where the Cernunnos remained an object of veneration everybody bedecked it in the same way The largest oak to be found in the district was chosen on which to suspend the trophies both of warriors and of hunters and at a more recent period sportsmen used to hang outside their doors stags heads boars feet birds of prey and other trophies a custom which evidently was a relic of the one referred to On pagan idolatry being abandoned hunters used to have a presiding genius or protector whom they selected from amongst the saints most in renown Some chose saint Germain d Auxerre who had himself been a sportsman others saint Martin who had been a soldier before he became Bishop of Tours Eventually they all agreed to place themselves under the patronage of saint Hubert Bishop of Liege a renowned hunter of the eighth century This saint devoted himself to a religious life after one day haying encountered a miraculous stag whilst hunting in the woods which appeared to him as bearing between his horns a luminous image of our Saviour At first the feast of saint Hubert was celebrated four times a year namely at the anniversaries of his conversion and death and on the two occasions on which his relics were exhibited At the celebration of each of these feasts a large number of sportsmen in fine apparel came from great distances with their horses and dogs There was in fact no magnificence or pomp deemed too imposing to be displayed both by the kings and nobles in honour of the patron saint of

German Sportsman drawn and engraved by J Amman in the Sixteenth Century Hunters and sportsmen in those days formed brotherhoods which had their rank defined at public ceremonials and especially in processions In fourteen fifty five Gerard Duke of Cleves and Burgrave of Ravensberg created the order of the Knights of saint Hubert into which those of noble blood only were admitted The insignia consisted of a gold or silver chain formed of hunting horns to which was hung a small likeness of the patron saint in the act of doing homage to our Saviour s image as it shone on the head of a stag It was popularly believed that the Knights of saint Hubert had the power of curing madness which for some unknown reason never showed itself in a pack of hounds This however was not the only superstitious belief attached to the noble and adventurous occupations of the followers of saint Hubert Amongst a number of old legends which mostly belong to Germany Fig one hundred thirty seven mention is made of hunters who sold their souls to the devil in exchange for some enchanted arrow which never missed its aim and which reached game at extraordinary distances Mention is also made in these legends of various animals which on being pursued by the hunters were miraculously saved by throwing themselves into the arms of some saint or by running into some holy sanctuary There were besides knights who having hunted all their lives believed that they were to continue the same occupation in another world An account is given in history of the apparition of a fiery phantom to Charles IX in the forest of Lyons and also the ominous meeting of Henry IV with the terrible grand veneur in the forest of Fontainebleau We may account for these strange tales from the fact that hunting formerly constituted a sort of freemasonry with its mysterious rites and its secret language The initiated used particular signs of recognition amongst themselves and they also had lucky and unlucky numbers emblematical colours c The more dangerous the sport the more it was indulged in by military men The Chronicles of the Monk of Saint Gall describe an adventure which befell Charlemagne on the occasion of his setting out with his huntsmen and hounds in order to chase an enormous bear which was the terror of the Vosges The bear after having disabled numerous dogs and hunters found himself face to face with the Emperor who alone dared to stand up before him A fierce combat ensued on the summit of a rock in which both were locked together in a fatal embrace The contest ended by the death of the bear Charles striking him with his dagger and hurling him down the precipice On this the hills resounded with the cry of Vive Charles le Grand from the numerous huntsmen and others who had assembled and it is said that this was the first occasion on which the companions of the intrepid monarch gave him the title of Grand Magnus so from that time King Charles became King Charlemagne This prince was most jealous of his rights of hunting which he would waive to no one For a long time he refused permission to the monks of the Abbey of saint Denis whom he nevertheless held in great esteem to have some stags killed which were destroying their forests It was only on condition that the flesh of these animals would serve as food to the monks of inferior order and that their hides should be used for binding the missals that he eventually granted them permission to kill the offending animals Fig one hundred thirty eight If we pass from the ninth to the thirteenth century we find that Louis IX king of France was as keen a sportsman and as brave a warrior as any of his ancestors He was indeed as fond of hunting as of war and during his first crusade an opportunity occurred to him of hunting the lion As soon as he began to know the country of Cesarea says Joinville the King set to work with his people to hunt lions so that they captured many but in doing so they incurred great bodily danger The mode of taking them was this They pursued them on the swiftest horses When they came near one they shot a bolt or arrow at him and the animal feeling himself wounded ran at the first person he could see who immediately turned his horse s head and fled as fast as he could During his flight he dropped a portion of his clothing which the lion caught up and tore thinking it was the person who had injured him and whilst the lion was thus engaged the hunters again approached the infuriated animal and shot more bolts and arrows at him Soon the lion left the cloth and madly rushed at some other hunter who adopted the same strategy as before This was repeated until the animal succumbed becoming exhausted by the wounds he had received Illustration Fig one hundred thirty eight Nature and Appearance of Deer and how they can be hunted with Dogs Fac simile of a Miniature in the Livre du Roy Modus Manuscript of the Fourteenth Century National Library of Paris Notwithstanding the passion which this king had for hunting he was the first to grant leave to the bourgeoisie to enjoy the sport The condition he made with them was that they should always give a haunch of any animal killed to the lord of the soil It is to this that we must trace the origin of giving the animal s foot to the huntsman or to the person who has the lead of the hunting party Louis XI however did not at all act in this liberal manner and although it might have been supposed that the incessant wars and political intrigues in which he was constantly engaged would have given him no time for amusements of this kind yet he was nevertheless the keenest sportsman of his day This tyrant of the Castle of Plessis les Tours who was always miserly except in matters of hunting in which he was most lavish forbade even the higher classes to hunt under penalty of hanging To ensure the execution of his severe orders he had all the castles as well as the cottages searched and any net engine or sporting arm found was immediately destroyed His only son the heir to the throne was not exempted from these laws Shut up in the Castle of Amboise he had no permission to leave it for it was the will of the King that the young prince should remain ignorant of the noble exercises of chivalry One day the Dauphin prayed his governor M du Bouchage with so much earnestness to give him an idea of hunting that this noble consented to make an excursion into the neighbouring wood with him The King however managed to find it out and Du Bouchage had great difficulty in keeping his head on his shoulders One of the best ways of pleasing Louis XI was to offer him some present relating to his favourite pastime either pointers hounds falcons or varlets who were adepts in the art of venery or hawking Figs one hundred thirty nine and one hundred forty When the cunning monarch became old and infirm in order to make his enemies believe that he was still young and vigorous he sent messengers everywhere even to the most remote countries to purchase horses dogs and falcons for which according to Comines he paid large sums Fig one hundred forty one On his death the young prince Charles VIII succeeded him and he seems to have had an innate taste for hunting and soon made up for lost time and the privation to which his father had subjected him He hunted daily and generously allowed the nobles to do the same It is scarcely necessary to say that these were not slow in indulging in the privilege thus restored to them and which was one of their most ancient pastimes and occupations for it must be remembered that in those days of small intellectual culture hunting must have been a great if not at times the only resource against idleness and the monotony of country life Everything which related to sport again became the fashion amongst the youth of the nobility and their chief occupation when not engaged in war They continued as formerly to invent every sort of sporting device For example they obtained from other countries traps engines and hunting weapons they introduced into France at great expense foreign animals which they took great pains in naturalising as game or in training as auxiliaries in hunting After having imported the reindeer from Lapland which did not succeed in their temperate climate and the pheasant from Tartary with which they stocked the woods they imported with greater success the panther and the leopard from Africa which were used for furred game as the hawk was for feathered game The mode of hunting with these animals was as follows The sportsmen preceded by their dogs rode across country each with a leopard sitting behind him on his saddle When the dogs had started the game the leopard jumped off the saddle and sprang after it and as soon as it was caught the hunters threw the leopard a piece of raw flesh for which he gave up the prey and remounted behind his master Fig one hundred forty two Louis XI Charles VIII and Louis XII often hunted thus The leopards which formed a part of the royal venery were kept in an enclosure of the Castle of Amboise which still exists near the gate des Lions so called no doubt on account of these sporting and carnivorous animals being mistaken for lions by the common people There were however always lions in the menageries of the kings of France Illustration Fig one hundred thirty nine The Way to catch Squirrels on the Ground in the Woods Fac simile of a Miniature in the Manuscript of the Livre du Roy Modus Fourteenth Century Francis I was quite as fond of hunting as any of his predecessors His innate taste for sport was increased during his travels in Italy where he lived with princes who displayed great splendour in their hunting equipages He even acquired the name of the Father of Sportsmen His netting establishment alone consisted of one captain one lieutenant twelve mounted huntsmen six varlets to attend the bloodhounds six whips who had under their charge sixty hounds and one hundred bowmen on foot carrying large stakes for fixing the nets and tents which were carried by fifty six horsed chariots He was much pleased when ladies followed the chase and amongst those who were most inclined to share its pleasures its toils and even its perils was Catherine de Medicis then Dauphine who was distinguished for her agility and her graceful appearance on horseback and who became a thorough sportswoman Illustration Fig one hundred forty The Way of catching Partridges with an Osier Net Work Apparatus Fac simile of a Miniature in Livre du Roy Modus The taste for hunting having become very general and the art being considered as the most noble occupation to which persons could devote themselves it is not surprising to find sporting works composed by writers of the greatest renown and of the highest rank The learned William Bude whom Erasmus called the wonder of France dedicated to the children of Francis I the second book of his Philologie which contains a treatise on stag hunting This treatise originally written in Latin was afterwards translated into French by order of Charles IX who was acknowledged to be one of the boldest and most scientific hunters of his time An extraordinary feat which has never been imitated by any one is recorded of him and that was that alone on horseback and without dogs he hunted down a stag The Chasse Royale the authorship of which is attributed to him is replete with scientific information Wolf hunting a work by the celebrated Clamorgan and Yenery by Du Fouilloux were dedicated to Charles IX and a great number of special treatises on such subjects appeared in his reign Illustration Fig one hundred forty one Kennel in which Dogs should live and how they should be kept Fac simile of a Miniature in Manuscript of Phoebus Fifteenth Century His brother the effeminate Henry III disliked hunting as he considered it too fatiguing and too dangerous On the other hand according to Sully Henry IV le Bearnais who learned hunting in early youth in the Pyrenees loved all kinds of sport and above all the most fatiguing and adventurous pursuits such as those after wolves bears and boars He never missed a chance of hunting even when in face of an enemy If he knew a stag to be near he found time to hunt it and we find in the Memoirs of Sully that the King hunted the day after the famous battle of Ivry One day when he was only King of Navarre he invited the ladies of Pau to come and see a bear hunt Happily they refused for on that occasion their nerves would have been put to a serious test Two bears killed two of the horses and several bowmen were hugged to death by the ferocious animals Another bear although pierced in several places and having six or seven pike heads in his body charged eight men who were stationed on the top of a rock and the whole of them with the bear were all dashed to pieces down the precipice The only point in which Louis XIII resembled his father was his love of the chase for during his reign hunting continued in France as well as in other countries to be a favourite royal pastime We have remarked that saint Germain d Auxerre who at a certain period was the patron of sportsmen made hunting his habitual relaxation He devoted himself to it with great keenness in his youth before he became bishop that is when he was Duke of Auxerre and general of the troops of the provinces Subsequently when against his will he was raised to the episcopal dignity not only did he give up all pleasures but he devoted himself to the strictest religious life Unfortunately in those days all church men did not understand as he did that the duties of their holy vocation were not consistent with these pastimes for in the year five hundred seven we find that councils and synods forbade priests to hunt In spite of this however the ancient historians relate that several noble prelates yielding to the customs of the times indulged in hunting the stag and flying the falcon Illustration Fig one hundred forty two Hunting with the Leopard from a Stamp of Jean Stradan Sixteenth Century It is related in history that some of the most illustrious popes were also great lovers of the chase namely Julius II Leo X and previously to them Pius II who before becoming Pope amongst other literary and scientific works wrote a Latin treatise on venery under his Christian names AEneas Silvius It is easy to understand how it happened that sports formerly possessed such attractions for ecclesiastical dignitaries In early life they acquired the tastes and habits of people of their rank and they were accordingly extremely jealous of the rights of chase in their domains Although Pope Clement V in his celebrated Institutions called Clementines had formally forbidden the monks to hunt there were few who did not evade the canonical prohibition by pursuing furred game and that without considering that they were violating the laws of the Church The papal edict permitted the monks and priests to hunt under certain circumstances and especially where rabbits or beasts of prey increased so much as to damage the crops It can easily be imagined that such would always be the case at a period when the people were so strictly forbidden to destroy game and therefore hunting was practised at all seasons in the woods and fields in the vicinity of each abbey The jealous peasants not themselves having the right of hunting and who continually saw Master Abbot passing on his hunting excursions said with malice that the monks never forgot to pray for the success of the litters and nests pro pullis et nidis in order that game might always be abundant Illustration Fig one hundred forty three How Wolves may be caught with a Snare Fac simile of a Miniature in the Manuscript of Phoebus Fifteenth Century If venery as a regular science dates from a comparatively recent period it is not so with falconry the first traces of which are lost in obscure antiquity This kind of sport which had become a most learned and complicated art was the delight of the nobles of the Middle Ages and during the Renaissance period It was in such esteem that a nobleman or his lady never appeared in public without a hawk on the wrist as a mark of dignity Fig one hundred forty seven Even bishops and abbots entered the churches with their hunting birds which they placed on the steps of the altar itself during the service Illustration Fig one hundred forty four How Bears and other Beasts may be caught with a Dart Fac simile of a Miniature in the Manuscript of Phoebus Fifteenth Century The bird like the sword was a distinctive mark which was inseparable from the person of gentle birth who frequently even went to war with the falcon on his wrist During the battle he would make his squire hold the bird which he replaced on his gauntlet when the fight was over In fact it was forbidden by the laws of chivalry for persons to give up their birds even as a ransom should they be made prisoners in which case they had to let the noble birds fly in order that they might not share their captivity The falcon to a certain degree partook of his owner s nobility he was moreover considered a noble bird by the laws of falconry as were all birds of prey which could be trained for purposes of sport All other birds without distinction were declared ignoble and no exception was made to this rule by the naturalists of the Middle Ages even in favour of the strongest and most magnificent such as the eagle and vulture According to this capricious classification they considered the sparrow hawk which was the smallest of the hunting birds to rank higher than the eagle The nickname of this diminutive sporting bird was often applied to a country gentleman who not being able to afford to keep falcons used the sparrow hawk to capture partridges and quail Illustration Fig one hundred forty five Olifant or Hunting horn in Ivory Fourteenth Century From an Original existing in England It was customary for gentlemen of all classes whether sportsmen or not to possess birds of some kind to keep up their rank as the saying then was Only the richest nobles however were expected to keep a regular falconry that is a collection of birds suited for taking all kinds of game such as the hare the kite the heron c

long and difficult education which had to be given them To succeed in making the falcon obey the whistle the voice and the signs of the falconer was the highest aim of the art and it was only by the exercise of much patience that the desired resuit was obtained All birds of prey when used for sport received the generic name of falcon and amongst them were to be found the gerfalcon the saker hawk the lanner the merlin and the sparrow hawk The male birds were smaller than the females and were called tiercelet this name however more particularly applied to the gosshawk or the largest kind of male hawk whereas the males of the above mentioned were called laneret sacret emouchet Generally the male birds were used for partridges and quail and the female birds for the hare the heron and crane Oiseaux de poing or hand birds was the name given to the gosshawk common hawk the gerfalcon and the merlin because they returned to the hand of their master after having pursued game The lanner sparrow hawk and saker hawk were called oiseaux de leure from the fact that it was always necessary to entice them back again Illustration Fig one hundred forty seven A Noble of Provence Fifteenth Century Bonnart s Costumes from the Tenth to the Sixteenth Century The lure was an imitation of a bird made of red cloth that it might be more easily seen from a distance It was stuffed so that the falcon could settle easily on it and furnished with the wings of a partridge duck or heron according to circumstances The falconer swung his mock bird like a sling and whistled as he did so and the falcon accustomed to find a piece of flesh attached to the lure flew down in order to obtain it and was thus secured Illustration Fig one hundred forty eight King Modus teaching the Art of Falconry Fac simile of a Miniature in the Manuscript of Livre du Roy Modus Fourteenth Century The trainers of birds divided them into two kinds namely the niais or simple bird which had been taken from the nest and the wild bird hagard captured when full grown The education of the former was naturally very much the easier but they succeeded in taming both classes and even the most rebellious were at last subdued by depriving them of sleep by keeping away the light from them by coaxing them with the voice by patting them by giving them choice food c Regardless of his original habits the bird was first accustomed to have no fear of men horses and dogs He was afterwards fastened to a string by one leg and being allowed to fly a short distance was recalled to the lure where he always found a dainty bit of food After he had been thus exercised for several months a wounded partridge was let loose that he might catch it near the falconer who immediately took it from him before he could tear it to pieces When he appeared sufficiently tame a quail or partridge previously stripped of a few feathers so as to prevent it flying properly was put in his way as before If he was wanted for hunting hares a stuffed hare was dragged before him inside of which was a live chicken whose head and liver was his reward if he did his work well Then they tried him with a hare whose fore leg was broken in order to ensure his being quickly caught For the kite they placed two hawks together on the same perch so as to accustom them peaceably to live and hunt together for if they fought with one another as strange birds were apt to do instead of attacking the kite the sport would of course have failed At first a hen of the colour of a kite was given them to fight with When they had mastered this a real kite was used which was tied to a string and his claws and beak were filed so as to prevent him from wounding the young untrained falcons The moment they had secured their prey they were called off it and given chickens flesh to eat on the lure The same System was adopted for hunting the heron or crane Fig one hundred fifty nine Illustration Fig one hundred forty nine Falconers dressing their Birds Fac simile of a Miniature in the Manuscript of Livre du Roy Modus Fourteenth Century It will be seen that in order to train birds it was necessary for a large number of the various kinds of game to be kept on the premises and for each branch of sport a regular establishment was required In falconry as in venery great care was taken to secure that a bird should continue at one object of prey until he had secured it that is to say it was most essential to teach it not to leave the game he was after in order to pursue another which might come in his way To establish a falconry therefore not only was a very large poultry yard required but also a considerable staff of huntsmen falconers and whips besides a number of horses and dogs of all sorts which were either used for starting the game for the hawks or for running it down when it was forced to ground by the birds Illustration Fig one hundred fifty Varlets of Falconry Fac simile of a Miniature in the Manuscript of Livre du Roy Modus Fourteenth Century A well trained falcon was a bird of great value and was the finest present that could be made to a lady to a nobleman or to the King himself by any one who had received a favour For instance the King of France received six birds from the Abbot of saint Hubert as a token of gratitude for the protection granted by him to the abbey The King of Denmark sent him several as a gracious offering in the month of April the Grand Master of Malta in the month of May At court in those days the reception of falcons either in public or in private was a great business and the first trial of any new birds formed a topic of conversation among the courtiers for some time after The arrival at court of a hawk dealer from some distant country was also a great event It is said that Louis XI gave orders that watch should be kept night and day to seize any falcons consigned to the Duke of Brittany from Turkey The plan succeeded and the birds thus stolen were brought to the King who exclaimed By our holy Lady of Clery what will the Duke Francis and his Bretons do They will be very angry at the good trick I have played them European princes vied with each other in extravagance as regards falconry but this was nothing in comparison to the magnificence displayed in oriental establishments The Count de Nevers son of Philip the Bold Duke of Burgundy having been made prisoner at the battle of Nicopolis was presented to the Sultan Bajazet who showed him his hunting establishment consisting of seven thousand falconers and as many huntsmen The Duke of Burgundy on hearing this sent twelve white hawks which were very scarce birds as a present to Bajazet The Sultan was so pleased with them that he sent him back his son in exchange Illustration Fig one hundred fifty one How to train a New Falcon Fac simile of a Miniature in the Manuscript of Livre du Roy Modus Fourteenth Century The Livre du Roy Modus gives the most minute and curious details on the noble science of hawking For instance it tells us that the nobility of the falcon was held in such respect that their utensils trappings or feeding dishes were never used for other birds The glove on which they were accustomed to alight was frequently elaborately embroidered in gold and was never used except for birds of their own species In the private establishments the leather hoods which were put on their heads to prevent them seeing were embroidered with gold and pearls and surmounted with the feathers of birds of paradise Each bird wore on his legs two little bells with his owner s crest upon them the noise made by these was very distinct and could be heard even when the bird was too high in the air to be seen for they were not made to sound in unison they generally came from Italy Milan especially being celebrated for their manufacture Straps were also fastened to the falcon s legs by means of which he was attached to the perch at the end of this strap was a brass or gold ring with the owner s name engraved upon it In the royal establishments each ring bore on one side I belong to the king and on the other the name of the Grand Falconer This was a necessary precaution for the birds frequently strayed and if captured they could thus be recognised and returned The ownership of a falcon was considered sacred and by an ancient barbaric law the stealer of a falcon was condemned to a very curious punishment The unfortunate thief was obliged to allow the falcon to eat six ounces of the flesh of his breast unless he could pay a heavy fine to the owner and another to the king Illustration Fig one hundred fifty two Falconers Fac simile from a Miniature in Manuscript of the Thirteenth Century which treats of the Cour de Jaime Roi de Maiorque A man thoroughly acquainted with the mode of training hawks was in high esteem everywhere If he was a freeman the nobles outbid each other as to who should secure his services if he was a serf his master kept him as a rare treasure

natural history the veterinary art and the chase but the profession generally ran in families and the son added his own experience to the lessons of his father There were also special schools of venery and falconry the most renowned being of course in the royal household The office of Grand Falconer of France the origin of which dates from twelve fifty was one of the highest in the kingdom The Marechal de Fleuranges says in his curious Memoirs The Grand Falconer whose salary is four thousand florins the golden florin was worth then twelve or fifteen francs and this amount must represent upwards of eighty thousand francs of present currency has fifty gentlemen under him the salary of each being from five to six thousand livres He has also fifty assistant falconers at two hundred livres each all chosen by himself His establishment consists of three hundred birds he has the right to hunt wherever he pleases in the kingdom he levies a tax on all bird dealers who are forbidden under penalty of the confiscation of their stock from selling a single bird in any town or at court without his sanction The Grand Falconer was chief at all the hunts or hawking meetings in public ceremonies he always appeared with the bird on his wrist as an emblem of his rank and the King whilst hawking could not let loose his bird until after the Grand Falconer had slipped his Illustration Fig one hundred fifty three How to bathe a New Falcon Fac simile of a Miniature in the Manuscript of Livre du Roy Modus Fourteenth Century Falconry like venery had a distinctive and professional vocabulary which it was necessary for every one who joined in hawking to understand unless he wished to be looked upon as an ignorant yeoman Flying the hawk is a royal pastime says the Jesuit Claude Binet and it is to talk royally to talk of the flight of birds Every one speaks of it but few speak well Many speak so ignorantly as to excite pity among their hearers Sometimes one says the hand of the bird instead of saying the talon sometimes the talon instead of the claw sometimes the claw instead of the nail c The fourteenth century was the great epoch of falconry There were then so many nobles who hawked that in the rooms of inns there were perches made under the large mantel pieces on which to place the birds while the sportsmen were at dinner Histories of the period are full of characteristic anecdotes which prove the enthusiasm which was created by hawking in those who devoted themselves to it Illustration Fig one hundred fifty four How to make Young Hawks fly Fac simile of a Miniature in the Manuscript of Livre du Roy Modus Fourteenth Century Emperors and kings were as keen as others for this kind of sport As early as the tenth century the Emperor Henry I had acquired the soubriquet of the Bird catcher from the fact of his giving much more attention to his birds than to his subjects His example was followed by one of his successors the Emperor Henry VI who was reckoned the first falconer of his time When his father the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa Red beard died in the Holy Land in eleven eighty nine the Archdukes Electors of the Empire went out to meet the prince so as to proclaim him Emperor of Germany They found him surrounded by dogs horses and birds ready to go hunting The day is fine he said allow us to put off serious affairs until to morrow Two centuries later we find at the court of France the same ardour for hawking and the same admiration for the performances of falcons The Constable Bertrand du Guesclin gave two hawks to King Charles VI and the Count de Tancarville whilst witnessing a combat between these noble birds and a crane which had been powerful enough to keep two greyhounds at bay exclaimed I would not give up the pleasure which I feel for a thousand florins The court poet William Cretin although he was Canon of the holy chapel of Vincennes was as passionately fond of hawking as his good master Louis XII He thus describes the pleasure he felt in seeing a heron succumb to the vigorous attack of the falcons Qui auroit la mort aux dents Il revivroit d avour un tel passe temps He who is about to die Would live again with such amusement Illustration Fig one hundred fifty five Lady setting out Hawking Fac simile of a Miniature in the Manuscript of Livre du Roy Modus Fourteenth Century At a hunting party given by Louis XII to the Archduke Maximilian Mary of Burgundy the Archduke s wife was killed by a fall from her horse The King presented his best falcons to the Archduke with a view to divert his mind and to turn his attention from the sad event and one of the historians tells us that the bereaved husband was soon consoled The partridges herons wild ducks and quails which he was enabled to take on his journey home by means of the King s present materially lessening his sorrow Falconry after having been in much esteem for centuries at last became amenable to the same law which affects all great institutions and having reached the height of its glory it was destined to decay Although the art disappeared completely under Louis the Great who only liked stag kunting and who by drawing all the nobility to court disorganized country life no greater adept had ever been known than King Louis XIII His first favourite and Grand Falconer was Albert de Luynes whom he made prime minister and constable Even in the Tuileries gardens on his way to mass at the convent of the Feuillants this prince amused himself by catching linnets and wrens with noisy magpies trained to pursue small birds It was during this reign that some ingenious person discovered that the words LOUIS TREIZIEME ROY DE FRANCE ET DE NAVARRE exactly gave this anagram ROY TRES RARE ESTIME DIEU DE LA FAUCONNERIE It was also at this time that Charles d Arcussia the last author who wrote a technical work on falconry after praising his majesty for devoting himself so thoroughly to the divine sport compared the King s birds to domestic angels and the carnivorous birds which they destroyed he likened to the devil From this he argued that the sport was like the angel Gabriel destroying the demon Asmodeus He also added in his dedication to the King As the nature of angels is above that of men so is that of these birds above all other animals Illustration Fig one hundred fifty six Dress of the Falconer Thirteenth Century Sculpture of the Cathedral of Rouen At that time certain religious or rather superstitious ceremonies were in use for blessing the water with which the falcons were sprinkled before hunting and supplications were addressed to the eagles that they might not molest them The following words were used I adjure you O eagles by the true God by the holy God by the most blessed Virgin Mary by the nine orders of angels by the holy prophets by the twelve apostles c to leave the field clear to our birds and not to molest them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost It was at this time that in order to recover a lost bird the Sire de la Brizardiere a professional necromancer proposed beating the owner of the bird with birch rods until he bled and of making a charm with the blood which was reckoned infallible Illustration Fig one hundred fifty seven Diseases of Dogs and their Cure Fac simile of a Miniature in the Manuscript of Phoebus Fourteenth Century Elzear Blaze expressed his astonishment that the ladies should not have used their influence to prevent falconry from falling into disuse The chase he considered gave them an active part in an interesting and animated scene which only required easy and graceful movements on their part and to which no danger was attached The ladies knowing he says how to fly a bird how to call him back and how to encourage him with their voice being familiar with him from having continually carried him on their wrist and often even from having broken him in themselves the honour of hunting belongs to them by right Besides it brings out to advantage their grace and dexterity as they gallop amongst the sportsmen followed by their pages and varlets and a whole herd of horses and dogs The question of precedence and of superiority had at every period been pretty evenly balanced between venery and falconry each having its own staunch supporters Thus in the Livre du Roy Modus two ladies contend in verse for the subject was considered too exalted to be treated of in simple prose the one for the superiority of the birds the other for the superiority of dogs Their controversy is at length terminated by a celebrated huntsman and falconer who decides in favour of venery for the somewhat remarkable reason that those who pursue it enjoy oral and ocular pleasure at the same time In an ancient Treatise by Gace de la Vigne in which the same question occupies no fewer than ten thousand verses the King unnamed ends the dispute by ordering that in future they shall be termed pleasures of dogs and pleasures of birds so that there may be no superiority on one side or the other Fig one hundred sixty The court poet William Cretin who was in great renown during the reigns of Louis XII and Francis I having asked two ladies to discuss the same subject in verse does not hesitate on the contrary to place falconry above venery Illustration Fig one hundred fifty eight German Falconer designed and engraved in the Sixteenth Century by J Amman It may fairly be asserted that venery and falconry have taken a position of some importance in history and in support of this theory it will suffice to mention a few facts borrowed from the annals of the chase The King of Navarre Charles the Bad had sworn to be faithful to the alliance made between himself and King Edward III of England but the English troops having been beaten by Du Guesclin Charles saw that it was to his advantage to turn to the side of the King of France In order not to appear to break his oath he managed to be taken prisoner by the French whilst out hunting and thus he sacrificed his honour to his personal interests It was also due to a hunting party that Henry III another King of Navarre who was afterwards Henry IV escaped from Paris on the third February fifteen seventy six and fled to Senlis where his friends of the Reformed religion came to join him Illustration Fig one hundred fifty nine Heron hawking Fac simile of a Miniature in the Manuscript of the Livre du Roy Modus Fourteenth Century Hunting formed a principal entertainment when public festivals were celebrated and it was frequently accompanied with great magnificence At the entry of Isabel of Bavaria into Paris a sort of stag hunt was performed when the streets according to a popular story of the time were full to profusion of hares rabbits and goslings Again at the solemn entry of Louis XI into Paris a representation of a doe hunt took place near the fountain saint Innocent after which the queen received a present of a magnificent stag made of confectionery and having the royal arms hung round its neck At the memorable festival given at Lille in fourteen fifty three by the Duke of Burgundy a very curious performance took place At one end of the table says the historian Mathieu de Coucy a heron was started which was hunted as if by falconers and sportsmen and presently from the other end of the table a falcon was slipped which hovered over the heron In a few minutes another falcon was started from the other side of the table which attacked the heron so fiercely that he brought him down in the middle of the

Middle Ages The anonymous author of the Livre du Roy Modus called it in the fourteenth century the pastime of the poor because the poor who can neither keep hounds nor falcons to hunt or to fly take much pleasure in it particularly as it serves at the same time as a means of subsistence to many of them In this book which was for a long time the authority in matters of sport generally we find that nearly all the methods and contrivances now employed for bird fowling were known and in use in the Middle Ages in addition to some which have since fallen into disuse We accordingly read in the Roy Modus a description of the drag net the mirror the screech owl the bird pipe Fig one hundred sixty one the traps the springs c the use of all of which is now well understood At that time when falcons were so much required it was necessary that people should be employed to catch them when young and the author of this book speaks of nets of various sorts and the pronged piece of wood in the middle of which a screech owl or some other bird was placed in order to attract the falcons Fig one hundred sixty two Illustration Fig one hundred sixty one Bird piping The Manner of Catching Birds by piping Fac simile of Miniature in the Manuscript of the Livre du Roy Modus Fourteenth Century Two methods were in use in those days for catching the woodcook and pheasant which deserve to be mentioned The pheasants says King Modus are of such a nature that the male bird cannot bear the company of another Taking advantage of this weakness the plan of placing a mirror which balanced a sort of wicker cage or coop was adopted The pheasant thinking he saw his fellow attacked him struck against the glass and brought down the coop in which he had leisure to reflect on his jealousy Fig one hundred sixty three Woodcocks which are says the author the most silly birds were caught in this way The bird fowler was covered from head to foot with clothes of the colour of dead leaves only having two little holes for his eyes When he saw one he knelt down noiselessly and supported his arms on two sticks so as to keep perfectly still When the bird was not looking towards him he cautiously approached it on his knees holding in his hands two little dry sticks covered with red cloth which he gently waved so as to divert the bird s attention from himself In this way he gradually got near enough to pass a noose which he kept ready at the end of a stick round the bird s neck Fig one hundred sixty four However ingenious these tricks may appear they are eclipsed by one we find recorded in the Ixeuticon a very elegant Latin poem by Angelis de Barga written two centuries later In order to catch a large number of starlings this author assures us it is only necessary to have two or three in a cage and when a flight of these birds is seen passing to liberate them with a very long twine attached to their claws The twine must be covered with bird lime and as the released birds instantly join their friends all those they come near get glued to the twine and fall together to the ground Illustration Fig one hundred sixty two Bird catching with a Machine like a Long Arm Fac simile of Miniature in the Manuscript of the Livre du Roy Modus Fourteenth Century As at the present time the object of bird fowling was twofold namely to procure game for food and to capture birds to be kept either for their voice or for fancy as pets The trade in the latter was so important at least in Paris that the bird catchers formed a numerous corporation having its statutes and privileges The Pont au Change then covered on each side with houses and shops occupied by goldsmiths and money changers was the place where these people carried on their trade and they had the privilege of hanging their cages against the houses even without the sanction of the proprietors This curious right was granted to them by Charles VI in fourteen oh two in return for which they were bound to provide four hundred birds whenever a king was crowned and an equal number when the queen made her first entry into her good town of Paris The goldsmiths and money changers however finding that this became a nuisance and that it injured their trade tried to get it abolished They applied to the authorities to protect their rights urging that the approaches to their shops the rents of which they paid regularly were continually obstructed by a crowd of purchasers and dealers in birds The case was brought several times before parliament which only confirmed the orders of the kings of France and the ancient privileges of the bird catchers At the end of the sixteenth century the quarrel became so bitter that the goldsmiths and changers took to throwing down the cages and birds and trampling them under foot and even assaulted and openly ill treated the poor bird dealers But a degree of parliament again justified the sale of birds on the Pont an Change by condemning the ring leader Illustration Fig

who had commenced the proceedings against the bird catchers to pay a double fine namely twenty crowns to the plaintiffs and ten to the King Illustration Fig one hundred sixty four The Mode of catching a Woodcock Fac simile of a Miniature in the Manuscript of the Livre du Roy Modus Fourteenth Century It is satisfactory to observe that at that period measures were taken to preserve nests and to prevent bird fowling from the fifteenth of March to the fifteenth of August Besides this it was necessary to have an express permission from the King himself to give persons the right of catching birds on the King s domains Before any one could sell birds it was required for him to have been received as a master bird catcher The recognised bird catchers therefore had no opponents except dealers from other countries who brought canary birds parrots and other foreign specimens into Paris These dealers were however obliged to conform to strict rules They were required on their arrival to exhibit their birds from ten to twelve o clock on the marble stone in the palace yard on the days when parliament sat in order that the masters and governors of the King s aviary and after them the presidents and councillors might have the first choice before other people of anything they wished to buy They were besides bound to part the male and female birds in separate cages with tickets on them so that purchasers might not be deceived and in case of dispute on this point some sworn inspectors were appointed as arbitrators No doubt emboldened by the victory which they had achieved over the goldsmiths of the Pont an Change the bird dealers of Paris attempted to forbid any bourgeois of the town from breeding canaries or any sort of cage birds The bourgeois resented this and brought their case before the Marshals of France They urged that it was easy for them to breed canaries and it was also a pleasure for their wives and daughters to teach them whereas those bought on the Pont an Change were old and difficult to educate This appeal was favourably received and an order from the tribunal of the Marshals of France permitted the bourgeois to breed canaries but it forbade the sale of them which it was considered would interfere with the trade of the master fowlers of the town faubourgs and suburbs of Paris Illustration Fig one hundred sixty five Powder horn Work of the

c Small Games for Private Society History of Dancing Ballet des Ardents The Orchesographie Art of Dancing of Thoinot Arbeau List of Dances People of all countries and at all periods have been fond of public amusements and have indulged in games and pastimes with a view to make time pass agreeably These amusements have continually varied according to the character of each nation and according to the capricious changes of fashion Since the learned antiquarian J Meursius has devoted a large volume to describing the games of the ancient Greeks De Ludis Graecorum and Rabelais has collected a list of two hundred and twenty games which were in fashion at different times at the court of his gay master it will be easily understood that a description of all the games and pastimes which have ever been in use by different nations and particularly by the French would form an encyclopaedia of some size We shall give a rapid sketch of the different kinds of games and pastimes which were most in fashion during the Middle Ages and to the end of the sixteenth century omitting however the religious festivals which belong to a different category the public festivals which will come under the chapter on Ceremonials the tournaments and tilting matches and other sports of warriors which belong to Chivalry and lastly the scenic and literary representations which specially belong to the history of the stage We shall therefore limit ourselves here to giving in a condensed form a few historical details of certain court amusements and a short description of the games of skill and of chance and also of dancing The Romans especially during the times of the emperors had a passionate love for performances in the circus and amphitheatre as well as for chariot races horse races foot races combats of animals and feats of strength and agility The daily life of the Roman people may be summed up as consisting of taking their food and enjoying games in the circus panem et circenses A taste for similar amusements was common to the Gauls as well as to the whole Roman Empire and were historians silent on the subject we need no further information than that which is to be gathered from the ruins of the numerous amphitheatres which are to be found at every centre of Roman occupation The circus disappeared on the establishment of the Christian religion for the bishops condemned it as a profane and sanguinary vestige of Paganism and no doubt this led to the cessation of combats between man and beast They continued however to pit wild or savage animals against one another and to train dogs to fight with lions tigers bears and bulls otherwise it would be difficult to explain the restoration by King Chilperic A D five hundred seventy seven of the circuses and arenas at Paris and Soissons The remains of one of these circuses was not long ago discovered in Paris whilst they were engaged in laying the foundations for a new street on the west side of the hill of saint Genevieve a short distance from the old palace of the Caesars known by the name of the Thermes of Julian Gregory of Tours states that Chilperic revived the ancient games of the circus but that Gaul had ceased to be famous for good athletes and race horses although animal combats continued to take place for the amusement of the kings One day King Pepin halted with the principal officers of his army at the Abbey of Ferrieres and witnessed a fight between a lion and a bull The bull was of enormous size and extraordinary strength but nevertheless the lion overcame him whereupon Pepin who was surnamed the Short turned to his officers who used to joke him about his short stature and said to them Make the lion loose his hold of the bull or kill him No one dared to undertake so perilous a task and some said aloud that the man who would measure his strength with a lion must be mad Upon this Pepin sprang into the arena sword in hand and with two blows cut off the heads of the lion and the bull What do you think of that he said to his astonished officers Am I not fit to be your master Size cannot compare with courage Remember what little David did to the Giant Goliath Eight hundred years later there were occasional animal combats at the court of Francis I A fine lady says Brantome went to see the King s lions in company with a gentleman who much admired her She suddenly let her glove drop and it fell into the lions den I beg of you she said in the calmest way to her admirer to go amongst the lions and bring me back my glove The gentleman made no remark but without even drawing his sword went into the den and gave himself up silently to death to please the lady The lions did not move and he was able to leave their den without a scratch and return the lady her missing glove Here is your glove madam he coldly said to her who evidently valued his life at so small a price see if you can find any one else who would do the same as I have done for you So saying he left her and never afterwards looked at or even spoke to her It has been imagined that the kings of France only kept lions as living symbols of royalty In thirteen thirty three Philippe de Valois bought a barn in the Rue Froidmantel near the Chateau du Louvre where he established a menagerie for his lions bears leopards and other wild beasts This royal menagerie still existed in the reigns of Charles VIII and Francis I Charles V and his successors had an establishment of lions in the quadrangle of the Grand Hotel de saint Paul on the very spot which was subsequently the site of the Rue des Lions saint Paul These wild beasts were sometimes employed in the combats and were pitted against bulls and dogs in the presence of the King and his court It was after one of these combats that Charles IX excited by the sanguinary spectacle wished to enter the arena alone in order to attack a lion which had torn some of his best dogs to pieces and it was only with great difficulty that the audacious sovereign was dissuaded from his foolish purpose Henry III had no disposition to imitate his brother s example for dreaming one night that his lions were devouring him he had them all killed the next day The love for hunting wild animals such as the wolf bear and boar see chapter on Hunting from an early date took the place of the animal combats as far as the court and the nobles were concerned The people were therefore deprived of the spectacle of the combats which had had so much charm for them and as they could not resort to the alternative of the chase they treated themselves to a feeble imitation of the games of the circus in such amusements as setting dogs to worry old horses or donkeys c Fig one hundred sixty six Bull fights nevertheless continued in the southern provinces of France as also in Spain At village feasts not only did wrestling matches take place but also queer kinds of combats with sticks or birch boughs Two men blindfolded each armed with a stick and holding in his hand a rope fastened to a stake entered the arena and went round and round trying to strike at a fat goose or a pig which was also let loose with them It can easily be imagined that the greater number of the blows fell like hail on one or other of the principal actors in this blind combat amidst shouts of laughter from the spectators Illustration Fig one hundred sixty six Fight between a Horse and Dogs Fac simile of a Manuscript in the British Museum Thirteenth Century Nothing amused our ancestors more than these blind encounters even kings took part at these burlesque representations At Mid Lent annually they attended with their court at the Quinze Vingts in Paris in order to see blindfold persons armed from head to foot fighting with a lance or stick This amusement was quite sufficient to attract all Paris In fourteen twenty five on the last day of August the inhabitants of the capital crowded their windows to witness the procession of four blind men clothed in full armour like knights going to a tournament and preceded by two men one playing the hautbois and the other bearing a banner on which a pig was painted These four champions on the next day attacked a pig which was to become the property of the one who killed it The lists were situated in the court of the Hotel d Armagnac the present site of the Palais Royal A great crowd attended the encounter The blind men armed with all sorts of weapons belaboured each other so furiously that the game would have ended fatally to one or more of them had they not been separated and made to divide the pig which they had all so well earned Illustration Fig one hundred sixty seven Merchants and Lion keepers at Constantinople Fac simile of an Engraving on Wood from the Cosmographie Universelle of Thevet folio fifteen seventy five The people of the Middle Ages had an insatiable love of sight seeing they came great distances from all parts to witness any amusing exhibition They would suffer any amount of privation or fatigue to indulge this feeling and they gave themselves up to it so heartily that it became a solace to them in their greatest sorrows and they laughed with that hearty laugh which may be said to be one of their natural characteristics In all public processions in the open air the crowd or rather as we might say the Cockneys of Paris in their anxiety to see everything that was to be seen would frequently obstruct all the public avenues and so prevent the procession from passing along In consequence of this the Provosts of Paris on these occasions distributed hundreds of stout sticks amongst the sergeants who used them freely on the shoulders of the most obstinate sight seers see chapter on Ceremonials There was no religious procession no parish fair no municipal feast and no parade or review of troops which did not bring together crowds of people whose ears and eyes were wide open if only to hear the sound of the trumpet or to see a dog rush past with a frying pan tied to his tail Illustration Fig one hundred sixty eight Free Distribution of Bread Meat and Wine to the People Reduced Copy of a Woodcut of the Solemn Entry of Charles V and Pope Clement VII into Bologna in fifteen thirty This curiosity of the French was particularly exhibited when the kings of the first royal dynasty held their Champs de Mars the kings of the second dynasty their Cours Plenieres and the kings of the third dynasty their Cours Couronnees In these assemblies where the King gathered together all his principal vassals once or twice a year to hold personal communication with them and to strengthen his power by ensuring their feudal services large quantities of food and fermented liquors were publicly distributed among the people Fig one hundred sixty eight The populace were always most enthusiastic spectators of military displays of court ceremonies and above all of the various amusements which royalty provided for them at great cost in those days and it was on these state occasions that jugglers tumblers and minstrels displayed their talents The Champ de Mars was one of the principal fetes of the year and was held sometimes in the centre of some large town sometimes in a royal domain and sometimes in the open country Bishop Gregory of Tours describes one which was given in his diocese during the reign of Chilperic at the Easter festivals at which we may be sure that the games of the circus re established by Chilperic excited the greatest interest Charlemagne also held Champs de Mars but called them Cours Royales at which he appeared dressed in cloth of gold studded all over with pearls and precious stones Under the third dynasty King Robert celebrated court days with the same magnificence and the people were admitted to the palace during the royal banquet to witness the King sitting amongst his great officers of state The Cours Plenieres which were always held at Christmas Twelfth day Easter and on the day of Pentecost were not less brilliant during the reigns of Robert s successors Louis IX himself notwithstanding his natural shyness and his taste for simplicity was noted for the display he made on state occasions In thirteen fifty Philippe de Valois wore his crown at the Cours Plenieres and from that time they were called Cours Couronnees The kings of jugglers were the privileged performers and their feats and the other amusements which continued on each occasion for several days were provided for at the sovereign s sole expense Illustration Fig one hundred sixty nine Feats in Balancing Fac simile of a Miniature in a Manuscript in the Bodleian Library at Oxford Thirteenth Century These kings of jugglers exercised a supreme authority over the art of jugglery and over all the members of this jovial fraternity It must not be imagined that these jugglers merely recited snatches from tales and fables in rhyme this was the least of their talents The cleverest of them played all sorts of musical instruments sung songs and repeated by heart a multitude of stories after the example of their reputed forefather King Borgabed or Bedabie who according to these troubadours was King of Great Britain at the time that Alexander the Great was King of Macedonia The jugglers of a lower order especially excelled in tumbling and in tricks of legerdemain Figs one hundred sixty nine and one hundred seventy They threw wonderful somersaults they leaped through hoops placed at certain distances from one another they played with knives slings baskets brass balls and earthenware plates and they walked on their hands with their feet in the air or with their heads turned downwards so as to look through their legs backwards These acrobatic feats were even practised by women According to a legend the daughter of Herodias was a renowned acrobat and on a bas relief in the Cathedral of Rouen we find this Jewish dancer turning somersaults before Herod so as to fascinate him and thus obtain the decapitation of John the Baptist Illustration Fig one hundred seventy Sword dance to the sound of the Bagpipe Fac simile of a Manuscript in the British Museum Fourteenth Century The jugglers adds M de Labedolliere in his clever work on The Private Life of the French often led about bears monkeys and other animals which they taught to dance or to fight Figs one hundred seventy one and one hundred seventy two A manuscript in the National Library represents a banquet and around the table so as to amuse the guests performances of animals are going on such as monkeys riding on horseback a bear feigning to be dead a goat playing the harp and dogs walking on their hind legs We find the same grotesque figures on sculptures on the capitals of churches on the illuminated margins of manuscripts of theology and on prayer books which seems to indicate that jugglers were the associates of painters and illuminators even if they themselves were not the writers and illuminators of the manuscripts Jugglery M de Labedolliere goes on to say at that time embraced poetry music dancing sleight of hand conjuring wrestling boxing and the training of animals Its humblest practitioners were the mimics or grimacers in many coloured garments and brazen faced mountebanks who provoked laughter at the expense of decency Illustration Fig one hundred seventy one Jugglers exhibiting Monkeys and Bears Fac simile of a Manuscript in the British Museum Thirteenth Century At first and down to the thirteenth century the profession of a juggler was a most lucrative one There was no public or private feast of any importance without the profession being represented Their mimicry and acrobatic feats were less thought of than their long poems or lays of wars and adventures which they recited in doggerel rhyme to the accompaniment of a stringed instrument The doors of the chateaux were always open to them and they had a place assigned to them at all feasts They were the principal attraction at the Cours Plenieres and according to the testimony of one of their poets they frequently retired from business loaded with presents such as riding horses carriage horses jewels cloaks fur robes clothing of violet or scarlet cloth and above all with large sums of money They loved to recall with pride the heroic memory of one of their own calling the brave Norman Taillefer who before the battle of Hastings advanced alone on horseback between the two armies about to commence the engagement and drew off the attention of the English by singing them the song of Roland He then began juggling and taking his lance by the hilt he threw it into the air and caught it by the point as it fell then drawing his sword he spun it several times over his head and caught it in a similar way as it fell After these skilful exercises during which the enemy were gaping in mute astonishment he forced his charger through the English ranks and caused great havoc before he fell positively riddled with wounds Notwithstanding this noble instance not to belie the old proverb jugglers were never received into the order of knighthood They were after a time as much abused as they had before been extolled Their licentious lives reflected itself in their obscene language Their pantomimes like their songs showed that they were the votaries of the lowest vices The lower orders laughed at their coarseness and were amused at their juggleries but the nobility were disgusted with them and they were absolutely excluded from the presence of ladies and girls in the chateaux and houses of the bourgeoisie We see in the tale of Le Jugleor that they acquired ill fame everywhere inasmuch as they were addicted to every sort of vice The clergy and saint Bernard especially denounced them and held them up to public contempt saint Bernard spoke thus of them in one of his sermons written in the middle of the twelfth century A man fond of jugglers will soon enough possess a wife whose name is Poverty If it happens that the tricks of jugglers are forced upon your notice endeavour to avoid them and think of other things The tricks of jugglers never please God Illustration Fig one hundred seventy two Equestrian Performances Fac simile of a Miniature in an English Manuscript of the Thirteenth Century From this remark we may understand their fall as well as the disrepute in which they were held at that time and we are not surprised to find in an old edition of the Memoires du Sire de Joinville this passage which is perhaps an interpolation from a contemporary document saint Louis drove from his kingdom all tumblers and players of sleight of hand through whom many evil habits and tastes had become engendered in the people A troubadour s story of this period shows that the jugglers wandered about the country with their trained animals nearly starved they were half naked and were often without anything on their heads without coats without shoes and always without money The lower orders welcomed them and continued to admire and idolize them for their clever tricks Fig one hundred seventy three but the bourgeois class following the example of the nobility turned their backs upon them

Jugglers performing in public From a Miniature of the Manuscript of Guarin de Loherane Thirteenth Century Library of the Arsenal Paris Having been associated together as a confraternity since thirteen thirty one they lived huddled together in one street of Paris which took the name of Rue des Jougleurs It was at this period that the Church and Hospital of saint Julian were founded through the exertions of Jacques Goure a native of Pistoia and of Huet le Lorrain who were both jugglers The newly formed brotherhood at once undertook to subscribe to this good work and each member did so according to his means Their aid to the cost of the two buildings was sixty livres and they were both erected in the Rue saint Martin and placed under the protection of saint Julian the Martyr The chapel was consecrated on the last Sunday in September thirteen thirty five and on the front of it there were three figures one representing a troubadour one a minstrel and one a juggler each with his various instruments The bad repute into which jugglers had fallen did not prevent the kings of France from attaching buffoons or fools as they were generally called to their households who were often more or less deformed dwarfs and who to all intents and purposes were jugglers They were allowed to indulge in every sort of impertinence and waggery in order to excite the risibility of their masters Figs one hundred seventy four and one hundred seventy five These buffoons or fools were an institution at court until the time of Louis XIV and several such as Caillette Triboulet and Brusquet are better known in history than many of the statesmen and soldiers who were their contemporaries Illustration Fig one hundred seventy four Dance of Fools Fac simile of a Miniature in Manuscript of the Thirteenth Century in the Bodleian Library of Oxford At the end of the fourteenth century the brotherhood of jugglers divided itself into two distinct classes the jugglers proper and the tumblers The former continued to recite serious or amusing poetry to sing love songs to play comic interludes either singly or in concert in the streets or in the houses accompanying themselves or being accompanied by all sorts of musical instruments The tumblers on the other hand devoted themselves exclusively to feats of agility or of skill the exhibition of trained animals the making of comic grimaces and tight rope dancing Illustration A Court Fool of the fifteenth Century Fac simile of a miniature from a ms in the Bibl de l Arsenal Th lat no one hundred twenty five The art of rope dancing is very ancient it was patronised by the Franks who looked upon it as a marvellous effort of human genius The most remarkable rope dancers of that time were of Indian origin All performers in this art came originally from the East although they afterwards trained pupils in the countries through which they passed recruiting themselves chiefly from the mixed tribe of jugglers According to a document quoted by the learned Foncemagne rope dancers appeared as early as thirteen twenty seven at the entertainments given at state banquets by the kings of France But long before that time they are mentioned in the poems of troubadours as the necessary auxiliaries of any feast given by the nobility or even by the monasteries From the fourteenth to the end of the sixteenth century they were never absent from any public ceremonial and it was at the state entries of kings and queens princes and princesses that they were especially called upon to display their talents Illustration Fig one hundred seventy five Court Fool Fac simile of a Woodcut in the Cosmographie Universelle of Munster folio Basle fifteen fifty two One of the most extraordinary examples of the daring of these tumblers is to be found in the records of the entry of Queen Isabel of Bavaria into Paris in thirteen eighty five see chapter on Ceremonials and indeed all the chronicles of the fifteenth century are full of anecdotes of their doings Mathieu de Coucy who wrote a history of the time of Charles VII relates some very curious details respecting a show which took place at Milan and which astonished the whole of Europe The Duke of Milan ordered a rope to be stretched across his palace about one hundred and fifty feet from the ground and of equal length On to this a Portuguese mounted walked straight along going backwards and forwards and dancing to the sound of the tambourine He also hung from the rope with his head downwards and went through all sorts of tricks The ladies who were looking on could not help hiding their eyes in their handkerchiefs from fear lest they should see him overbalance and fall and kill himself The chronicler of Charles XII Jean d Arton tells us of a not less remarkable feat performed on the occasion of the obsequies of Duke Pierre de Bourbon which were celebrated at Moulins in the month of October fifteen oh three in the presence of the king and the court Amongst other performances was that of a German tight rope dancer named Georges Menustre a very young man who had a thick rope stretched across from the highest part of the tower of the Castle of Macon to the windows of the steeple of the Church of the Jacobites The height of this from the ground was twenty five fathoms and the distance from the castle to the steeple some two hundred and fifty paces On two evenings in succession he walked along this rope and on the second occasion when he started from the tower of the castle his feat was witnessed by the king and upwards of thirty thousand persons He performed all sorts of graceful tricks such as dancing grotesque dances to music and hanging to the rope by his feet and by his teeth Although so strange and marvellous these feats were nevertheless actually performed unless human sight had been deceived by magic A female dancer also performed in a novel way cutting capers throwing somersaults and performing graceful Moorish and other remarkable and peculiar dances Such was their manner of celebrating a funeral In the sixteenth century these dancers and tumblers became so numerous that they were to be met with everywhere in the provinces as well as in the towns Many of them were Bohemians or Zingari They travelled in companies sometimes on foot sometimes on horseback and sometimes with some sort of a conveyance containing the accessories of their craft and a travelling theatre But people began to tire of these sorts of entertainments the more so as they were required to pay for them and they naturally preferred the public rejoicings which cost them nothing They were particularly fond of illuminations and fireworks which are of much later origin than the invention of gunpowder although the Saracens at the time of the Crusades used a Greek fire for illuminations which considerably alarmed the Crusaders when they first witnessed its effects Regular fireworks appear to have been invented in Italy where the pyrotechnic art has retained its superiority to this day and where the inhabitants are as enthusiastic as ever for this sort of amusement and consider it in fact inseparable from every religious private or public festival This Italian invention was first introduced into the Low Countries by the Spaniards where it found many admirers and it made its appearance in France with the Italian artists who established themselves in that country in the reigns of Charles VIII Louis XII and Francis I Fireworks could not fail to be attractive at the Court of the Valois to which Catherine de Medicis had introduced the manners and customs of Italy The French who up to that time had only been accustomed to the illuminations of saint John s Day and of the first Sunday in Lent received those fireworks with great enthusiasm and they soon became a regular part of the programme for public festivals Fig one hundred seventy six Illustration Fig one hundred seventy six Fireworks on the Water with an Imitation of a

of the spectators we have still to describe those in which the actors took greater pleasure than even the spectators themselves These were specially the games of strength and skill as well as dancing with a notice of which we shall conclude this chapter There were besides the various games of chance and the games of fun and humour Most of the bourgeois and the villagers played a variety of games of agility many of which have descended to our times and are still to be found at our schools and colleges Wrestling running races the game of bars high and wide jumping leap frog blind man s buff games of ball of all sorts gymnastics and all exercises which strengthened the body or added to the suppleness of the limbs were long in use among the youth of the nobility Figs one hundred seventy seven and one hundred seventy eight The Lord of Fleuranges in his memoirs written at the court of Francis I recounts numerous exercises to which he devoted himself during his childhood and youth and which were then looked upon as a necessary part of the education of chivalry The nobles in this way acquired a taste for physical exercises and took naturally to combats tournaments and hunting and subsequently their services in the battle field gave them plenty of opportunities to gratify the taste thus developed in them These were not however sufficient for their insatiable activity when they could not do anything else they played at tennis and such games at all hours of the day and these pastimes had so much attraction for nobles of all ages that they not unfrequently sacrificed their health in consequence of overtaxing their strength In fifteen oh six the King of Castile Philippe le Beau died of pleurisy from a severe cold which he caught while playing tennis Illustration Fig one

in the towns and tennis courts were built in all parts of such spacious proportions and so well adapted for spectators that they were often converted into theatres Their game of billiards resembled the modern one only in name for it was played on a level piece of ground with wooden balls which were struck with hooked sticks and mallets It was in great repute in the fourteenth century for in thirteen ninety six Marshal de Boucicault who was considered one of the best players of his time won at it six hundred francs or more than twenty eight thousand francs of present currency At the beginning of the following century the Duke Louis d Orleans ordered billes et billars to be bought for the sum of eleven sols six deniers tournois about fifteen francs of our money that he might amuse himself with them There were several games of the same sort which were not less popular Skittles la Soule or Soulette which consisted of a large ball of hay covered over with leather the possession of which was contested for by two opposing sides of players Football open Tennis Shuttlecock c It was Charles V who first thought of giving a more serious and useful character to the games of the people

Leaping and Vaulting by A Tuccaro fourto Paris fifteen ninety nine At all times and in all countries the games of chance were the most popular although they were forbidden both by ecclesiastical and royal authority New laws were continually being enacted against them and especially against those in which dice were used though with little avail Dice shall not be made in the kingdom says the law of twelve fifty six and those who are discovered using them and frequenting taverns and bad places will be looked upon as suspicions characters A law of twelve ninety one repeats That games with dice be forbidden Nevertheless though these prohibitions were frequently renewed people continued to disregard them and to lose much money at such games The law of thirteen ninety six is aimed particularly against loaded dice which must have been contemporary with the origin of dice themselves for no games ever gave rise to a greater amount of roguery than those of this description They were however publicly sold in spite of all the laws to the contrary for in the Dit du Mercier the dealer offers his merchandise thus J ay dez de plus j ay dez de moins De Paris de Chartres de Rains I have heavy dice I have light dice From Paris from Chartres and from Rains It has been said that the game of dice was at first called the game of God because the regulation of lottery was one of God s prerogatives but this derivation is purely imaginary What appears more likely is that dice were first forbidden by the Church and then by the civil authorities on account of the fearful oaths which were so apt to be uttered by those players who had a run of ill luck Nothing was commoner than for people to ruin themselves at this game The poems of troubadours are full of imprecations against the

number of the games of cards formerly did not require the least skill on the part of the players chance alone deciding The game of Tables however required skill and calculation for under this head were comprised all the games which were played on a board and particularly chess draughts and backgammon The invention of the game of chess has been attributed to the Assyrians and there can be no doubt but that it came from the East and reached Gaul about the beginning of the ninth century although it was not extensively known till about the twelfth The annals of chivalry continually speak of the barons playing at these games and especially at chess Historians also mention chess and show that it was played with the same zest in the camp of the Saracens as in that of the Crusaders We must not be surprised if chess shared the prohibition laid upon dice for those who were ignorant of its ingenious combinations ranked it amongst games of chance The Council of Paris in twelve twelve therefore condemned chess for the same reasons as dice and it was specially forbidden to church people who had begun to make it their habitual pastime The royal edict of twelve fifty four was equally unjust with regard to this game We strictly forbid says Louis IX any person to play at dice tables or chess This pious king set himself against these games which he looked upon as inventions of the devil After the fatal day of Mansorah in twelve forty nine the King who was still in Egypt with the remnants of his army asked what his brother the Comte d Anjou was doing He was told says Joinville that he was playing at tables with his Royal Highness Gaultier de Nemours The King was highly incensed against his brother and though most feeble from the effects of his illness went to him and taking the dice and the tables had them thrown into the sea Nevertheless Louis IX received as a present from the Vieux de la Montagne chief of the Ismalians a chessboard made of gold and rock crystal the pieces being of precious metals beautifully worked It has been asserted but incorrectly that this chessboard was the one preserved in the Musee de Cluny after having long formed part of the treasures of the Kings of France Amongst the games comprised under the name of tables it is sufficient to mention that of draughts which was formerly played with dice and with the same men as were used for chess also the game of honchet or jonchees that is bones or spillikins games which required pieces or men in the same way as chess but which required more quickness of hand than of intelligence and epingles or push pin which was played in a similar manner to the honchets and was the great amusement of the small pages in the houses of the nobility When they had not epingles honchets or draughtsmen to play with they used their fingers instead and played a game which is still most popular amongst the Italian people called the morra and which was as much in vogue with the ancient Romans as it is among the modern Italians It consisted of suddenly raising as many fingers as had been shown by one s adversary and gave rise to a great amount of amusement among the players and lookers on The games played by girls were of course different from those in use among boys The latter played at marbles luettes peg or humming tops quoits fouquet merelles and a number of other games many of which are now unknown The girls it is almost needless to say from the earliest times played with dolls Briche a game in which a brick and a small stick was used were also a favourite Martiaus or small quoits wolf or fox blind man s buff hide and seek quoits c were all girls games The greater part of these amusements were enlivened by a chorus which all the girls sang together or by dialogues sung or chanted in unison Illustration Fig one hundred eighty one Allegorical Scene of one of the Courts of Love in Provence In the First Compartment the God of Love Cupid is sitting on the

many generations continued comparatively unchanged so the dames and the young ladies had theirs consisting of gallantry and politeness which only disappeared with those harmless assemblies in which the two sexes vied with each other in urbanity friendly roguishness and wit It would require long antiquarian researches to discover the origin and mode of playing many of these pastimes such as des oes des trois anes des accords bigarres du jardin madame de la fricade du feiseau de la mick and a number of others which are named but not described in the records of the times The game a l oreille the invention of which is attributed to the troubadour Guillaume Adhemar the jeu des Valentines or the game of lovers and the numerous games of forfeits which have come down to us from the Courts of Love of the Middle Ages we find to be somewhat deprived of their original simplicity in the way they are now played in country houses in the winter and at village festivals in the summer But the Courts of Love are no longer in existence gravely to superintend all these diversions Fig one hundred eighty one Amongst the amusements which time has not obliterated but which on the contrary seem destined to be of longer duration than monuments of stone and brass we must name dancing which was certainly one of the principal amusements of society and which has come down to us through all religions all customs all people and all ages preserving at the same time much of its original character Dancing appears at each period of the world s history to have been alternately religions and profane lively and solemn frivolous and severe Though dancing was as common an amusement formerly as it is now there was this essential difference between the two periods namely that certain people such as the Romans were very fond of seeing dancing but did not join in it themselves Tiberius drove the dancers out of Rome and Domitian dismissed certain senators from their seats in the senate who had degraded themselves by dancing and there seems to be no doubt that the Romans from the conquest of Julius Caesar did not themselves patronise the art There were a number of professional dancers in Gaul as well as in the other provinces of the Roman Empire who were hired to dance at feasts and who endeavoured to do their best to make their art as popular as possible The lightheartedness of the Gauls their natural gaiety their love for violent exercise and for pleasures of all sorts made them delight in dancing and indulge in it with great energy and thus notwithstanding the repugnance of the Roman aristocracy and the prohibitions and anathemas of councils and synods dancing has always been one of the favourite pastimes of the Gauls and the French Illustration Fig one hundred eighty two Dancers on Christmas Night punished for their Impiety and condemned to dance for a whole Year Legend of the Fifteenth Century Fac simile of a Woodcut by P Wohlgemuth in the Liber Chronicorum Mundi folio Nuremberg fourteen ninety three Leuce Carin a writer of doubtful authority states that in the early history of Christianity the faithful danced or rather stamped in measured time during religions ceremonials gesticulating and distorting themselves This is however a mistake The only thing approaching to it was the slight trace of the ancient Pagan dances which remained in the feast of the first Sunday in Lent and which probably belonged to the religious ceremonies of the Druids At nightfall fires were lighted in public places and numbers of people danced madly round them Rioting and disorderly conduct often resulted from this popular feast and the magistrates were obliged to interfere in order to suppress it The church too did not close her eyes to the abuses which this feast engendered although episcopal admonitions were not always listened to Fig one hundred eighty two We see in the records of one of the most recent Councils of Narbonne that the custom of dancing in the churches and in the cemeteries on certain feasts had not been abolished in some parts of the Languedoc at the end of the sixteenth century Dancing was at all times forbidden by the Catholic Church on account of its tendency to corrupt the morals and for centuries ecclesiastical authority was strenuously opposed to it but on the other hand it could not complain of want of encouragement from the civil power When King Childebert in five hundred fifty four forbade all dances in his domains he was only induced to do so by the influence of the bishops We have but little information respecting the dances of this period and it would be impossible accurately to determine as to the justice of their being forbidden They were certainly no longer those war dances which the Franks had brought with them and which antiquarians have mentioned under the name of Pyrrhichienne dances In any case war dances reappeared at the commencement of chivalry for when a new knight was elected all the knights in full armour performed evolutions either on foot or on horseback to the sound of military music and the populace danced round them It has been said that this was the origin of court ballets and La Colombiere in his Theatre d Honneur et de Chevalerie relates that this ancient dance of the knights was kept up by the Spaniards who called it the Moresque The Middle Ages was the great epoch for dancing especially in France There were an endless number of dancing festivals and from reading the old poets and romancers one might imagine that the French had never anything better to do than to dance and that at all hours of the day and night A curious argument in favour of the practical utility of dancing is suggested by Jean Tabourot in his Orchesographie published at Langres in fifteen eighty eight under the name of Thoinot Arbeau He says Dancing is practised in order to see whether lovers are healthy and suitable for one another at the end of a dance the gentlemen are permitted to kiss their mistresses in order that they may ascertain if they have an agreeable breath In this matter besides many other good results which follow from dancing it becomes necessary for the good governing of society Such was the doctrine of the Courts of Love which stoutly took up the defence of dancing against the clergy In those days as soon as the two sexes were assembled in sufficient numbers before or after the feasts the balls began and men and women took each other by the hand and commenced the performance in regular steps Fig one hundred eighty three The author of the poem of Provence called Flamenca thus allegorically describes these amusements Youth and Gaiety opened the ball accompanied by their sister Bravery Cowardice confused went of her own accord and hid herself The troubadours mention a great number of dances without describing them no doubt they were so familiar that they thought a description of them needless They often speak of the danse au virlet a kind of round dance during the performance of which each person in turn sang a verse the chorus being repeated by all In the code of the Courts of Love entitled Arresta Amorum that is the decrees of love the pas de Brabant is mentioned in which each gentleman bent his knee before his lady and also the danse au chapelet at the end of which each dancer kissed his lady Romances of chivalry frequently mention that knights used to dance with the dames and young ladies without taking off their helmets and coats of mail Although this costume was hardly fitted for the purpose we find in the romance of Perceforet that after a repast whilst the tables were being removed everything was prepared for a ball and that although the knights made no change in their accoutrements yet the ladies went and made fresh toilettes Then says the old novelist the young knights and the young ladies began to play their instruments and to have the dance From this custom may be traced the origin of the ancient Gallic proverb Apres la panse vient la danse After the feast comes the dance Sometimes a minstrel sang songs to the accompaniment of the harp and the young ladies danced in couples and repeated at intervals the minstrel s songs Sometimes the torch dance was performed in this each performer bore in his hand a long lighted taper and endeavoured to prevent his neighbours from blowing it out which each one tried to do if possible Fig one hundred eighty four This dance which was in use up to the end of the sixteenth century at court was generally reserved for weddings Illustration Fig one hundred eighty

a Scene at the Court of Burgundy From a Painting on Wood of fourteen sixty three belonging to M H Casterman of Tournai Belgium Dancing lost much of its simplicity and harmlessness when masquerades were introduced these being the first examples of the ballet These masquerades which soon after their introduction became passionately indulged in at court under Charles VI were at first only allowed during Carnival and on particular occasions called Charivaris and they were usually made the pretext for the practice of the most licentious follies These masquerades had a most unfortunate inauguration by the catastrophe which rendered the madness of Charles VI incurable and which is described in history under the name of the Burning Ballet It was on the twenty ninth of January thirteen ninety three that this ballet made famous the festival held in the Royal Palace of saint Paul in Paris on the occasion of the marriage of one of the maids of honour of Queen Isabel of Bavaria with a gentleman of Vermandois The bride was a widow and the second nuptials were deemed a fitting occasion for the Charivaris Illustration Fig one hundred eighty five The Burning Ballet Fac simile of a Miniature in the Manuscript of the Chroniques of Froissart Fifteenth Century in the National Library of Paris A gentleman from Normandy named Hugonin de Grensay thought he could create a sensation by having a dance of wild men to please the ladies He admitted to his plot says Froissart the king and four of the principal nobles of the court These all had themselves sewn up in close fitting linen garments covered with resin on which a quantity of tow was glued and in this guise they appeared in the middle of the ball The king was alone but the other four were chained together They jumped about like madmen uttered wild cries and made all sorts of eccentric gestures No one knew who these hideous objects were but the Duke of Orleans determined to find out so he took a candle and imprudently approached too near one of the men The tow caught fire and the flames enveloped him and the other three who were chained to him in a moment They were burning for nearly an hour like torches says a chronicler The king had the good fortune to escape the peril because the Duchesse de Berry his aunt recognised him and had the presence of mind to envelop him in her train Fig one hundred eighty five Such a calamity one would have thought might have been sufficient to disgust people with masquerades but they were none the less in favour at court for many years afterwards and two centuries later the author of the Orchesographie thus writes on the subject Kings and princes give dances and masquerades for amusement and in order to afford a joyful welcome to foreign nobles we also practise the same amusements on the celebration of marriages In no country in the world was dancing practised with more grace and elegance than in France Foreign dances of every kind were introduced and after being remodelled and brought to as great perfection as possible they were often returned to the countries from which they had been imported under almost a new character Illustration Fig one hundred eighty six Musicians accompanying the Dancing Fac simile of a Wood Engraving in the Orchesographie of Thoinot Arbeau Jehan Tabourot fourto Langres fifteen eighty eight In fifteen forty eight the dances of the Bearnais which were much admired at the court of the Comtes de Foix especially those called the danse mauresque and the danse des sauvages were introduced at the court of France and excited great merriment So popular did they become that with a little modification they soon were considered essentially French The German dances which were distinguished by the rapidity of their movements were also thoroughly established at the court of France Italian Milanese Spanish and Piedmontese dances were in fashion in France before the expedition of Charles VIII into Italy and when this king followed by his youthful nobility passed over the mountains to march to the conquest of Naples he found everywhere in the towns that welcomed him and in which balls and masquerades were given in honour of his visit the dance a la mode de France which consisted of a sort of medley of the dances of all countries Some hundreds of these dances have been enumerated in the fifth book of the Pantagruel of Rabelais and in various humorous works of those who succeeded him They owed their success to the singing with which they were generally accompanied or to the postures pantomimes or drolleries with which they were supplemented for the amusement of the spectators A few and amongst others that of the five steps and that of the three faces are mentioned in the History of the Queen of Navarre Illustration Fig one hundred eighty seven The Dance called La Gaillarde Fac simile of Wood Engravings from the Orchesographie of Thoinot Arbeau Jehan Tabourot fourto Langres fifteen eighty eight Dances were divided into two distinct classes danses basses or common and regular dances which did not admit of jumping violent movements or extraordinary contortions and the danses par haut which were irregular and comprised all sorts of antics and buffoonery The regular French dance was a basse dance called the gaillarde it was accompanied by the sound of the hautbois and tambourine and originally it was danced with great form and state This is the dance which Jean Tabouret has described it began with the two performers standing opposite to each other advancing bowing and retiring These advancings and retirings were done in steps to the time of the music and continued until the instrumental accompaniment stopped then the gentleman made his bow to the lady took her by the hand thanked her and led her to her seat The tourdion was similar to the gaillarde only faster and was accompanied with more action Each province of France had its national dance such as the bourree of Auvergne the trioris of Brittany the branles of Poitou and the valses of Lorraine which constituted a very agreeable pastime and one in which the French excelled all other nations This art so ancient so honourable and so profitable to use the words of Jean Tabourot was long in esteem in the highest social circles and the old men liked to display their agility and the dames and young ladies to find a temperate exercise calculated to contribute to their health as well as to their amusement The sixteenth century was the great era of dancing in all the courts of Europe but under the Valois the art had more charm and prestige at the court of France than anywhere else The Queen mother Catherine surrounded by a crowd of pretty young ladies who composed what she called her flying squadron presided at these exciting dances A certain Balthazar de Beaujoyeux was master of her ballets and they danced at the Castle of Blois the night before the Duc de Guise was assassinated under the eyes of Henry

Commercial Flanders Laws of Maritime Commerce Consular Laws Banks and Bills of Exchange French Settlements on the Coast of Africa Consequences of the Discovery of America Commerce in the Middle Ages says M Charles Grandmaison differed but little from that of a more remote period It was essentially a local and limited traffic rather inland than maritime for long and perilous sea voyages only commenced towards the end of the fifteenth century or about the time when Columbus discovered America On the fall of the Roman Empire commerce was rendered insecure and indeed it was almost completely put a stop to by the barbarian invasions and all facility of communication between different nations and even between towns of the same country was interrupted In those times of social confusion there were periods of such poverty and distress that for want of money commerce was reduced to the simple exchange of the positive necessaries of life When order was a little restored and society and the minds of people became more composed we see commerce recovering its position and France was perhaps the first country in Europe in which this happy change took place Those famous cities of Gaul which ancient authors describe to us as so rich and so industrious quickly recovered their former prosperity and the friendly relations which were established between the kings of the Franks and the Eastern Empire encouraged the Gallic cities in cultivating a commerce which was at that time the most important and most extensive in the world Marseilles the ancient Phoenician colony once the rival and then the successor to Carthage was undoubtedly at the head of the commercial cities of France Next to her came Arles which supplied ship builders and seamen to the fleet of Provence and Narbonne which admitted into its harbour ships from Spain Sicily and Africa until in consequence of the Aude having changed its course it was obliged to relinquish the greater part of its maritime commerce in favour of Montpellier Illustration Fig one hundred eighty nine View of Alexandria in Egypt in the Sixteenth Century Fac simile of a Woodcut in the Travels of P Belon Observations de Plusieurs Singularitez c fourto Paris fifteen eighty eight Commerce maintained frequent communications with the East it sought its supplies on the coast of Syria and especially at Alexandria in Egypt which was a kind of depot for goods obtained from the rich countries lying beyond the Red Sea Figs one hundred eighty nine and one hundred ninety The Frank navigators imported from these countries groceries linen Egyptian paper pearls perfumes and a thousand other rare and choice articles In exchange they offered chiefly the precious metals in bars rather than coined and it is probable that at this period they also exported iron wines oil and wax The agricultural produce and manufactures of Gaul had not sufficiently developed to provide anything more than what was required for the producers themselves Industry was as yet if not purely domestic confined to monasteries and to the houses of the nobility and even the kings employed women or serf workmen to manufacture the coarse stuffs with which they clothed themselves and their households We may add that the bad state of the roads the little security they offered to travellers the extortions of all kinds to which foreign merchants were subjected and above all the iniquitous System of fines and tolls which each landowner thought right to exact before letting merchandise pass through his domains all created insuperable obstacles to the development of commerce Illustration Fig one hundred ninety Transport of Merchandise on the Backs of Camels Fac simile of a Woodcut in the Cosmographie Universelle of Thevet folio fifteen seventy five The Frank kings on several occasions evinced a desire that communications favourable to trade should be re established in their dominions We find for instance Chilperic making treaties with Eastern emperors in favour of the merchants of Agde and Marseilles Queen Brunehaut making viaducts worthy of the Romans and which still bear her name and Dagobert opening at saint Denis free fairs that is to say free or nearly so from all tolls and taxes to which goods both agricultural and manufactured were sent from every corner of Europe and the known world to be afterwards distributed through the towns and provinces by the enterprise of internal commerce After the reign of Dagobert commerce again declined without positively ceasing for the revolution which transferred the power of the kings to the mayors of the palace was not of a nature to exhaust the resources of public prosperity and a charter of seven hundred ten proves that the merchants of Saxony England Normandy and even Hungary still flocked to the fairs of saint Denis Under the powerful and administrative hand of Charlemagne the roads being better kept up and the rivers being made more navigable commerce became safe and more general the coasts were protected from piratical incursions lighthouses were erected at dangerous points to prevent shipwrecks and treaties of commerce with foreign nations including even the most distant guaranteed the liberty and security of French traders abroad Under the weak successors of this monarch notwithstanding their many efforts commerce was again subjected to all sorts of injustice and extortions and all its safeguards were rapidly destroyed The Moors in the south and the Normans in the north appeared to desire to destroy everything which came in their way and already Marseilles in eight hundred thirty eight was taken and pillaged by the Greeks The constant altercations between the sons of Louis le Debonnaire and their unfortunate father their jealousies amongst themselves and their fratricidal wars increased the measure of public calamity so that soon overrun by foreign enemies and destroyed by her own sons France became a vast field of disorder and desolation The Church which alone possessed some social influence never ceased to use its authority in endeavouring to remedy this miserable state of things but episcopal edicts papal anathemas and decrees of councils had only a partial effect at this unhappy period At any moment agricultural and commercial operations were liable to be interrupted if not completely ruined by the violence of a wild and rapacious soldiery at every step the roads often impassable were intercepted by toll bars for some due of a vexatious nature besides being continually infested by bands of brigands who carried off the merchandise and murdered those few merchants who were so bold as to attempt to continue their business It was the Church occupied as she was with the interests of civilisation who again assisted commerce to emerge from the state of annihilation into which it had fallen and the Peace or Truce of God established in ten forty one endeavoured to stop at least the internal wars of feudalism and it succeeded at any rate for a time in arresting these disorders This was all that could be done at that period and the Church accomplished it by taking the high hand and with as much unselfishness as energy and courage she regulated society which had been abandoned by the civil power from sheer impotence and want of administrative capability Illustration Fig one hundred ninety one Trade on the Seaports of the Levant After a Miniature in a Manuscript of the Travels of Marco Polo Fifteenth Century Library of the Arsenal of Paris At all events thanks to ecclesiastical foresight which increased the number of fairs and markets at the gates of abbeys and convents the first step was made towards the general resuscitation of commerce Indeed the Church may be said to have largely contributed to develop the spirit of progress and liberty whence were to spring societies and nationalities and in a word modern organization The Eastern commerce furnished the first elements of that trading activity which showed itself on the borders of the Mediterranean and we find the ancient towns of Provence and Languedoc springing up again by the aide of the republics of Amalfi Venice Genoa and Pisa which had become the rich depots of all maritime trade At first as we have already stated the wares of India came to Europe through the Greek port of Alexandria or through Constantinople The Crusades which had facilitated the relations with Eastern countries developed a taste in the West for their indigenous productions gave a fresh vigour to this foreign commerce and rendered it more productive by removing the stumbling blocks which had arrested its progress Fig one hundred ninety one The conquest of Palestine by the Crusaders had first opened all the towns and harbours of this wealthy region to Western traders and many of them were able permanently to establish themselves there with all sorts of privileges and exemptions from taxes which were gladly offered to them by the nobles who had transferred feudal power to Mussulman territories Ocean commerce assumed from this moment proportions hitherto unknown Notwithstanding the papal bulls and decrees which forbade Christians from having any connection with infidels the voice of interest was more listened to than that of the Church Fig one hundred ninety two and traders did not fear to disobey the political and religions orders which forbade them to carry arms and slaves to the enemies of the faith It was easy to foretell from the very first that the military occupation of the Holy Land would not be permanent In consequence of this therefore the nearer the loss of this fine conquest seemed to be the greater were the efforts made by the maritime towns of the West to re establish on a more solid and lasting basis a commercial alliance with Egypt the country which they selected to replace Palestine in a mercantile point of view Marseilles was the greatest supporter of this intercourse with Egypt and in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries she reached a very high position which she owed to her shipowners and traders In the fourteenth century however the princes of the house of Anjou ruined her like the rest of Provence in the great and fruitless efforts which they made to recover the kingdom of Naples and it was not until the reign of Louis XI that the old Phoenician city recovered its maritime and commercial prosperity Fig one hundred ninety three Illustration Fig one hundred ninety two Merchant Vessel in a Storm Fac simile of a Woodcut in the Grand Kalendrier et Compost des Bergers in folio

Narbonne and especially Montpellier so quickly established important trading connections with all the ports of the Mediterranean that at the end of the fourteenth century consuls were appointed at each of these towns in order to protect and direct their transmarine commerce A traveller of the twelfth century Benjamin de Tudele relates that in these ports which were afterwards called the stepping stones to the Levant every language in the world might be heard Toulouse was soon on a par with the towns of Lower Languedoc and the Garonne poured into the markets not only the produce of Guienne and of the western parts of France but also those of Flanders Normandy and England We may observe however that Bordeaux although placed in a most advantageous position at the mouth of the river only possessed when under the English dominion a very limited commerce principally confined to the export of wines to Great Britain in exchange for corn oil c La Rochelle on the same coast was much more flourishing at this period owing to the numerous coasters which carried the wines of Aunis and Saintonge and the salt of Brouage to Flanders the Netherlands and the north of Germany Vitre already had its silk manufactories in the fifteenth century and Nantes gave promise of her future greatness as a depot of maritime commerce It was about this time also that the fisheries became a new industry in which Bayonne and a few villages on the sea coast took the lead some being especially engaged in whaling and others in the cod and herring fisheries Fig one hundred ninety four Long before this Normandy had depended on other branches of trade for its commercial prosperity Its fabrics of woollen stuffs its arms and cutlery besides the agricultural productions of its fertile and well cultivated soil each furnished material for export on a large scale The towns of Rouen and Caen were especially manufacturing cities and were very rich This was the case with Rouen particularly which was situated on the Seine and was at that time an extensive depot for provisions and other merchandise which was sent down the river for export or was imported for future internal consumption Already Paris the abode of kings and the metropolis of government began to foreshadow the immense development which it was destined to undergo by becoming the centre of commercial affairs and by daily adding to its labouring and mercantile population Figs one hundred ninety five and one hundred ninety six It was however outside the walls of Paris that commerce which needed liberty as well as protection at first progressed most rapidly The northern provinces had early united manufacturing industry with traffic and this double source of local prosperity was the origin of their enormous wealth Ghent and Bruges in the Low Countries and Beauvais and Arras were celebrated for their manufacture of cloths carpets and serge and Cambrai for its fine cloths The artizans and merchants of these industrious cities then established their powerful corporations whose unwearied energy gave rise to that commercial freedom so favourable to trade Illustration Fig one hundred ninety four Whale Fishing Fac simile of a Woodcut in the Cosmographie Universelle of Thevet in folio Paris fifteen seventy four More important than the woollen manufactures for the greater part of the wool used was brought from England was the manufacture of flax inasmuch as it encouraged agriculture the raw material being produced in France This first flourished in the north east of France and spread slowly to Picardy to Beauvois and Brittany The central countries with the exception of Bruges whose cloth manufactories were already celebrated in the fifteenth century remained essentially agricultural and their principal towns were merely depots for imported goods The institution of fairs however rendered it is true this commerce of some of the towns as wide spread as it was productive In the Middle Ages religious feasts and ceremonials almost always gave rise to fairs which commerce was not slow in multiplying as much as possible The merchants naturally came to exhibit their goods where the largest concourse of people afforded the greatest promise of their readily disposing of them As early as the first dynasty of Merovingian kings temporary and periodical markets of this kind existed but except at saint Denis articles of local consumption only were brought to them The reasons for this were the heavy taxes which were levied by the feudal lords on all merchandise exhibited for sale and the danger which foreign merchants ran of being plundered on their way or even at the fair itself These causes for a long time delayed the progress of an institution which was afterwards destined to become so useful and beneficial to all classes of the community We have several times mentioned the famous fair of Landit which is supposed to have been established by Charlemagne but which no doubt was a sort of revival of the fairs of saint Denis founded by Dagobert and which for a time had fallen into disuse in the midst of the general ruin which preceded that emperor s reign This fair of Landit was renowned over the whole of Europe and attracted merchants from all countries It was held in the month of June and only lasted fifteen days Goods of all sorts both of home and foreign manufacture were sold but the sale of parchment was the principal object of the fair to purchase a supply of which the University of Paris regularly went in procession On account of its special character this fair was of less general importance than the six others which from the twelfth century were held at Troyes Provins Lagny sur Marne Rheims and Bar sur Aube These infused so much commercial vitality into the province of Champagne that the nobles for the most part shook off the prejudice which forbad their entering into any sort of trading association Fairs multiplied in the centre and in the south of France simultaneously Those of Puy en Velay now the capital of the Haute Loire are looked upon as the most ancient and they preserved their old reputation and attracted a considerable concourse of people which was also increased by the pilgrimages then made to Notre Dame du Puy These fairs which were more of a religious than of a commercial character were then of less importance as regards trade than those held at Beaucaire This town rose to great repute in the thirteenth century and with the Lyons market became at that time the largest centre of commerce in the southern provinces Placed at the junction of the Saone and the Rhone Lyons owed its commercial development to the proximity of Marseilles and the towns of Italy Its four annual fairs were always much frequented and when the kings of France transferred to it the privileges of the fairs of Champagne and transplanted to within its walls the silk manufactories formerly established at Tours Lyons really became the second

the Company of Merchants and Shrievalty in the City of Paris in small folio goth Jacques Nyverd fifteen twenty eight It may be asserted as an established fact that the gradual extension of the power of the king produced by the fall of feudalism was favourable to the extension of commerce As early as the reign of Louis IX many laws and regulations prove that the kings were alive to the importance of trade Among the chief enactments was one which led to the formation of the harbour of Aigues Mortes on the Mediterranean another to the publication of the book of Weights and Measures by Etienne Boileau a work in which the ancient statutes of the various trades were arranged and codified and a third to the enactment made in the very year of this king s death to guarantee the security of vendors and at the same time to ensure purchasers against fraud All these bear undoubted witness that an enlightened policy in favour of commerce had already sprung up Philippe le Bel issued several prohibitory enactments also in the interest of home commerce and local industry which Louis X confirmed Philippe le Long attempted even to outdo the judicious efforts of Louis XI and tried though unsuccessfully to establish a uniformity in the weights and measures throughout the kingdom a reform however which was never accomplished until the revolution of seventeen eighty nine It is difficult to credit how many different weights and measures were in use at that time each one varying according to local custom or the choice of the lord of the soil who probably in some way profited by the confusion which this uncertain state of things must have produced The fraud and errors to which this led may easily be imagined particularly in the intercourse between one part of the country and another The feudal stamp is here thoroughly exhibited as M Charles de Grandmaison remarks Nothing is fixed nothing is uniform everything is special and arbitrary settled by the lord of the soil by virtue of his right of justesse by which he undertook the regulation and superintendence of the weights and measures in use in his lordship Measures of length and contents often differed much from one another although they might be similarly named and it would require very complicated comparative tables approximately to fix their value The pied de roi was from ten to twelve inches and was the least varying measure The fathom differed much in different parts and in the attempt to determine the relations between the innumerable measures of contents which we find recorded a knowledge of which must have been necessary for the commerce of the period we are stopped by a labyrinth of incomprehensible calculations which it is impossible to determine with any degree of certainty The weights were more uniform and less uncertain The pound was everywhere in use but it was not everywhere of the same standard Fig two hundred one For instance at Paris it weighed sixteen ounces whereas at Lyons it only weighed fourteen and in weighing silk fifteen ounces to the pound was the rule At Toulouse and in Upper Languedoc the pound was only thirteen and a half ounces at Marseilles thirteen ounces and at other places it even fell to twelve ounces There was in Paris a public scale called poids du roi but this scale though a most important means of revenue was a great hindrance to retail trade In spite of these petty and irritating impediments the commerce of France extended throughout the whole world Illustration Fig one hundred ninety seven View of Lubeck and its Harbour Sixteenth Century From a Copper plate in the Work of P Bertius Commentaria Rerum Germanicarum in fourto Amsterdam sixteen sixteen The compass known in Italy as early as the twelfth century but little used until the fourteenth enabled the mercantile navy to discover new routes and it was thus that true maritime commerce may be said regularly to have begun The sailors of the Mediterranean with the help of this little instrument dared to pass the Straits of Gibraltar and to venture on the ocean From that moment commercial intercourse which had previously only existed by land and that with great difficulty was permanently established between the northern and southern harbours of Europe Flanders was the central port for merchant vessels which arrived in great numbers from the Mediterranean and Bruges became the principal depot The Teutonic league the origin of which dates from the thirteenth century and which formed the most powerful confederacy recorded in history also sent innumerable vessels from its harbours of Lubeck Fig one hundred ninety seven and Hamburg These carried the merchandise of the northern countries into Flanders and this rich province which excelled in every branch of industry and especially in those relating to metals and weaving became the great market of Europe Fig one hundred ninety eight The commercial movement formerly limited to the shores of the Mediterranean extended to all parts and gradually became universal The northern states shared in it and England which for a long time kept aloof from a stage on which it was destined to play the first part began to give indications of its future commercial greatness The number of transactions increased as the facility for carrying them on became greater Consumption being extended production progressively followed and so commerce went on gaining strength as it widened its sphere Everything in fact seemed to contribute to its expansion The downfall of the feudal system and the establishment in each country of a central power more or less strong and respected enabled it to extend its operations by land with a degree of security hitherto unknown and at the same time international legislation came in to protect maritime trade which was still exposed to great dangers The sea which was open freely to the whole human race gave robbers comparatively easy means of following their nefarious practices and with less fear of punishment than they could obtain on the shore of civilised countries For this reason piracy continued its depredations long after the enactment of severe laws for its suppression This maritime legislation did not wait for the sixteenth century to come into existence Maritime law was promulgated more or less in the twelfth century but the troubles and agitations which weakened and disorganized empires during that period of the Middle Ages deprived it of its power and efficiency The Code des Rhodiens dates as far back as eleven sixty seven the Code de la Mer which became a sort of recognised text book dates from the same period the Lois d Oleron is anterior to the twelfth century and ruled the western coasts of France being also adopted in Flanders and in England Venice dated her most ancient law on maritime rights from twelve fifty five and the Statutes of Marseilles date from twelve fifty four Illustration Fig one hundred ninety eight Execution of the celebrated pirate Stoertebeck and his seventy accomplices in fourteen oh two at Hamburg From a popular Picture of the end of the Sixteenth Century Hamburg Library The period of the establishment of commercial law and justice corresponds with that of the introduction of national and universal codes of law and consular jurisdiction These may be said to have originated in the sixth century in the laws of the Visigoths which empowered foreign traders to be judged by delegates from their own countries The Venetians had consuls in the Greek empire as early as the tenth century and we may fairly presume that the French had consuls in Palestine during the reign of Charlemagne In the thirteenth century the towns of Italy had consular agents in France and Marseilles had them in Savoy in Arles and in Genoa Thus traders of each country were always sure of finding justice assistance and protection in all the centres of European commerce Numerous facilities for barter were added to these advantages Merchants who at first travelled with their merchandise and who afterwards merely sent a factor as their representative finally consigned it to foreign agents Communication by correspondence in this way became more general and paper replaced parchment as being less rare and less expensive The introduction of Arabic figures which were more convenient than the Roman numerals for making calculations the establishment of banks of which the most ancient was in operation in Venice as early as the twelfth century the invention of bills of exchange attributed to the Jews and generally in use in the thirteenth century the establishment of insurance against the risks and perils of sea and land and lastly the formation of trading companies or what are now called partnerships all tended to give expansion and activity to commerce whereby public and private wealth was increased in spite of obstacles which routine envy and ill will persistently raised against great commercial enterprises For a long time the French through indolence or antipathy for it was more to their liking to be occupied with arms and chivalry than with matters of interest and profit took but a feeble part in the trade which was carried on so successfully on their own territory The nobles were ashamed to mix in commerce considering it unworthy of them and the bourgeois for want of liberal feeling and expansiveness in their ideas were satisfied with appropriating merely local trade Foreign commerce even of the most lucrative description was handed over to foreigners and especially to Jews who were often banished from the kingdom and as frequently ransomed though universally despised and hated Notwithstanding this they succeeded in rising to wealth under the stigma of shame and infamy and the immense gains which they realised by means of usury reconciled them to and consoled them for the ill treatment to which they were subjected Illustration Fig one hundred ninety nine Discovery of America twelfth of May fourteen ninety two Columbus erects the Cross and baptizes the Isle of Guanahani now Cat Island one of the Bahamas by the Christian Name of saint Salvador From a Stamp engraved on Copper by Th de Bry in the Collection of Grands Voyages in folio fifteen ninety At a very early period and especially when the Jews had been absolutely expelled the advantage of exclusively trading with and securing the rich profits from France had attracted the Italians who were frequently only Jews in disguise concealing themselves as to their character under the generic name of Lombards It was under this name that the French kings gave them on different occasions various privileges when they frequented the fairs of Champagne and came to establish themselves in the inland and seaport towns These Italians constituted the great corporation of money changers in Paris and hoarded in their coffers all the coin of the kingdom and in this way caused a perpetual variation in the value of money by which they themselves benefited In the sixteenth century the wars of Italy rather changed matters and we find royal and important concessions increasing in favour of Castilians and other Spaniards whom the people maliciously called negroes and who had emigrated in order to engage in commerce and manufactures in Saintonge Normandy Burgundy Agenois and Languedoc About the time of Louis XI the French becoming more alive to their true interests began to manage their own affairs following the suggestions and advice of the King whose democratic instincts prompted him to encourage and favour the bourgeois This result was also attributable to the state of peace and security which then began to exist in the kingdom impoverished and distracted as it had been by a hundred years of domestic and foreign warfare From thirteen sixty five to thirteen eighty two factories and warehouses were founded by Norman navigators on the western coast of Africa in Senegal and Guinea Numerous fleets of merchantmen of great size for those days were employed in transporting cloth grain of all kinds knives brandy salt and other merchandise which were bartered for leather ivory gum amber and gold dust Considerable profits were realised by the shipowners and merchants who like Jacques Coeur employed ships for the purpose of carrying on these large and lucrative commercial operations These facts sufficiently testify the condition of France at this period and prove that this like other branches of human industry was arrested in its expansion by the political troubles which followed in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries Fortunately these social troubles were not universal and it was just at the period when France was struggling and had become exhausted and impoverished that the Portuguese extended their discoveries on the same coast of Africa and soon after succeeded in rounding the Cape of Good Hope and opening a new maritime road to India a country which was always attractive from the commercial advantages which it offered Some years after Christopher Columbus the Genoese more daring and more fortunate still guided by the compass and impelled by his own genius discovered a new continent the fourth continent of the world Fig one hundred ninety nine This unexpected event the greatest and most remarkable of the age necessarily enlarged the field for produce as well as for consumption to an enormous extent and naturally added not only to the variety and quantity of exchangeable wares but also to the production of the precious metals and brought about a complete revolution in the laws of the whole civilised world Maritime commerce immediately acquired an extraordinary development and merchants forsaking the harbours of the Mediterranean and even those of the Levant which then seemed to them scarcely worthy of notice sent their vessels by thousands upon the ocean in pursuit of the wonderful riches of the New World The day of caravans and coasting had passed Venice had lost its splendour the sway of the Mediterranean was over the commerce of the world was suddenly transferred from the active and industrious towns of that sea which had so long monopolized it to the Western nations to the Portuguese and Spaniards first and then to the Dutch and English France absorbed in and almost ruined by civil war and above all by religious dissensions only played a subordinate part in this commercial and pacific revolution although it has been said that the sailors of Dieppe and Honfleur really discovered America before Columbus Nevertheless the kings of France Louis XII Francis I and Henry II tried to establish and encourage transatlantic voyages and to create in the interest of French commerce colonies on the coasts of the New World from Florida and Virginia to Canada But these colonies had but a precarious and transitory existence fisheries alone succeeded and French commerce continued insignificant circumscribed and domestic notwithstanding the increasing requirements of luxury at court This luxury contented itself with the use of the merchandise which arrived from the Low Countries Spain and Italy National industry did all in its power to surmount this ignominious condition she specially turned her attention to the manufacture of silks and of stuffs tissued with gold and silver The only practical attempt of the government in the sixteenth century to protect commerce and manufactures was to forbid the import of foreign merchandise and to endeavour to oppose the progress of luxury by rigid enactments Certainly the government of that time little understood the advantages which a country derived from commerce when it forbade the higher classes from engaging in mercantile pursuits under penalty of having their privileges of nobility withdrawn from them In the face of the examples of Italy Genoa Venice and especially of Florence where the nobles were all traders or sons of traders the kings of the line of Valois thought proper to make this enactment The desire seemed to be to make the merchant class a separate class stationary and consisting exclusively of bourgeois shut up in their counting houses and prevented in every way from participating in public life The merchants became indignant at this banishment and in order to employ their leisure they plunged with all their energy into the sanguinary struggles of Reform and of the League Illustration Fig two hundred Medal to commemorate the Association of the Merchants of the City of Rouen It was not until the reign of Henry IV that they again confined themselves to their occupations as merchants when Sully published the political suggestions of his master for renewing commercial prosperity From this time a new era commenced in the commercial destiny of France Commerce fostered and protected by statesmen sought to extend its operations with greater freedom and power Companies were formed at Paris Marseilles Lyons and Rouen to carry French merchandise all over the world and the rules of the mercantile associations in spite of the routine and jealousies which guided the trade corporations became the code which afterwards regulated commerce Fig two hundred Illustration Fig two hundred one Standard Weight in Brass of the Fish market at Mans Sign of the Syren End of the Sixteenth Century Guilds and Trade

properly so called Etienne Boileau s Book of Trades or the First Code of Regulations The Laws governing Trades Public and Private Organization of Trade Corporations and other Communities Energy of the Corporations Masters Journeymen Supernumeraries and Apprentices Religious Festivals and Trade Societies Trade Unions Learned authorities have frequently discussed without agreeing on the question of the origin of the Corporations of the Middle Ages It may be admitted we think a priori that associations of artisans were as ancient as the trades themselves It may readily be imagined that the numerous members of the industrial classes having to maintain and defend their common rights and common interests would have sought to establish mutual fraternal associations among themselves The deeper we dive into ancient history the clearer we perceive traces more or less distinct of these kinds of associations To cite only two examples which may serve to some extent as an historical parallel to the analogous institutions of the present day we may mention the Roman Colleges which were really leagues of artisans following the same calling and the Scandinavian guilds whose object was to assimilate the different branches of industry and trade either of a city or of some particular district Indeed brotherhoods amongst the labouring classes always existed under the German conquerors from the moment when Europe so long divided into Roman provinces shook off the yoke of subjection to Rome although she still adhered to the laws and customs of the nation which had held her in subjection for so many generations We can however only regard the few traces which remain of these brotherhoods as evidence of their having once existed and not as indicative of their having been in a flourishing state In the fifth century the Hermit Ampelius in his Legends of the Saints mentions Consuls or Chiefs of Locksmiths The Corporation of Goldsmiths is spoken of as existing in the first dynasty of the French kings Bakers are named collectively in six hundred thirty in the laws of Dagobert which seems to show that they formed a sort of trade union at that remote period We also see Charlemagne in several of his statutes taking steps in order that the number of persons engaged in providing food of different kinds should everywhere be adequate to provide for the necessities of consumption which would tend to show a general organization of that most important branch of industry In Lombardy colleges of artisans were established at an early period and were no doubt on the model of the Roman ones Ravenna in nine hundred forty three possessed a College of Fishermen and ten years later the records of that town mention a Chief of the Corporation of Traders and in ten oh one a Chief of the Corporation of Butchers France at the same time kept up a remembrance of the institutions of Roman Gaul and the ancient colleges of trades still formed associations and companies in Paris and in the larger towns In ten sixty one King Philip I granted certain privileges to Master Chandlers and Oilmen The ancient customs of the butchers are mentioned as early as the time of Louis VII eleven sixty two The same king granted to the wife of Ives Laccobre and her heirs the collectorship of the dues which were payable by tanners purse makers curriers and shoemakers Under Philip Augustus similar concessions became more frequent and it is evident that at that time trade was beginning to take root and to require special and particular administration This led to regulations being drawn up for each trade to which Philip Augustus gave his sanction In eleven eighty two he confirmed the statutes of the butchers and the furriers and drapers also obtained favourable concessions from him According to the learned Augustin Thierry corporations like civic communities were engrafted on previously existing guilds such as on the colleges or corporations of workmen which were of Roman origin In the guild which signifies a banquet at common expense there was a mutual assurance against misfortunes and injuries of all sorts such as fire and shipwreck and also against all lawsuits incurred for offences and crimes even though they were proved against the accused Each of these associations was placed under the patronage of a god or of a hero and had its compulsory statutes each had its chief or president chosen from among the members and a common treasury supplied by annual contributions Roman colleges as we have already stated were established with a more special purpose and were more exclusively confined to the peculiar trade to which they belonged but these equally with the guilds possessed a common exchequer enjoyed equal rights and privileges elected their own presidents and celebrated in common their sacrifices festivals and banquets We have therefore good reason for agreeing in the opinion of the celebrated historian who considers that in the establishment of a corporation the guild should be to a certain degree the motive power and the Roman college with its organization the material which should be used to bring it into existence Illustration Fig two hundred two Craftsmen in the Fourteenth Century Fac simile of a Miniature of a Manuscript in the Library of Brussels It is certain however that during several centuries corporations were either dissolved or hidden from public notice for they almost entirely disappeared from the historic records during the partial return to barbarism when the production of objects of daily necessity and the preparation of food were entrusted to slaves under the eye of their master Not till the twelfth century did they again begin to flourish and as might be supposed it was Italy which gave the signal for the resuscitation of the institutions whose birthplace had been Rome and which barbarism had allowed to fall into decay Brotherhoods of artisans were also founded at an early period in the north of Gaul whence they rapidly spread beyond the Rhine Under the Emperor Henry I that is during the tenth century the ordinary condition of artisans in Germany was still serfdom but two centuries later the greater number of trades in most of the large towns of the empire had congregated together in colleges or bodies under the name of unions Einnungen or Innungen Fig two hundred two as for example at Gozlar at Wuerzburg at Brunswick c These colleges however were not established without much difficulty and without the energetic resistance of the ruling powers inasmuch as they often raised their pretensions so high as to wish to substitute their authority for the senatorial law and thus to grasp the government of the cities The thirteenth century witnessed obstinate and sanguinary feuds between these two parties each of which was alternately victorious Whichever had the upper hand took advantage of the opportunity to carry out the most cruel reprisals against its defeated opponents The Emperors Frederick II and Henry VII tried to put an end to these strifes by abolishing the corporations of workmen but these powerful associations fearlessly opposed the imperial authority In France the organization of communities of artisans an organization which in many ways was connected with the commercial movement but which must not be confounded with it did not give rise to any political difficulty It seems not even to have met with any opposition from the feudal powers who no doubt found it an easy pretext for levying additional rates and taxes The most ancient of these corporations was the Parisian Hanse or corporation of the bourgeois for canal navigation which probably dates its origin back to the college of Parisian Nautes existing before the Roman conquest This mercantile association held its meetings in the island of Lutetia on the very spot where the church of Notre Dame was afterwards built From the earliest days of monarchy tradesmen constituted entirely the bourgeois of the towns Fig two hundred three Above them were the nobility or clergy beneath them the artisans Hence we can understand how the bourgeois who during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries were a distinct section of the community became at last the important commercial body itself The kings invariably treated them with favour Louis VI granted them new rights Louis VII confirmed their ancient privileges and Philip Augustus increased them The Parisian Hanse succeeded in monopolising all the commerce which was carried on by water on the Seine and the Yonne between Mantes and Auxerre No merchandise coming up or down the stream in boats could be disembarked in the interior of Paris without becoming as it were the property of the corporation which through its agents superintended its measurement and its sale in bulk and up to a certain point its sale by retail No foreign merchant was permitted to send his goods to Paris without first obtaining lettres de Hanse whereby he had associated with him a bourgeois of the town who acted as his guarantee and who shared in his profits Illustration Fig two hundred three Merchants or Tradesmen of the Fourteenth Century Fac simile of a Miniature in a Manuscript of the Library at Brussels There were associations of the same kind in most of the commercial towns situated on the banks of rivers and on the sea coast as for example at Rouen Arles Marseilles Narbonne Toulouse Ratisbon Augsburg and Utrecht Sometimes neighbouring towns such as the great manufacturing cities of Flanders agreed together and entered into a leagued bond which gave them greater power and constituted an offensive and defensive compact Fig two hundred four A typical example of this last institution is that of the commercial association of the Hanseatic Towns of Germany which were grouped together to the number of eighty around their four capitals viz Lubeck Cologne Dantzic and Brunswick Illustration Fig two hundred four Seal of the United Trades of Ghent End of the Fifteenth Century Although as we have already seen previous to the thirteenth century many of the corporations of artisans had been authorised by several of the kings of France to make special laws whereby they might govern themselves it was really only from the reign of saint Louis that the first general measures of administration and police relating to these communities can be dated The King appointed Etienne Boileau a rich bourgeois provost of the capital in twelve sixty one to set to work to establish order wise administration and good faith in the commerce of Paris To this end he ascertained from the verbal testimony of the senior members of each corporation the customs and usages of the various crafts which for the most part up to that time had not been committed to writing He arranged and probably amended them in many ways and thus composed the famous Book of Trades which as M Depping the able editor of this valuable compilation first published in eighteen thirty seven says has the advantage of being to a great extent the genuine production of the corporations themselves and not a list of rules established and framed by the municipal or judicial authorities From that time corporations gradually introduced themselves into the order of society The royal decrees in their favour were multiplied and the regulations with regard to mechanical trades daily improved not only in Paris and in the provinces and also abroad both in the south and in the north of Europe especially in Italy Germany England and the Low Countries Figs two hundred five to two hundred thirteen Etienne Boileau s Book of Trades contained the rules of one hundred different trade associations It must be observed however that several of the most important trades such as the butchers tanners glaziers c were omitted either because they neglected to be registered at the Chatelet where the inquiry superintended by Boileau was made or because some private interest induced them to keep aloof from this registration which probably imposed some sort of fine and a tax upon them In the following century the number of trade associations considerably increased and wonderfully so during the reigns of the last of the Valois and the first of the Bourbons The historian of the antiquities of Paris Henry Sauval enumerated no fewer than fifteen hundred and fifty one trade associations in the capital alone in the middle of the seventeenth century It must be remarked however that the societies of artisans were much subdivided owing to the simple fact that each craft could only practise its own special work Thus in Boileau s book we find four different corporations of patenotriers or makers of chaplets six of hatters six of weavers c Besides these societies of artisans there were in Paris a few privileged corporations which occupied a more important position and were known under the name of Corps des Marchands Their number at first frequently varied but finally it was settled at six and they were termed les Six Corps They comprised the drapers which always took precedence of the five others the grocers the mercers the furriers the hatters and the goldsmiths These five for a long time disputed the question of precedence and finally they decided the matter by lot as they were not able to agree in any other way Illustration Fig two

these six bodies of merchants exclusively enjoyed of being called upon to appear though at their own expense in the civic processions and at the public ceremonials and to carry the canopy over the heads of kings queens or princes on their state entry into the capital Fig two hundred thirty four it would be difficult to specify the nature of the privileges which were granted to them and of which they were so jealous It is clear however that these six bodies were imbued with a kind of aristocratic spirit which made them place trading much above handicraft in their own class and set a high value on their calling as merchants Thus contemporary historians tell us that any merchant who compromised the dignity of the company fell into the class of the lower orders that mercers boasted of excluding from their body the upholsterers who were but artisans that hatters who were admitted into the Six Corps to replace one of the other trades became in consequence merchants instead of artisans which they had been up to that time Notwithstanding the statutes so carefully compiled and revised by Etienne Boileau and his successors and in spite of the numerous arbitrary rules which the sovereigns the magistrates and the corporations themselves strenuously endeavoured to frame order and unity were far from governing the commerce and industry of Paris during the Middle Ages and what took place in Paris generally repeated itself elsewhere Serious disputes continually arose between the authorities and those amenable to their jurisdiction and between the various crafts themselves notwithstanding the relation which they bore to each other from the similarity of their employments In fact in this as in many other matters social disorder often emanated from the powers whose duty it was in the first instance to have repressed it Thus at the time when Philip Augustus extended the boundaries of his capital so as to include the boroughs in it which until then had been separated from the city the lay and clerical lords under whose feudal dominion those districts had hitherto been placed naturally insisted upon preserving all their rights So forcibly did they do this that the King was obliged to recognise their claims and in several boroughs including the Bourg l Abbe the Beau Bourg the Bourg saint Germain and the Bourg Auxerrois c there were trade associations completely distinct from and independent of those of ancient Paris If we simply limit our examination to that of the condition of the trade associations which held their authority immediately from royalty we still see that the causes of confusion were by no means trifling for the majority of the high officers of the crown acting as delegates of the royal authority were always disputing amongst themselves the right of superintending protecting judging punishing and above all of exacting tribute from the members of the various trades The King granted to various officers the privilege of arbitrarily disposing of the freedom of each trade for their own profit and thereby gave them power over all the merchants and craftsmen who were officially connected with them not only in Paris but also throughout the whole kingdom Thus the lord chamberlain had jurisdiction over the drapers mercers furriers shoemakers tailors and other dealers in articles of wearing apparel the barbers were governed by the king s varlet and barber the head baker was governor over the bakers and the head butler over the wine merchants Illustration Fig two hundred thirty four Group of Goldsmiths preceding the Chasse de saint Marcel in the Reign of Louis XIII From a Copper plate of the Period Cabinet of Stamps in the National Library of Paris These state officers granted freedoms to artisans or in other words they gave them the right to exercise such and such a craft with assistants or companions exacting for the performance of this trifling act a very considerable tax And as they preferred receiving their revenues without the annoyance of having direct communication with their humble subjects they appointed deputies who were authorised to collect them in their names The most celebrated of these deputies were the rois des merciers who lived on the fat of the land in complete idleness and who were surrounded by a mercantile court which appeared in all its splendour at the trade festivals Illustration Fig two hundred thirty five Banner of the Corporation of the United Boot and Shoe Makers of Issoudun The great officers of the crown exercised in their own interests and without a thought for the public advantage a complete magisterial jurisdiction over all crafts they adjudicated in disputes arising between masters and men decided quarrels visited either personally or through their deputies the houses of the merchants in order to discover frauds or infractions in the rules of the trade and levied fines accordingly We must remember that the collectors of court dues had always to contend for the free exercise of their jurisdiction against the provost of Paris who considered their acquisitions of authority as interfering with his personal prerogatives and who therefore persistently opposed them on all occasions For instance if the head baker ordered an artisan of the same trade to be imprisoned in the Chatelet the high provost who was governor of the prison released him immediately and in retaliation if the high provost punished a baker the chief baker warmly espoused his subordinate s cause At other times the artisans if they were dissatisfied with the deputy appointed by the great officer of the crown whose dependents they were would refuse to recognise his authority In this way constant quarrels and interminable lawsuits occurred and it is easy to understand the disorder which must have arisen from such a state of things By degrees however and in consequence of the new tendencies of royalty which were simply directed to the diminution of feudal power the numerous jurisdictions relating to the various trades gradually returned to the hand of the municipal provostship and this concentration of power had the best results as well for the public good as for that of the corporations themselves Having examined into corporations collectively and also into their general administration we will now turn to consider their internal organization It was only after long and difficult struggles that these trade associations succeeded in taking a definite and established position without however succeeding at any time in organizing themselves as one body on the same basis and with the same privileges Therefore in pointing out the influential character of these institutions generally we must omit various matters specially connected with individual associations which it would be impossible to mention in this brief sketch In the fourteenth century the period when the communities of crafts were at the height of their development and power no association of artisans could legally exist without a license either from the king the lord the prince the abbot the bailiff or the mayor of the district in which it proposed to establish itself

ceremonials by their liveries or special dress as well as by their arms and banners Figs two hundred thirty five to two hundred forty one They possessed the right freely to discuss their general interests and at meetings composed of all their members they might modify their statutes provided that such changes were confirmed by the King or by the authorities It was also necessary that these meetings at which the royal delegates were present should be duly authorised and lastly so as to render the communication between members more easy and to facilitate everything which concerned the interests of the craft artisans of the same trade usually resided in the same quarter of the town and even in the same street The names of many streets in Paris and other towns of France testify to this custom which still partially exists in the towns of Germany and Italy Illustration Fig two hundred forty two Ceremonial Dress of an Elder and a Juror of the Corporation of Old Shoemakers of Ghent The communities of artisans had to a certain extent the character and position of private individuals They had the power in their corporate capacity of holding and administrating property of defending or bringing actions at law of accepting inheritances c they disbursed from a common treasury which was supplied by legacies donations fines and periodical subscriptions These communities exercised in addition through their jurors a magisterial authority and even under some circumstances a criminal jurisdiction over their members For a long time they strove to extend this last power or to keep it independent of municipal control and the supreme courts by which it was curtailed to that of exercising a simple police authority strictly confined to persons or things relating to the craft They carefully watched for any infractions of the rules of the trade They acted as arbitrators between master and man particularly in quarrels when the parties had had recourse to violence The functions of this kind of domestic magistracy were exercised by officers known under various names such as kings masters elders guards syndics and jurors who were besides charged to visit the workshops at any hour they pleased in order to see that the laws concerning the articles of workmanship were observed They also received the taxes for the benefit of the association and lastly they examined the apprentices and installed masters into their office Fig two hundred forty two The jurors or syndics as they were more usually called and whose number varied according to the importance of numerical force of the corporation were generally elected by the majority of votes of their fellow workmen though sometimes the choice of these was entirely in the hands of the great officers of state It was not unfrequent to find women amongst the dignitaries of the arts and crafts and the professional tribunals which decided every question relative to the community and its members were often held by an equal number of masters and associate craftsmen The jealous exclusive and inflexible spirit of caste which in the Middle Ages is to be seen almost everywhere formed one of the principal features of industrial associations The admission of new members was surrounded with conditions calculated to restrict the number of associates and to discourage candidates The sons of masters alone enjoyed hereditary privileges in consequence of which they were always allowed to be admitted without being subjected to the tyrannical yoke of the association Illustration Martyrdom of SS Crispin and Crepinien From a window in the Hopital des Quinze Vingts Fifteenth Century Generally the members of a corporation were divided into three distinct classes the masters the paid assistants or companions and the apprentices Apprenticeship from which the sons of masters were often exempted began between the ages of twelve and seventeen years and lasted from two to five years In most of the trades the master could only receive one apprentice in his house besides his own son Tanners dyers and goldsmiths were allowed one of their relatives in addition or a second apprentice if they had no relation willing to learn their trade and although some commoner trades such as butchers and bakers were allowed an unlimited number of apprentices the custom of restriction had become a sort of general law with the object of limiting the number of masters and workmen to the requirements of the public The position of paid assistant or companion was required to be held in many trades for a certain length of time before promotion to mastership could be obtained Illustration Fig two hundred forty three Bootmaker s Apprentice working at a Trial piece From a Window of the Thirteenth Century published by Messrs Cahier and Martin When apprentices or companions wished to become masters they were called aspirants and were subjected to successive examinations They were particularly required to prove their ability by executing what was termed a chef d oeuvre which consisted in fabricating a perfect specimen of whatever craft they practised The execution of the chef d oeuvre gave rise to many technical formalities which were at times most frivolous The aspirant in certain cases had to pass a technical examination as for instance the barber in forging and polishing lancets the wool weaver in making and adjusting the different parts of his loom and during the period of executing the chef d oeuvre which often extended over several months the aspirant was deprived of all communication with his fellows He had to work at the office of the association which was called the bureau under the eyes of the jurors or syndics who often after an angry debate issued their judgment upon the merits of the work and the capability of the workman Figs two hundred forty three and two hundred forty four Illustration Fig two hundred forty four Carpenter s Apprentice working at a Trial piece From one of the Stalls called Misericordes in Rouen Cathedral Fifteenth Century On his admission the aspirant had first to take again the oath of allegiance to the King before the provost or civil deputy although he had already done so on commencing his apprenticeship He then had to pay a duty or fee which was divided between the sovereign or lord and the brotherhood from which fee the sons of masters always obtained a considerable abatement Often too the husbands of the daughters of masters were exempted from paying the duties A few masters such as the goldsmiths and the cloth workers had besides to pay a sum of money by way of guarantee which remained in the funds of the craft as long as they carried on the trade After these forms had been complied with the masters acquired the exclusive privilege of freely exercising their profession There were however certain exceptions to this rule for a king on his coronation a prince or princess of the royal blood at the time of his or her marriage and in certain towns the bishop on his installation had the right of creating one or more masters in each trade and these received their licence without going through any of the usual formalities

however was that he or she did not contract a second marriage with any one who did not belong to the craft Masters lost their rights directly they worked for any other master and received wages Certain freedoms too were only available in the towns in which they had been obtained In more than one craft when a family holding the freedom became extinct their premises and tools became the property of the corporation subject to an indemnity payable to the next of kin Illustration Fig two hundred forty six Shops under Covered Market Goldsmith Dealer in Stuffs and Shoemaker From a Miniature in Aristotle s Ethics and Politics translated by Nicholas Oresme Manuscript of the Fifteenth Century Library of Rouen At times and particularly in those trades where the aspirants were not required to produce a chef d oeuvre the installation of masters was accompanied with extraordinary ceremonies which no doubt originally possessed some symbolical meaning but which having lost their true signification became singular and appeared even ludicrous Thus with the bakers after four years apprenticeship the candidate on purchasing the freedom from the King issued from his door escorted by all the other bakers of the town bearing a new pot filled with walnuts and wafers On arriving before the chief of the corporation he said to him Master I have accomplished my four years here is my pot filled with walnuts and wafers The assistants in the ceremony having vouched for the truth of this statement the candidate broke the pot against the wall and the chief solemnly pronounced his admission which was inaugurated by the older masters emptying a number of tankards of wine or beer at the expense of their new brother The ceremony was also of a jovial character in the case of the millwrights who only admitted the candidate after he had received a caning on the shoulders from the last elected brother Illustration Fig two hundred forty seven Fac simile of the first six Lines on the Copper Tablet on which was engraved from the year fourteen seventy the Names and Titles of those who were elected Members of the Corporation of Goldsmiths of Ghent The statutes of the corporations which had the force of law on account of being approved and accepted by royal authority almost always detailed with the greatest precision the conditions of labour They fixed the hours and days for working the size of the articles to be made the quality of the stuffs used in their manufacture and even the price at which they were to be sold Fig two hundred forty six Night labour was pretty generally forbidden as likely to produce only imperfect work We nevertheless find that carpenters were permitted to make coffins and other funeral articles by night On the eve of religious feasts the shops were shut earlier than usual that is to say at three o clock and were not opened on the next day with the exception of those of pastrycooks whose assistance was especially required on feast days and who sold curious varieties of cakes and sweetmeats Notwithstanding the strictness of the rules and the administrative laws of each trade which were intended to secure good faith and loyalty between the various members it is unnecessary to state that they were frequently violated The fines which were then imposed on delinquents constituted an important source of revenue not only to the corporations themselves but also to the town treasury The penally however was not always a pecuniary one for as late as the fifteenth century we have instances of artisans being condemned to death simply for having adulterated their articles of trade Illustration Fig two hundred forty eight Elder and Jurors of the Tanners of the Town of Ghent in Ceremonial Dress Fac simile of a Miniature in a Manuscript of the Fifteenth Century This deception was looked upon as of the nature of robbery which we know to have been for a long time punishable by death Robbery on the part of merchants found no indulgence nor pardon in those days and the whole corporation demanded immediate and exemplary justice According to the statutes which generally tended to prevent frauds and falsifications in most crafts the masters were bound to put their trade mark on their goods or some particular sign which was to be a guarantee for the purchaser and one means of identifying the culprit in the event of complaints arising on account of the bad quality or bad workmanship of the articles sold Illustration Fig two hundred forty nine Companion Carpenter Fragment of a Woodcut of the Fifteenth Century after a Drawing by Wohlgemueth for the Chronique de Nuremberg Besides taking various steps to maintain professional integrity the framers of the various statutes as a safeguard to the public interests undertook also to inculcate morality and good feeling amongst their members A youth could not be admitted unless he could prove his legitimacy of birth by his baptismal register and to obtain the freedom he was bound to bear an irreproachable character Artisans exposed themselves to a reprimand and even to bodily chastisement from the corporation for even associating with and certainly for working or drinking with those who had been expelled Licentiousness and misconduct of any kind rendered them liable to be deprived of their mastership In some trade associations all the members were bound to solemnize the day of the decease of a brother to assist at his funeral and to follow him to the grave In another community the slightest indecent or discourteous word was punishable by a fine A new master could not establish himself in the same street as his former master except at a distance which was determined by the statutes and further no member was allowed to ask for or attract customers when the latter were nearer the shop of his neighbour than of his own In the Middle Ages religion placed its stamp on every occupation and calling and corporations were careful to maintain this characteristic feature Each was under the patronage of some saint who was considered the special protector of the craft each possessed a shrine or chapel in some church of the quarter where the trade was located and some even kept chaplains at their own expense for the celebration of masses which were daily said for the souls of the good deceased members of the craft These associations animated by Christian charity took upon them to invoke the blessings of heaven on all members of the fraternity and to assist those who were either laid by through sickness or want of work and to take care of the widows and to help the orphans of the less prosperous craftsmen They also gave alms to the poor and presented the broken meat left at their banquets to the hospitals Under the name of garcons or compagnons de devoir this surname was at first specially applied to carpenters and masons who from a very ancient date formed an important association which was partly secret and from which Freemasonry traces its origin Fig two hundred fifty the companions notwithstanding that they belonged to the community of their own special craft also formed distinct corporations among themselves with a view to mutual assistance They made a point of visiting any foreign workman on his arrival in their town supplied his first requirements found him work and when work was wanting the oldest companion gave up his place to him These associations of companionship however soon failed to carry out the noble object for which they were instituted After a time the meeting together of the fraternity was but a pretext for intemperance and debauchery and at times their tumultuous processions and indecent masquerades occasioned much disorder in the cities The facilities which these numerous associations possessed of extending and mutually company operating with one another also led to coalitions among them for the purpose of securing any advantage which they desired to possess Sometimes open violence was resorted to to obtain their exorbitant and unjust demands which greatly excited the industrious classes and eventually induced the authorities to interfere Lastly these brotherhoods gave rise to many violent quarrels which ended in blows and too often in bloodshed between workmen of the same craft who took different views on debateable points The decrees of parliament the edicts of sovereigns and the decisions of councils as early as at the end of the fifteenth century and throughout the whole of the sixteenth severely proscribed the doings of these brotherhoods but these interdictions were never duly and rigidly enforced and the authorities themselves often tolerated infractions of the law and thus license was given to every kind of abuse Illustration Fig two hundred fifty Carpenters Fac simile of a Miniature in the Chroniques de Hainaut Manuscript of the Fifteenth Century in the Burgundy Library Brussels We have frequently mentioned in the course of this volume the political part played by the corporations during the Middle Ages We know the active and important part taken by trades of all descriptions in France in the great movement of the formation of communities The spirit of fraternal association which constituted the strength of the corporations Fig two hundred fifty one and which exhibited itself so conspicuously in every act of their public and private life resisted during several centuries the individual and collective attacks made on it by craftsmen themselves These rich and powerful corporations began to decline from the moment they ceased to be united and they were dissolved by law at the beginning of the revolution of seventeen eighty nine an act which necessarily dealt a heavy blow to industry and commerce Illustration Fig two hundred fifty one Painting commemorative of the Union of the Merchants of Rouen at the End of the Seventeenth Century Illustration Fig two hundred fifty two Banner of the

VI Charles VII and Jacques Coeur Changes in Taxation from Louis XI to Francis I The great Financiers Florimond Robertet If we believe Caesar s Commentaries on the Gallic War the Gauls were groaning in his time under the pressure of taxation and struggled hard to remove it Rome lightened their burden but the fiscal system of the metropolis imperceptibly took root in all the Roman provinces There was an arbitrary personal tax called the poll tax and a land tax which was named cens calculated according to the area of the holding Besides these there were taxes on articles of consumption on salt on the import and export of all articles of merchandise on sales by auction also on marriages on burials and on houses There were also legacy and succession duties and taxes on slaves according to their number Tolls on highways were also created and the treasury went so far as to tax the hearth Hence the origin of the name feu which was afterwards applied to each household or family group assembled in the same house or sitting before the same fire A number of other taxes sprung up called sordides from which the nobility and the government functionaries were exempt This ruinous system of taxation rendered still more insupportable by the exactions of the proconsuls and the violence of their subordinates went on increasing down to the time of the fall of the Roman Empire The Middle Ages gave birth to a new order of things The municipal administration composed in great part of Gallo Roman citizens did not perceptibly deviate from the customs established for five centuries but each invading nation by degrees introduced new habits and ideas into the countries they subdued The Germans and Franks having become masters of part of Gaul established themselves on the lands which they had divided between them The great domains with their revenues which had belonged to the emperors naturally became the property of the barbarian chiefs and served to defray the expenses of their houses or their courts These chiefs at each general assembly of the Leudes or great vassals received presents of money of arms of horses and of various objects of home or of foreign manufacture For a long time these gifts were voluntary The territorial fief which was given to those soldlers who had deserved it by their military services involved from the holders a personal service to the King They had to attend him on his journeys to follow him to war and to defend him under all circumstances The fief was entirely exempt from taxes Many misdeeds even robberies and other crimes which were ordinarily punishable by death were pardonable on payment of a proportionate fine and oaths in many cases might be absolved in the same way Thus a large revenue was received which was generally divided equally between the State the procurator fiscal and the King Illustration Fig two hundred fifty three The Extraction of Metals Fac simile of a Woodcut in the Cosmographie Universelle of Munster folio Basle fifteen fifty two War which was almost constant in those turbulent times furnished the barbarian kings with occasional resources which were usually much more important than the ordinary supplies from taxation The first chiefs of the Visigoths the Ostrogoths and the Franks sought means of replenishing their treasuries by their victorious arms Alaric Totila and Clovis thus amassed enormous wealth without troubling themselves to place the government finances on a satisfactory basis We see however a semblance of financial organization in the institutions of Alaric and his successors Subsequently the great Theodoric who had studied the administrative theories of the Byzantine Court exercised his genius in endeavouring to work out an accurate system of finance which was adopted in Italy Gregory of Tours a writer of the sixteenth century relates in several passages of his History of the Franks that they exhibited the same repugnance to compulsory taxation as the Germans of the time of Tacitus The Leudes considered that they owed nothing to the treasury and to force them to submit to taxation was not an easy matter About the year four hundred sixty five Childeric I father of Clovis lost his crown for wishing all classes to submit to taxation equally In six hundred seventy three Childeric II King of Austrasia had one of these Leudes named Bodillon flogged with rods for daring to reproach him with the injustice of certain taxes He however was afterwards assassinated by this same Bodillon and the Leudes maintained their right of immunity A century before the Leudes were already quarrelling with royalty on account of the taxes which they refused to pay and they sacrificed Queen Brunehaut because she attempted to enrich the treasury with the confiscated property of a few nobles who had rebelled against her authority The wealth of the Frank kings which was always very great was a continual object of envy and on one occasion Chilperic I King of Soissons having the Leudes in league with him laid his hands on the wealth amassed by his father Clotaire I which was kept in the Palace of Braine He was nevertheless obliged to share his spoil with his brothers and their followers who came in arms to force him to refund what he had taken Chilperic Fig two hundred fifty four was so much in awe of these Leudes that he did not ask them for money His wife the much feared Fredegonde did not however exempt them more than Brunehaut had done and her judges or ministers Audon and Mummius having met with an insurmountable resistance in endeavouring to force taxation on the nobles nearly lost their lives in consequence Illustration Fig two hundred fifty four Tomb of Chilperic Sculpture of the Eleventh Century in the Abbey of saint Denis The custom of numbering the population such as was carried on in Rome through the censors appears to have been observed under the Merovingian kings At the request of the Bishop of Poitiers Childebert gave orders to amend the census taken under Sigebert King of Austrasia It is a most curious document mentioned by Gregory of Tours The ancient division he says had been one so unequal owing to the subdivision of properties and other changes which time had made in the condition of the taxpayers that the poor the orphans and the helpless classes generally alone bore the real burden of taxation Florentius comptroller of the King s household and Romulfus count of the palace remedied this abuse After a closer examination of the changes which had taken place they relieved the taxpayers who were too heavily rated and placed the burden on those who could better afford it This direct taxation continued on this plan until the time of the kings of the second dynasty The Franks who had not the privilege of exemption paid a poll tax and a house tax about a tenth was charged on the produce of highly cultivated lands a little more on that of lands of an inferior description and a certain measure a cruche of wine on the produce of every half acre of vineyard There were assessors and royal agents charged with levying such taxes and regulating the farming of them In spite of this precaution however an edict of Clovis II in the year six hundred fifteen censures the mode of imposing rates and taxes it orders that they shall only be levied in the places where they have been authorised and forbade their being used under any pretext whatever for any other object than that for which they were imposed Illustration Fig two hundred fifty five Signature of saint Eloy Eligius Financier and Minister to Dagobert I from the Charter of Foundation of the Abbey of Solignac Mabillon Da Re Diplomatica Under the Merovingians specie was not in common use although the precious metals were abundant among the Gauls as their mines of gold and silver were not yet exhausted Money was rarely coined except on great occasions such as a coronation the birth of an heir to the throne the marriage of a prince or the commemoration of a decisive victory It is even probable that each time that money was used in large sums the pound or the sou of gold was represented more by ingots of metal than by stamped coin The third of the sou of gold which was coined on state occasions seems to have been used only as a commemorative medal to be distributed amongst the great officers of state and this circumstance explains their extreme rarity The general character of the coinage whether of gold silver or of the baser metals of the Burgundian Austrasian and Frank kings differs little from what it had been at the time of the last of the Roman emperors though the Angel bearing the cross gradually replaced the Renommee victorieuse formerly stamped on the coins Christian monograms and symbols of the Trinity were often intermingled with the initials of the sovereign It also became common to combine in a monogram letters thought to be sacred or lucky such as C M S T c also to introduce the names of places which perhaps have since disappeared as well as some particular mark or sign special to each mint Some of these are very difficult to understand and present a number of problems which have yet to be solved

the Church with favours and it soon possessed considerable revenues and enjoyed many valuable immunities The sons of Clovis contested these privileges but the Church resisted for a time though she was eventually obliged to give way to the iron hand of Charles Martel In seven hundred thirty two this great military chieftain after his struggle with Rainfroy and after his brilliant victories over the Saxons the Bavarians the Swiss and the Saracens stripped the clergy of their landed possessions in order to distribute them amongst his Leudes who by this means he secured as his creatures and who were therefore ever willing and eager to serve him in arms On ascending the throne King Pepin who wanted to pacify the Church endeavoured as far as possible to obliterate the recollection of the wrongs of which his father had been guilty towards her he ordered the dimes and the nones tenth and ninth denier levied on the value of lands to be placed to the account of the possessors of each ecclesiastical domain on their under taking to repair the buildings churches chateaux abbeys and presbyteries and to restore to the owners the properties on which they held mortgages The nobles long resented this and it required the authority and the example of Charlemagne to soothe the contending parties and to make Church and State act in harmony Charlemagne renounced the arbitrary rights established by the Mayors of the Palace and retained only those which long usage had legitimatised He registered them clearly in a code called the Capitulaires into which he introduced the ancient laws of the Ripuaires the Burgundians and the Franks arranging them so as to suit the organization and requirements of his vast empire From that time each freeman subscribed to the military service according to the amount of his possessions The great vassal or fiscal judge was no longer allowed to practise extortion on those citizens appointed to defend the State Freemen could legally refuse all servile or obligatory work imposed on them by the nobles and the amount of labour to be performed by the serfs was lessened Without absolutely abolishing the authority of local customs in matters of finance or penalties which had been illegally exacted they were suspended by laws decided at the Champs de Mai by the Counts and by the Leudes in presence of the Emperor Arbitrary taxes were abolished as they were no longer required Food and any articles of consumption and military munitions were exempted from taxation and the revenues derived from tolls on road gates on bridges and on city gates c were applied to the purposes for which they were imposed namely to the repair of the roads the bridges and the fortified enclosures The heriban a fine of sixty sols which in those days would amount to more than six thousand francs was imposed on any holder of a fief who refused military service and each noble was obliged to pay this for every one of his vassals who was absent when summoned to the King s banner These fines must have produced considerable sums A special law exempted ecclesiastics from bearing arms and Charlemagne decreed that their possessions should be sacred and untouched and everything was done to ensure the payment of the indemnity dime and none which was due to them Illustration Fig two hundred sixty Toll on Markets levied by a Cleric From one of the Painted Windows of the Cathedral of Tournay Fifteenth Century Charlemagne also superintended the coining and circulation of money He directed that the silver sou should exactly contain the twenty second part by weight of the pound He also directed that money should only be coined in the Imperial palaces He forbade the circulation of spurious coin he ordered base coiners to be severely punished and imposed heavy fines upon those who refused to accept the coin in legal circulation The tithe due to the Church Fig two hundred sixty which was imposed at the National Assembly in seven hundred seventy nine and disbursed by the diocesan bishops gave rise to many complaints and much opposition This tithe was in addition to that paid to the King which was of itself sufficiently heavy The right of claiming the two tithes however had a common origin so that the sovereign defended his own rights in protecting those of the Church This is set forth in the text of the Capitulaires from the year seven hundred ninety four to eight hundred twenty nine What had originally been only a voluntary and pious offering of a few of the faithful says the author of the Histoire Financiere de la France became thus a perpetual tax upon agriculture custom rather than law enforcing its payment and a tithe which was at first limited to the produce of the soil soon extended itself to cattle and other live stock Royal delegates missi dominici who were invested with complex functions and with very extensive power travelled through the empire exercising legal jurisdiction over all matters of importance They assembled all the placites or provincial authorities and inquired particularly into the collection of the public revenue During their tours which took place four times a year they either personally annulled unjust sentences or submitted them to the Emperor They denounced any irregularities on the part of the Counts punished the negligences of their assessors and often in order to replace unworthy judges they had to resort to a system of election of assessors chosen from among the people They verified the returns for the census superintended the keeping up of the royal domains corrected frauds in matters of taxation and punished usurers as much as base coiners for at that time money was not considered a commercial article nor was it thought right that a money lender should be allowed to carry on a trade which required a remuneration proportionate to the risk which he incurred Illustration Fig two hundred sixty one Sale by Town Crier Preco the Crier blowing a trumpet Subhastator public

These missi dominici were too much hated by the great vassals to outlive the introduction of the feudal system Their royal masters as they themselves gradually lost a part of their own privileges and power could not sustain the authority of these officers Dukes counts and barons having become magistrates arbitrarily levied new taxes imposed new fines and appropriated the King s tributes to such an extent that towards the end of the tenth century the laws of Charlemagne had no longer any weight We then find a number of new taxes levied for the benefit of the nobles the very names of which have fallen into disuse with the feudal claims which they represented Among these new taxes were those of escorte and entree of mortmain of lods et ventes of relief the champarts the taille the fouage and the various fees for wine pressing grinding baking c all of which were payable without prejudice to the tithes due to the King and the Church However as the royal tithe was hardly ever paid the kings were obliged to look to other means for replenishing their treasuries and coining false money was a common practice Unfortunately each great vassal vied with the kings in this and to such an extent that the enormous quantity of bad money coined during the ninth century completed the public ruin and made this a sad period of social chaos The freeman was no longer distinguishable from the villain nor the villain from the serf Serfdom was general men found themselves as it were slaves in possession of land which they laboured at with the sweat of their brow only to cultivate for the benefit of others The towns even with the exception of a few privileged cities as Florence Paris Lyons Rheims Metz Strasburg Marseilles Hamburg Frankfort and Milan were under the dominion of some ecclesiastical or lay lord and only enjoyed liberty of a more or less limited character Towards the end of the eleventh century under Philip I the enthusiasm for Crusades became general and as all the nobles joined in the holy mission of freeing the tomb of Jesus Christ from the hands of the infidels large sums of money were required to defray the costs New taxes were accordingly imposed but as these did not produce enough at once large sums were raised by the sale of some of the feudal rights Certain franchises were in this way sold by the nobles to the boroughs towns and abbeys though in not a few instances these very privileges had been formerly plundered from the places to which they were now sold Fines were exacted from any person declining to go to Palestine and foreign merchants especially the Jews were required to subscribe large sums A number of the nobles holding fiefs were reduced to the lowest expedients with a view to raising money and even sold their estates at a low price or mortgaged them to the very Jews whom they taxed so heavily Every town in which the spirit of Gallo Roman municipality was preserved took advantage of these circumstances to extend its liberties Each monarch too found this a favourable opportunity to add new fiefs to the crown and to recall as many great vassals as possible under his dominion It was at this period that communities arose and that the first charters of freedom which were obligatory and binding contracts between the King and the people date their origin Besides the annual fines due to the King and the feudal lords and in addition to the general subsidies such as the quit rent and the tithes these communities had to provide for the repair of the walls or ramparts for the paving of the streets the cleaning of the pits the watch on the city gates and the various expenses of local administration Louis le Gros endeavoured to make a re arrangement of the taxes and to establish them on a definite basis By his orders a new register of the lands throughout the kingdom was commenced but various calamities caused this useful measure to be suspended In eleven forty nine Louis le Jeune in consequence of a disaster which had befallen the Crusaders did what none of his predecessors had dared to attempt he exacted from all his subjects a sol per pound on their income This tax which amounted to a twentieth part of income was paid even by the Church which for example s sake did not take advantage of its immunities Forty years later at a council or great parliament called by Philip Augustus a new crusade was decided upon and under the name of Saladin s tithe an annual tax was imposed on all property whether landed or personal of all who did not take up the cross to go to the Holy Land The nobility however so violently resisted this that the King was obliged to substitute for it a general tax which although it was still more productive was less offensive in its mode of collection On returning to France in eleven ninety one Philip Augustus rated and taxed every one nobility bourgeois and clergy in order to prosecute the great wars in which he was engaged and to provide for the first paid troops ever known in France He began by confirming the enormous confiscations of the properties of the Jews who had been banished from the kingdom and afterwards sold a temporary permission to some of the richest of them to return The Jews at that time were the only possessors of available funds as they were the only people who trafficked and who lent money on interest On this account the Government were glad to recall them so as to have at hand a valuable resource which it could always make use of As the King could not on his own authority levy taxes upon the vassals of feudal lords on emergencies he convoked the barons who discussed financial matters with the King and when the sum required was settled an order of assessment was issued and the barons undertook the collection of the taxes The assessment was always fixed higher than was required for the King s wants and the barons having paid the King what was due to him retained the surplus which they divided amongst themselves The creation of a public revenue raised by the contributions of all classes of society with a definite sum to be kept in reserve thus dates from the reign of Philip Augustus The annual income of the State at that time amounted to thirty six thousand marks or seventy two thousand pounds weight of silver about sixteen or seventeen million francs of present currency The treasury which was kept in the great tower of the temple Fig two hundred sixty two was under the custody of seven bourgeois of Paris and a king s clerk kept a register of receipts and disbursements This treasury must have been well filled at the death of Philip Augustus for that monarch s legacies were very considerable One of his last wishes deserves to be mentioned and this was a formal order which he gave to Louis VIII to employ a certain sum left him for that purpose solely and entirely for the defence of the kingdom Illustration Fig two hundred sixty two The Tower of the Temple in Paris From an Engraving of the

Gros of Tours Philip III When Louis IX in twelve forty two at Taillebourg and at Saintes had defeated the great vassals who had rebelled against him he hastened to regulate the taxes by means of a special code which bore the name of the Etablissements The taxes thus imposed fell upon the whole population and even lands belonging to the Church houses which the nobles did not themselves occupy rural properties and leased holdings were all subjected to them There were however two different kinds of rates one called the occupation rate and the other the rate of exploitation and they were both collected according to a register kept in the most regular and systematic manner possible Ancient custom had maintained a tax exceptionally in the following cases when a noble dubbed his son a knight or gave his daughter in marriage when he had to pay a ransom and when he set out on a campaign against the enemies of the Church or for the defence of the country These taxes were called l aide aux quatre cas At this period despotism too often overruled custom and the good King Louis IX by granting legal power to custom tried to bring it back to the true principles of justice and humanity He was however none the less jealous of his own personal privileges especially as regarded coining Figs two hundred sixty three to two hundred seventy He insisted that coining should be exclusively carried on in his palace as in the times of the Carlovingian kings and he required every coin to be made of a definite standard of weight which he himself fixed In this way he secured the exclusive control over the mint For the various localities towns or counties directly under the crown Louis IX settled the mode of levying taxes Men of integrity were elected by the vote of the General Assembly consisting of the three orders namely of the nobility the clergy and the tiers etat to assess the taxation of each individual and these assessors themselves were taxed by four of their own number The custom of levying proprietary subsidies in each small feudal jurisdiction could not be abolished notwithstanding the King s desire to do so owing to the power still held by the nobles Nobles were forbidden to levy a rate under any consideration without previously holding a meeting of the vassals and their tenants The tolls on roads bridges Fig two hundred seventy one fairs and markets and the harbour dues were kept up notwithstanding their obstruction to commerce with the exception that free passage was given to corn passing from one province to another The exemptions from taxes which had been dearly bought were removed and the nobles were bound not to divert the revenue received from tolls for any purposes other than those for which they were legitimately intended The nobles were also required to guard the roads from sunrise to sunset and they were made responsible for robberies committed upon travellers within their domains Louis IX by refunding the value of goods which had been stolen through the carelessness of his officers himself showed an example of the respect due to the law Those charged with collecting the King s dues as well as the mayors whose duty it was to take custody of the money contributed and to receive the taxes on various articles of consumption worked under the eye of officials appointed by the King who exercised a financial jurisdiction which developed later into the department or office called the Chamber of Accounts A tax somewhat similar to the tithe on funds was imposed for the benefit of the nobles on property held by corporations or under charter in order to compensate the treasury for the loss of the succession duties This tax represented about the fifth part of the value of the estate To cover the enormous expenses of the two crusades Louis IX however was obliged to levy two new taxes called decimes from his already overburdened people It does not however appear that this excessive taxation alienated the affection of his subjects Their minds were entirely taken up with the pilgrimages to the East and the pious monarch notwithstanding his fruitless sacrifices and his disastrous expeditions earned for himself the title of Prince of Peace and of Justice Illustration Fig two hundred seventy one Paying Toll on passing a Bridge From a Painted Window in the Cathedral of Tournay Fifteenth Century From the time of Louis IX

Venice attracted a part of the European commerce towards the Adriatic and the Mediterranean Everywhere the Jews and Lombards already well initiated into the mysterious System of credit and accustomed to lend money started banks and pawn establishments where jewels diamonds glittering arms and paraphernalia of all kinds were deposited by princes and nobles as security for loans Fig two hundred

collectors maltotiers a name derived from the Italian mala tolta unjust tax receivers or farmers of taxes paid dearly for exercising their calling which was always a dishonourable one and was at times exercised with a great amount of harshness and even of cruelty The treasury required a certain number of deniers oboles or pittes a small coin varying in value in each province to be paid by these men for each bank operation they effected and for every pound in value of merchandise they sold for they and the Jews were permitted to carry on trades of all kinds without being subject to any kind of rates taxes work military service or municipal dues Philippe le Bel owing to his interminable wars against the King of Castille and against England Germany and Flanders was frequently so embarrassed as to be obliged to resort to extraordinary subsidies in order to carry them on In twelve ninety five he called upon his subjects for a forced loan and soon after he shamelessly required them to pay the one hundredth part of their incomes and after but a short interval he demanded another fiftieth part The king assumed the exclusive right to debase the value of the coinage which caused him to be commonly called the base coiner and no sovereign ever coined a greater quantity of base money He changed the standard or name of current coin with a view to counterbalance the mischief arising from the illicit coinage of the nobles and especially to baffle the base traffic of the Jews and Lombards who occasionally would obtain possession of a great part of the coin and mutilate each piece before restoring it to circulation in this way they upset the whole monetary economy of the realm and secured immense profits to themselves Figs two hundred seventy three to two hundred seventy eight In thirteen oh three the aide au leur which was afterwards called the aide de l ost or the army tax was invented by Philippe le Bel for raising an army without opening his purse It was levied without distinction upon dukes counts barons ladies damsels archbishops bishops abbots chapters colleges and in fact upon all classes whether noble or not Nobles were bound to furnish one knight mounted equipped and in full armour for every five hundred marks of land which they possessed those who were not nobles had to furnish six foot soldiers for every hundred households By another enactment of this king the privilege was granted of paying money instead of complying with these demands for men and a sum of one hundred livres about ten thousand francs of present currency was exacted for each armed knight and two sols about ten francs per diem for each soldier which any one failed to furnish An outcry was raised throughout France at this proceeding and rebellions broke out in several provinces in Paris the mob destroyed the house of Stephen Barbette master of the mint and insulted the King in his palace It was necessary to enforce the royal authority with vigour and after considerable difficulty peace was at last restored and Philip learned though too late that in matters of taxation the people should first be consulted In thirteen thirteen for the first time the bourgeoisie syndics or deputies of communities under the name of tiers etat third order of the state were called to exercise the right of freely voting the assistance or subsidy which it pleased the King to ask of them After this memorable occasion an edict was issued ordering a levy of six deniers in the pound on every sort of merchandise sold in the kingdom Paris paid this without hesitation whereas in the provinces there was much discontented murmuring But the following year the King having tried to raise the six deniers voted by the assembly of thirteen thirteen to twelve the clergy nobility and tiers etat combined to resist the extortions of the government Philippe le Bel died after having yielded to the opposition of his indignant subjects and in his last moments he recommended his son to exercise moderation in taxing and honesty in coining Illustration Gold Coins of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries Fig two hundred seventy three Masse d Or Philip IV Fig two hundred

King unfortunately in spite of his father s advice attempted systematically to tamper with the coinage and he also commenced the exaction of fresh taxes to the great exasperation of his subjects He was obliged through fear of a general rebellion to do away with the tithe established for the support of the army and to sacrifice the superintendent of finances Enguerrand de Marigny to the public indignation which was felt against him This man without being allowed to defend himself was tried by an extraordinary commission of parliament for embezzling the public money was condemned to death and was hung on the gibbet of Montfaucon Not daring to risk a convocation of the States General of the kingdom Louis X ordered the seneschals to convoke the provincial assemblies and thus obtained a few subsidies which he promised to refund out of the revenues of his domains The clergy even allowed themselves to be taxed and closed their eyes to the misappropriation of the funds which were supposed to be held in reserve for a new crusade Taxes giving commercial franchise and of exchange were levied which were paid by the Jews Lombards Tuscans and other Italians judiciary offices were sold by auction the trading class purchased letters of nobility as they had already done under Philippe le Bel and more than this the enfranchisement of serfs which had commenced in twelve ninety eight was continued on the payment of a tax which varied according to the means of each individual In consequence of this system personal servitude was almost entirely abolished under Philippe de Long brother of Louis X Each province under the reign of this rapacious and necessitous monarch demanded some concession from the crown and almost always obtained it at a money value Normandy and Burgundy which were dreaded more than any other province on account of their turbulence received remarkable concessions The base coin was withdrawn from circulation and Louis X attempted to forbid the right of coinage to those who broke the wise laws of saint Louis The idea of bills of exchange arose at this period Thanks to the peace concluded with Flanders on which occasion that country paid into the hands of the sovereign thirty thousand florins in gold for arrears of taxes and above all owing to the rules of economy and order from which Philip V surnamed the Long never deviated the attitude of France became completely altered We find the King initiating reform by reducing the expenses of his household He convened round his person a great council which met monthly to examine and discuss matters of public interest he allowed only one national treasury for the reception of the State revenues he required the treasurers to make a half yearly statement of their accounts and a daily journal of receipts and disbursements he forbad clerks of the treasury to make entries either of receipts or expenditure however trifling without the authority and supervision of accountants whom he also compelled to assist at the checking of sums received or paid by the money changers Fig two hundred seventy nine The farming of the crown lands the King s taxes the stamp registration and the gaol duties were sold by auction subject to certain regulations with regard to guarantee The bailiffs and seneschals sent in their accounts to Paris annually they were not allowed to absent themselves without the King s permission and they were formally forbidden under pain of confiscation or even a severer penalty to speculate with the public money The operations of the treasury were at this period always involved in the greatest mystery Illustration Fig two hundred seventy nine Hotel of the Chamber of Accounts in the Courtyard of the Palace in Paris From a Woodcut of the Cosmographie

and salt became a source of legitimate complaint Figs two hundred eighty and two hundred eighty one Philip VI surnamed de Valois a more astute politician than his predecessor felt the necessity of gaining the affections of the people by sparing their private fortunes In order to establish the public revenue on a firm basis he assembled in thirteen thirty the States General composed of barons prelates and deputies from the principal towns and then hoping to awe the financial agents he authorised the arrest of the overseer Pierre de Montigny whose property was confiscated and sold producing to the treasury the enormous sum of one million two hundred thousand livres or upwards of one hundred million francs of present currency The long and terrible war which the King was forced to carry on against the English and which ended in the treaty of Bretigny in thirteen sixty one gave rise to the introduction of taxation of extreme severity The dues on ecclesiastical properties were renewed and maintained for several years all beverages sold in towns were taxed and from four to six deniers in the pound were levied upon the value of all merchandise sold in any part of the kingdom The salt tax which Philippe le Bel had established and which his successor Louis X immediately abolished at the unanimous wish of the people was again levied by Philip VI and this king having caused the salt produced in his domains to be sold gave great offence to all classes of the community It was on account of this that Edward III King of England facetiously called him the author of the Salic law Philippe de Valois when he first ascended the throne coined his money according to the standard weight of saint Louis but in a short time he more or less alloyed it This he did secretly in order to be able to withdraw the pieces of full weight from circulation and to replace them with others having less pure metal in them and whose weight was made up by an extra amount of alloy In this dishonest way a considerable sum was added to the coffers of the state King John on succeeding his father in thirteen fifty found the treasury empty and the resources of the kingdom exhausted He was nevertheless obliged to provide means to continue the war against the English who continually harassed the French on their own territory The tax on merchandise not being sufficient for this war the payment of public debts contracted by the government was suspended and the State was thus obliged to admit its insolvency The mint taxes called seigneuriage were pushed to the utmost limits and the King levied them on the new coin which he increased at will by largely alloying the gold with base metals The duties on exported and imported goods were increased notwithstanding the complaints that commerce was declining These financial expedients would not have been tolerated by the people had not the King taken the precaution to have them approved by the States General of the provincial states which he annually assembled In thirteen fifty five the States General were convoked and the King who had to maintain thirty thousand soldiers asked them to provide for this annual expenditure estimated at five million livres parisis about three hundred million francs of present currency The States General animated by a generous feeling of patriotism ordered a tax of eight deniers in the pound on the sale and transfer of all goods and articles of merchandise with the exception of inheritances which was to be payable by the vendors of whatever rank they might be whether ecclesiastics nobles or others and also a salt tax to be levied throughout the whole kingdom of France The King promised as long as this assistance lasted to levy no other subsidy and to coin good and sterling money i e deniers of fine gold white or silver coin coin of billon or mixed metal and deniers and mailles of copper The assembly appointed travelling agents and three inspectors or superintendents who had under them two receivers and a considerable number of sub collectors whose duties were defined with scrupulous minuteness The King at this time renounced the right of seizin his dues over property inherited or conveyed by sale exchange gift or will his right of demanding war levies by proclamation and of issuing forced loans the despotic character of which offended everybody The following year the tax of eight deniers having been found insufficient and expensive in its collection the assembly substituted for it a property and income tax varying according to the property and income of each individual Illustration Fig two hundred eighty two The Courtiers amassing Riches at the Expense of the Poor From a Miniature in the Tresor of Brunetto Latini Manuscript of the Fourteenth Century in the Library of the Arsenal Paris The finances were notwithstanding these additions in a low and unsatisfactory condition which became worse and worse from the fatal day of Poitiers when King John fell into the hands of the English The States General were summoned by the Dauphin and seeing the desperate condition in which the country was placed all classes freely opened their purses The nobility who had already given their blood gave the produce of all their feudal dues besides The church paid a tenth and a half and the bourgeois showed the most noble unselfishness and rose as one man to find means to resist the common enemy The ransom of the King had been fixed at three millions of ecus d or nearly a thousand million francs payable in six years and the peace of Bretigny was concluded by the cession of a third of the territory of France There was however cause for congratulation in this result for France was reduced to its utmost extremity says a chronicler and had not something led to a reaction she must have perished irretrievably King John grateful for the love and devotion shown to him by his subjects under these trying circumstances returned from captivity with the solemn intention of lightening the burdens which pressed upon them and in consequence be began by spontaneously reducing the enormous wages which the tax gatherers had hitherto received and by abolishing the tolls on highways He also sold to the Jews at a very high price the right of remaining in the kingdom and of exercising any trade in it and by this means he obtained a large sum of money He solemnly promised never again to debase the coin and he endeavoured to make an equitable division of the taxes Unfortunately it was impossible to do without a public revenue and it was necessary that the royal ransom should be paid off within six years The people from whom taxes might be always extorted at pleasure paid a good share of this for the fifth of the three millions of ecus d or was realised from the tax on salt the thirteenth part from the duty on the sale of fermented liquors and twelve deniers per pound from the tax on the value of all provisions sold and resold within the kingdom Commerce was subjected to a new tax called imposition foraine a measure most detrimental to the trade and manufactures of the country which were continually struggling under the pitiless oppression of the treasury Royal despotism was not always able to shelter itself under the sanction of the general and provincial councils and a few provinces which forcibly protested against this excise duty were treated on the same footing as foreign states with relation to the transit of merchandise from them Other provinces compounded for this tax and in this way owing to the different arrangements in different places a complicated system of exemptions and prohibitions existed which although most prejudicial to all industry remained in force to a great extent until seventeen eighty nine When Charles V surnamed the Wise ascended the throne in thirteen sixty four France ruined by the disasters of the war by the weight of taxation by the reduction in her commerce and by the want of internal security exhibited everywhere a picture of misery and desolation in addition to which famine and various epidemics were constantly breaking out in various parts of the kingdom Besides this the country was incessantly overrun by gangs of plunderers who called themselves ecorcheurs routiers tardvenus c and who were more dreaded by the country people even than the English had been Charles V who was celebrated for his justice and for his economical and provident habits was alone capable of establishing order in the midst of such general confusion Supported by the vote of the Assembly held at Compiegne in thirteen sixty seven he remitted a moiety of the salt tax and diminished the number of the treasury agents reduced their wages and curtailed their privileges He inquired into all cases of embezzlement so as to put a stop to fraud and he insisted that the accounts of the public expenditure in its several departments should be annually audited He protected commerce facilitated exchanges and reduced as far as possible the rates and taxes on woven articles and manufactured goods He permitted Jews to hold funded property and invited foreign merchants to trade with the country For the first time he required all gold and silver articles to be stamped and called in all the old gold and silver coins in order that by a new and uniform issue the value of money might no longer be fictitious or variable For more than a century coins had so often changed in name value and standard weight that in an edict of King John we read It was difficult for a man when paying money in the ordinary course to know what he was about from one day to another The recommencement of hostilities between England and France in thirteen seventy unfortunately interrupted the progressive and regular course of these financial improvements The States General to whom the King was obliged to appeal for assistance in order to carry on the war decided that salt should be taxed one sol per pound wine by wholesale a thirteenth of its value and by retail a fourth that a fouage or hearth tax of six francs should be established in towns and of two francs in the country and that a duty should be levied in walled towns on the entrance of all wine The produce of the salt tax was devoted to the special use of the King Each district farmed its excise and its salt tax under the superintendence of clerks appointed by the King who regulated the assessment and the fines and who adjudicated in the first instance in all cases of dispute Tax gatherers were chosen by the inhabitants of each locality but the chief officers of finance four in number were appointed by the King This administrative organization created on a sound basis marked the establishment of a complete financial system The Assembly which thus transferred the administration of all matters of taxation from the people at large to the King did not consist of a combination of the three estates but simply of persons of position namely prelates nobles and bourgeois of Paris in addition to the leading magistrates of the kingdom Footnote This is the origin of the saying smoke farthing The following extract from the accounts of the

year one hundred thirty one thousand francs in ecus d or representing in present money about twelve million francs were appropriated to the expenses of the State out of which the sum of five thousand francs equal to two hundred seventy five thousand francs of present money was devoted to what we may call the Civil List On the death of Charles V in thirteen eighty his eldest son Charles who was a minor was put under the guardianship of his uncles and one of these the Duke d Anjou assumed the regency by force He seized upon the royal treasury which was concealed in the Castle of Melun and also upon all the savings of the deceased king and instead of applying them to alleviate the general burden of taxation he levied a duty for the first time on the common food of the people Immediately there arose a general outcry of indignation and a formidable expression of resistance was made in Paris and in the large towns Mob orators loudly proclaimed the public rights thus trampled upon by the regent and the King s uncles the expression of the feelings of the masses began to take the shape of open revolt when the council of the regency made an appearance of giving way and the new taxes were suppressed or at all events partially abandoned The success of the insurrectionary movement however caused increased concessions to be demanded by the people The Jews and tax collectors were attacked Some of the latter were hung or assassinated and their registers torn up and many of the former were ill treated and banished notwithstanding the price they had paid for living in the kingdom The assembly of the States which was summoned by the King s uncles to meet in Paris sided with the people and in consequence the regent and his brother pretended to acknowledge the justice of the claims which were made upon them in the name of the people and on their withdrawing the taxes order was for a time restored No sooner however was this the case than in spite of the solemn promises made by the council of regency the taxes were suddenly reimposed and the right of farming them was sold to persons who exacted them in the most brutal manner A sanguinary revolt called that of the Maillotins burst forth in Paris and the capital remained for some time in the power of the people or rather of the bourgeois who led the mob on to act for them thirteen eighty one thirteen eighty two The towns of Rouen Rheims Troyes Orleans and Blois many places in Beauvoise in Champagne and in Normandy followed the example of the Parisians and it is impossible to say to what a length the revolt would have reached had it not been for the victory over the Flemish at Rosebecque This victory enabled the King s uncles to re enter Paris in thirteen eighty three and to re establish the royal authority at the same time making the Maillotins and their accomplices pay dearly for their conduct The excise duties the hearth tax the salt tax and various other imposts which had been abolished or suspended were re established the taxes on wine beer and other fermented liquors was lowered bread was taxed twelve deniers per pound and the duty on salt was fixed at the excessive rate of twenty francs in gold about twelve hundred francs of present money per hogshead of sixty hundredweight Certain concessions and compromises were made exceptionally in favour of Artois Dauphine Poitou and Saintonge in consideration of the voluntary contributions which those provinces had made Illustration Fig two hundred eighty three Assassination of the Duke of Burgundy John the Fearless on the Bridge of Montereau

and arbitrary rule the Dukes of Anjou Burgundy and Berry under pretext of requiring money for war expenses again increased the taxes from the year thirteen eighty five to thirteen eighty eight and the salt tax was raised to forty golden francs about twenty four thousand francs of present money per hogshead The ecclesiastics paid a half decime to the King and several decimes to the Pope but these did not prevent a forced loan being ordered Happily Charles VI about this period attained his majority and assumed his position as king and his uncle the Duke of Bourbon who was called to the direction of affairs re established comparative order in financial matters but soon after the King s brother the Duke of Orleans seized the reins of government and jointly with his sister in law Isabel of Bavaria increased the taxation far beyond that imposed by the Duke d Anjou The Duke of Burgundy called John the Fearless in order to gratify his personal hatred to his cousin Louis of Orleans made himself the instrument of the strong popular feeling by assassinating that prince as he was returning from an entertainment The tragical death of the Duke of Orleans no more alleviated the ills of France than did that of the Duke of Burgundy sixteen years later for he in his turn was the victim of a conspiracy and was assassinated on the bridge of Montereau in the presence of the Dauphin Fig two hundred eighty three The marriage of Isabel of France with the young king Richard of England the ransom of the Christian prisoners in the East the money required by the Emperor of

other from the French people Distress was at its height and though the people were groaning under oppression they continued to pay not only the increased taxes on provisions and merchandise and an additional general tax but to submit to the most outrageous confiscations and robbery of the public money from the public treasuries The State Assemblies held at Auxerre and Paris in fourteen twelve and fourteen thirteen denounced the extravagance and maladministration of the treasurers the generals the excisemen the receivers of royal dues and of all those who took part in the direction of the finances though they nevertheless voted the taxes and promulgated most severe regulations with respect to their collection To meet emergencies which were now becoming chronic extraordinary taxes were established the non payment of which involved the immediate imprisonment of the defaulter and the debasement of the coinage and the alienation of certain parts of the kingdom were authorised in the name of the King who had been insane for more than fifteen years The incessant revolts of the bourgeois the reappearance of the English on the soil of France the ambitious rivalry of Queen Isabel of Bavaria leagued with the Duke of Burgundy against the Dauphin who had been made regent at last in fourteen twenty brought about the humiliating treaty of Troyes by which Henry V king of England was to become king of France on the death of Charles VI This treaty of Troyes became the cause of and the pretext for a vast amount of extortion being practised upon the unfortunate inhabitants of the conquered country Henry V who had already made several exactions from Normandy before he had obtained by force the throne of France did not spare the other provinces and whilst proclaiming his good intentions towards his future subjects he added a new general impost in the shape of a forced loan to the taxes which already weighed so heavily on the people He also issued a new coinage maintained many of the taxes especially those on salt and on liquors even after he had announced his intention of abolishing them At the same time the Dauphin Charles surnamed Roi de Bourges because he had retired with his court and retinue into the centre of the kingdom fourteen twenty two was sadly in want of money He alienated the State revenues he levied excise duties and subsidies in the provinces which remained faithful to his cause and he borrowed largely from those members of the Church and the nobility who manifested a generous pity for the sad destiny of the King and the monarchy Many persons however instead of sacrificing themselves for their king and country made conditions with him taking advantage of his position The heir to the throne was obliged in many points to give way either to a noble whose services he bargained for or to a town or an abbey whose aid he sought At times he bought over influential bodies such as universities and other corporation by granting exemptions from or privileges in matters of taxation c So much was this the case that it may be said that Charles VII treated by private contract for the recovery of the inheritances of his fathers The towns of Paris and Rouen as well as the provinces of Brittany Languedoc Normandy and Guyenne only returned to their allegiance to the King on conditions more or less advantageous to themselves

of Burgundy Philip the Good Illustration Fig two hundred eighty four The House of Jacques Coeur at Bourges now converted into the Hotel de Ville Charles VII reconquered his kingdom by a good and wise policy as much as by arms He doubtless had cause to be thankful for the valeur and devotion of his officers but he principally owed the success of his cause to one man namely his treasurer the famous Jacques Coeur who possessed the faculty of always supplying money to his master and at the same time of enriching himself Fig two hundred eighty four Thus it was that Charles VII whose finances had been restored by the genius of Jacques Coeur was at last able to re enter his capital triumphantly to emancipate Guyenne Normandy and the banks of the Loire from the English yoke to reattach to the crown a portion of its former possessions or to open the way for their early return to remove bold usurpers from high places in the State and to bring about a real alleviation of those evils which his subjects had so courageously borne He suppressed the fraud and extortion carried on under the name of justice put a stop to the sale of offices abolished a number of rates illegally levied required that the receivers accounts should be sent in biennially and whilst regulating the taxation he devoted its proceeds entirely to the maintenance and pay of the army From that time taxation once feudal and arbitrary became a fixed royal due which was the surest means of preventing the pillage and the excesses of the soldiery to which the country people had been subjected for many years Important triumphs of freedom were thus obtained over the tyrannical supremacy of the great vassals but in the midst of all this improvement we cannot but regret that the assessors who from the time of their creation by saint Louis had been elected by the towns or the corporations now became the nominees of the crown Illustration Fig two hundred eighty five Amende honorable of Jacques Coeur before Charles VII Fac simile of a Miniature of the Chroniques of Monstrelet Manuscript of the Fifteenth Century in the National Library of Paris Philip the Good Duke of Burgundy taxed his subjects but little Therefore says Philippe de Commines they became very wealthy and lived in much comfort But Louis XI did not imitate him His first care was to reinstate that great merchant that clever financier Jacques Coeur to whom as much as to Joan of Arc the kingdom owed its freedom and whom Charles VII for the most contemptible reasons had had the weakness to allow to be judicially condemned Louis XI would have been very glad to entrust the care of his finances to another Jacques Coeur for being sadly in want of money he ran through his father s earnings and to refill his coffers he increased taxation imposed a duty on the importation of wines and levied a tax on those holding offices c A revolution broke out in consequence which was only quenched in the blood of the insurgents In this manner he continued by force of arms to increase and strengthen his own regal power at the expense of feudalism He soon found himself opposed by the Ligue du Bien Public formed by the great vassals ostensibly to get rid of the pecuniary burden which oppressed the people but really with the secret intention of restoring feudalism and lessening the King s power He was not powerful enough openly to resist this and appeared to give way by allowing the leagued nobles immense privileges and himself consenting to the control of a sort of council of thirty six notables appointed to superintend matters of finance Far from acknowledging himself vanquished however he immediately set to work to cause division among his enemies so as to be able to overcome them He accordingly showed favour towards the bourgeois whom he had already flattered by granting new privileges and abolishing or reducing certain vexatious taxes of which they complained The thirty six notables appointed to control his financial management reformed nothing They were timid and docile under the cunning eye of the King and practically assisted him in his designs for in a very few years the taxes were increased from one million eight hundred thousand ecus about forty five million francs of present money to three million six hundred thousand ecus about ninety five million francs Towards the end of the reign they exceeded four million seven hundred thousand ecus one hundred thirty million francs of present money Louis XI wasted nothing on luxury and pleasure he lived parsimoniously but he maintained one hundred ten thousand men under arms and was ready to make the greatest sacrifices whenever there was a necessity for augmenting the territory of the kingdom or for establishing national unity At his death on the twenty fifth of August fourteen eighty three he left a kingdom considerably increased in area but financialty almost ruined When Anne de Beaujeu eldest sister of the King who was a minor assumed the reins of government as regent an immediate demand was made for reparation of the evils to which the finance ministers had subjected the unfortunate people The treasurer general Olivier le Dain and the attorney general Jean Doyat were almost immediately sacrificed to popular resentment six thousand Swiss were subsidised the pensions granted during the previous reign were cancelled and a fourth part of the taxes was removed Public opinion being thus satisfied the States General assembled The bourgeois here showed great practical good sense especially in matters of finance they proved clearly that the assessment was illegal and that the accounts were fictitious inasmuch as the latter only showed one million six hundred fifty thousand livres of subsidies whereas they amounted to three times as much It was satisfactorily established that the excise the salt tax and the revenues of the public lands amply sufficed for the wants of the country and the crown The young King Charles was only allowed one million two hundred thousand livres for his private purse for two years and three hundred thousand livres for the expenses of the festivities of his coronation On the Assembly being dissolved the Queen Regent found ample means of pleasing the bourgeois and the people generally by breaking through the engagements she had entered into in the King s name by remitting taxation and finally by force of arms destroying the power of the last remaining vassals of the crown Illustration Fig two hundred eighty six The Mint Fac simile of a Woodcut in the Translation of the Latin

Damhoudere s Praxis Rerum Civilium Charles VIII during a reign of fourteen years continued to waste the public money His disastrous expedition for the conquest of the kingdom of Naples forced him to borrow at the rate of forty two per cent A short time previous to his death he acknowledged his errors but continued to spend money without consideration or restraint in all kinds of extravagances but especially in buildings During his reign the annual expenditure almost invariably doubled the revenue In fourteen ninety two it reached seven million three hundred thousand francs about two hundred forty four million francs of present money The deficit was made up each year by a general tax which was paid neither by the nobles nor the Church but was obtained entirely from the people letters from the ambassadors of Venice When the Duke of Orleans ascended the throne as Louis XII the people were again treated with some consideration Having chosen George d Amboise as premier and Florimond Robertet as first secretary of the treasury he resolutely pursued a course of strict economy he refused to demand of his subjects the usual tax for celebrating the joyous accession the taxes fell by successive reductions to the sum of two million six hundred thousand livres about seventy six million francs of present money the salt tax was entirely abolished and the question as to what should be the standard measure of this important article was legislated upon The tax gatherers were forced to reside in their respective districts and to submit their registers to the royal commissioners before beginning to collect the tax By strict discipline pillage by soldiers was put a stop to Fig two hundred eighty eight Notwithstanding the resources obtained by the King through mortgaging a part of the royal domains and in spite of the excellent administration of Robertet who almost always managed to pay the public deficit without any additional tax it was necessary in fifteen thirteen after several disastrous expeditions to Italy to borrow on the security of the royal domains four hundred thousand livres ten million francs of present money and to raise from the excise and from other dues and taxes the sum of three million three hundred thousand livres about eighty million francs of present money This caused the nation some distress but it was only temporary and was not much felt for commerce both domestic and foreign much extended at the same time and the sale of collectorships of titles of nobility of places in parliament and of nominations to numerous judicial offices brought in considerable sums to the treasury The higher classes surnamed the king Le Roitelet because he was sickly and of small stature parsimonious and economical The people called him their father and

Chronicon in folio fifteen ninety nine In an administrative and financial point of view the reign of Francis I was not at all a period of revival or of progress The commencement of a sounder System of finance is rather to be dated from that of Charles V and good financial organization is associated with the names of Jacques Coeur Philip the Good Charles XI and Florimond Robertet As an example of this it may be stated that financiers of that time established taxes on registration of all kinds also on stamps and on sales which did not before exist in France and which were borrowed from the Roman emperors We must also give them the credit of having first commenced a public debt under the name of rentes perpetuelles which at that time realised eight per cent During this brilliant and yet disastrous reign the additional taxes were enormous and the sale of offices produced such a large revenue that the post of parliamentary counsel realised the sum of two thousand golden ecus or nearly a million francs of present currency It was necessary to obtain money at any price and from any one who would lend it The ecclesiastics the nobility the bourgeois all gave up their plate and their jewels to furnish the mint which continued to coin money of every description and in consequence of the discovery of America and the working of the gold and silver mines in that country the precious metals poured into the hands of the money changers The country however was none the more prosperous and the people often were in want of even the commonest necessaries of life The King and the court swallowed up everything and consumed all the resources of the country on their luxury and their wars The towns the monasteries and the corporations were bound to furnish a certain number of troops

any Greek or Roman innovations had become engrafted on to their customs everything even political power as well as the rightful possession of lands appears to have been dependent on families Julius Caesar in his Commentaries tells us that each year the magistrates and princes assigned portions of land to families as well as to associations of individuals having a common object whenever they thought proper and to any extent they chose though in the following year the same authorities compelled them to go and establish themselves elsewhere We again find families familiae and associations of men cognationes hominum spoken of by Caesar in the barbaric laws and referred to in the histories of the Middle Ages under the names of genealogiae faramanni farae c but the extent of the relationship parentela included under the general appellation of families varied amongst the Franks Lombards Visigoths and Bavarians Generally amongst all the people of German origin the relationship only extended to the seventh degree amongst the Celts it was determined merely by a common ancestry with endless subdivisions of the tribe into distinct families Amongst the Germans from whom modern Europe has its origin we find only three primary groups namely first the family proper comprising the father mother and children and the collateral relatives of all degrees secondly the vassals ministeriales or servants of the free class and thirdly the servants mansionarii coloni liti servi of the servile class attached to the family proper Fig two hundred ninety six Domestic authority was represented by the mund or head of the family also called rex the king who exercised a special power over the persons and goods of his dependents a guardianship in fact with certain rights and prerogatives and a sort of civil and political responsibility attached to it Thus the head of the family who was responsible for his wife and for those of his children who lived with him was also responsible for his slaves and domestic animals To such a pitch did these primitive people carry their desire that justice should be done in all cases of infringement of the law that the head was held legally responsible for any injury which might be done by the bow or the sword of any of his dependents without it being necessary that he should himself have handled either of these weapons Long before the commencement of the Merovingian era the family whose sphere of action had at first been an isolated and individual one became incorporated into one great national association which held official meetings at stated periods on the Malberg Parliament hill These assemblies alone possessed supreme power in its full signification The titles given to certain chiefs of rex king dux duke graff count brenn general of the army only defined the subdivisions of that power and were applied the last exclusively to those engaged in war and the others to those possessing judicial and administrative functions The duty of dispensing justice was specially assigned to the counts who had to ascertain the cause of quarrels between parties and to inflict penalties There was a count in each district and in each important town there were besides several counts attached to the sovereign under the title of counts of the palace comites palatii an honourable position which was much sought after and much coveted on account of its pecuniary and other contingent advantages The counts of the palace deliberated with the sovereign on all matters and all questions of State and at the same time they were his companions in hunting feasting and religious exercises they acted as arbitrators in questions of inheritance of the crown during the minority of princes they exercised the same authority as that which the constitution gave to sovereigns who were of full age they confirmed the nominations of the principal functionaries and even those of the bishops they gave their advice on the occasion of a proposed alliance between one nation and another on matters connected with treaties of peace or of commerce on military expeditions or on exchanges of territory as well as in reference to the marriage of a prince and they incurred no responsibility beyond that naturally attached to persons in so distinguished a position among a semi barbarous community At first the legates legati and afterwards the King s ambassadors missi dominici the bishops and the dukes or commanders of the army were usually selected from the higher court officials such as the counts of the palace whereas the ministeriales forming the second class of the royal officials filled inferior though very honourable and lucrative posts of an administrative and magisterial character Illustration Fig two hundred ninety six The Familles and the Barbarians Fac simile of a Woodcut in the Cosmographie Universelle of Munster in folio Basle fifteen fifty two Under the Merovingians the legal principle of power was closely bound up with the possession of landed property The subdivision of that power however closely followed this union and the constant ruin of some of the nobles rapidly increased the power of others who absorbed to themselves the lost authority of their more unfortunate brethren so much so that the Frank kings perceived that society would soon escape their rule unless they speedily found a remedy for this state of things It was then that the lois Salique and Ripuaire appeared which were subjected to successive revisions and gradual or sudden modifications necessitated by political changes or by the increasing exigencies of the prelates and nobles But far from lessening the supremacy of the King the national customs which were collected in a code extended the limits of the royal authority and facilitated its exercise In five hundred ninety six Childebert in concert with his leudes decided that in future the crime of rape should be punished with death and that the judge of the district pagus in which it had been committed should kill the ravisher and leave his body on the public road He also enacted that the homicide should have the same fate It is just to quote the words of the law that he who knows how to kill should learn how to die Robbery attested by seven witnesses also involved capital punishment and a judge convicted of having let a noble escape underwent the same punishment that would have been inflicted on the criminal The punishment however differed according to the station of the delinquent Thus for the non observance of Sunday a Salian paid a fine of fifteen sols a Roman seven and a half sols a slave three sols or his back paid the penalty for him At this early period some important changes in the barbaric code had been made the sentence of death when once given had to be carried out and no arrangements between the interested parties could avert it A crime could no longer be condoned by the payment of money robbery even which was still leniently regarded at that time and beyond the Rhine even honoured was pitilessly punished by death We therefore cannot have more striking testimony than this of the abridgment of the privileges of the Frankish aristocracy and of the progress which the sovereign power was making towards absolute and uncontrolled authority over cases of life and death By almost imperceptible steps Roman legislation became more humane and perfect Christianity engrafted itself into barbarism licentiousness was considered a crime crime became an offence against the King and society and it was in one sense by the King s hand that the criminals received punishment From the time of the baptism of Clovis the Church had much to do with the re arrangement of the penal code for instance marriage with a sister in law a mother in law an aunt or a niece was forbidden the travelling shows nocturnal dances public orgies formerly permitted at feasts were forbidden as being profane In the time of Clotaire the prelates sat as members of the supreme council which was strictly speaking the highest court of the land having the power of reversing the decisions of the judges of the lower courts It pronounced sentence in conjunction with the King and from these decisions there was no appeal The nation had no longer a voice in the election of the magistrates for the assemblies of Malberg did not meet except on extraordinary occasions and all government and judicial business was removed to the supreme and often capricious arbitration of the King and his council As long as the mayors of the palace of Austrasia and of that of Burgundy were only temporarily appointed royal authority never wavered and the sovereign remained supreme judge over his subjects Suddenly however after the execution of Brunehaut who was sacrificed to the hatred of the feudal lords the mayoralty of the palace became a life appointment and in consequence the person holding the office became possessed almost of supreme power and the rightful sovereigns from that time practically became subject to the authority of the future usurpers of the crown The edict of six hundred fifteen to which the ecclesiastical and State nobility were parties was in its laws and customs completely at variance with former edicts In resuming their places in the French constitution the Merovingian kings who had been deprived both of influence and authority were compelled by the Germanic institutions to return to the passive position which their predecessors had held in the forests of Germany but they no longer had like the latter the prestige of military authority to enable them to keep the position of judges or arbitrators The canons of the Council of Paris which were confirmed by an edict of the King bearing date the fifteenth of the calends of November six hundred fifteen upset the political and legal system so firmly established in Europe since the fifth century The royal power was shorn of some of its most valuable prerogatives one of which was that of selecting the bishops lay judges were forbidden to bring an ecclesiastic before the tribunals and the treasury was prohibited from seizing intestate estates with a view to increasing the rates and taxes and it was decreed that Jews should not be employed in collecting the public taxes By these canons the judges and other officers of State were made responsible the benefices which had been withdrawn from the leudes were restored the King was forbidden from granting written orders praecepta for carrying off rich widows young virgins and nuns and the penalty of death was ordered to be enforced against those who disobeyed the canons of the council Thence sprung two new species of legislation one ecclesiastical the other civil between which royalty more and more curtailed of its authority was compelled for many centuries to struggle Amongst the Germanic nations the right of justice was inherent to landed property from the earliest times and this right had reference to things as well as to persons It was the patronage patrocinium of the proprietor and this patronage eventually gave origin to feudal jurisdictions and to lordly and customary rights in each domain We may infer from this that under the two first dynasties laws were made by individuals and that each lord so to speak made his own The right of jurisdiction seems to have been so inherent to the right of property that a landed proprietor could always put an end to feuds and personal quarrels could temporarily bring any lawsuit to a close and by issuing his ban stop the course of the law in his own immediate neighbourhood at least within a given circumference of his residence This was often done during any family festival or any civil or religious public ceremony On these occasions whoever infringed the ban of the master was liable to be brought before his court and to have to pay a fine The lord who was too poor to create a court of sufficient power and importance obtained assistance from his lord paramount or relinquished the right of justice to him whence originated the saying The fief is one thing and justice another The law of the Visigoths speaks of nobles holding local courts similar to those of the official judge count or bishop King Dagobert required the public and the private judges to act together In the law of Lombardy landlords are mentioned who in virtue of the double title of nobles and judges assumed the right of protecting fugitive slaves taking shelter in their domains By an article of the Salie law the noble is made to answer for his vassal before the court of the count We must hence conclude that the landlord s judgment was exercised indiscriminately on the serfs the colons and the vassals and a statute of eight hundred fifty five places under his authority even the freemen who resided with other persons From these various sources we discover a curious fact which has hitherto remained unnoticed by historians namely that there existed an intermediate legislation between the official court of the count and his subordinates and the private courts which was a kind of court of arbitration exercised by the neighbours vicini without the assistance of the judges of the county and this was invested with a sort of authority which rendered its decisions binding Illustration Fig two hundred ninety seven The Emperor Charlemagne holding in one hand the Globe and in the other the Sword After a Miniature in the Registers of the University of Paris Archives of the Minister of Public Instruction of the University The Motto In scelus exurgo sceleris discrimina purgo is written on a Scroll round the Sword Private courts however were limited in their power They were neither absolutely independent nor supreme and without appeal All conducted their business much in the same way as the high middle and lower courts of the Middle Ages and above all these authorities towered the King s jurisdiction The usurpation of ecclesiastical bishops and abbots who having become temporal lords assumed a domestic jurisdiction was curtailed by the authority of the counts and they were even more obliged to give way before that of the missi dominici or the official delegates of the monarch Charles the Bald notwithstanding his enormous concessions to feudalism and to the Church never gave up his right of final appeal During the whole of the Merovingian epoch the mahl mallus the general and regular assembly of the nation was held in the month of March Persons of every class met there clad in armour political commercial and judicial interests were discussed under the presidency of the monarch but this did not prevent other special assemblies of the King s court curia regalis being held on urgent occasions This court formed a parliament parlamentum which at first was exclusively military but from the time of Clovis was composed of Franks Burgundians Gallo Romans as well as of feudal lords and ecclesiastics As by degrees the feudal System became organized the convocation of national assemblies became more necessary and the administration of justice more complicated Charlemagne decided that two mahls should be held annually one in the month of May the other in the autumn and in addition that in each county two annual plaids should meet independently of any special mahls and plaids which it should please him to convoke In seven hundred eighty eight the emperor found it necessary to call three general plaids and besides these he was pleased to summon his great vassals both clerical and lay to the four principal feasts of the year It may be asserted that the idea of royalty being the central authority in matters of common law dates from the reign of Charlemagne Fig two hundred ninety seven The authority of royalty based on law took such deep root from that time forth that it maintained itself erect notwithstanding the weakness of the successors of the great Charles and the repeated infractions of it by the Church and the great vassals of the crown Fig two hundred ninety eight Illustration Fig two hundred ninety eight Carlovingian King in his Palace personifying Wisdom appealing to the whole Human Race After a Miniature in a Manuscript of the Ninth Century in the Burgundian Library of Brussels from a Drawing by Count Horace de Vielcastel The authoritative and responsible action of a tribunal which represented society Fig two hundred ninety nine thus took the place of the unchecked animosity of private feuds and family quarrels which were often avenged by the use of the gibbet a monument to be found erected at almost every corner Not unfrequently in those early times the unchecked passions of a chief of a party would be the only reason for inflicting a penalty often such a person would constitute himself sole judge and without the advice of any one he would pass sentence and even with his own sword or any other available instrument he would act as his own executioner The tribunal thus formed denounced duelling the pitiless warfare between man and man and between family and family and its first care was to protect not each individual man s life which was impossible in those days of blind barbarism but at least his dwelling Imperceptibly the sanctuary of a man s house extended first to towns of refuge and then to certain public places such as the church the mahlum or place of national assemblies the market the tavern c It was next required that the accused whether guilty or not should remain unharmed from the time of the crime being committed until the day on which judgment was passed Illustration Fig two hundred ninety nine The Court of the Nobles Fac simile of a Miniature in an old Poetical Romance of Chivalry Manuscript of the Thirteenth Century in the Library of the Arsenal of Paris This right of revenge besides being thus circumscribed as to locality was also subject to certain rules as to time Sunday and the principal feasts of the year such as Advent Christmas week and from that time to the Epiphany from the Ascension to the Day of Pentecost certain vigils c were all occasions upon which the right of revenge could not be exercised The power of the King says a clever and learned writer partook to a certain degree of that of God and of the Saints it was his province to calm human passions by the moral power of his seal and his hand he extended peace over all the great lines of communication through the forests along the principal rivers the highways and the byways c The Treve du Dieu in ten thirty five was the logical application of these humane principles We must not suppose that justice in those days was dispensed without formalities and that there were no regular intervals between the various steps to be gone through before final judgment was given and in consequence of which some guarantee was afforded that the decisions arrived at were carefully considered No one was tried without having been previously summoned to appear before the tribunal Under the Carlovingians as in previous times the periods when judicial courts were held were regulated by the moon Preference was given to the day on which it entered the first quarter or during the full moon the summonses were returnable by moons or quarter moons that is every seventh day The summons was issued four times after which if the accused did not appear he lost the right of counterplea or was nonsuited The Salic law allowed but two summonses before a count which had to be issued at an interval of forty nights the one from the other The third which summoned the accused before the King was issued fourteen nights later and if he had not put in an appearance before sunset on the fourteenth day he was placed hors de sa parole his goods were confiscated and he forfeited the privilege of any kind of refuge Among the Visigoths justice was equally absolute from the count to the tithe gatherer Each magistrate had his tribunal and his special jurisdiction These judges called to their assistance assessors or colleagues either rachimbourgs who were selected from freemen or provosts or echevins scabini whose appointment was of an official and permanent character The scabins created by Charlemagne were the first elected magistrates They numbered seven for each bench They alone prepared the cases and arranged as to the sentence The count or his delegate alone presided at the tribunal and pronounced the judgment Every vassal enjoyed the right of appeal to the sovereign who with his court alone decided the quarrels between ecclesiastics and nobles and between private individuals who were specially under the royal protection Criminal business was specially referred to the sovereign the missi or the Count Palatine Final appeal lay with the Count Palatine in all cases in which the public peace was endangered such as in revolts or in armed encounters As early as the time of the invasion the Franks Bavarians and Visigoths when investigating cases began by an inquiry and previously to having recourse to trials before a judge they examined witnesses on oath Then he who swore to the matter was believed and acquitted accordingly This system was no doubt flattering to human veracity but unfortunately it gave rise to abuses which it was thought would be avoided by calling the family and friends of the accused to take an oath and it was then administered by requiring them to place their hands on the crucifix on some relics or on the consecrated Host These witnesses who were called conjuratores came to attest before the judges not the fact itself but the veracity of the person who invoked their testimony Illustration Fig three hundred The Judicial Duel The Plaintiff opening his Case before the Judge Fac simile of a Miniature in the Ceremonies des Gages des Batailles Manuscript of the Fifteenth Century in the National Library of Paris The number and respectability of the conjuratores varied according to the importance of the case in dispute Gregory of Tours relates that King Gontran being suspicious as to the legitimacy of the child who afterwards became Clotaire II his mother Fredegonde called in the impartial testimony of certain nobles These to the number of three hundred with three bishops at their head tribus episcopis et trecentis viris optimis swore or as we say made an affidavit and the queen was declared innocent The laws of the Burgundians and of the Anglians were more severe than those of the Germanic race for they granted to the disputants trial by combat After having employed the ordeal of red hot iron and of scalding water the Franks adopted the judicial duel Fig three hundred This was imposed first upon the disputing parties then on the witnesses and sometimes even on the judges themselves Dating from the reign of the Emperor Otho the Great in nine hundred sixty seven the judicial duel which had been at first restricted to the most serious cases was had recourse to in almost all suits that were brought before the courts Neither women old men children nor infirm persons were exempted When a person could not himself fight he had to provide a champion whose sole business was to take in hand the quarrels of others Illustration Fig three hundred one Judicial Duel Combat of a Knight with a Dog Fac simile of a Miniature in the Romance of Macaire of the Thirteenth Century Library of the Arsenal of Paris Ecclesiastics were obliged in the same maimer to fight by deputy The champion or substitute required of course to be paid beforehand If the legend of the Dog of Montargis is to be believed the judicial duel seems to have been resorted to even against an animal Fig three hundred one In the twelfth century Europe was divided so to speak into two vast judicial zones the one Southern Gallo Roman and Visigoth the other Northern and Western half Germanic and half Scandinavian Anglian or Saxon Christianity established common ties between these different legislations and imperceptibly softened their native coarseness although they retained the elements of their pagan and barbaric origin Sentences were not as yet given in writing they were entrusted to the memory of the judges who had issued them and when a question or dispute arose between the interested parties as to the terms of the decision which had been pronounced an inquiry was held and the court issued a second decision called a recordatum As long as the King s court was a movable one the King carried about with him the original text of the law in rolls rotuli It was in consequence of the seizure of a number of these by the English during the reign of Philip Augustus in eleven ninety four that the idea was suggested of preserving the text of all the laws as state archives and of opening authentic registers of decisions in civil and criminal cases As early as the time of Charles the Bald the inconvenience was felt of the high court of the count being movable from place to place and having no special locality where instructions might be given as to modes of procedure for the hearing of witnesses and for keeping the accused in custody c A former statute provided for this probable difficulty but there seems to be no proof that previous to the twelfth century any fixed courts of justice had been established The Kings and likewise the counts held courts in the open air at the entrance to the palace Fig three hundred two or in some other public place under a large tree for instance as saint Louis did in the wood of Vincennes M Desmaze in his valuable researches on the history of the Parliament of Paris says In eleven ninety one Philip Augustus before starting for Palestine established bailiwicks which held their assizes once a month during their sitting they heard all those who had complaints to make and gave summary judgment The bailiff s assize was held at stated periods from time to time and at a fixed place it was composed of five judges the King deciding the number and quality of the persons who were to take part in the deliberations of the court for each session The royal court only sat when it pleased the King to order it it accompanied the King wherever he went so that it had no settled place of residence Louis IX ordered that the courts of the nobles should be consolidated with the King s court and succeeded in carrying out this reform The bailiffs who were the direct delegates of the sovereign power assumed an authority before which even the feudal lord was obliged to bend because this authority was supported by the people who were at that time organized in corporations and these corporations were again bound together in communes Under the bailiffs a system was developed the principles of which more nearly resembled the Roman legislation than the right of custom which it nevertheless respected and the judicial trial by duel completely disappeared Inquiries and appeals were much resorted to in all kinds of proceedings and Louis IX succeeded in controlling the power of ecclesiastical courts which had been much abused in reference to excommunication He also suppressed the arbitrary and ruinous confiscations which the nobles had unjustly made on their vassals Illustration Fig three hundred two The Palace as it was in the Sixteenth Century After an Engraving of that Period National Library of Paris Cabinet des Estampes The edict of twelve seventy six very clearly established the jurisdiction of parliaments and bailiwicks it defined the important duties of the bailiffs and at the same time specified the mode in which proceedings should be taken it also regulated the duties of counsel maitres des requetes auditors and advocates To the bailiwicks already in existence Louis IX added the four great assizes of Vermandois of Sens of Saint Pierre le Moustier and of Macon to act as courts of final appeal from the judgment of the nobles Philippe le Bel went still further for in twelve eighty seven he invited all those who possess temporal authority in the kingdom of France to appoint for the purpose of exercising civil jurisdiction a bailiff a provost and some serjeants who were to be laymen and not ecclesiastics and if there should be ecclesiastics in the said offices to remove them He ordered besides that all those who had cases pending before the court of the King and the secular judges of the kingdom should be furnished with lay attorneys though the chapters as well as the abbeys and convents were allowed to be represented by canons M Desmaze adds This really amounted to excluding ecclesiastics from judicial offices not only from the courts of the King but also from those of the nobles and from every place in which any temporal jurisdiction existed At the time of his accession Hugh Capet was Count of Paris and as such was invested with judicial powers which he resigned in nine hundred eighty seven on the understanding that his county of Paris after the decease of the male heirs of his brother Eudes should return to the crown In ten thirty two a new magistrate was created called the Provost of Paris whose duty it was to give assistance to the bourgeois in arresting persons for debt This functionary combined in his own person the financial and political chief of the capital he was also the head of the nobility of the county he was independent of the governor and was placed above the bailiffs and seneschals He was the senior of the urban magistracy and police leader of the municipal troops and in a word the prefect praefectus urbis as he was called under the Emperor Aurelian or the first magistrate of Lutetia as he was still called under Clotaire in six hundred sixty three Assessors were associated with the provost and together they formed a tribunal which was afterwards known as the Chatelet Fig three hundred three because they assembled in that fortress the building of which is attributed to Julius Caesar The functions of this tribunal did not differ much from those of the royal chatellenies its jurisdiction embraced quarrels between individuals assaults revolts disputes between the universities and the students and improper conduct generally ribaudailles in consequence of which the provost acquired the popular surname of Roi des Ribauds At first his judgment was final but very soon those under his jurisdiction were allowed to appeal to Parliament and that court was obliged to have certain cases sent back for judgment from the Chatelet This was however done only in a few very important instances notwithstanding frequent appeals being made to its supreme arbitration Illustration Fig three hundred three The Great Chatelet of Paris Principal Front opposite the Pont au Change Fac simile of an Engraving on Copper by Merian in the Topographia Galliae of Zeller In addition to the courts of the counts and bailiffs established in certain of the large towns aldermanic or magisterial courts existed which rather resembled the Chatelet of Paris Thus the capiloulat of Toulouse the senior alderman of Metz and the burgomaster of Strasburg and Brussels possessed in each of these towns a tribunal which judged without appeal and united the several functions of a civil criminal and simple police court Several places in the north of France had provosts who held courts whose duties were various but who were principally charged with the maintenance of public order and with suppressing disputes and conflicts arising from the privileges granted to the trade corporations whose importance especially in Flanders had much increased since the twelfth century On his return from abroad Louis IX took his seat upon the bench and administered justice by the side of the good provost of Paris This provost was no other than the learned Estienne Boileau out of respect to whom the provostship was declared a charge de magistrature The increase of business which fell to the provost s office especially after the boundaries of Paris were extended by Philip Augustus caused him to be released from the duty of collecting the public taxes He was authorised to furnish himself with competent assistants who were employed with matters of minor detail and he was allowed the assistance of juges auditeurs We order that they shall be eight in number says an edict of Philippe le Bel of February thirteen twenty four four of them being ecclesiastics and four laymen and that they shall assemble at the Chatelet two days in the week to take into consideration the suits and causes in concert with our provost In thirteen forty three the provost s court was composed of one King s attorney one civil commissioner two King s counsel eight councillors and one criminal commissioner whose sittings took place daily at the Chatelet From the year thirteen forty this tribunal had to adjudicate in reference to all the affairs of the university and from the sixth of October thirteen eighty to all those of the salt fish market which were no less numerous so that its importance increased considerably Unfortunately numerous abuses were introduced into this municipal jurisdiction In thirteen thirteen and thirteen twenty the officers of the Chatelet were suspended on account of the extortions which they were guilty of and the King ordered an inquiry to be made into the matter The provost and two councillors of the Parliament sat upon it and Philip de Valois adopting its decisions prescribed fresh statutes which were naturally framed in such a way as to show the distrust in which the Chatelet was then held To these the officers of the Chatelet promised on oath to submit The ignorance and immorality of the lay officers who had been substituted for the clerical caused much disturbance Parliament authorised two of its principal members to examine the officers of the Chatelet Twenty years later on the receipt of fresh complaints Parliament decided that three qualified councillors chosen from its own body should proceed with the King s attorney to the Chatelet so as to reform the abuses and informalities of that court Illustration Fig three hundred four The King s Court or Grand Council Fac simile of a Miniature in the Chroniques of Froissart Manuscript of the Fifteenth Century formerly in the possession of Charles V in the Library of the Arsenal Paris In the time of Philippe le Bel there existed in reality but one Parliament and that was the King s Court Its action was at once political administrative financial and judicial and was necessarily therefore of a most complicated character Philippe le Bel made it exclusively a judicial court defined the territorial limit of its power and gave it as a judicial body privileges tending to strengthen its independence and to raise its dignity He assigned political functions to the Great Council Conseil d Etat financial matters to the chamber of accounts and the hearing of cases of heresy wills legacies and dowries to the prelates But in opposition to the wise edict of twelve ninety five he determined that Jews should be excluded from Parliament and prelates from the palace of justice by which latter proceeding he was depriving justice of the abilities of the most worthy representatives of the Gallican Church But Philippe le Bel and his successors while incessantly quarrelling either with the aristocracy or with the clergy wanted the great judicial bodies which issued the edicts and the urban or municipal magistrates which being subject to re election were principally recruited from among the bourgeois to be a common centre of opposition to any attempt at usurpation of power whether on the part of the Church the nobility or the crown The Great Days of Troyes dies magni Trecenses the assizes of the ancient counts of Champagne and the exchequer of Normandy were also organized by Philipe le Bel and further he authorised the maintenance of a Parliament at Toulouse a court which he solemnly opened in person on the tenth of January thirteen oh two In times of war the Parliament of Paris sat once a year in times of peace twice There were according to circumstances during the year two three or four sittings of the exchequer of Normandy and two of the Great Days of Troyes tribunals which were annexed to the Parliament of Paris and generally presided over by one of its delegates and sometimes even by the supreme head of that high court At the King s council Fig three hundred four it was decided whether a case should be reserved for the Parliament of Paris or passed on either to the exchequer or to the Great Days of Troyes As that advanced reformer Philippe le Bel died before the institutions he had established had taken root for many years even down to the time of Louis XI a continual conflict for supremacy was waged between the Parliament of Paris and the various courts of the kingdom between the counts and the Parliament and between the latter and the King which without lessening the dignity of the crown gradually tended to increase the influence which the judges possessed Immediately on the accession of Louis le Hutin in thirteen fourteen a reaction commenced the higher clergy re entered Parliament but Philippe le Long took care that the laity should be in a majority and did not allow that in his council of State the titled councillors should be more numerous than the lawyers The latter succeeded in completely carrying the day on account of the services they rendered and the influence which their knowledge of the laws of the country gave them As for centuries the sword had ruled the gown so since the emancipation of the bourgeois the lawyers had become masters of the administrative and judicial world and notwithstanding the fact that they were still kept in a somewhat inferior position to the peers and barons their opinion alone predominated and their decision frequently at once settled the most important questions An edict issued at Val Notre Dame on the eleventh of March thirteen forty four increased the number of members of Parliament which from that time consisted of three presidents fifteen clerical councillors fifteen lay councillors twenty four clergymen and sixteen laymen of the Court of Inquiry and five clergymen and sixteen laymen of the Court of Petitions The King filled up the vacant seats on the recommendation of the Chancellor and of the Parliament The reporters were enjoined to write the decisions and sentences which were given by the court in large letters and far apart so that they might be more easily read The duties of police in the courts the keeping of the doors and the internal arrangements generally for those attending the courts and the Parliament were entrusted to the ushers who divided among themselves the gratuities which were given them by virtue of their office Before an advocate was admitted to plead he was required to take oath and to be inscribed on the register The Parliament as then established was somewhat similar in its character to that of the old national representative government under the Germans and Franks For centuries it protected the King against the undue interference of the spiritual power it defended the people against despotism but it often lacked independence and political wisdom and it was not always remarkable for its correct appreciation of men and things This tribunal although supreme over all public affairs sometimes wavered before the threats of a minister or of a court favourite succumbed to the influence of intrigues and adapted itself to the prejudices of the times We see it in moments of error and of blindness both condemning eminent statesmen and leading citizens such as Jacques Coeur and Robertet and handing over to the executioner distinguished men of learning and science in advance of the times in which they lived because they were falsely accused of witchcraft and also doing the same towards unfortunate maniacs who fancied they had dealings with the devil Illustration Fig three hundred five Trial of the Constable de Bourbon before the Peers of France fifteen twenty three From an Engraving in La Monarchie Francoise of Montfaucon In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries all the members of Parliament formed part of the council of State which was divided into the Smaller Council and the Greater Council The Greater Council only assembled in cases of urgency and for extraordinary and very important purposes the Smaller Council assembled every month and its decisions were registered From this arose the custom of making a similar registration in Parliament confirming the decisions after they had been formally arrived at The most ancient edict placed on the register of the Parliament of Paris dates from the year thirteen thirty four and is of a very important character It concerns a question of royal authority and decides that in spiritual matters the right of supremacy does not belong more to the Pope than to the King Consequently Philippe de Valois ordered his friends and vassals who shall attend the next Parliament and the keepers of the accounts that for the perpetual record of so memorable a decision it shall be registered in the Chambers of Parliament and kept for reference in the Treasury of the Charters From that time cases of complaint and other matters relating to benefices have no longer been discussed before the ecclesiastical judges but before Parliament or some other secular court During the captivity of King John in England royal authority having considerably declined the powers of Parliament and other bodies of the magistracy so increased that under Charles VI the Parliament of Paris was bold enough to assert that a royal edict should not become law until it had been registered in Parliament This bold and certainly novel proceeding the kings nevertheless did not altogether oppose as they foresaw that the time would come when it might afford them the means of repudiating a treaty extorted from them under difficult circumstances Fig three hundred six The close connection which existed between the various Parliaments and their political functions for they had occasion incessantly to interfere between the acts of the government and the respective pretensions of the provinces or of the three orders naturally increased the importance of this supreme magistracy More than once the kings had cause to repent having rendered it so powerful and this was the case especially with the Parliament of Paris In this difficulty it is interesting to note how the kings acted They imperceptibly curtailed the various powers of the other courts of justice they circumscribed the power of the Parliament of Paris and proportionately enlarged the jurisdiction of the great bailiwicks as also that of the Chatelet The provost of Paris was an auxiliary as well as a support to the royal power which nevertheless held him in its grasp The Chatelet was also a centre of action and of strength which counteracted in certain cases parliamentary opposition Thence arose the most implacable rivalries and dissensions between these various parties Illustration Fig three hundred six Promulgation of an Edict Fac simile of a Miniature in Anciennetes des Juifs French Translation from Josephus Manuscript of the Fifteenth Century executed for the Duke of Burgundy Library of the Arsenal of Paris It is curious to notice with what ingenuity and how readily Parliament took advantage of the most trifling circumstances or of charges based upon the very slightest grounds to summon the officers of the Chatelet before its bar on suspicion of prevarication or of outrages against religion morals or the laws Often were these officers and the provost himself summoned to appear and make amende honourable before the assembly notwithstanding which they retained their offices More than once an officer of the Chatelet was condemned to death and executed but the King always annulled that part of the sentence which had reference to the confiscation of the goods of the condemned thus proving that in reality the condemnation had been unjust although for grave reasons the royal authority had been unable to save the victim from the avenging power of Parliament Hugues Aubriot the provost was thus condemned to imprisonment for life on the most trivial grounds and he would have undergone capital punishment if Charles V had abandoned him at the time of his trial During the English occupation in the disastrous reign of Charles VI the Chatelet of Paris which took part with the people gave proof of extraordinary energy and of great force of character The blood of many of its members was shed on the scaffold and this circumstance must ever remain a reproach to the judges and to those who executed their cruel sentences and a lasting crown of glory to the martyrs themselves An edict of King John issued after his return from London in thirteen sixty three a short time before his death clearly defined the duties of Parliament They were to try cases which concerned peers of France and such prelates chapters barons corporations and councils as had the privilege of appealing to the supreme court and to hear cases relating to estates and appeals from the provost of Paris the bailiffs seneschals and other judges Fig three hundred seven It disregarded minor matters but took cognizance of all judicial debates which concerned religion the King or the State We must remark here that advocates were only allowed to speak twice in the same cause and that they were subjected to fine or at least to remonstrance if they were tedious or indulged in needless repetition in their replies and especially if they did not keep carefully to the facts of the case After pleading they were permitted to give a summary in writing of the principal points of importance as well as their clients grounds of defence Charles V confirmed these orders and regulations with respect to advocates and added others which were no less important among which we find a provision for giving legal assistance to poor and destitute persons who go to law These regulations of Charles also limited the time in which officers of justice were to get through their business under a certain penalty they also proclaimed that the King should no longer hear minor causes and that whatever might be the rules of the court they forbad the presidents from deferring their judgment or from retarding the regular course of justice Charles VI before he became insane contributed no less than his father to the establishment on a better footing of the supreme court of the kingdom as well as that of the Chatelet and the bailiwicks Illustration Fig three hundred seven Bailiwick Fac simile of a Woodcut in the Cosmographie Universelle of Munster in folio Basle fifteen fifty two In the fifteenth century the Parliament of Paris was so organized as not to require material change till seventeen eighty nine There were noble clerical and lay councillors honorary members and maitres de requete only four of whom sat a first president who was supreme head of the Parliament a master of the great chamber of pleas and three presidents of the chamber all of whom were nominated for life There were fifteen masters maistres or clerical councillors and fifteen who were laymen and these were annually approved by the King on the opening of the session An attorney general several advocates general and deputies who formed a committee or college constituted the active part of this court round which were grouped consulting advocates consiliarii pleading advocates proponentes advocates who were mere listeners audientes ushers and serjeants whose chief on his appointment became a member of the nobility The official costume of the first president resembled that of the ancient barons and knights He wore a scarlet gown lined with ermine and a black silk cap ornamented with tassels In winter he wore a scarlet mantle lined with ermine over his gown on which his crest was worked on a shield This mantle was fastened to the left shoulder by three gold cords in order to leave the sword side free because the ancient knights and barons always sat in court wearing their swords Amongst the archives of the mayoralty of London we find in the account of the entry of Henry V King of England into Paris on the first of December fourteen twenty that the first president was in royal dress estoit en habit roial the first usher preceding him and wearing a fur cap the church dignitaries wore blue robes and hoods and all the others in the procession scarlet robes and hoods This imposing dress in perfect harmony with the dignity of the office of those who wore them degenerated towards the fifteenth century So much was this the case that an order of Francis I forbad the judges from wearing pink slashed hose or other rakish garments In the early times of monarchy the judicial functions were performed gratuitously but it was the custom to give presents to the judges consisting of sweetmeats spices sugar plums and preserves until at a subsequent period fourteen ninety eight when as the judges preferred money to sweetmeats says the Chancellor Etienne Pasquier the money value of the spices c was fixed by law and made compulsory In the bills of expenses preserved among the national archives we find that the first president of the Parliament of Paris received a thousand livres parisis annually representing upwards of one hundred thousand francs at the present rate of money the three presidents of the chamber five hundred livres equal to fifty thousand francs and the other nobles of the said Parliament five sols parisis or six sols three deniers about twenty five francs per day for the days only on which they sat They received besides two mantles annually The prelates princes and barons who were chosen by the King received no salaries ils ne prennent nuls guaiges law of twenty seventh January thirteen sixty seven The seneschals and high bailiffs like the presidents of the chambers received five hundred livres fifty thousand francs They and the bailiffs of inferior rank were expressly forbidden from receiving money or fees from the parties in any suit but they were allowed to accept on one day refreshment and bottles of wine The salaries were paid monthly but this was not always done regularly sometimes the King was to blame for this and sometimes it was owing to the ill nature of the chiefs of finance or of the receivers and payers When the blame rested with the King the Parliament humbly remonstrated or closed the court When on the contrary an officer of finance did not pay the salaries Parliament sent him the bailiff s usher and put him under certain penalties until he had done so The question of salaries was frequently arising On the ninth of February thirteen sixty nine the court having been requested to serve without any remuneration for one Parliament on the understanding that the King would make up for it another time the nobles of the court replied after private deliberation that they were ready to do the King s pleasure but could not do so properly without receiving their salaries Register of the Parliament of Paris At the commencement of the fifteenth century the scale of remuneration was not increased In fourteen eleven it was raised for the whole Parliament to twenty five thousand livres which calculated according to the present rate amounted to nearly a million francs In consequence of financial difficulties and the general distress the unpleasant question in reference to claims for payment of salaries was renewed with threats that the course of justice would be interrupted if they were not paid or not promised On the second of October fourteen nineteen two councillors and one usher were sent to the house of one of the chiefs of finance with orders to demand payment of the salaries of the court In October fourteen thirty the government owed the magistrates two years of arrears After useless appeals to the Regent and to the Bishop of Therouanne the then Chancellor of France the Parliament sent two of its members to the King at Rouen who obtained after much difficulty one month s pay on the understanding that the Parliament should hold its sittings in the month of April In the month of July fourteen thirty one there was another deputation to the King in order to lay before him the necessities of the court and that it had for some time been prorogued and was still prorogued on account of the non payment of salaries After two months of repeated remonstrance the deputies only bringing back promises the court assumed a menacing aspect and on the eleventh of January fourteen thirty seven it pointed out to the chancellor the evil which would arise if Parliament ceased to hold its sittings and this time the chancellor announced that the salaries would be paid though six months passed without any resuit or any practical step being taken in the matter This state of affairs grew worse until the year fourteen forty three when the King was obliged to plead with the Parliament in the character of an insolvent debtor and in order to obtain remission of part of his debt to the members to guarantee to them a part of the salt duties Charles VII after having reconquered his states hastened to restore order He first occupied himself with the System of justice the Parliament the Chatelet and the bailiwicks and in April fourteen fifty three in concert with the princes the prelates the council of State the judges and others in authority he framed a general law in one hundred and twenty five articles which was considered as the great charter of Parliament Fig three hundred eight According to the terms of these articles the councillors are to sit after dinner to get through the minor causes Prisoners are to be examined without delay and to hold no communication with any one unless by special permission The cases are to be carefully gone through in their proper order for courts are instructed to do justice as promptly for the poor as for the rich as it is a greater hardship for the poor to be kept waiting than the rich The fees of attorneys were taxed and reduced in amount Those of advocates were reduced to such moderation and fairness that there should be no cause for complaint The judgments by commissary were forbidden The bailiffs and seneschals were directed to reside within their districts The councillors were ordered to abstain from all communication with the parties in private and consultations between themselves were to be held in secret The judgments given in lawsuits were inscribed in a register and submitted every two months to the presidents who if necessary called the reporters to account for any neglect of duty The reporter was ordered to draw attention to any point of difficulty arising in a suit and the execution of sentences or judgments was entrusted to the ushers of the court In fourteen fifty four the King in consequence of a difficulty in paying the regular instalments of the usual salaries of the Parliament created after dinner fees des gages d apres dinees of five sols parisis more than ten francs of our money per day payable to those councillors who should hold a second hearing Matters did not improve much however nothing seemed to proceed satisfactorily and members of Parliament deprived of their salaries were compelled to contract a loan in order to commence proceedings against the treasury for the non payment of the amount due to them In fourteen ninety three the annual salaries of Parliament were raised to the sum of forty thousand six hundred thirty livres equal to about one million one hundred thousand francs Illustration Fig three hundred eight Supreme Court presided over by the King who is in the act of issuing a Decree which is being registered by the Usher Fac simile of a Miniature in Camareu of the Information des Rois Manuscript of the Fifteenth Century in the Library of the Arsenal of Paris The first president received four livres twenty two solis parisis about one hundred forty francs per day a clerical councillor twenty five sols parisis about forty francs and a lay councillor twenty sols about thirty two francs This was an increase of a fifth on the preceding year Charles VIII in thus improving the remuneration of the members of the first court of the kingdom reminded them of their duties which had been too long neglected he told them that of all the cardinal virtues justice was the most noble and most important and he pointed out to them the line of conduct they were to pursue The councillors were to be present daily in their respective chambers from saint Martin s day to Easter before seven o clock in the morning and from Easter to the closing of Parliament immediately after six o clock without intermission under penalty of punishment Strict silence was enforced upon them during the debates and they were forbidden to occupy themselves with anything which did not concern the case under discussion Amidst a mass of other points upon which directions are given we notice the following the necessity of keeping secret the matters in course of deliberation the prohibition to councillors from receiving either directly or indirectly anything in the shape of a douceur from the parties in any suit and the forbidding all attorneys from receiving any bribe or claiming more than the actual expenses of a journey and other just charges The great charter of the Parliament promulgated in April fourteen fifty three was thus amended confirmed and completed by this code of Charles VIII with a wisdom which cannot be too highly extolled The magistrature of the supreme courts had been less favoured during the preceding reign Louis XI that cautious and crafty reformer after having forbidden ecclesiastical judges to examine cases referring to the revenues of vacant benefices remodelled the secular courts but he ruthlessly destroyed anything which offended him personally For this reason as he himself said he limited the power of the Parliaments of Paris and Toulouse by establishing to their prejudice several other courts of justice and by favouring the Chatelet where he was sure always to find those who would act with him against the aristocracy The Parliament would not give way willingly nor without the most determined opposition It was obliged however at last to succumb and to pass certain edicts which were most repugnant to it On the death of Louis XI however it took its revenge and called those who had been his favourites and principal agents to answer a criminal charge for no other reason than that they had exposed themselves to the resentment of the supreme court The Chatelet in its judicial functions was inferior to the Parliament nevertheless it acquired through its provost who represented the bourgeois of Paris considerable importance in the eyes of the supreme court In fact for two centuries the provost held the privilege of ruling the capital both politically and financially of commanding the citizen militia and of being chief magistrate of the city In the court of audiences a canopy was erected under which he sat a distinction which no other magistrate enjoyed and which appears to have been exclusively granted to him because he sat in the place of Monsieur Saint Loys Saint Louis dispensing justice to the good people of the City of Paris When the provost was installed he was solemnly escorted wearing his cap to the great chamber of Parliament accompanied by four councillors Illustration Fig three hundred nine The Court of a Baron Fac simile of a Woodcut in the Cosmographie Universelle of Munster in folio Basle fifteen fifty two After the ceremony of installation he gave his horse to the president who had come to receive him His dress consisted of a short robe with mantle collar turned down sword and hat with feathers he also carried a staff of office profusely ornamented with silver Thus attired he attended Parliament and assisted at the levees of the sovereign where he took up his position on the lowest step of the throne below the great Chamberlain Every day excepting at the vintage time he was required to be present at the Chatelet either personally or by deputy punctually at nine in the morning There he received the list of the prisoners who had been arrested the day before after that he visited the prisons settled business of various kinds and then inspected the town His jurisdiction extended to several courts which were presided over by eight deputies or judges appointed by him and who were created officers of the Chatelet by Louis XII in fourteen ninety eight Subsequently these received their appointments direct from the King Two auditing judges one king s attorney one registrar and some bailiffs completed the provost s staff Illustration Fig three hundred ten Sergeants at Arms of the Fourteenth Century carved in Stone From the Church of saint Catherine du Val des Ecoliers in Paris The bailiffs at the Chatelet were divided into five classes the king s sergeant at arms the sergeants de la douzaine the sergeants of the mace or foot sergeants the sergeants fieffes and the mounted sergeants The establishment of these officers dated from the beginning of the fourteenth century and they were originally appointed by the provost but afterwards by the King himself The King s sergeants at arms Fig three hundred ten formed his body guard they were not under the jurisdiction of the high constable but of the ordinary judges which proves that they were in civil employ The sergeants de la douzaine were twelve in number as their name implies all of whom were in the service of the provost the foot sergeants who were civilians were gradually increased to the number of two hundred and twenty as early as the middle of the fifteenth century They acted only in the interior of the capital and guarded the city the suburbs and the surrounding districts whereas the mounted sergeants had to watch over the safety of the rural parishes and to act throughout the whole extent of the provost s jurisdiction and of that of the viscount of Paris In the midst of the changes of the Middle Ages especially after the communes became free all those kings who felt the importance of a strict system of justice particularly saint Louis Philippe le Bel and Charles VIII had seen the necessity of compiling a record of local customs An edict of fourteen fifty three orders that the custom shall be registered in writing so as to be examined by the members of the great council of the Parliament Nevertheless this important work was never properly carried out and to Louis XII is due the honour of introducing a customary or usage law and at the same time of correcting the various modes of procedure upon which customs and usages had been based and which had become singularly antiquated since the edict of thirteen oh two No monarch showed more favour to Parliament than Louis XII During his reign of seventeen years we never find complaints from the magistracy for not having been paid punctually But in contrast with this on the accession of Francis I the court complained of not having been paid its first quarter s salary From that moment claims were perpetually being made there were continually delays or absolute refusals the members were expecting remuneration for their services in order absolutely to enable them to support their families and households We can thus judge of the state of the various minor courts which being less powerful than the supreme tribunals and especially than that of Paris were quite unable to get their murmurings even listened to by the proper authorities This sad state of things continued and in fact grew worse until the assembly of the League when Mayenne the chief of the leaguers in order to gratify the Parliament promised to double the salaries although he was unable to fulfil his promise Illustration Fig three hundred eleven Inferior Court in the Great Bailiwick Adoption of Orphan Children Fac simile of a Woodcut in J Damhoudere s Refuge et Garand

matters in which sums of less than two hundred livres were involved Fig three hundred eleven There existed besides a branch of the Grands Jours occasionally sitting at Poitiers Bayeux and at some other central towns in order to suppress the excesses which at times arose from religious dissensions and political controversy The Parliament of Paris or Great French Parliament as it was called by Philip V and Charles V in edicts of the seventeenth of November thirteen eighteen and of the eighth of October thirteen seventy one was divided into four principal chambers the Grand Chamber the Chamber of Inquiry the Criminal Chamber and the Chamber of Appeal It was composed of ordinary councillors both clerical and lay of honorary councillors some of whom were ecclesiastics and others members of the nobility of masters of inquiry and of a considerable number of officers of all ranks Figs three hundred twelve to three hundred fourteen It had at times as many as twenty four presidents one hundred and eighty two councillors four knights of honour four masters of records a public prosecutor s office was also attached consisting of the king s counsel an attorney general and

one inspector of estates several keepers of refreshment establishments who resided within the precincts of the palace sixty or eighty notaries four or five hundred advocates two hundred attorneys besides registers and deputy registers Down to the reign of Charles VI thirteen eighty fourteen twenty two members of Parliament held their appointment by commissions granted by the King and renewed

Parliament of Paris a permanent one and Francis I continued this privilege In fifteen eighty the supreme magistracy poured one hundred forty million francs which now would be worth fifteen or twenty times as much into the State treasury so as to enable members to sit permanently sur les fleurs de lis and to obtain hereditary privileges The hereditary transmission of office from father to son dealt a heavy blow at the popularity of the parliamentary body which had already deeply suffered through shameful abuses the enormity of the fees the ignorance of some of the members and the dissolute

contrary was less involved in intrigue less occupied with politics and was daily engaged in adjudicating in cases of litigation and thus it rendered innumerable services in promoting the public welfare and maintained and even increased the respect which it had enjoyed from the commencement of its existence In fourteen ninety eight Louis XII required that the provost should possess the title of doctor in utroque jure and that his officers whom he made to hold their appointments for life should be chosen from amongst the most distinguished counsellors at law This excellent arrangement bore its fruits As early as fifteen ten the Usages of the City Provosty and Viscounty of Paris were published in extenso and were then received with much ceremony at a solemn audience held on the eighth of March in the episcopal palace and were deposited among the archives of the Chatelet Fig three hundred fifteen The Parliament held a very different line of policy from that adopted by the Chatelet which only took a political part in the religious troubles of Protestantism and the League with a view to serve and defend the cause of the people In spite of its fits of personal animosity and its rebellious freaks Parliament remained almost invariably attached to the side of the King and the court It always leaned to the absolute maintenance of things as they were instead of following progress and changes which time necessitated It was for severe measures for intimidation more than for gentleness and toleration and it yielded sooner or later to the injunctions and admonitions of the King

Vehmic Tribunal Council of Ten in Venice its Code and Secret Decisions End of the Council of Ten During the Middle Ages human life was generally held in small respect various judicial institutions if not altogether secret at least more or less enveloped in mystery were remarkable for being founded on the monstrous right of issuing the most severe sentences with closed doors and of executing these sentences with inflexible rigour on individuals who had not been allowed the slightest chance of defending themselves While passing judgment in secret they often openly dealt blows as unexpected and terrible as they were fatal Therefore the most innocent and the most daring trembled at the very name of the Free Judges of the Terre Rouge an institution which adopted Westphalia as the special or rather as the central region of its authority the Council of Ten exercised their power in Venice and the states of the republic and the Assassins of Syria in the time of saint Louis made more than one invasion into Christian Europe We must nevertheless acknowledge that terrible as these mysterious institutions were the general credulity the gross ignorance of the masses and the love of the marvellous helped not a little to render them even more outrageous and alarming than they really were Marco Polo the celebrated Venetian traveller of the thirteenth century says We will speak of the Old Man of the Mountain This prince was named Alaodin He had a lovely garden full of all manner of trees and fruits in a beautiful valley surrounded by high hills and all round these plantations were various palaces and pavilions decorated with works of art in gold with paintings and with furniture of silk Therein were to be seen rivulets of wine as well as milk honey and gentle streams of limpid water He had placed therein damsels of transcendent beauty and endowed with great charms who were taught to sing and to play all manner of instruments they were dressed in silk and gold and continually walked in these gardens and palaces The reasons for which the Old Man had these palaces built were the following Mahomet having said that those who should obey his will should go to paradise and there find all kinds of luxuries this prince wished it to be believed that he was the prophet and companion of Mahomet and that he had the power of sending whom he chose to paradise No one could succeed in entering the garden because an impregnable castle had been built at the entrance of the valley and it could only be approached by a covered and secret way The Old Man had in his court some young men from ten to twenty years of age chosen from those inhabitants of the hills who seemed to him capable of bearing arms and who were bold and courageous From time to time he administered a certain drink to ten or twelve of these young men which sent them to sleep and when they were in deep stupor he had them carried into the garden When they awoke they saw all we have described they were surrounded by the young damsels who sang played instruments together caressed them played all sorts of games and presented them with the most exquisite wines and meats Fig three hundred seventeen So that these young men satiated with such pleasures did not doubt that they were in paradise and would willingly have never gone out of it again At the end of four or five days the Old Man sent them to sleep again and had them removed from the garden in the same way in which they had been brought in He then called them before him and asked them where they had been By your grace lord they answered we have been in paradise And then they related in the presence of everybody what they had seen there This tale excited the astonishment of all those who heard it and the desire that they might be equally fortunate The Old Man would then formally announce to those who were present as follows Thus saith the law of our prophet He causes all who fight for their Lord to enter into paradise if you obey me you shall enjoy that happiness By such words and plans this prince had so accustomed them to believe in him that he whom he ordered to die for his service considered himself lucky All the nobles or other enemies of the Old Man of the Mountain were put to death by the assassins in his service for none of them feared death provided he complied with the orders and wishes of his lord However powerful a man might be therefore if he was an enemy of the Old Man s he was sure to meet with an untimely end Illustration Fig three hundred seventeen The Castle of Alamond and its Enchantments Fac simile of a Miniature in Marco Polo s Travels Manuscript of the Fifteenth Century in the Library of the Arsenal of Paris In his story which we translate literally from the original written in ancient French the venerable traveller attributes the origin of this singular system of exercising power over the minds of persons to a prince who in reality did but keep up a tradition of his family for the Alaodin herein mentioned is no other than a successor of the famous Hassan son of Ali who in the middle of the eleventh century took advantage of the wars which devastated Asia to create himself a kingdom comprising the three provinces of Turkistan Djebel and Syria Hassan had embraced the doctrine of the Ishmaelian sect who pretended to explain allegorically all the precepts of the Mahometan religion and who did away with public worship and originated a creed which was altogether philosophical He made himself the chief exponent of this doctrine which by its very simplicity was sure to attract to him many people of simple and sincere minds Attacked by the troops of the Sultan Sindgar he defended himself vigorously and not unsuccessfully but fearing lest he should fall in an unequal and protracted struggle against an adversary more powerful than himself he had recourse to cunning so as to obtain peace He entranced or fascinated probably by means analogous to those related by Marco Polo a slave who had the daring during Sindgar s sleep to stick a sharp dagger in the ground by the side of the Sultan s head On waking Sindgar was much alarmed A few days after Hassan wrote to him If one had not good intentions towards the Sultan one might have driven the dagger which was stuck in the earth by his head into his bosom The Sultan Sindgar then made peace with the chief of the Ishmaelians whose dynasty lasted for one hundred and seventy years The Castle of Alamond built on the confines of Persia on the top of a high mountain surrounded with trees after having been the usual residence of Hassan became that of his successors As in the native language the same word means both prince and old man the Crusaders who had heard the word pronounced confounded the two and gave the name of Old Man of the Mountain to the Ishmaelian prince at that time inhabiting the Castle of Alamond a name which has remained famous in history since the period when the Sire de Joinville published his Memoires Ancient authors call the subjects of Hassan Haschichini Heississini Assissini Assassini various forms of the same expression which in fact has passed into French with a signification which recalls the sanguinary exploits of the Ishmaelians In seeking for the etymology of this name one must suppose that Haschichini is the Latin transformation of the Arabic word Hachychy the name of the sect of which we are speaking because the ecstacies during which they believed themselves removed to paradise were produced by means of haschisch or haschischa We know that this inebriating preparation extracted from hemp really produces the most strange and delicious hallucinations on those who use it All travellers who have visited the East agree in saying that its effects are very superior to those of opium We evidently must attribute to some ecstatic vision the supposed existence of the enchanted gardens which Marco Polo described from popular tales and which of course never existed but in the imagination of the young men who were either mentally excited after fasting and prayer or intoxicated by the haschischa and consequently for a time lulled in dreams of celestial bliss which they imagined awaited them under the guidance of Hassan and his descendants Illustration Fig three hundred eighteen The Old Man of the Mountain giving Orders to his Followers Fac simile of a Miniature in the Travels of Marco Polo Manuscript of the Fifteenth Century Library of the Arsenal of Paris The Haschischini whom certain contemporary historians describe to us as infatuated by the hope of some future boundless felicity owe their melancholy celebrity solely to the blind obedience with which they executed the orders of their chiefs and to the coolness with which they sought the favourable moment for fulfilling their sanguinary missions Fig three hundred eighteen The Old Man of the Mountain the master of daggers magister cultellorum as he is also called by the chronicler Jacques de Vintry was almost continually at war with the Mussulman princes who reigned from the banks of the Nile to the borders of the Caspian Sea He continually opposed them with the steel of his fanatical emissaries at times also making a traffic and merchandise of murder he treated for a money payment with the sultans or emirs who were desirous of ridding themselves of an enemy The Ishmaelians thus put to death a number of princes and Mahometan nobles but at the time of the Crusades religious zeal having incited them against the Christians they found more than one notable victim in the ranks of the Crusaders Conrad Marquis of Montferrat was assassinated by them the great Salah Eddin Saladin himself narrowly escaped them Richard Coeur de Lion and Philip Augustus were pointed out to the assassins by the Old Man who subsequently on hearing of the immense preparations which Louis IX was making for the Holy War had the daring to send two of his followers to France and even into Paris with orders to kill that monarch in the midst of his court This king after having again escaped during his sojourn in Palestine from the murderous attempts of the savage messengers of the Prince of Alamond succeeded by his courage his firmness and his virtues in inspiring these fanatics with so much respect that their chief looking upon him as protected by heaven asked for his friendship and offered him presents amongst which was a magnificent set of chessmen in crystal ornamented with gold and amber The successors of Hassan simultaneously attacked by the Moguls under Houlayon and by the Egyptians commanded by the Sultan Bibars were conquered and dispossessed of their States towards the middle of the thirteenth century but long after the Ishmaelians either because their chiefs sought to recover their power or because they had placed their daggers at the disposal of some foreign foe continued notorious in history At last the sect became extinct or at least retired into obscurity and renounced its murderous profession which had for so long made its members such objects of terror We have thus seen how a legion of fanatics in the East made themselves the blind and formidable tools of a religious and political chieftain who was no less ambitious than revengeful If we now turn our attention to Germany we shall here find almost at the same period a local institution which although very different from the sanguinary court of the Old Man of the Mountain was of an equally terrible and mysterious character We must not however look at it from the same point of view for having been founded with the object of furthering and defending the establishment of a regular social state which had been approved and sanctioned by the sovereigns and recognised by the Church it at times rendered great service to the cause of justice and humanity at a period when might usurped right and when the excesses and the crimes of shameless evil doers and of petty tyrants entrenched in their impregnable strongholds were but too often made lawful from the simple fact that there was no power to oppose them The secret tribunal of Westphalia which held its sittings

remarkable institutions of the Middle Ages Illustration Figs three hundred nineteen and three hundred twenty Hermensul or Irmensul and Crodon Idols of the Ancient Saxons Fac simile of a Woodcut in the Annales Circuli Westphaliae by Herman Stangefol in fourto sixteen fifty six The Idol Hermensul appears to have presided over Executive Justice the attributes of which it holds in its hands It would be difficult to state exactly at what period this formidable institution was established A few writers and amongst these Sebastian Munster wish us to believe that it was founded by Charlemagne himself They affirm that this monarch having subjugated the Saxons to his sway and having forced them to be baptized created a secret tribunal the duties of which were to watch over them in order that they might not return to the errors of Paganism However the Saxons were incorrigible and although Christians they still carried on the worship of their idols Figs three hundred nineteen and three hundred twenty and for this reason it is said by these authorities that the laws of the tribunal of Westphalia were founded by Charlemagne It is well known that from the ninth to the thirteenth century all that part of Germany between the Rhine and the Weser suffered under the most complete anarchy In consequence of this and of the increase of crime which remained unpunished energetic men established a rigorous jurisdiction which to a certain extent suppressed these barbarous disorders and gave some assurance to social intercourse but the very mystery which gave weight to the institution was the cause of its origin being unknown It is only mentioned and then cursorily in historical documents towards the early part of the fifteenth century This court of judicature received the name of Femgericht or Vehmgericht which means Vehmic tribunal The origin of the word Fem Vehm or Fam which has given rise to many scientific discussions still remains in doubt The most generally accepted opinion is that it is derived from a Latin expression vemi vae mihi woe is me The special dominion over which the Vehmic tribunal reigned supreme was Westphalia and the country which was subjected to its laws was designated as the Terre Rouge There was no assembly of this tribunal beyond the limits of this Terre Rouge but it would be quite impossible to define these limits with any accuracy However the free judges assuming the right of suppressing certain crimes committed beyond their territory on more than one occasion summoned persons living in various parts of Germany and even in provinces far from Westphalia to appear before them We do not know all the localities wherein the Vehmic tribunal sat but the most celebrated of them and the one which served as a model for all the rest held its sittings under a lime tree in front of the castle gate of Dortmund Fig three hundred twenty one There the chapters general of the association usually assembled and on certain occasions several thousands of the free judges were to be seen there Each tribunal was composed of an unlimited number of free judges under the presidency of a free count who was charged with the higher administration of Vehmic justice A free county generally comprised several free tribunals or friestuhle The free count who was chosen by the prince of the territory in which the tribunal sat had two courts one secret the other public The public assizes which took place at least three times a year were announced fourteen days beforehand and any person living within the county and who was summoned before the free count was bound to appear and to answer all questions which might be put to him It was required that the free judges who are generally mentioned as femnoten that is to say sages and who are besides denoted by writers of the time by the most honourable epithets such as serious men very pious of very pure morals lovers of justice c should be persons who had been born in lawful wedlock and on German soil they were not allowed to belong to any religions order or to have ever themselves been summoned before the Vehmic tribunal They were nominated by the free counts but subject to the approval of their sovereigns They were not allowed to sit as judges before having been initiated into the mysteries of the tribunals Illustration Fig three hundred twenty one View of the Town of Dortmund in the Sixteenth Century From an Engraving on Copper in P Bertius s Theatrum Geographicum The initiation of a free judge was accompanied by extraordinary formalities The candidate appeared bareheaded he knelt down and placing two fingers of his right hand on his naked sword and on a rope he took oath to adhere to the laws and customs of the holy tribunal to devote his five senses to it and not to allow himself to be allured therefrom either by silver gold or even precious stones to forward the interests of the tribunal above everything illumined by the sun and all that the rain reaches and to defend them against everything which is between heaven and earth The candidate was then given the sign by which members of the association recognised each other This sign has remained unknown and nothing even in the deeds of the Vehmic archives leads one even to guess what it was and every hypothesis on this subject must be looked upon as uncertain or erroneous By one of the fundamental statutes of the Terre Rouge a member convicted of betraying the secrets of the order was condemned to the most cruel punishment but we have every reason for asserting that this sentence was never carried out or even issued against a free judge Illustration Fig three hundred twenty two The Landgrave of Thuringia and his Wife Fac simile of a Miniature in the Collection of the Minnesinger Manuscript of the Fourteenth Century In one case alone during the fourteenth century was an accusation of this sort made and that proved to be groundless It would have been considered the height of treason to have given a relation or a friend the slightest hint that he was being pursued or that he had been condemned by the Holy Vehme in order that he might seek refuge by flight And in consequence of this there was a general mistrust of any one belonging to the tribunal so much so that a brother says a German writer often feared his brother and hospitality was no longer possible The functions of free judges consisted in going about the country seeking out crimes denouncing them and inflicting immediate punishment on any evil doer caught in the act Figs three hundred twenty three

Illustration Figs three hundred twenty three and three hundred twenty four Free Judges Fac simile of two Woodcuts in the Cosmographie Universelle of Munster in folio fifteen fifty two It has been erroneously stated that the sittings of the Vehmic tribunals were held at night in the depths of forests or in subterranean places but it appears that all criminal business was first heard in public and could only be subjected to a secret judgment when the accused had failed either publicly to justify himself or to appear in person When three free judges caught a malefactor in the very act they could seize him judge him and inflict the penalty on the spot In other cases when a tribunal considered that it should pursue an individual it summoned him to appear before it The summons had to be written without erasures on a large sheet of vellum and to bear at least seven seals that of the free count and those of six free judges and these seals generally represented either a man in full armour holding a sword or a simple sword blade or other analagous emblems Figs three hundred twenty five to three hundred twenty seven Two free judges delivered the summons personally where a member of the association was concerned but if the summons affected an individual who was not of the Vehmic order a sworn messenger bore it and placed it in the very hands of the person or slipped it into his house The time given for putting in an appearance was originally six weeks and three days at least but at a later period this time was shortened The writ of summons was repeated three times and each time bore a greater number of seals of free judges so as to verify the legality of the instrument The accused whether guilty or not was liable to a fine for not answering the first summons unless he could prove that it was impossible for him to have done so If he failed to appear on the third summons he was finally condemned en corps et en honneur Illustration Fig three hundred twenty five

emblematical of the punishment deserved by the guilty were placed on the table before the president The judges were bareheaded with bare hands and each wore a cloak over his shoulder and carried no

Wieriex after Gerard de Jode The plaintiff and the defendant were each allowed to produce thirty witnesses The defendant could either defend himself or entrust his case to an advocate whom he brought with him At first any free judge being defendant in a suit enjoyed the privilege of justifying himself on oath but it having been discovered that this privilege was abused all persons of whatever station were compelled to be confronted with the other side The witnesses who were subpoened by either accuser or accused had to give their evidence according to the truth dispassionately and voluntarily In the event of the accused not succeeding in bringing sufficient testimony to clear himself the prosecutor claimed a verdict in his favour from the free count presiding at the tribunal who appointed one of the free judges to declare it In case the free judge did not feel satisfied as to the guilt he could by making oath temporarily divest himself of his office which devolved upon a second a third or even a fourth free judge If four free judges were unable to decide the matter was referred to another sitting for judgment had to be pronounced by the appointed free judge at the sitting The various penalties for different crimes were left to the decision of the tribunal The rules are silent on the subject and simply state that the culprits will be punished according to the authority of the secret bench The royale i e capital punishment was strictly applied in all serious cases and the manner of execution most in use was hanging Figs three hundred twenty nine three hundred thirty A person accused who did not appear after the third summons was out lawed by a terrible sentence which deprived him of all rights of common peace and forbad him the company of all Christians by the wording of this sentence his wife was looked upon as a widow his children as orphans his neck was abandoned to the birds of the air and his body to the beasts of the field but his soul was recommended to God At the expiration of one year and a day if the culprit had not appeared or had not established his common rights all his goods were confiscated and appropriated by the King or Emperor When the condemnation referred to a prince a town or a corporation for the accusations of the tribunal frequently were issued against groups of individuals it caused the loss of all honour authority and privileges The free count in pronouncing the sentence threw the rope which was before him on to the ground the free judges spat upon it and the name of the culprit was inscribed on the book of blood The sentence was kept secret the prosecutor alone was informed of it by a written notice which was sealed with seven seals When the condemned was present the execution took place immediately and according to the custom of the Middle Ages its carrying out was deputed to the youngest of the free judges The members of the Vehmic association enjoyed the privilege of being hung seven feet higher than those who were not associates The Vehmic judgments were however liable to be appealed against the accused might at the sitting appeal either to what was termed the imperial chamber a general chapter of the association which assembled at Dortmund or and this was the more frequent custom to the emperor or ruler of the country whether he were king prince duke or bishop provided that these authorities belonged to the association The revision of the judgment could only be entrusted to members of the tribunal who in their turn could only act in Westphalia The condemned might also appeal to the lieutenant general of the emperor or to the grand master of the Holy Vehme a title which from the remotest times was given to the Archbishop of Cologne There are even instances of appeals having been made to the councils and to the Popes although the Vehmic association never had any communication or intercourse with the court of Rome We must not forget a very curious privilege which in certain cases was left to the culprit as a last resource he might appeal to the emperor and solicit an order which required the execution of the sentence to be applied after a delay of one hundred years six weeks and one day Illustration Figs three hundred twenty nine and three hundred thirty Execution of the Sentences of the Secret Tribunal Fac simile of Woodcuts in the Cosmographie Universelle of Munster in folio Basle fifteen fifty two The chapter general of the association was generally summoned once a year by the emperor or his lieutenant and assembled either at Dortmund or Arensberg in order to receive the returns of causes judged by the various Vehmic tribunals to hear the changes which had taken place among the members of the order to receive the free judges to hear appeals and lastly to decide upon reforms to be introduced into the rules These reforms usually had reference to the connection of imperial authority with the members of the secret jurisdiction and were generally suggested by the emperors who were jealous of the increasing power of the association From what we have shown on the authority of authentic documents we understand how untrue is the tradition or rather the popular idea that the Secret Tribunal was an assembly of bloodthirsty judges secretly perpetrating acts of mere cruelty without any but arbitrary laws It is clear on the contrary that it was a regular institution having it is true a most mysterious and complex organization but simply acting in virtue of legal prescriptions which were rigorously laid down and arranged in a sort of code which did honour to the wisdom of those who had created it It was towards the end of the fourteenth and the beginning of the fifteenth centuries that the Vehmic jurisdiction reached its highest degree of power its name was only pronounced in a whisper and with trembling its orders were received with immediate submission and its chastisements always fell upon the guilty and those who resisted its authority There cannot be a doubt but that the Westphalian tribunal prevented many great crimes and public misfortunes by putting a wholesome check on the nobles who were ever ready to place themselves above all human authority and by punishing with pitiless severity the audacity of bandits who would otherwise have been encouraged to commit the most daring acts with almost the certainty of escaping with impunity But the Holy Vehme blinded by the terror it inspired was not long without displaying the most extravagant assumption of power and digressing from the strict path to which its action should have been confined It summoned before its tribunals princes who openly denied its authority and cities which did not condescend to answer to its behests In the fifteenth century the free judges were composed of men who could not be called of unimpeachable integrity many persons of doubtful morals having been raised to the dignity by party influence and by money The partiality and the spirit of revenge which at times prompted their judgments were complained of they were accused of being open to corruption and this accusation appears to have been but too well founded It is known that according to a feudal practice established in the Vehmic system every new free judge was obliged to make a present to the free count who had admitted him into the order and the free counts did not hesitate to make this an important source of revenue to themselves by admitting according to an historian many people as judges who in reality deserved to be judged

Three Persons of the Trinity and the seven small ones the Electors of the Empire Illustration Fig three hundred thirty two German Knights Fifteenth Century From a Plate in the Life of the Emperor Maximilian engraved by Burgmayer from Drawings by Albert Durer Owing to the most flagrant and most insolent abuses of power the ancient authority of the institution became gradually more and more shaken On one occasion for instance in answer to a summons issued by the Imperial Tribunal against some free judges the tribunal of the Terre Rouge had the daring to summon the Emperor Frederick III before it to answer for this want of respect On another occasion a certain free count jealous of one of his associates hung him with his own hands while out on a hunting excursion alleging that his rank of free judge authorised him to execute summary justice From that time there was a perpetual cry of horror and indignation against a judicial institution which thus interpreted its duties and before long the State undertook the suppression of these secret tribunals The first idea of this was formed by the electors of the empire at the diet of Treves in fifteen twelve The Archbishop of Cologne succeeded however in parrying the blow by convoking the chapter general of the order on the plea of the necessity of reform But besides being essentially corrupt the Holy Vehme had really run its course and it gradually became effete as by degrees a better organized and more defined social and political state succeeded to the confused anarchy of the Middle Ages and as the princes and free towns adopted the custom of dispensing justice either in person or through regular tribunals Its proceedings becoming more and more summary and rigorous daily gave rise to feelings of greater and greater abhorrence The common saying over all Germany was They first hang you and afterwards inquire into your innocence On all sides opposition arose against the jurisdiction of the free judges Princes bishops cities and citizens agreed instinctively to counteract this worn out and degenerate institution The struggle was long and tedious During the last convulsions of the expiring Holy Vehme there was more than one sanguinary episode both on the side of the free judges themselves as well as on that of their adversaries Occasionally the secret tribunal broke out into fresh signs of life and proclaimed its existence by some terrible execution and at times also its members paid dearly for their acts On one occasion in fifteen seventy fourteen free judges whom Kaspar Schwitz Count of Oettingen caused to be seized were already tied up in bags and about to be drowned when the mob pitying their fate asked for and obtained their reprieve The death blow to the Vehmic tribunal was struck by its own hand It condenmed summarily and executed without regular procedure an inhabitant of Munster who used to scandalize the town by his profligacy He was arrested at night led to a small wood where the free judges awaited him and condemned to death without being allowed an advocate and after being refused a respite even of a few hours that he might make his peace with heaven he was confessed by a monk and his head was severed from his body by the executioner on the spot Illustration Fig three hundred thirty three Interior Court of the Palace of the Doges of Venice Buildings in which are the Cells and the Leads From Cesare Vecellio Dating from this tragical event which excited universal indignation the authority of the free judges gradually declined and at last the institution became almost defunct and merely confined itself to occasionally adjudicating in simple civil matters We must not omit to mention the Council of Ten of Venice when speaking on the subject of arbitrary executions and of tyrannical and implacable justice In some respects it was more notorious than the Vehmic tribunal exercising as it did a no less mysterious power and inspiring equal terror though in other countries This secret tribunal was created after a revolt which burst on the republic of Venice on the fifteenth of June thirteen ten At first it was only instituted for two months but after various successive prorogations it was confirmed for five years on the thirty first of January thirteen eleven In thirteen sixteen it was again appointed for five years on the second of May thirteen twenty seven for ten years more and at last was established permanently In the fifteenth century the authority of the Council of Ten was consolidated and rendered more energetic by the creation of the Inquisitors of State These were three in number elected by the Council of Ten and the citizens on whom the votes fell could not refuse the functions which were thus spontaneously and often unexpectedly assigned to them The authority of Inquisitors of State was declared to be unlimited In order to show the power and mode of action of this terrible tribunal it is perhaps better to make a few extracts from the code of rules which it established for itself in June fourteen fifty four This document several manuscript copies of which are to be found in the public libraries of Paris says The inquisitors may proceed against any person whomsoever no rank giving the right of exemption from their jurisdiction They may pronounce any sentence even that of death only their final sentences must be passed unanimously They shall have complete charge of the prisons and the leads Fig three hundred thirty three They may draw at sight from the treasury of the Council of Ten without having to give any account of the use made of the funds placed in their hands The proceedings of the tribunal shall always be secret its members shall wear no distinctive badge No open arrests shall be made The chief of the bailiffs sbirri shall avoid making domiciliary arrests but he shall try to seize the culprit unawares away from his home and so securely get him under the leads of the Palace of the Doges When the tribunal shall deem the death of any person necessary the execution shall never be public the condemned shall be drowned at night in the Orfano Canal The tribunal shall authorise the generals commanding in Cyprus or in Candia in the event of its being for the welfare of the Republic to cause any patrician or other influential person in either of those Venetian provinces to disappear or to be assassinated secretly if such a measure should conscientiously appear to them indispensable but they shall be answerable before God for it Illustration Fig three hundred thirty four

Republic he shall be ordered to return to his country and should he not obey all his nearest relatives shall be imprisoned in order that his affection for them may bring him to obedience Should he still persist in his disobedience secret measures shall be taken to put him to death wherever he may be If a Venetian noble reveal to the tribunal propositions which have been made to him by some foreign ambassador the agent excepting it should be the ambassador himself shall be immediately carried off and drowned If a patrician having committed any misdeed shall take refuge under the protection of a foreign ambassador he shall be put to death forthwith If any noble in full senate take upon himself to question the authority of the Council of Ten and persist in attacking it he shall be allowed to speak without interruption immediately afterwards he shall be arrested and instructions as to his trial shall be given so that he may be judged by the ordinary tribunals and if this does not succeed in preventing his proceedings he shall be put to death secretly In case of a complaint against one of the heads of the Council of Ten the instructions shall be made secretly and in case of sentence of death poison shall be the agent selected Should any dissatisfied noble speak ill of the Government he shall first be forbidden to appear in the councils and public places for two years Should he not obey or should he repeat the offence after the two years he shall be drowned as incorrigible c One can easily understand that in order to carry out these laws the most careful measures were taken to organize a system of espionage The nobles were subjected to a rigorous supervision the privacy of letters was not respected an ambassador was never lost sight of and his smallest acts were narrowly watched Any one who dared to throw obstacles in the way of the spies employed by the Council of Ten was put on the rack and made afterwards to receive the punishment which the State inquisitors might consider befitting Whole pages of the secret statutes bear witness that lying and fraud formed the basis of all the diplomatic relations of the Venetian Government Nevertheless the Council of Ten which was solely instituted with the view of watching over the safety of the Republic could not inter meddle in civil cases and its members were forbidden to hold any sort of communication with foreigners Illustration Figs three hundred thirty five and three hundred thirty six Chiefs of Sbirri in the Secret Service of the Council of Ten From Cesare Vecellio The list of

Borromeo Memo punished but three witnesses of the crime which was imputed to him were condemned to a year s imprisonment and three years banishment for not having denounced the deed between evening and morning In fourteen fifty seven we find the Council of Ten attacking the Doge himself by requiring the abdication of Francis Foscari A century earlier it had caused the Doge Marino Faliero who was

Imprisonment Regulations of Prisons The Iron Cage The Leads of Venice It is very sad says the learned M de Villegille to observe the infinite variety of tortures which have existed since the beginning of the world It is in fact difficult to realise the amount of ingenuity exercised by men in inventing new tortures in order to give themselves the satisfaction of seeing their fellow creatures agonizing in the most awful sufferings In entering upon the subject of ancient modes of punishment we must first speak of the torture which according to the received phrase might be either previous or preparatory previous when it consisted of a torture which the condemned had to endure previous to capital punishment and preparatory when it was applied in order to elicit from the culprit an avowal of his crime or of that of his accomplices It was also called ordinary or extraordinary according to the duration or violence with which it was inflicted In some cases the torture lasted five or six consecutive hours in others it rarely exceeded an hour Hippolyte de Marsillis the learned and venerable jurisconsult of Bologna who lived at the beginning of the fifteenth century mentions fourteen ways of inflicting torture The compression of the limbs by special instruments or by ropes only injection of water vinegar or oil into the body of the accused application of hot pitch and starvation were the processes most in use Other means which were more or less applied according to the fancy of the magistrate and the tormentor or executioner were remarkable for their singular atrocities For instance placing hot eggs under the arm pits introducing dice between the skin and flesh tying lighted candles to the fingers so that they might be consumed simultaneously with the wax letting water trickle drop by drop from a great height on the stomach and also the custom which was according to writers on criminal matters an indescribable torture of watering the feet with salt water and allowing goats to lick them However every country had special customs as to the manner of applying torture In France too the torture varied according to the provinces or rather according to the parliaments For instance in Brittany the culprit tied in an iron chair was gradually brought near a blazing furnace In Normandy one thumb was squeezed in a screw in the ordinary and both thumbs in the extraordinary torture At Autun after high boots made of spongy leather had been placed on the culprit s feet he was tied on to a table near a large fire and a quantity of boiling water was poured on the boots which penetrated the leather ate away the flesh and even dissolved the bones of the victim At Orleans for the ordinary torture the accused was stripped half naked and his hands were tightly tied behind his back with a ring fixed between them Then by means of a rope fastened to this ring they raised the poor man who had a weight of one hundred and eighty pounds attached to his feet a certain height from the ground For the extraordinary torture which then took the name of estrapade they raised the victim with two hundred and fifty pounds attached to his feet to the ceiling by means of a capstan he was then allowed to fall several times successively by jerks to the level of the ground by which means his arms and legs were completely dislocated Fig three hundred forty At Avignon the ordinary torture consisted in hanging the accused by the wrists with a heavy iron ball at each foot for the extraordinary torture which was then much in use in Italy under the name of veglia the body was stretched horizontally by means of ropes passing through rings riveted into the wall and attached to the four limbs the only support given to the culprit being the point of a stake cut in a diamond shape which just touched the end of the back bone A doctor and a surgeon were always present feeling the pulse at the temples of the patient so as to be able to judge of the moment when he could not any longer bear the pain Illustration Fig three hundred forty The Estrapade or Question Extraordinary Fac simile of a Woodcut in the Work of J Millaeus Praxis Criminis Persequendi folio Paris fifteen forty one Illustration Fig three hundred forty one The Water Torture Fac simile of a Woodcut in J Damhoudere s Praxis Rerum Criminalium in fourto Antwerp fifteen fifty six At that moment he was untied hot fomentations were used to revive him restoratives were administered and as soon as he had recovered a little strength he was again put to the torture which went on thus for six consecutive hours In Paris for a long time the water torture was in use this was the most easily borne and the least dangerous A person undergoing it was tied to a board which was supported horizontally on two trestles By means of a horn acting as a funnel and whilst his nose was being pinched so as to force him to swallow they slowly poured four coquemars about nine pints of water into his mouth this was for the ordinary torture For the extraordinary double that quantity was poured in Fig three hundred forty one When the torture was ended the victim was untied and taken to be warmed in the kitchen says the old text At a later period the brodequins were preferred For this torture the victim was placed in a sitting posture on a massive bench with strong narrow boards fixed inside and outside of each leg which were tightly bound together with strong rope wedges were then driven in between the centre boards with a mallet four wedges in the ordinary and eight in the extraordinary torture Not unfrequently during the latter operation the bones of the legs were literally burst The brodequins which were often used for ordinary torture were stockings of parchment into which it was easy enough to get the feet when it was wet but which on being held near the fire shrunk so considerably that it caused insufferable agony to the wearer Whatever manner of torture was applied the accused before undergoing it was forced to remain eight or ten hours without eating Damhoudere in his famous technical work called Practique et Enchiridion des Causes Criminelles fifteen forty four also recommends that the hair should be carefully shaved from the bodies of persons about to undergo examination by torture for fear of their concealing some countercharm which would render them insensible to bodily pain The same author also recommends as a rule when there are several persons to be placed on the rack for the same deed to begin with those from whom it would be most probable that confession would be first extorted Thus for instance when a man and a woman were to suffer one after the other he recommended that the woman be first tortured as being the weaker of the two when a father and son were concerned the son should be tortured in presence of the father who naturally fears more for his son than for himself We thereby see that the judges were adepts in the art of adding moral to physical tortures The barbarous custom of punishment by torture was on several occasions condemned by the Church As early as eight hundred sixty six we find from Pope Nicholas V s letter to the Bulgarians that their custom of torturing the accused was considered contrary to divine as well as to human law For says he a confession should be voluntary and not forced By means of the torture an innocent man may suffer to the utmost without making any avowal and in such a case what a crime for the judge Or the person may be subdued by pain and may acknowledge himself guilty although he be not so which throws an equally great sin upon the judge Illustration Fig three hundred forty two Type of Executioner in the Decapitation of John the Baptist Thirteenth Century Fac

special tormentors or executioners the condemned was at last handed over to the maistre des haultes oeuvres that is to say the executioner whose special mission was that of sending culprits to another world Fig three hundred forty two Illustration Fig three hundred forty three Swiss Grand Provost Fifteenth Century From a Painting in the Danse des Morts of Basle engraved by Merian The executioner did not hold the same position in all countries For whereas in France Italy and Spain a certain amount of odium was attached to this terrible craft in Germany on the contrary successfully carrying out a certain number of capital sentences was rewarded by titles and the privileges of nobility Fig three hundred forty three At Reutlingen in Suabia the last of the councillors admitted into the tribunal had to carry out the sentence with his own hand In Franconia this painful duty fell upon the councillor who had last taken a wife In France the executioner otherwise called the King s Sworn Tormentor was the lowest of the officers of justice His letters of appointment which he received from the King had nevertheless to be registered in Parliament but after having put the seal on them it is said that the chancellor threw them under the table in token of contempt The executioner was generally forbidden to live within the precincts of the city unless it was on the grounds where the pillory was situated and in some cases so that he might not be mistaken amongst the people he was forced to wear a particular coat either of red or yellow On the other hand his duties ensured him certain privileges In Paris he possessed the right of havage which consisted in taking all that he could hold in his hand from every load of grain which was brought into market however in order that the grain might be preserved from ignominious contact he levied his tax with a wooden spoon He enjoyed many similar rights over most articles of consumption independently of benefiting by several taxes or fines such as the toll on the Petit Pont the tax on foreign traders on boats arriving with fish on dealers in herrings watercress c and the fine of five sous which was levied on stray pigs see previous chapter c And lastly besides the personal property of the condemned he received the rents from the shops and stalls surrounding the pillory in which the retail fish trade was carried on It appears that in consequence of the receipts from these various duties forming a considerable source of revenue the prestige of wealth by degrees dissipated the unfavourable impressions traditionally attached to the duties of executioner At least we have authority for supposing this when for instance in fourteen eighteen we see the Paris executioner who was then captain of the bourgeois militia coming in that capacity to touch the hand of the Duke of Burgundy on the occasion of his solemn entry into Paris with Queen Isabel of Bavaria We may add that popular belief generally ascribed to the executioner a certain practical knowledge of medicine which was supposed inherent in the profession itself and the acquaintance with certain methods of cure unknown to doctors was attributed to him people went to buy from him the fat of culprits who had been hung which was supposed to be a marvellous panacea We may also remark that in our day the proficiency of the executioner in setting dislocated limbs is still proverbial in many countries Illustration Fig three hundred forty four Amende Honorable before the Tribunal Fac simile of a Woodcut in J Damhoudere s Praxis Rerum Criminalium in fourto Antwerp fifteen fifty six More than once during the thirteenth century the duties of the executioner were performed by women but only in those cases in which their own sex was concerned for it is expressly stated in an order of saint Louis that persons convicted of blasphemy shall be beaten with birch rods the men by men and the women by women only without the presence of men This however was not long tolerated for we know that a period soon arrived when women were exempted from a duty so little adapted to their physical weakness and moral sensitiveness The learned writer on criminal cases Josse Damhoudere whom we have already mentioned and whom we shall take as our special guide in the enumeration of the various tortures specifies thirteen ways in which the executioner carries out his executions and places them in the following order Fire the sword mechanical force quartering the wheel the fork the gibbet drawing spiking cutting off the ears dismembering flogging or beating and the pillory Illustration Fig three hundred forty five The Punishment by Fire Fac simile of a Woodcut of the Cosmographie Universelle of Munster in folio Basle fifteen fifty two But before entering upon the details of this revolting subject we must state that whatever punishment was inflicted upon a culprit it was very rare that its execution had not been preceded by the amende honorable which in certain cases constituted a distinct punishment but which generally was but the prelude to the torture itself The amende honorable which was called simple or short took place without the assistance of the executioner in the council chamber where the condemned bareheaded and kneeling had to state that he had falsely said or done something against the authority of the King or the honour of some person Fig three hundred forty four For the amende honorable in figuris that is to say in public the condemned in his shirt barefooted the rope round his neck followed by the executioner and holding in his hand a wax taper with a weight which was definitely specified in the sentence which had been passed upon him but which was generally of two or four pounds prostrated himself at the door of a church where in a loud voice he had to confess his sin and to beg the pardon of God and man When a criminal had been condemned to be burnt a stake was erected on the spot specially designed for the execution and round it a pile was prepared composed of alternate layers of straw and wood and rising to about the height of a man Care was taken to leave a free space round the stake for the victim and also a passage by which to lead him to it Having been stripped of his clothes and dressed in a shirt smeared with sulphur he had to walk to the centre of the pile through a narrow opening and was then tightly bound to the stake with ropes and chains After this faggots and straw were thrown into the empty space through which he had passed to the stake until he was entirely covered by them the pile was then fired on all sides at once Fig three hundred forty five Sometimes the sentence was that the culprit should only be delivered to the flames after having been previously strangled In this case the dead corpse was then immediately placed where the victim would otherwise have been placed alive and the punishment lost much of its horror It often happened that the executioner in order to shorten the sufferings of the condemned whilst he prepared the pile placed a large and pointed iron bar amongst the faggots and opposite the stake breast high so that directly the fire was lighted the bar was quickly pushed against the victim giving a mortal blow to the unfortunate wretch who would otherwise have been slowly devoured by the flames If according to the wording of the sentence the ashes of the criminal were to be scattered to the winds as soon as it was possible to approach the centre of the burning pile a few ashes were taken in a shovel and sprinkled in the air They were not satisfied with burning the living they also delivered to the flames the bodies of those who had died a natural death before their execution could be carried out as if an anticipated death should not be allowed to save them from the punishment which they had deserved It also happened in certain cases where a person s guilt was only proved after his decease that his body was disinterred and carried to the stake to be burnt The punishment by fire was always inflicted in cases of heresy or blasphemy The Spanish Inquisition made such a constant and cruel use of it that the expression auto da fe act of faith strangely perverted from its original meaning was the only one employed to denote the punishment itself In France in the beginning of the fourteenth century fifty nine Templars were burned at the same time for the crimes of heresy and witchcraft And three years later on the eighteenth March thirteen fourteen Jacques Molay and a few other dignitaries of the Order of the Templars also perished in the flames at the extremity of the island of Notre Dame on the very spot where the equestrian statue of Henry IV now stands Every one is acquainted with the fact that judges were found iniquitous enough to condemn Joan of Arc to death by fire as a witch and a heretic Her execution which took place in the market place of Rouen is remarkable from a circumstance which is little known and which had never taken place on any other occasion When it was supposed that the fire which surrounded the young heroine on all sides had reached her and no doubt suffocated her although sufficient time had not elapsed for it to consume her body a part of the blazing wood was withdrawn in order to remove any doubts from the people and when the crowd had satisfied themselves by seeing her in the middle of the pile chained to the post and quite dead the executioner replaced the fire It should be stated in reference to this point that Joan having been accused of witchcraft there was a general belief among the people that the flames would be harmless to her and that she would be seen emerging from her pile unscathed The sentence of punishment by fire did not absolutely imply death at the stake for there was a punishment of this description which was specially reserved for base coiners and which consisted in hurling the criminals into a cauldron of scalding water or oil We must include in the category of punishment by fire certain penalties which were so to speak but the preliminaries of a more severe punishment such as the sulphur fire in which the hands of parricides or of criminals accused of high treason were burned We must also add various punishments which if they did not involve death were none the less cruel such as the red hot brazier bassin ardent which was passed backwards and forwards before the eyes of the culprit until they were destroyed by the scorching heat and the process of branding various marks on the flesh as an ineffaceable stigma the use of which has been continued to the present day In certain countries decapitation was performed with an axe but in France it was carried out usually by means of a two handed sword or glave of justice which was furnished to the executioner for that purpose Fig three hundred forty six We find it recorded that in fourteen seventy six sixty sous parisis were paid to the executioner of Paris for having bought a large espee a feuille used for beheading the condemned and for having the old sword done up which was damaged and had become notched whilst carrying out the sentence of justice upon Messire Louis de Luxembourg Illustration Fig three hundred forty six Beheading Fac simile of a Miniature on Wood in the Cosmographie Universelle of Munster in folio Basle fifteen fifty two Originally decapitation was indiscriminately inflicted on all criminals condemned to death at a later period however it became the particular privilege of the nobility who submitted to it without any feeling of degradation The victim unless the sentence prescribed that he should be blindfolded as an ignominious aggravation of the penalty was allowed to choose whether he would have his eyes covered or not He knelt down on the scaffold placed his head on the block and gave himself up to the executioner Fig three hundred forty seven The skill of the executioner was generally such that the head was almost invariably severed from the body at the first blow Nevertheless skill and practice at times failed for cases are on record where as many as eleven blows were dealt and at times it happened that the sword broke It was no doubt the desire to avoid this mischance that led to the invention of the mechanical instrument now known under the name of the guillotine which is merely an improvement on a complicated machine which was much more ancient than is generally supposed As early as the sixteenth century the modern guillotine already existed in Scotland under the name of the Maiden and English historians relate that Lord Morton regent of Scotland during the minority of James VI had it constructed after a model of a similar machine which had long been in use at Halifax in Yorkshire They add and popular tradition also has invented an analogous tale in France that this Lord Morton who was the inventor or the first to introduce this kind of punishment was himself the first to experience it The guillotine is besides very accurately described in the Chronicles of Jean d Auton in an account of an execution which took place at Genoa at the beginning of the sixteenth century Two German engravings executed about fifteen fifty by Pencz and Aldegrever also represent an instrument of death almost identical with the guillotine and the same instrument is to be found on a bas relief of that period which is still existing in one of the halls of the Tribunal of Luneburg in Hanover Illustration Decapitation of Guillaume de Pommiers Illustration Fig three hundred forty seven Public

seven by order of the King of England s Lieutenant Froissart s Chronicles No twenty six forty four Bibl nat le de Paris Possibly the invention of such a machine was prompted by the desire to curtail the physical sufferings of the victim instead of prolonging them as under the ancient system It is however difficult to believe that the mediaeval judges were actuated by any humane feelings when we find that in order to reconcile a respect for propriety with a due compliance with the ends of justice the punishment of burying alive was resorted to for women who could not with decency be hung up to the gibbets In fourteen sixty a woman named Perette accused of theft and of receiving stolen goods was condemned by the Provost of Paris to be buried alive before the gallows and the sentence was literally carried out Quartering may in truth be considered the most horrible penalty invented by judicial cruelty This punishment really dates from the remotest ages but it was scarcely ever inflicted in more modern times except on regicides who were looked upon as having committed the worst of crimes In almost all cases the victim had previously to undergo various accessory tortures sometimes his right hand was cut off and the mutilated stump was burnt in a cauldron of sulphur sometimes his arms thighs or breasts were lacerated with red hot pincers and hot oil pitch or molten lead was poured into the wounds Illustration Fig three hundred forty eight Demons applying the Torture of the Wheel Fac simile of a Woodcut in the Grand Kalendrier ou Compost des Bergers small folio Troyes Nicholas le Rouge fifteen twenty nine After these horrible preliminaries a rope was attached to each of the limbs of the criminal one being bound round each leg from the foot to the knee and round each arm from the wrist to the elbow These ropes were then fastened to four bars to each of which a strong horse was harnessed as if for towing a barge These horses were first made to give short jerks and when the agony had elicited heart rending cries from the unfortunate man who felt his limbs being dislocated without being broken the four horses were all suddenly urged on with the whip in different directions and thus all the limbs were strained at one moment If the tendons and ligaments still resisted the combined efforts of the four horses the executioner assisted and made several cuts with a hatchet on each joint When at last for this horrible torture often lasted several hours each horse had drawn out a limb they were collected and placed near the hideous trunk which often still showed signs of life and the whole were burned together Sometimes the sentence was that the body should be hung to the gibbet and that the limbs should be displayed on the gates of the town or sent to four principal towns in the extremities of the kingdom When this was done an inscription was placed on each of the limbs which stated the reason of its being thus exposed The wheel is the name applied to a torture of very ancient origin but which was applied during the Middle Ages to quite a different torture from that used in olden times The modern instrument might indeed have been called the cross for it only served for the public exhibition of the body of the criminal whose limbs had been previously broken alive This torture which does not date earlier than the days of Francis I is thus described The victim was first tied on his back to two joists forming a saint Andrew s cross each of his limbs being stretched out on its arms Two places were hollowed out under each limb about a foot apart in order that the joints alone might touch the wood The executioner then dealt a heavy blow over each hollow with a square iron bar about two inches broad and rounded at the handle thus breaking each limb in two places To the eight blows required for this the executioner generally added two or three on the chest which were called coups de grace and which ended this horrible execution It was only after death that the broken body was placed on a wheel which was turned round on a pivot Sometimes however the sentence ordered that the condemned should be strangled before being broken which was done in such cases by the instantaneous twist of a rope round the neck Strangling thus carried out was called garotting This method is still in use in Spain and is specially reserved for the nobility The victim is seated on a scaffold his head leaning against a beam and his neck grasped by an iron collar which the executioner suddenly tightens from behind by means of a screw For several centuries and down to the Revolution hanging was the most common mode of execution in France consequently in every town and almost in every village there was a permanent gibbet which owing to the custom of leaving the bodies to hang till they crumbled into dust was very rarely without having some corpses or skeletons attached to it These gibbets which were called fourches patibulaires or justices because they represented the authority of the law were generally composed of pillars of stone joined at their summit by wooden traverses to which the bodies of criminals were tied by ropes or chains The gallows the pillars of which varied in number according to the will of the authorities were always placed by the side of frequented roads and on an eminence Illustration Fig three hundred forty nine The Gibbet of Montfaucon From an Engraving of the Topography of Paris in the Collection of Engravings of the National Library According to prescribed rule the gallows of Paris which played such an important part in the political as well as the criminal history of that city were erected on a height north of the town near the high road leading into Germany Montfaucon originally the name of the hill soon became that of the gallows itself This celebrated place of execution consisted of a heavy mass of masonry composed of ten or twelve layers of rough stones and formed an enclosure of forty feet by twenty five or thirty At the upper part there was a platform which was reached by a stone staircase the entrance to which was closed by a massive door Fig three hundred forty nine On three sides of this platform rested sixteen square pillars about thirty feet high made of blocks of stone a foot thick These pillars were joined to one another by double bars of wood which were fastened into them and bore iron chains three feet and a half long to which the criminals were suspended Underneath half way between these and the platform other bars were placed for the same purpose Long and solid ladders riveted to the pillars enabled the executioner and his assistants to lead up criminals or to carry up corpses destined to be hung there Lastly the centre of the structure was occupied by a deep pit the hideous receptacle of the decaying remains of the criminals One can easily imagine the strange and melancholy aspect of this monumental gibbet if one thinks of the number of corpses continually attached to it and which were feasted upon by thousands of crows On one occasion only it was necessary to replace fifty two chains which were useless and the accounts of the city of Paris prove that the expense of executions was more heavy than that of the maintenance of the gibbet a fact easy to be understood if one recalls to mind the frequency of capital sentences during the Middle Ages Montfaucon was used not only for executions but also for exposing corpses which were brought there from various places of execution in every part of the country The mutilated remains of criminals who had been boiled quartered or beheaded were also hung there enclosed in sacks of leather or wickerwork They often remained hanging for a considerable time as in the case of Pierre des Essarts who had been beheaded in fourteen thirteen and whose remains were handed over to his family for Christian burial after having hung on Montfaucon for three years The criminal condemned to be hanged was generally taken to the place of execution sitting or standing in a waggon with his back to the horses his confessor by his side and the executioner behind him He bore three ropes round his neck two the size of the little finger and called tortouses each of which had a slip knot the third called the jet was only used to pull the victim off the ladder and so to launch him into eternity Fig three hundred fifty When the cart arrived at the foot of the gallows the executioner first ascended the ladder backwards drawing the culprit after him by means of the ropes and forcing him to keep pace with him on arriving at the top he quickly fastened the two tortouses to the arm of the gibbet and by a jerk of his knee he turned the culprit off the ladder still holding the jet in his own hand He then placed his feet on the tied hands of the condemned and suspending himself by his hands to the gibbet he finished off his victim by repeated jerks thus ensuring complete strangulation When the words shall be hung until death doth ensue are to be found in a sentence it must not be supposed that they were used merely as a form for in certain cases the judge ordered that the sentence should be only carried out as far as would prove to the culprit the awful sensation of hanging In such cases the victim was simply suspended by ropes passing under the arm pits a kind of exhibition which was not free from danger when it was too prolonged for the weight of the body so tightened the rope round the chest that the circulation might be stopped Many culprits after hanging thus an hour when brought down were dead or only survived this painful process a short time Illustration Fig three hundred fifty Hanging to Music A Minstrel condemned to the Gallows obtained permission that one of his companions should accompany him to his execution and play his favourite instrument on the ladder of the Gallows Fac simile of a Woodcut in Michault s Doctrinal du Temps Present small folio goth Bruges about fourteen ninety We have seen elsewhere chapter on Privileges and Rights Feudal and Municipal that when the criminal passed before the convent of the Filles Dieu the nuns of that establishment were bound to bring him out a glass of wine and three pieces of bread and this was called le dernier morceau des patients It was hardly ever refused and an immense crowd assisted at this sad meal After this the procession went forward and on arriving near the gallows another halt was made at the foot of a stone cross in order that the culprit might receive the religions exhortations of his confessor The moment the execution was over the confessor and the officers of justice returned to the Chatelet where a repast provided by the town awaited them Illustration Fig three hundred fifty one View of the Pillory in the Market place of Paris in the Sixteenth Century after a Drawing by an unknown Artist of sixteen seventy Sometimes the criminals in consequence of a peculiar wording of the sentence were taken to Montfaucon whether dead or alive on a ladder fastened behind a cart This was an aggravation of the penalty which was called trainer sur la claie The penalty of the lash was inflicted in two ways first under the custode that is to say within the prison and by the hand of the gaoler himself in which case it was simply a correction and secondly in public when its administration became ignominious as well as painful In the latter case the criminal was paraded about the town stripped to the waist and at each crossway he received a certain number of blows on the shoulders given by the public executioner with a cane or a knotted rope When it was only required to stamp a culprit with infamy he was put into the pillory which was generally a kind of scaffold furnished with chains and iron collars and bearing on its front the arms of the feudal lord In Paris this name was given to a round isolated tower built in the centre of the market The tower was sixty feet high and had large openings in its thick walls and a horizontal wheel was provided which was capable of turning on a pivot This wheel was pierced with several holes made so as to hold the hands and head of the culprit who on passing and repassing before the eyes of the crowd came in full view and was subjected to their hootings Fig three hundred fifty one The pillories were always situated in the most frequented places such as markets crossways c Notwithstanding the long and dreadful enumeration we have just made of mediaeval punishments we are far from having exhausted the subject for we have not spoken of several more or less atrocious punishments which were in use at various times and in various countries such as the Pain of the Cross specially employed against the Jews the Arquebusade which was well adapted for carrying out prompt justice on soldiers the Chatouillement which resulted in death after the most intense tortures the Pal Fig three hundred fifty two flaying alive and lastly drowning a kind of death frequently employed in France Hence the common expression gens de sac et de corde which was derived from the sack into which persons were tied who were condemned to die by immersion But we will now turn away from these horrible scenes and consider the several methods of penal sequestration and prison arrangements It is unnecessary to state that in barbarous times the cruel and pitiless feeling which induced legislators to increase the horrors of tortures also contributed to the aggravation of the fate of prisoners Each administrator of the law had his private gaol which was entirely under his will and control Fig three hundred fifty three Law or custom did not prescribe any fixed rules for the internal government of prisons There can be little doubt however that these prisons were as small as they were unhealthy if we may judge from that in the Rue de la Tannerie which was the property of the provost the merchants and the aldermen of Paris in thirteen eighty three Although this dungeon was only eleven feet long by seven feet wide from ten to twenty prisoners were often immured in it at the same time Illustration Fig three hundred fifty two Empalement Fac simile of a Woodcut in the Cosmographie Universelle of Munster in folio Basle fifteen fifty two Paris alone contained twenty five or thirty special prisons without counting the vade in pace of the various religious communities The most important were the Grand Chatelet the Petit Chatelet the Bastille the Conciergerie and the For l Eveque the ancient seat of the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Bishop of Paris Nearly all these places of confinement contained subterranean cells which were almost entirely deprived of air and light As examples of these may be mentioned the Chartres basses of the Petit Chatelet where under the reign of Charles VI it was proved that no man could pass an entire day without being suffocated and the fearful cells excavated thirty feet below the surface of the earth in the gaol of the Abbey of Saint Germain des Pres the roof of which was so low that a man of middle height could not stand up in them and where the straw of the prisoners beds floated upon the stagnant water which had oozed through the walls Illustration Fig three hundred fifty three The Provost s Prison Fac simile of a Woodcut in J Damhoudere s Praxis Rerum Civilium The Grand Chatelet was one of the most ancient prisons of Paris and probably the one which held the greatest number of prisoners By a curious and arbitrary custom prisoners were compelled to pay a gaol fee on entering and going out of this prison which varied according to their rank and which was established by a law of the year fourteen twenty five We learn from this enactment the names by which the various places of confinement composing this spacious municipal prison were known A prisoner who was confined in the Beauvoir La Mate or La Salle had the right of having a bed brought from his own house and only had to pay the droit de place to the gaoler any one who was placed in the Boucherie in the Beaumont or in the Griseche which are closed prisons had to pay four deniers pour place any one who was confined in the Beauvais lies on mats or on layers of rushes or straw gist sur nates ou sur couche de feurre ou de paille if he preferred he might be placed au Puis in the Gourdaine in the Bercueil or in the Oubliette where he did not pay more than in the Fosse For this no doubt the smallest charge was made Sometimes however the prisoner was left between two doors entre deux huis and he then paid much less than he would in the Barbarie or in the Gloriette The exact meaning of these curious names is no longer intelligible to us notwithstanding the terror which they formerly created but their very strangeness gives us reason to suppose that the prison system was at that time subjected to the most odious refinement of the basest cruelty From various reliable sources we learn that there was a place in the Grand Chatelet called the Chausse d Hypocras in which the prisoners had their feet continually in water and where they could neither stand up nor lie down and a cell called Fin d aise which was a horrible receptacle of filth vermin and reptiles as to the Fosse no staircase being attached to it the prisoners were lowered down into it by means of a rope and pulley By the law of fourteen twenty five the gaoler was not permitted to put more than two or three persons in the same bed He was bound to give bread and water to the poor prisoners who had no means of subsistence and lastly he was enjoined to keep the large stone basin which was on the pavement full of water so that prisoners might get it whenever they wished In order to defray his expenses he levied on the prisoners various charges for attendance and for bedding and he was authorised to detain in prison any person who failed to pay him The power of compelling payment of these charges continued even after a judge s order for the release of a prisoner had been issued Illustration Fig three hundred fifty four The Bastille From an ancient Engraving of the Topography of Paris in the Collection of Engravings of the National Library The subterranean cells of the Bastille Fig three hundred fifty four did not differ much from those of the Chatelet There were several the bottoms of which were formed like a sugar loaf upside down thus neither allowing the prisoner to stand up nor even to adopt a tolerable position sitting or lying down It was in these that King Louis XI who seemed to have a partiality for filthy dungeons placed the two young sons of the Duke de Nemours beheaded in fourteen seventy seven ordering besides that they should be taken out twice a week and beaten with birch rods and as a supreme measure of atrocity he had one of their teeth extracted every three months It was Louis XI too who in fourteen seventy six ordered the famous iron cage to be erected in one of the towers of the Bastille in which Guillaume Bishop of Verdun was incarcerated for fourteen years The Chateau de Loches also possessed one of these cages which received the name of Cage de Balue because the Cardinal Jean de la Balue was imprisoned in it Philippe de Commines in his Memoires declares that he himself had a taste of it for eight months Before the invention of cages Louis XI ordered very heavy chains to be made which were fastened to the feet of the prisoners and attached to large iron balls called according to Commines the King s little daughters les fillettes du roy Illustration Fig three hundred fifty five Movable Iron Cage Fac simile of a Woodcut in the Cosmographie Universelle of Munster in folio Basle fifteen fifty two The prison known by the name of The Leads of Venice is of so notorious a character that its mere mention is sufficient without its being necessary for us to describe it To the subject of voluntary seclusions to which certain pious persons submitted themselves as acts of extreme religious devotion it will only be necessary to allude here and to remark that there are examples of this confinement having been ordered by legal authority In fourteen eighty five Renee de Vermandois the widow of a squire had been condemned to be burnt for adultery and for murdering her husband but on letters of remission from the King Parliament commuted the sentence pronounced by the Provost of Paris and ordered that Renee de Vermandois should be shut up within the walls of the cemetery of the Saints Innocents in a small house built at her expense that she might therein do penance and end her days In conformity with this sentence the culprit having been conducted with much pomp to the cell which had been prepared for her the door was locked by means of two keys one of which remained in the hands of the churchwarden marguillier of the Church of the Innocents and the other was deposited at the office of the Parliament The prisoner received her food from public charity and it is said that she became an object of veneration and respect by the whole town Illustration Fig three hundred fifty

scattered proscribed and received universal reprobation Fig three hundred fifty seven notwithstanding that their annals collected under divine inspiration by Moses and the sacred writers had furnished a glorious prologue to the annals of all modern nations and had given to the world the holy and divine history of Christ who by establishing the Gospel was to become the regenerator of the whole human family Their Temple is destroyed and the crowd which had once pressed beneath its portico as the flock of the living God has become a miserable tribe restless and unquiet in the present but full of hope as regards the future The Jewish nation exists nowhere nevertheless the Jewish people are to be found everywhere They are wanderers upon the face of the earth continually pursued threatened and persecuted It would seem as if the existence of the offspring of Israel is perpetuated simply to present to Christian eyes a clear and awful warning of the Divine vengeance a special and at the same time an overwhelming example of the vicissitudes which God alone can determine in the life of a people Illustration Fig three hundred fifty seven Expulsion of the Jews in the Reign of the Emperor Hadrian A D one hundred thirty five How Heraclius turned the Jews out of Jerusalem Fac simile of a Miniature in the Histoire des Empereurs Manuscript of the Fifteenth Century in the Library of the Arsenal Paris M Depping an historian of this race so long accursed after having been for centuries blessed and favoured by God says A Jewish community in an European town during the Middle Ages resembled a colony on an island or on a distant coast Isolated from the rest of the population it generally occupied a district or street which was separated from the town or borough The Jews like a troop of lepers were thrust away and huddled together into the most uncomfortable and most unhealthy quarter of the city as miserable as it vas disgusting There in ill constructed houses this poor and numerous population was amassed in some cases high walls enclosed the small and dark narrow streets of the quarter occupied by this branded race which prevented its extension though at the same time it often protected the inhabitants from the fury of the populace In order to form a just appreciation of what the Jewish quarters were like in the mediaeval towns one must visit the Ghetto of Rome or ancient Prague The latter place especially has in all respects preserved its antique appearance We must picture to ourselves a large enclosure of wretched houses irregularly built divided by small streets with no attempt at uniformity The principal thoroughfare is lined with stalls in which are sold not only old clothes furniture and utensils but also new and glittering articles The inhabitants of this enclosure can without crossing its limits procure everything necessary to material life This quarter contains the old synagogue a square building begrimed with the dirt of ages and so covered with dirt and moss that the stone of which it is built is scarcely visible The building which is as mournful as a prison has only narrow loopholes by way of windows and a door so low that one must stoop to enter it A dark passage leads to the interior into which air and light can scarcely penetrate A few lamps contend with the darkness and lighted fires serve to modify a little the icy temperature of this cellar Here and there pillars seem to support a roof which is too high and too darkened for the eye of the visitor to distinguish On the sides are dark and damp recesses where women assist at the celebration of worship which is always carried on according to ancient custom with much wailing and strange gestures of the body The book of the law which is in use is no less venerable than the edifice in which it is contained It appears that this synagogue has never undergone the slightest repairs or changes for many centuries The successive generations who have prayed in this ancient temple rest under thousands of sepulchral stones in a cemetery which is of the same date as the synagogue and is about a league in circumference Paris has never possessed properly speaking a regular Jewish quarter it is true that the Israelites settled down in the neighbourhood of the markets and in certain narrow streets which at some period or other took the name of Juiverie or Vieille Juiverie Old Jewry but they were never distinct from the rest of the population they only had a separate cemetery at the bottom or rather on the slope of the hill of Sainte Genevieve On the other hand most of the towns of France and of Europe had their Jewry In certain countries the colonies of Jews enjoyed a share of immunities and protections thus rendering their life a little less precarious and their occupations of a rather more settled character In Spain and in Portugal the Jews in consequence of their having been on several occasions useful to the kings of those two countries were allowed to carry on their trade and to engage in money speculations outside their own quarters a few were elevated to positions of responsibility and some were even tolerated at court In the southern towns of France which they enriched by commerce and taxes and where they formed considerable communities the Jews enjoyed the protection of the nobles We find them in Languedoc and Provence buying and selling property like Christians a privilege which was not permitted to them elsewhere this is proved by charters of contracts made during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries which bear the signature of certain Jews in Hebrew characters On Papal lands at Avignon at Carpentras and at Cavaillon they had bailes or consuls of their nation The Jews of Rousillon during the Spanish rule fifteenth century were governed by two syndics and a scribe elected by the community The latter levied the taxes due to the King of Aragon In Burgundy they cultivated the vines which was rather singular for the Jews generally preferred towns where they could form groups more compact and more capable of mutual assistance The name of Sabath given to a vineyard in the neighbourhood of Macon still points out the position of their synagogue The hamlet of Mouys a dependency of the communes of Prissey owes its name to a rich Israelite Moses who had received that land as an indemnity for money lent to the Count Gerfroy de Macon which the latter had been unable to repay In Vienna where the Israelites had a special quarter still called the Jews Illustration Fig three hundred fifty

taxes and travelling expenses of the nobles c This community even became so rich that it eventually held mortgages on the greater part of the houses of the town In Venice also the Jews had their quarter the Giudecca which is still one of the darkest in the town but they did not much care about such trifling inconveniences as the republic allowed them to bank that is to lend money at interest and although they were driven out on several occasions they always found means to return and recommence their operations When they were authorised to establish themselves in the towns of the Adriatic their presence did not fail to annoy the Christian merchants whose rivals they were but neither in Venice nor in the Italian republics had they to fear court intrigues nor the hatred of corporations of trades which were so powerful in France and in Germany It was in the north of Europe that the animosity against the Jews was greatest The Christian population continually threatened the Jewish quarters which public opinion pointed to as haunts and sinks of iniquity The Jews were believed to be much more amenable to the doctrines of the Talmud than to the laws of Moses However secret they may have kept their learning a portion of its tenets transpired which was supposed to inculcate the right to pillage and murder Christians and it is to the vague knowledge of these odious prescriptions of the Talmud that we must attribute the readiness with which the most atrocious accusations against the Jews were always welcomed Besides this the public mind in those days of bigotry was naturally filled with a deep antipathy against the Jewish deicides When monks and priests came annually in Holy week to relate from the pulpit to their hearers the revolting details of the Passion resentment was kindled in the hearts of the Christians against the descendants of the judges and executioners of the Saviour And when on going out of the churches excited by the sermons they had just heard the faithful saw in pictures in the cemeteries and elsewhere representations of the mystery of the death of our Saviour in which the Jews played so odious a part there was scarcely a spectator who did not feel an increased hatred against the condemned race Hence it was that in many towns even when the authorities did not compel them to do so the Israelites found it prudent to shut themselves up in their own quarter and even in their own houses during the whole of Passion week for in consequence of the public feeling roused during those days of mourning and penance a false rumour was quite sufficient to give the people a pretext for offering violence to the Jews In fact from the earliest days of Christianity a certain number of accusations were always being made sometimes in one country sometimes in another against the Israelites which always ended in bringing down the same misfortunes on their heads The most common and most easily credited report was that which attributed to them the murder of some Christian child said to be sacrificed in Passion week in token of their hatred of Christ and in the event of this terrible accusation being once uttered and maintained by popular opinion it never failed to spread with remarkable swiftness In such cases popular fury not being on all occasions satisfied with the tardiness of judicial forms vented itself upon the first Jews who had the misfortune to fall into the hands of their enemies As soon as the disturbance was heard the Jewish quarter was closed fathers and mothers barricaded themselves in with

Lincoln the report was suddenly spread that a child of the name of Hughes had been enticed into the Jewish quarter and there scourged crucified and pierced with lances in the presence of all the Israelites of the district who were convoked and assembled to take part in this horrible barbarity The King and Queen of England on their return from a journey to Scotland arrived in Lincoln at the very time when the inhabitants were so much agitated by this mysterious announcement The people called for vengeance An order was issued to the bailiffs and officers of the King to deliver the murderer into the hands of justice and the quarter in which the Jews had shut themselves up so as to avoid the public animosity was immediately invaded by armed men The rabbi in whose house the child was supposed to have been tortured was seized and at once condemned to be tied to the tail of a horse and dragged through the streets of the town After this his mangled body which was only half dead was hung Fig three hundred fifty nine Many of the Jews ran away and hid themselves in all parts of the kingdom and those who had the misfortune to be caught were thrown into chains and led to London Orders were given in the provinces to imprison all the Israelites who were accused or even suspected of having taken any part whether actively or indirectly in the murder of the Lincoln child and suspicion made rapid strides in those days In a short space of time eighteen Israelites in London shared the fate of the rabbi of their community in Lincoln Some Dominican monks who were charitable and courageous enough to interfere in favour of the wretched prisoners brought down odium on their own heads and were accused of having allowed themselves to be corrupted by the money of the Jews Seventy one prisoners were retained in the dungeons of London and seemed inevitably fated to die when the king s brother Richard came to their aid by asserting his right over all the Jews of the kingdom a right which the King had pledged to him for a loan of five thousand silver marks The unfortunate prisoners were therefore saved thanks to Richard s desire to protect his securities History does not tell what their liberty cost them but we must hope that a sense of justice alone guided the English prince and that the Jews found other means besides money by which to show their gratitude There is scarcely a country in Europe which cannot recount similar tales In eleven seventy one we find the murder of a child at Orleans or Blois causing capital punishment to be inflicted on several Jews Imputations of this horrible character were continually renewed during the Middle Ages and were of very ancient origin for we hear of them in the times of Honorius and Theodosius the younger we find them reproduced with equal vehemence in fourteen seventy five at Trent where a furious mob was excited against the Jews who were accused of having destroyed a child twenty nine months old named Simon The tale of the martyrdom of this child was circulated widely and woodcut representations of it were freely distributed which necessarily increased especially in Germany the horror which was aroused in the minds of Christians against the accursed nation Fig three hundred sixty one Illustration Fig three hundred sixty The Infant Richard crucified by the Jews at Pontoise Fac simile of a

a Woodcut of Wohlgemuth in the Liber Chronicarum Mundi large folio Nuremberg fourteen ninety three The Jews gave cause for other accusations calculated to keep up this hatred such as the desecration of the consecrated host the mutilation of the crucifix Tradition informs us of a miracle which took place in Paris in twelve ninety in the Rue des Jardins when a Jew dared to mutilate and boil a consecrated host This miracle was commemorated by the erection of a chapel on the spot which was afterwards replaced by the church and convent of the Billettes In thirteen seventy the people of Brussels were startled in consequence of the statements of a Jewess who accused her company religionists of having made her carry a pyx full of stolen hosts to the Jews of Cologne for the purpose of submitting them to the most horrible profanations The woman added that the Jews having pierced these hosts with sticks and knives such a quantity of blood poured from them that the culprits were struck with terror and concealed themselves in their quarter The Jews were all imprisoned tortured and burnt alive Fig three hundred sixty two In order to perpetuate the memory of the miracle of the bleeding hosts an annual procession took place which was the origin of the great kermesse or annual fair In the event of any unforeseen misfortune or any great catastrophe occurring amongst Christians the odium was frequently cast on the Jews If the Crusaders met with reverses in Asia fanatics formed themselves into bands who under the name of Pastoureaux spread over the country killing and robbing not only the Jews but many Christians also In the event of any general sickness and especially during the prevalence of epidemics the Jews were accused of having poisoned the water of fountains and pits and the people massacred them in consequence Thousands perished in this way when the black plague made ravages in Europe in the fourteenth century The sovereigns who were tardy in suppressing these sanguinary proceedings never thought of indemnifying the Jewish families which so unjustly suffered Illustration Fig three hundred sixty two The Jews of Cologne burnt alive From a Woodcut in the Liber Chronicarum Mundi large folio Nuremberg fourteen ninety three In fact it was then most religiously believed that by despising and holding the Jewish nation under the yoke banished as it was from Judaea for the murder of Jesus Christ the will of the Almighty was being carried out so much so that the greater number of kings and princes looked upon themselves as absolute masters over the Jews who lived under their protection All feudal lords spoke with scorn of their Jews they allowed them to establish themselves on their lands but on the condition that as they became the subjects and property of their lord the latter should draw his best income from them We have shown by an instance borrowed from the history of England that the Jews were often mortgaged by the kings like land This was not all for the Jews who inhabited Great Britain during the reign of Henry III in the middle of the thirteenth century were not only obliged to acknowledge by voluntarily contributing large sums of money the service the King s brother had rendered them in clearing them from the imputation of having had any participation in the murder of the child Richard but the loan on mortgage for which they were the material and passive security became the cause of odious extortions from them The King had pledged them to the Earl of Cornwall for five thousand marks but they themselves had to repay the royal loan by means of enormous taxes When they had succeeded in cancelling the King s debt to his brother that necessitous monarch again mortgaged them but on this occasion to his son Edward Soon after the son having rebelled against his father the latter took back his Jews and having assembled six elders from each of their communities he told them that he required twenty thousand silver marks and ordered them to pay him that sum at two stated periods The payments were rigorously exacted those who were behind hand were imprisoned and the debtor who was in arrear for the second payment was sued for the whole sum On the King s death his successor continued the same system of tyranny against the Jews In twelve seventy nine they were charged with having issued counterfeit coin and on this vague or imaginary accusation two hundred and eighty men and women were put to death in London alone In the counties there were also numerous executions and many innocent persons were thrown into dungeons and at last in twelve ninety King Edward who wished to enrich himself by taking possession of their properties banished the Jews from his kingdom A short time before this the English people had offered to pay an annual fine to the King on condition of his expelling the Jews from the country but the Jews outbid them and thus obtained the repeal of the edict of banishment However on this last occasion there was no mercy shown and the Jews sixteen thousand in number were expelled from England and the King seized upon their goods At the same period Philippe le Bel of France gave the example of this system of persecuting the Jews but instead of confiscating all their goods he was satisfied with taking one fifth his subjects therefore almost accused him of generosity Illustration Fig three hundred sixty three Jewish Conspiracy in France From a Miniature in the Pelerinage de la Vie Humaine Imperial Library Paris The Jews often took the precaution of purchasing certain rights and franchises from their sovereign or from the feudal lord under whose sway they lived but generally these were one sided bargains for not being protected by common rights and only forming a very small part of the population they could nowhere depend upon promises or privileges which had been made to them even though they had purchased them with their own money To the uncertainty and annoyance of a life which was continually being threatened was added a number of vexatious and personal insults even in ordinary times and when they enjoyed a kind of normal tolerance They were almost everywhere obliged to wear a visible mark on their dress such as a patch of gaudy colour attached to the shoulder or chest in order to prevent their being mistaken for Christians By this or some other means they were continually subject to insults from the people and only succeeded in ridding themselves of it by paying the most enormous fines Nothing was spared to humiliate and insult them At Toulouse they were forced to send a representative to the cathedral on every Good Friday that he might there publicly receive a box on the ears At Beziers during Passion week the mob assumed the right of attacking the Jews houses with stones The Jews bought off this right in eleven sixty by paying a certain sum to the Vicomte de Beziers and by promising an annual poll tax to him and to his successors A Jew passing on the road of Etampes beneath the tower of Montlhery had to pay an obole if he had in his possession a Hebrew book he paid four deniers and if he carried his lamp with him two oboles At Chateauneuf sur Loire a Jew on passing had to pay twelve deniers and a Jewess six It has been said that there were various ancient rates levied upon Jews in which they were treated like cattle but this requires authentication During the Carnival in Rome they were forced to run in the lists amidst the jeers of the populace This public outrage was stopped at a subsequent period by a tax of three hundred ecus which a deputation from the Ghetto presented on their knees to the magistrates of the city at the same time thanking them for their protection When Pope Martin IV arrived at the Council of Constance in fourteen seventeen the Jewish community which was as numerous as it was powerful in that old city came in great state to present him with the book of the law Fig three hundred sixty four The holy father received the Jews kindly and prayed God to open their eyes and bring them back into the bosom of his church We know too how charitable the popes were to the Jews In the face of the distressing position they occupied it may be asked what powerful motive induced the Jews to live amongst nations who almost invariably treated them as enemies and to remain at the mercy of sovereigns whose sole object was to oppress plunder and subject them to all kinds of vexations To understand this it is sufficient to remember that in their peculiar aptness for earning and hoarding money they found or at least hoped to find a means of compensation whereby they might be led to forget the servitude to which they were subjected There existed amongst them and especially in the southern countries some very learned men who devoted themselves principally to medicine and in order to avoid having to struggle against insuperable prejudice they were careful to disguise their nationality and religion in the exercise of that art Illustration Fig three hundred sixty four The Jewish Procession going to meet the Pope at the Council of Constance in fourteen seventeen After a Miniature in the Manuscript Chronicle of Ulrie de Reichental in the Library of the Mansion house of Basle in Switzerland They pretended in order not to arouse the suspicion of their patients to be practitioners from Lombardy or Spain or even from Arabia whether they were really clever or only made a pretence of being so in an art which was then very much a compound of quackery and imposture it is difficult to say but they acquired wealth as well as renown in its practice But there was another science to the study of which they applied themselves with the utmost ardour and perseverance and for which they possessed in a marvellous degree the necessary qualities to insure success and that science was the science of finance In matters having reference to the recovering of arrears of taxes to contracts for the sale of goods and produce of industry to turning a royalty to account to making hazardous commercial enterprises lucrative or to the accumulating of large sums of money for the use of sovereigns or poor nobles the Jews were always at hand and might invariably be reckoned upon They created capital for they always had funds to dispose of even in the midst of the most terrible public calamities and when all other means were exhausted when all expedients for filling empty purses had been resorted to without success the Jews were called in Often in consequence of the envy which they excited from being known to possess hoards of gold they were exposed to many dangers which they nevertheless faced buoying themselves up with the insatiable love of gain Few Christians in the Middle Ages were given to speculation and they were especially ignorant of financial matters as demanding interest on loans was almost always looked upon as usury and consequently such dealings were stigmatized as disgraceful The Jews were far from sharing these high minded scruples and they took advantage of the ignorance of Christians by devoting themselves as much as possible to enterprises and speculations which were at all times the distinguishing occupation of their race For this reason we find the Jews who were engaged in the export trade from the twelfth to the fifteenth centuries doing a most excellent business even in the commercial towns of the Mediterranean We can to a certain extent in speaking of the intercourse of the Jews with the Christians of the Middle Ages apply what Lady Montague remarked as late as seventeen seventeen when comparing the Jews of Turkey with the Mussulmans The former she says have monopolized all the commerce of the empire thanks to the close ties which exist amongst them and to the laziness and want of industry of the Turks No bargain is made without their connivance They are the physicians and stewards of all the nobility It is easy to conceive the unity which this gives to a nation which never despises the smallest profits They have found means of rendering themselves so useful that they are certain of protection at court whoever the ruling minister may be Many of them are enormously rich but they are careful to make but little outward display although living in the greatest possible luxury Illustration Fig three hundred sixty five Costume of an Italian Jew of the Fourteenth Century From a Painting by Sano di Pietro preserved in the Academy of the Fine Arts at Sienna Illustration The Jews Passover Fac simile of a miniature from a missel of fifteenth century ornamented with paintings of the School of Van Eyck Bibl de l Arsenal Th lat no one hundred ninety nine The condition of the Jews in the East was never so precarious nor so difficult as it was in the West From the Councils of Paris in six hundred fifteen down to the end of the fifteenth century the nobles and the civil and ecclesiastical authorities excluded the Jews from administrative positions but it continually happened that a positive want of money against which the Jews were ever ready to provide caused a repeal or modification of these arbitrary measures Moreover Christians did not feel any scruple in parting with their most valued treasures and giving them as pledges to the Jews for a loan of money when they were in need of it This plan of lending on pledge or usury belonged specially to the Jews in Europe during the Middle Ages and was both the cause of their prosperity and of their misfortune Of their prosperity because they cleverly contrived to become possessors of all the coin and of their misfortune because their usurious demands became so detrimental to the public welfare and were often exacted with such unscrupulous severity that people not unfrequently became exasperated and acts of violence were committed which as often fell upon the innocent as upon the guilty The greater number of the acts of banishment were those for which no other motive was assigned or at all events no other pretext was made than the usury practised by these strangers in the provinces and in the towns in which they were permitted to reside When the Christians heard that these rapacious guests had harshly pressed and entirely stripped certain poor debtors when they learned that the debtors ruined by usury were still kept prisoners in the house of their pitiless creditors general indignation often manifested itself by personal attacks This feeling was frequently shared by the authorities themselves who instead of dispensing equal justice to the strangers and to the citizens according to the spirit of the law often decided with partiality and even with resentment and in some cases abandoned the Jews to the fury of the people The people s feelings of hatred against the sordid avarice of the Jews was continually kept up by ballads which were sung and legends which were related in the public streets of the cities and in the cottages of the villages ballads and legends in which usurers were depicted in hideous colours Fig three hundred sixty six The most celebrated of these popular compositions was evidently that which must have furnished the idea to Shakespeare of the Merchant of Venice for in this old English drama mention is made of a bargain struck between a Jew and a Christian who borrows money of him on condition that if he cannot refund it on a certain day the lender shall have the right of cutting a pound of flesh from his body All the evil which the people said and thought of the Jews during the Middle Ages seems concentrated in the Shylock of the English poet The rate of interest for loans was nevertheless everywhere settled by law and at all times This rate varied according to the scarcity of gold and was always high enough to give a very ample profit to the lenders although they too often required a very much higher rate In truth the small security offered by those borrowing and the arbitrary manner in which debts were at times cancelled increased the risks of the lender and the normal difficulties of obtaining a loan We find everywhere in all ancient legislations a mass of rules on the rate of pecuniary interest to be allowed to the Jews Illustration Fig three hundred sixty six Legend of the Jew calling the Devil from a Vessel of Blood Fac simile of a Woodcut in Boaistuau s Histoires Prodigieuses in fourto Paris Annet Briere fifteen sixty In some countries especially in England precautionary measures were taken for regulating the compacts entered into between Christians and Jews One of the departments of the Exchequer received the register of these compacts which thus acquired a legal value However it was not unfrequent for the kings of England to grant of their own free will letters of release to persons owing money to Jews and these letters which were often equivalent to the cancelling of the entire debt were even at times actually purchased from the sovereign Mention of sums received by the royal treasury for the liberation of debtors or for enabling them to recover their mortgaged lands without payment may still be found in the registers of the Exchequer of London at the same time Jews on the other hand also paid the King large sums in order that he might allow justice to take its course against powerful debtors who were in arrear and who could not be induced to pay We thus see that if the Jews practised usury the Christians and especially kings and powerful nobles defrauded the Jews in every way and were too often disposed to sell to them the smallest concessions at a great price Indeed Christians often went so far as to persecute them in order to obtain the greatest possible amount from them and the Jews of the Middle Ages put up with anything provided they could enrich themselves Illustration Fig three hundred sixty seven View and Plan of Jerusalem Fac simile of a Woodout in the Liber Chronicarum Mundi large folio Nuremberg fourteen ninety three It must not be supposed however that great as were their capabilities the Jews exclusively devoted themselves to financial matters When they were permitted to trade they were well satisfied to become artisans or agriculturists In Spain they proved themselves most industrious and that kingdom suffered a great loss in consequence of their being expelled from it In whatever country they established themselves the Jews carried on most of the mechanical and manual industries with cleverness and success but they could not hope to become landed proprietors in countries where they were in such bad odour and where the possession of land far from offering them any security could not fail to excite the envy of their enemies If as is the case Oriental people are of a serious turn of mind it is easy to understand that the Jews should have been still more so since they were always objects of hatred and abhorrence We find a touching allegory in the Talmud Each time that a human being is created God orders his angels to bring a soul before his throne and orders this soul to go and inhabit the body which is about to be born on earth The soul is grieved and supplicates the Supreme Being to spare it that painful trial in which it only sees sorrow and affliction This allegory may be suitably applied to a people who have only to expect contempt mistrust and hatred everywhere The Israelites therefore clung enthusiastically to the hope of the advent of a Messiah who should bring back to them the happy days of the land of promise and they looked upon their absence from Palestine as only a passing exile But the Christians said to them this Messiah has long since come Alas they answered if He had appeared on earth should we still be miserable Fulbert Bishop of Chartres preached three sermons to undeceive the Jews by endeavouring to prove to them that their Messiah was no other than Jesus Christ but he preached to the winds for the Jews remained obstinately attached to their illusion that the Messiah was yet to come In any case the Jews who mixed up the mysteries and absurdities of the Talmud with the ancient laws and numerous rules of the religion of their ancestors found in the practice of their national customs and in the celebration of their mysterious ceremonies the sweetest emotions especially when they could devote themselves to them in the peaceful retirement of the Ghetto for in all the countries in which they lived scattered and isolated amongst Christians they were careful to conceal their worship and to conduct their ceremonial as secretly as possible The clergy in striving to convert the Jews repeatedly had conferences with the rabbis of a controversial character which often led to quarrels and aggravated the lot of the Jewish community If Catholic proselystism succeeded in completely detaching a few individuals or a few families from the Israelitish creed these ardent converts rekindled the horror of the people against their former company religionists by revealing some of the precepts of the Talmud Sometimes the conversion of whole masses of Jews was effected but this happened much less through conviction on their part than through the fear of exile plunder or execution These pretended conversions however did not always protect them from danger In Spain the Inquisition kept a close watch on converted Jews and if they were not true to their new faith severe punishment was inflicted upon them In fifteen oh six the inhabitants of Abrantes a town of Portugal massacred all the baptized Jews Manoel a king of Portugal forbad the converts from selling their goods and leaving his dominions The Church excluded them from ecclesiastical dignities and when they succeeded in obtaining civil employments they were received with distrust In France the Parliaments tried with a show of justice to prevent converted Jews from being reproached for their former condition but Louis XII during his pressing wants did not scruple to exact a special tax from them And in sixteen eleven we again find that they were unjustly denounced and under the form of a Remonstrance to the King and the Parliament of Provence on account of the great family alliances of the new converts an appeal was made for the most cruel reprisals against this unfortunate race which deserved only to be banished and their goods confiscated Illustration Fig three hundred sixty eight Jewish Ceremony before the Ark Fac simile of a woodcut printed at Troyes Gipsies Tramps Beggars and Cours des Miracles

were very little better than the former of gueux or dishonest beggars and of a host of other swindlers constituting the order or hierarchy of the Argot or Slang people Their chief was called the Grand Coesre a vagabond broken to all the tricks of his trade says M Francisque Michel and who frequently ended his days on the rack or the gibbet History has furnished us with the story of a miserable cripple who used to sit in a wooden bowl and who after having been Grand Coesre for three years was broken alive on the wheel at Bordeaux for his crimes He was called Roi de Tunes Tunis and was drawn about by two large dogs One of his successors the Grand Coesre surnamed Anacreon who suffered from the same infirmity namely that of a cripple rode about Paris on a donkey begging He generally held his court on the Port au Foin where he sat on his throne dressed in a mantle made of a thousand pieces The Grand Coesre had a lieutenant in each province called cagou whose business it was to initiate apprentices in the secrets of the craft and who looked after in different localities those whom the chief had entrusted to his care He gave an account of the property he received in thus exercising his stewardship and of the money as well as of the clothing which he took from the Argotiers who refused to recognise his authority As a remuneration for their duties the cagoux were exempt from all tribute to their chief they received their share of the property taken from persons whom they had ordered to be robbed and they were free to beg in any way they pleased After the cagoux came the archisuppots who being recruited from the lowest dregs of the clergy and others who had been in a better position were so to speak the teachers of the law To them was intrusted the duty of instructing the less experienced rogues and of determining the language of Slang and as a reward for their good and loyal services they had the right of begging without paying any fees to their chiefs

malingreux had to pay forty sous they were covered with sores most of which were self inflicted or they pretended to have swellings of some kind and stated that they were about to undertake a pilgrimage to saint Meen in Brittany in order to be cured The pietres or lame rogues paid half an ecu and walked with crutches The sabouleux who were commonly called the poor sick of saint John were in the habit of frequenting fairs and markets or the vicinity of churches there smeared with blood and appearing as if foaming at the mouth by means of a piece of soap they had placed in it they struggled on the ground as if in a fit and in this way realised a considerable amount of alms These consequently paid the largest fees to the Coesre Fig three hundred seventy five Illustration Fig

saint Michael and the hubins who according to the forged certificate which they carried with them were going to or returning from saint Hubert after having been bitten by a mad dog The polissons paid two ecus to the Coesre but they earned a considerable amount especially in winter for benevolent people touched with their destitution and half nakedness gave them sometimes a doublet sometimes a shirt or some other article of clothing which of course they immediately sold The francs mitoux who were never taxed above five sous were sickly members of the fraternity or at all events pretended to

to diminish the power as well as the prestige of this eccentric sovereign and this was that the cut purses the night prowlers and wood thieves not finding sufficient means of livelihood in their own department and seeing that the Argotiers on the contrary were always in a more luxurious position tried to amalgamate robbery with mendicity which raised an outcry amongst these sections of their community The archisuppots and the cagoux at first declined such an alliance but eventually they were obliged to admit all with the exception of the wood thieves who were altogether excluded In the seventeenth century therefore in order to become a thorough Argotier it was necessary not only to solicit alms like any mere beggar but also to possess the dexterity of the cut purse and the thief These arts were to be learned in the places which served as the habitual rendezvous of the very dregs of society and which were generally known as the Cours des Miracles These houses or rather resorts had been so called if we are to believe a writer of the early part of the seventeenth century Because rogues and others who have all day been cripples maimed dropsical and beset with every sort of bodily ailment come home at night carrying under their arms a sirloin of beef a joint of veal or a leg of mutton not forgetting to hang a bottle of wine to their belt and on entering the court they throw aside their crutches resume their healthy and lusty appearance and in imitation of the ancient Bacchanalian revelries dance all kinds of dances with their trophies in their hands whilst the host is preparing their suppers Can there be a greater miracle than is to be seen in this court where the maimed walk upright Illustration Fig three hundred seventy nine Cour des Miracles of Paris Talebot

innumerable laws of these three kinds of ceremonial our attention will be directed solely to their most characteristic customs and to their most remarkable and interesting aspects taken as a whole We must altogether lay aside matters relating specially to ceremonies of a purely religions character as they are connected more or less with the traditions and customs of the Church and belong to quite a distinct order of things When the Germans and especially the Franks says the learned paleographer Vallet de Viriville had succeeded in establishing their own rule in place of that of the Romans these almost savage nations and the barbarian chiefs who were at their head under the title of kings necessarily borrowed more or less the refined practices relating to ceremonial possessed by the people whom they had conquered The elevation of the elected chief or king on the shield and the solemn taking of arms in the midst of the tribe seem to be the only traces of public ceremonies which we can discover among the Grermans The marvellous display and the imposing splendour of the political hierarchy of the Roman Empire especially in its outward arrangements must have astonished the minds of these uncultivated people Thus we find the Frank kings becoming immediately after a victory the simple and clumsy imitators of the civilisation which they had broken up Clovis on returning to Tours in five hundred seven after having defeated Alaric received the titles of Patrician and Consul from the Emperor Anastasius and bedecked himself with the purple the chlamys and the diadem The same principle of imitation was afterwards exhibited in the internal and external court ceremonial in proportion as it became developed in the royal person Charlemagne who aimed at everything which could adorn and add strength to a new monarchy established a regular method for the general and special administration of his empire as also for the internal arrangement and discipline of his palace We have already referred to this twofold organization vide chapters on Private Life and on Food but we may here remark that notwithstanding these ancient tendencies to the creation of a fixed ceremonial the trifling rules which made etiquette a science and a law were introduced by degrees and have only very recently been established amongst us In thirteen eighty five when King Charles VI married the notorious Isabel of Bavaria then scarcely fourteen years of age he desired to arrange for her a magnificent entry into Paris the pomp and brilliancy of which should be consistent with the rank and illustrious descent of his young bride He therefore begged the old Queen Blanche widow of Philippe de Valois to preside over the ceremony and to have it conducted according to the custom of olden times She was consequently obliged in the absence of any fixed rules on the subject to consult the official records that is to say the Chronique du Monastere de Saint Denis The first embodiment of rules relating to these matters in use among the nobility which had appeared in France under the title of Honneurs de la Cour only goes back to the end of the fifteenth century It appears however that even then this was not generally admitted among the nobility as the basis of ceremonial for in fifteen forty eight we find that nothing had been definitely settled This is evident from the fact that when King Henri III desired to know the rank and order of precedence of the princes of the royal blood both dukes and counts as also that of the other princes the barons the nobles of the kingdom the constables the marshals of France and the admirals and what position they had held on great public occasions during the reigns of his predecessors he commissioned Jean du Tillet the civil registrar of the Parliament of Paris to search among the royal archives for the various authentic documents which might throw light on this question and serve as a precedent for the future In fact it was Henri III who in fifteen eighty five created the office of Grand Master of the Ceremonies of France entrusting it to Guillaume Pot a noble of Rhodes which office for many generations remained hereditary in his family Illustration Fig three hundred eighty five Herald Fourteenth Century From a Miniature in the Chroniques de Saint Denis Imperial Library of Paris Nevertheless the question of ceremonial and especially that of precedence had already more than once occupied the attention of sovereigns not only within their own states but also in relation to diplomatic matters The meetings of councils at which the ambassadors of all the Christian Powers with the delegates of the Catholic Church were assembled did not fail to bring this subject up for decision Pope Julius II in fifteen oh four instructed Pierre de Crassis his Master of the Ceremonies to publish a decree determining the rank to be taken by the various sovereigns of Europe or by their representatives but we should add that this Papal decree never received the sanction of the parties interested and that the question of precedence even at the most unimportant public ceremonies was during the whole of the Middle Ages a perpetual source of litigation in courts of law and of quarrels which too often ended in bloodshed It is right that we should place at the head of political ceremonies those having reference to the coronation of sovereigns which were not only political but owed their supreme importance and dignity to the necessary intervention of ecclesiastical authority We will therefore first speak of the consecration and coronation of the kings of France Pepin le Bref son of Charles Martel and founder of the second dynasty was the first of the French kings who was consecrated by the religions rite of anointing But its mode of administration for a long period underwent numerous changes before becoming established by a definite law Thus Pepin after having been first consecrated in seven hundred fifty two in the Cathedral of Boissons by the Archbishop of Mayence was again consecrated with his two sons Charlemagne and Carloman in seven hundred fifty three in the Abbey of saint Denis by Pope Stephen III Charlemagne was twice anointed by the Sovereign Pontiff first as King of Lombardy and then as Emperor Louis le Debonnaire his immediate successor was consecrated at Rheims by Pope Stephen IV in eight hundred sixteen In eight hundred seventy seven Louis le Begue received unction and the sceptre at Compiegne at the hands of the Archbishop of Rheims Charles le Simple in eight hundred ninety three and Robert I in nine hundred twenty two were consecrated and crowned at Rheims but the coronation of Raoul in nine hundred twenty three was celebrated in the Abbey of saint Medard de Soissons and that of Louis d Outremer in nine hundred thirty six at Laon From the accession of King Lothaire to that of Louis VI called Le Gros the consecration of the kings of France sometimes took place in the metropolitan church of Rheims and sometimes in other churches but more frequently in the former Louis VI having been consecrated in the Cathedral of Orleans the clergy of Rheims appealed against this supposed infraction of custom and their own special privileges A long discussion took place in which were brought forward the titles which the Church of Rheims possessed subsequently to the reign of Clovis to the exclusive honour of having kings consecrated in it and King Louis le Jeune son of Louis le Gros who was himself consecrated at Rheims promulgated a special decree on this question in anticipation of the consecration of his son Philippe Auguste This decree finally settled the rights of this ancient church and at the same time defined the order which was to be observed in future at the ceremony of consecration From that date down to the end of the reign of the Bourbons of the elder line kings were invariably consecrated according to legal rite in the metropolitan church of Rheims with the exception of Henry IV who was crowned at Chartres by the bishop of that town on account of the civil wars which then divided his kingdom and caused the gates of Rheims to be closed against him Illustration Fig three hundred eighty six Coronation of Charlemagne Fac simile of a Miniature in the Chroniques de Saint Denis Manuscript of the Fourteenth Century Imperial Library of Paris The consecration of the kings of France always took place on a Sunday On the previous day at the conclusion of evening prayers the custody of the cathedral devolved upon certain royal officers assisted by the ordinary officials During the evening the monarch came to the church for devotion and according to his religions feelings to pass part of the night in prayer an act which was called la veillee des armes A large platform surmounted by a throne was erected between the chancel and the great nave Upon this assembled besides the King and his officers of State twelve ecclesiastical peers together with those prelates whom the King might be pleased to invite and six lay peers with other officers or nobles At daybreak the King sent a deputation of barons to the Abbey of saint Remi for the holy vial which was a small glass vessel called ampoule from the Latin word ampulla containing the holy oil to be used at the royal anointing According to tradition this vial was brought from heaven by a dove at the time of the consecration of Clovis Four of the nobles remained as hostages at the abbey during the time that the Abbot of saint Remi followed by his monks and escorted by the barons went in procession to the cathedral to place the sacred vessel upon the altar The abbot of saint Denis in France had in a similar manner to bring from Rheims with great pomp and deposit by the side of the holy vial the royal insignia which were kept in the treasury of his monastery and had been there since the reign of Charlemagne They consisted of the crown the sword sheathed the golden spurs the gilt sceptre the rod adorned with an ivory handle in the form of a hand the sandals of blue silk embroidered with fleur de lis the chasuble or dalmatique and the surcot or royal mantle in the shape of a cape without a hood The King immediately on rising from his bed entered the cathedral and forthwith took oath to maintain the Catholio faith and the privileges of the Church and to dispense good and impartial justice to his subjects He then walked to the foot of the altar and divested himself of part of his dress having his head bare and wearing a tunic with openings on the chest on the shoulders at the elbows and in the middle of the back these openings were closed by means of silver aigulets The Archbishop of Rheims then drew the sword from the scabbard and handed it to the King who passed it to the principal officer in attendance The prelate then proceeded with the religious part of the ceremony of consecration and taking a drop of the miraculous oil out of the holy vial by means of a gold needle he mixed it with the holy oil from his own church This being done and sitting in the posture of consecration he anointed the King who was kneeling before him in five different parts of the body namely on the forehead on the breast on the back on the shoulders and on the joints of the arms After this the King rose up and with the assistance of his officers put on his royal robes The Archbishop handed to him successively the ring the sceptre and the rod of justice and lastly placed the crown on his head At this moment the twelve peers formed themselves into a group the lay peers being in the first rank immediately around the sovereign and raising their hands to the crown they held it for a moment and then they conducted the King to the throne The consecrating prelate putting down his mitre then knelt at the feet of the monarch and took the oath of allegiance his example being followed by the other peers and their vassals who were in attendance At the same time the cry of Vive le Roi uttered by the archbishop was repeated three times outside the cathedral by the heralds at arms who shouted it to the assembled multitude The latter replied Noel Noel Noel and scrambled for the small pieces of money thrown to them by the officers who at the same time cried out Largesse largesse aux manants Every part of this ceremony was accompanied by benedictions and prayers the form of which was read out of the consecration service as ordered by the bishop and the proceedings terminated by the return of the civil and religious procession which had composed the cortege When the sovereign was married his wife participated with him in the honours of the consecration the symbolical investiture and the coronation but she only partook of the homage rendered to the King to a limited degree which was meant to imply that the Queen had a less extended authority and a less exalted rank Illustration Fig three hundred eighty seven Dalmatica and Sandals of Charlemagne Insignia of the Kings of France at their Coronation preserved in the Treasury of the Abbey of saint Denis The ceremonies which accompanied the accessions of the emperors of Germany Fig three hundred eighty eight are equally interesting and were settled by a decree which the Emperor Charles IX promulgated in thirteen fifty six at the Diet of Nuremberg According to the terms of this decree which is still preserved among the archives of Frankfort on the Main and which is known as the bulle d or or golden bull from the fact of its bearing a seal of pure gold on the death of an emperor the Archbishop of Mayence summoned for an appointed day the Prince Electors of the Empire who during the whole course of the Middle Ages remained seven in number in honour says the bull of the seven candlesticks mentioned in the Apocalypse These Electors who occupied the same position near the Emperor that the twelve peers did in relation to the King of France were the Archbishops of Mayence of Treves and of Cologne the King of Bohemia the Count Palatine of the Rhine the Duke of Saxony and the Margrave of Brandenburg On the appointed day the mass of the Holy Spirit was duly solemnized in the Church of saint Bartholomew of Frankfort a town in which not only the election of the Emperor but also his coronation almost always took place though one might have supposed that Aix la Chapelle would have been selected for such ceremonies The Electors attended and after the service was concluded they retired to the sacristy of the church accompanied by their officers and secretaries They had thirty days for deliberation but beyond that period they were not allowed to eat bread or drink water until they had agreed at least by a majority to give a temporal chief to the Christian people that is to say a King of the Romans who should in due time be promoted to be Emperor The newly elected prince was in fact at first simply King of the Romans and this title was often borne by persons who were merely nominated for the office by the voice of the Electors or by political combinations In order to be promoted to the full measure of power and authority the King of the Romans had to receive both religions consecration and the crown The ceremonies adopted at this solemnity were very analogous to those used at the consecrations of the kings of France as well as to those of installation of all Christian princes The service was celebrated by the Archbishop of Cologne who placed the crown on the head of the sovereign elect whom he consecrated Emperor The symbols of his authority were handed to him by the Electors and then he was proclaimed Caesar most sacred ever august Majesty Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire of the nation of Germany Illustration Fig three hundred eighty eight Costume of Emperors at their Coronation since the Time of Charlemagne From an Engraving in a Work entitled Insignia Sacre Majistatis Caesarum Principum Frankfort fifteen seventy nine in folio The imperial cortege then came out from the Church of saint Bartholomew and went through the town halting at the town hall called the Roemer in commemoration of the noble name of Rome where a splendid banquet prepared in the Kaysersaal hall of the Caesars awaited the principal performers in this august ceremony At the moment that the Emperor set foot on the threshold of the Roemer the Elector of Saxony Chief Marshal of the Empire on horseback galloped at full speed towards a heap of oats which was piled up in the middle of the square Holding in one hand a silver measure and in the other a scraper of the same metal each of which weighed six marks he filled the measure with oats levelled it with the scraper and handed it over to the hereditary marshal The rest of the heap was noisily scrambled for by the people who had been witnesses of this allegorical performance Then the Count Palatine as chief seneschal proceeded to perform his part in the ceremony which consisted of placing before the Emperor who was sitting at table four silver dishes each weighing three marks The King of Bohemia as chief butler handed to the monarch wine and water in a silver cup weighing twelve marks and then the Margrave of Magdeburg presented to him a silver basin of the same weight for washing his hands The other three Electors or arch chancellors provided at their own expense the silver baton weighing twelve marks suspended to which one of them carried the seals of the empire Lastly the Emperor and with him the Empress if he was married the princes and the Electors sat down to a banquet at separate tables and were waited upon by their respective officers On another table or stage were placed the Imperial insignia The ceremony was concluded outside by public rejoicings fountains were set to play wine beer and other beverages were distributed gigantic bonfires were made at which whole oxen were roasted refreshment tables were set out in the open air at which any one might sit down and partake and in a word every bounty as well as every amusement was provided In this way for centuries public fetes were celebrated on these occasions Illustration Fig three hundred eighty nine Imperial Procession From an Engraving of the Solemn Entry of Charles V and Clement VII into Bologna by L de Cranach from a Fresco by Brusasorci of Verona The doges of Venice as well as the emperors of Germany and some other heads of states differed from other Christian sovereigns in this respect that instead of holding their high office by hereditary or divine right they were installed therein by election At Venice a conclave consisting of forty electors appointed by a much more numerous body of men of high position elected the Doge or president of the most serene Republic From the day when Laurent Tiepolo immediately after his election in twelve sixty eight was spontaneously carried in triumph by the Venetian sailors it became the custom for a similar ovation to take place in honour of any newly elected doge In order to do this the workmen of the harbour had the new Doge seated in a splendid palanquin and carried him on their shoulders in great pomp round the Piazza San Marco But another still more characteristic ceremony distinguished this magisterial election On Ascension Day the Doge entering a magnificent galley called the Bucentaur which was elegantly equipped and resplendent with gold and precious stuffs crossed the Grand Canal went outside the town and proceeded in the midst of a nautical cortege escorted by bands of music to the distance of about a league from the town on the Adriatic Gulf Then the Patriarch of Venice gave his blessing to the sea and the Doge taking the helm threw a gold ring into the water saying O sea I espouse thee in the name and in token of our true and perpetual sovereignty Immediately the waters were strewed with flowers and the shouts of joy and the clapping of hands of the crowd were intermingled with the strains of instruments of music of all sorts whilst the glorious sky of Venice smiled on the poetic scene The greater part of the principal ceremonies of the Middle Ages acquired from various accessory and local circumstances a character of grandeur well fitted to impress the minds of the populace On these memorable occasions the exhibition of some historical memorial of certain traditional symbols of certain relics c brought to the recollection the most celebrated events in national history events already possessing the prestige of antiquity as well as the veneration of the people Thus as a memorial of the consecration of the kings of Hungary the actual crown of holy King Stephen was used at the consecration of the kings of England the actual chair of Edward the Confessor was used at the consecration of the emperors of Germany the imperial insignia actually used by Charlemagne formed part of the display at the consecration of the kings of France at a certain period the hand of justice of saint Louis which has been before alluded to was produced Illustration Fig three hundred ninety Standards of the Church and the Empire Reduced from an Engraving of the Entry of Charles V and Clement VII into Bologna by Lucas de Cranach from a Fresco by Brusasorci of Verona After their consecration by the Church and by the spiritual power the sovereigns had simply to take actual possession of their dominions and so to speak of their subjects This positive act of sovereignty was often accompanied by another class of ceremonies called joyous entry or public entry These entries of which numerous accounts have been handed down to us by historians and which for the most part were very varied in character naturally took place in the capital city We will limit ourselves to transcribing the account given by the ancient chronicler Juvenal des Ursins of the entry into Paris of Queen Isabel of Bavaria wife of Charles VI which was a curious specimen of the public fetes of this kind Illustration Fig three hundred ninety one Grand Procession of the Doge Venice Sixteenth Century Reduced from one of fourteen Engravings representing this Ceremony designed and engraved by J Amman In the year thirteen eighty nine the King was desirous that the Queen should make a public entry into Paris and this he made known to the inhabitants in order that they should make preparations for it And there were at each cross roads divers histoires historical representations pictures or tableaux vivants and fountains sending forth water wine and milk The people of Paris in great numbers went out to meet the Queen with the Provost of the Merchants crying Noel The bridge by which she passed was covered with blue taffeta embroidered with golden fleurs de lys A man of light weight dressed in the guise of an angel came down by means of some well constructed machinery from one of the towers of Notre Dame to the said bridge through an opening in the said blue taffeta at the moment when the Queen was passing and placed a beautiful crown on her head After he had done this he withdrew through the said opening by the same means and thus appeared as if he were returning to the skies of his own accord Before the Grand Chastelet there was a splendid court adorned with azure tapestry which was intended to be a representation of the lit de justice and it was very large and richly decorated In the middle of it was a very large pure white artificial stag its horns gilt and its neck encircled with a crown of gold It was so ingeniously constructed that its eyes horns mouth and all its limbs were put in motion by a man who was secreted within its body Hanging to its neck were the King s arms that is to say three gold fleur de lys on an azure shield Near the stag there was a large sword beautiful and bright unsheathed and when the Queen passed the stag was made to take the sword in the right fore foot to hold it out straight and to brandish it It was reported to the King that the said preparations were made and he said to Savoisy who was one of those nearest to him Savoisy I earnestly entreat thee to mount a good horse and I will ride behind thee and we will so dress ourselves that no one will know us and let us go and see the entry of my wife And although Savoisy did all he could to dissuade him the King insisted and ordered that it should be done So Savoisy did what the King had ordered and disguised himself as well as he could and mounted on a powerful horse with the King behind him They went through the town and managed so as to reach the Chastelet at the time the Queen was passing There was a great crowd and Savoisy placed himself as near as he could and there were sergeants on all sides with thick birch wands who in order to prevent the crowd from pressing upon and injuring the court where the stag was hit away with their wands as hard as they could Savoisy struggled continually to get nearer and nearer and the sergeants who neither knew the King nor Savoisy struck away at them and the King received several very hard and well directed blows on the shoulders In the evening in the presence of the ladies the matter was talked over and they began to joke about it and even the King himself laughed at the blows he had received The Queen on her entry was seated on a litter and very magnificently dressed as were also the ladies and maids of honour It was indeed a splendid sight and if any one wished to describe the dresses of the ladies of the knights and squires and of those who escorted the Queen it would take a long time to do so After supper singing and dancing commenced which continued until daylight The next day there were tournaments and other sports Fig three hundred

From a Pen and ink Sketch in an Original Manuscript Arch of the Empire In the course of this simple and graphic description mention has been made of the lit de justice seat of justice All judicial or legislative assemblies at which the King considered it his duty to be present were thus designated when the King came there simply as a looker on they were more commonly called plaidoyers and in this case no change was made in the ordinary arrangements but when the King presided they were called conseils and then a special ceremonial was required In fact by lit de justice Fig three hundred ninety three or cour des pairs we understand a court consisting of the high officers of the crown and of the great executive of the State whose duty it was to determine whether any peer of France should be tried on a criminal charge gravely to deliberate on any political matter of special interest or to register in the name of the absolute sovereignty of the King any edict of importance We know the prominent and we may say even the fatal part played by these solemnities which were being continually re enacted and on every sort of pretext during the latter days of monarchy These courts were always held with impressive pomp The sovereign usually summoned to them the princes of the blood royal and the officers of his household the members of the Parliament took their seats in scarlet robes the presidents being habited in their caps and their mantles and the registrars of the court also wearing their official dress The High Chancellor the First Chamberlain and the Provost of Paris sat at the King s feet The Chancellor of France the presidents and councillors of the Parliament occupied the bar and the ushers of the court were in a kneeling posture Having thus mentioned the assemblies of persons of distinction the interviews of sovereigns Fig three hundred ninety four and the reception of ambassadors without describing them in detail which would involve more space than we have at our command we will enter upon the subject of the special ceremonial adopted by the nobility taking as our guide the standard book called Honneurs de la Cour compiled at the end of the fifteenth century by the celebrated Alienor de Poitiers In addition to her own observations she gives those of her mother Isabelle de Souza who herself had but continued the work of another noble lady Jeanne d Harcourt married in thirteen ninety one to the Count William de Namur who was considered the best authority to be found in the kingdom of France This collection of the customs of the court forms a kind of family diary embracing three generations and extending back over more than a century Notwithstanding the curious and interesting character of this book and the authority which it possesses on this subject we cannot much to our regret do more than borrow a few passages from it but these carefully selected will no doubt suffice to give some idea of the manners and customs of the nobility during the fifteenth century and to illustrate the laws of etiquette of which it was the recognised code One of the early chapters of the work sets forth this fundamental law of French ceremonial namely that according to the traditions or customs of France women however exalted their position be they even king s daughters rank with their husbands We find on the occasion of the marriage of King Charles VII with Mary of Anjou in fourteen thirteen although probably there had never been assembled together so many princes and ladies of rank that at the banquet the ladies alone dined with the Queen and no gentlemen sat with them We may remark whilst on this subject that before the reign of Francis I it was not customary for the two sexes to be associated together in the ordinary intercourse of court life and we have elsewhere remarked see chapter on Private Life that this departure from ancient custom exerted a considerable influence not only on manners but also on public affairs Illustration Fig three hundred ninety four Interview of King Charles V with the Emperor Charles IV in Paris in thirteen seventy eight Fac simile of a Miniature in the Description of this Interview Manuscript of the Fifteenth Century in the Library of the Arsenal of Paris The authoress of the Honneurs de la Cour specially mentions the respect which Queen Mary of Anjou paid to the Duchess of Burgundy when she was at Chalons in Champagne in fourteen forty five The Duchess came with all her retinue on horseback and in carriages into the courtyard of the mansion where the King and Queen were and there alighted her first maid of honour acting as her train bearer M de Bourbon gave her his right hand and the gentlemen went on in front In this manner she was conducted to the hall which served as the ante chamber to the Queen s apartment There she stopped and sent in M de Crequi to ask the Queen if it was her pleasure that she should enter When the Duchess came to the door she took the train of her dress from the lady who bore it and let it trail on the ground and as she entered she knelt and then adyanced to the middle of the room There she made the same obeisance and moved straight towards the Queen who was standing close to the foot of her throne When the Duchess had performed a further act of homage the Queen advanced two or three steps and the Duchess fell on her knees the Queen then put her hand on her shoulder embraced her kissed her and commanded her to rise The Duchess then went up to Margaret of Scotland wife of the Dauphin afterwards Louis XI who was four or five feet from the Queen and paid her the same honours as she had done to the Queen although the Dauphine appeared to wish to prevent her from absolutely kneeling to her After this she turned towards the Queen of Sicily Isabelle de Lorraine wife of Rene of Anjou brother in law of the King who was two or three feet from the Dauphine and merely bowed to her and the same to another Princess Madame de Calabre who was still more distantly connected with the blood royal Then the Queen and after her the Dauphine kissed the three maids of honour of the Duchess and the wives of the gentlemen The Duchess did the same to the ladies who accompanied the Queen and the Dauphine but of those of the Queen of Sicily the Duchess kissed none inasmuch as the Queen had not kissed hers And the Duchess would not walk behind the Queen for she said that the Duke of Burgundy was nearer the crown of France than was the King of Sicily and also that she was daughter of the King of Portugal who was greater than the King of Sicily Further on from the details given of a similar reception we learn that etiquette was not at that time regulated by the laws of politeness as now understood inasmuch as the voluntary respect paid by men to the gentle sex was influenced much by social rank Thus at the time of a visit of Louis XI then Dauphin to the court of Brussels to which place he went to seek refuge against the anger of his father the Duchesses of Burgundy of Charolais and of Cleves his near relatives exhibited towards him all the tokens of submission and inferiority which he might have received from a vassal The Dauphin it is true wished to avoid this homage and a disussion on the subject of more than a quarter of an hour ensued at last he took the Duchess of Burgundy by the arm and led her away in order to cut short the ceremonies about which Madame made so much to do This however did not prevent the princesses on their withdrawing from kneeling to the ground in order to show their respect for the son of the King of France Illustration Fig three hundred ninety five The Entry of Louis XI into Paris Fac simile of a Miniature in the Chroniques of Monstrelet Manuscript of the Fifteenth Century Imperial Library of Paris We have already seen that the Duchess of Burgundy when about to appear before the Queen took her train from her train bearer in order that she might carry it herself In this she was only conforming to a general principle which was that in the presence of a superior a person however high his rank should not himself receive honours whilst at the same time paying them to another Thus a duke and a duchess amidst their court had all the things which were used at their table covered hence the modern expression mettre le couvert to lay the cloth even the wash hand basin and the cadenas a kind of case in which the cups knives and other table articles were kept but when they were entertaining a king all these marks of superiority were removed as a matter of etiquette from the table at which they sat and were passed on as an act of respect to the sovereign present The book of Dame Alienor in a series of articles to which we shall merely allude speaks at great length and enters into detail respecting the interior arrangements of the rooms in which princes and other noble children were born The formalities gone through on these occasions were as curious as they were complicated and Dame Alienor regretted to see them falling into disuse owing to which she says we fear that the possessions of the great houses of the nobility are getting too large as every one admits and chicanery or concealment of birth so as to make away with too many children is on the increase Mourning is the next subject which we shall notice The King never wore black for mourning not even for his father but scarlet or violet The Queen wore white and did not leave her apartments for a whole year Hence the name of chateau hotel or tour de la Reine Blanche which many of the buildings of the Middle Ages still bear from the fact that widowed queens inhabited them during the first year of their widowhood On occasions of mourning the various reception rooms of a house were hung with black In deep mourning such as that for a husband or a father a lady wore neither gloves jewels nor silk The head was covered with a low black head dress with trailing lappets called chaperons barbettes couvre chefs and tourets A duchess and the wife of a knight or a banneret on going into mourning stayed in their apartments for six weeks the former during the whole of this time when in deep mourning remained lying down all day on a bed covered with a white sheet whereas the latter at the end of nine days got up and until the six weeks were over remained sitting in front of the bed on a black sheet Ladies did not attend the funerals of their husbands though it was usual for them to be present at those of their fathers and mothers For an elder brother they wore the same mourning as for a father but they did not lie down as above described Illustration Fig three hundred ninety six How the King at Arms presents the Sword to the Duke of Bourbon From a Miniature in Tournois du Roi Rene Manuscript of the Fifteenth Century Imperial Library of Paris In their everyday intercourse with one another kings princes dukes and duchesses called one another monsieur and madame adding the Christian name or that of the estate A superior speaking or writing to an inferior might prefix to his or her title of relationship beau or belle for instance mon bel oncle ma belle cousine People in a lower sphere of life on being introduced to one another did not say Monsieur Jean ma belle tante mister John allow me to introduce you to my aunt but simply Jean ma tante The head of a house had his seat under a canopy or dosseret Fig three hundred ninety six which he only relinquished to his sovereign when he had the honour of entertaining him Such says Alienor in conclusion are the points of etiquette which are observed in Germany in France in Naples in Italy and in all other civilised countries and kingdoms We may here remark that etiquette after having originated in France spread throughout all Christian nations and when it had become naturalised as it were amongst the latter it acquired a settled position which it retained more firmly than it did in France In this latter country it was only from the seventeenth century and particularly under Louis XIV that court etiquette really became a science and almost a species of religions observance whose minutiae were attended to as much as if they were sacramental rites though they were not unfrequently of the most childish character and whose pomp and precision often caused the most insufferable annoyance But notwithstanding the perpetual changes of times and customs the French nation has always been distinguished for nobility and dignity tempered with good sense and elegance If we now direct our attention to the tiers etat that class which to quote a celebrated expression was destined to become everything after having for a long time been looked upon as nothing we shall notice that there too custom and tradition had much to do with ceremonies of all kinds The presence of the middle classes not only gave as it were a stamp of grandeur to fetes of an aristocratic and religions character but in addition the people themselves had a number of ceremonies of every description in which etiquette was not one whit less strict than in those of the court The variety of civic and popular ceremonies is so great that it would require a large volume illustrated with numerous engravings to explain fully their characteristic features The simple enumeration of the various public fetes each of which was necessarily accompanied by a distinct ceremonial would take up much time were we to attempt to give it even in the shortest manner Illustration Fig three hundred ninety seven Entry of the Roi de l Epinette at Lille in the Sixteenth Century From a Miniature in a Manuscript of the Library of Rouen Besides the numerous ceremonies which were purely religious namely the procession of the Fete Dieu in Rogation week and the fetes which were both of a superstitions and burlesque character such as des Fous de l Ane des Innocents and others of the same kind so much in vogue during the Middle Ages and which we shall describe more in detail hereafter we should like to mention the military or gymnastic fetes Amongst these were what were called the processions of the Confreres de l Arquebuse the Archers the Papegaut the roi de l Epinette at Lille Fig three hundred ninety seven and the Forestier at Bruges There were also what may be termed the fetes peculiar to certain places such as those of Behors of the Champs Galat at Epinal of the Laboureurs at Montelimar of Guy l an neuf at Anjou Also of the fetes of May of the sheaf of the spring of the roses of the fires of saint John c Then there were the historical or commemorative fetes such as those of the Geant Reuss at Dunkerque of the Gayant at Douai c also of Guet de Saint Maxime at Riez in Provence the processions of Jeanne d Arc at Orleans of Jeanne Hachette at Beauvais and lastly the numerous fetes of public corporations such as the Ecoliers the Nations the Universites also the Lendit the Saint Charlemagne the Baillee des roses au Parlement the literary fetes of the Pays et Chambres de rhetorique of Picardy and Flanders of the Clemence Isaure at Toulouse and of the Capitole at Rome c the fetes of the Serments Metiers and Devoirs of the working men s corporation and lastly the Fetes Patronales called also Assemblees Ducasses Folies Foires Kermesses Pardons c From this simple enumeration it can easily be understood what a useless task we should impose upon ourselves were we merely to enter upon so wide and difficult a subject Apart from the infinite variety of details resulting from the local circumstances under which these ceremonies had been instituted which were everywhere celebrated at fixed periods a kind of general principle regulated and directed their arrangement Nearly all these fetes and public rejoicings which to a certain extent constituted the common basis of popular ceremonial bore much analogy to one another There are however certain peculiarities less known and more striking than the rest which deserve to be mentioned and we shall then conclude this part of our subject Illustration Fig three hundred ninety eight Representation of a Ballet before Henri III and his Court in the Gallery of the Louvre Fac simile of an Engraving on Copper of the Ballet de la Royne by Balthazar de Beaujoyeulx folio Paris Mamert Patisson fifteen eighty two Those rites ceremonies and customs which are the most commonly observed and which most persistently keep their place amongst us are far from being of modern origin Thus the custom of jovially celebrating the commencement of the new year or of devoting certain particular days to festivity is still universally followed in every country in the world The practice of sending presents on New Year s Day is to be found among civilised nations in the East as well as in our own country In the Middle Ages the intimate friends of princes and especially of the kings of France received Christmas gifts for which they considered themselves bound to make an ample return In England these interchanges of generosity also take place on Christmas Day In Russia on Easter Day the people on meeting in the street salute one another by saying Christ is risen These practices as well as many others have no doubt been handed down to us from the early ages of Christianity The same may be said of a vast number of customs of a more or less local character which have been observed in various countries for centuries In former times at Ochsenbach in Wurtemberg during the carnival women held a feast at which they were waited upon by men and after it was over they formed themselves into a sort of court of plenary indulgence from which the men were uniformly excluded and sat in judgment on one another At Ramerupt a small town in Champagne every year on the first of May twenty of the citizens repaired to the adjoining hamlet of saint Remy hunting as they went along They were called the fools of Rameru and it was said that the greatest fool led the band The inhabitants of saint Remy were bound to receive them gratuitously and to supply them as well as their horses and dogs with what they required to have a mass said for them to put up with all the absurd vagaries of the captain and his troop and to supply them with a fine and handsome horned ram which was led back in triumph On their return into Ramerupt they set up shouts at the door of the cure the procurator fiscal and the collector of taxes and after the invention of gunpowder fireworks were let off They then went to the market place where they danced round the ram which was decorated with ribbons No doubt this was a relic of the feasts of ancient heathenism A more curious ceremony still whose origin we think may be traced to the Dionysian feasts of heathenism has continued to be observed to this day at Beziers It bears the names of the Feast of Pepezuch the Triumph of Beziers or the Feast of Caritats or Charites At the bottom of the Rue Francaise at Beziers a statue is to be seen which notwithstanding the mutilations to which it has been subjected still distinctly bears traces of being an ancient work of the most refined period of art This statue represents Pepezuch a citizen of Beziers who according to somewhat questionable tradition valiantly defended the town against the Goths or as some say against the English its origin therefore cannot be later than the thirteenth century On Ascension Day the day of the Feast of Pepezuch an immense procession went about the town Three remarkable machines were particularly noticeable the first was an enormous wooden camel made to walk by mechanism and to move its limbs and jaws the second was a galley on wheels fully manned the third consisted of a cart on which a travelling theatre was erected The consuls and other civic authorities the corporations of trades having the pastors walking in front of them the farriers on horseback all bearing their respective insignia and banners formed the procession A double column composed of a division of young men and young women holding white hoops decorated with ribbons and many coloured streamers was preceded by a young girl crowned with flowers half veiled and carrying a basket This brilliant procession marched to the sound of music and at certain distances the youthful couples of the two sexes halted in order to perform with the assistance of their hoops various figures which were called the Danse des Treilles The machines also stopped from time to time at various places The camel was especially made to enter the Church of saint Aphrodise because it was said that the apostle had first come on a camel to preach the Gospel in that country and there to receive the palm of martyrdom On arriving before the statue of Pepezuch the young people decorated it with garlands When the square of the town was reached the theatre was stopped like the ancient car of Thespis and the actors treated the people to a few comical drolleries in imitation of Aristophanes From the galley the youths flung sugar plums and sweetmeats which the spectators returned in equal profusion The procession closed with a number of men crowned with green leaves carrying on their heads loaves of bread which with other provisions contained in the galley were distributed amongst the poor of the town In Germany and in France it was the custom at the public entries of kings princes and persons of rank to offer them the wines made in the district and commonly sold in the town At Langres for instance these wines were put into four pewter vessels called cimaises which are still to be seen They were called the lion monkey sheep and pig wines symbolical names which expressed the different degrees or phases of drunkenness which they were supposed to be capable of producing the lion courage the monkey cunning the sheep good temper the pig bestiality We will now conclude by borrowing from the excellent work of M Alfred Michiels on Dutch and Flemish painting the abridged description of a procession of corporations of trades which took place at Antwerp in fifteen twenty on the Sunday after Ascension Day All the corporations of trades were present every member being dressed in his best suit In front of each guild a banner floated and immediately behind an enormous lighted wax taper was carried March music was played on long silver trumpets flutes and drums The goldsmiths painters masons silk embroiderers sculptors carpenters boatmen fishermen butchers curriers drapers bakers tailors and men of every other trade marched two abreast Then came crossbowmen arquebusiers archers c some on foot and some on horseback After them came the various monastic orders and then followed a crowd of bourgeois magnificently dressed A numerous company of widows dressed in white from head to foot particularly attracted attention they constituted a sort of sisterhood observing certain rules and gaining their livelihood by various descriptions of manual work The cathedral canons and the other priests walked in the procession in their gorgeous silk vestments sparkling with gold Twenty persons carried on their shoulders a huge figure of the Virgin with the infant Saviour in her arms splendidly decorated At the end of the procession were chariots and ships on wheels There were various groups in the procession representing scenes from the Old and New Testament such as the Salutation of the Angels the Visitation of the Magi who appeared riding on camels the Flight into Egypt and other well known historical incidents The last machine represented a dragon being led by saint Margaret with a magnificent bridle and was followed by saint George and several brilliantly attired knights

of Dress Long garments alone were worn by the ancients and up to the period when the barbarous tribes of the North made their appearance or rather until the invasion of the Roman Empire by these wandering nations male and female dress differed but little The Greeks made scarcely any change in their mode of dress for centuries but the Romans on becoming masters of the world partially adopted the dress and arms of the people they had conquered where they considered them an improvement on their own although the original style of dress was but little altered Figs four hundred and four hundred one Roman attire consisted of two garments the under garment or tunic and the outer garment or cloak the latter was known under the various names of chlamys toga and pallium but notwithstanding these several appellations there was scarcely any appreciable distinction between them The simple tunic with sleeves which answered to our shirt was like the modern blouse in shape and was called by various names The chiridota was a tunic with long and large sleeves of Asiatic origin the manuleata was a tunic with long and tight sleeves coming to the wrists the talaris was a tunic reaching to the feet the palmata was a state tunic embroidered with palms which ornamentation was often found in other parts of dress The lacerna loena cucullus chlamys sagum paludamentum were upper garments more or less coarse either full or scant and usually short and were analogous to our cloaks mantles c and were made both with and without hoods There were many varieties of the tunic and cloak invented by female ingenuity as well as of other articles of dress which formed elegant accessories to the toilet but there was no essential alteration in the national costume nor was there any change in the shape of the numerous descriptions of shoes The barbarian invasions brought about a revolution in the dress as well as in the social state of the people and it is from the time of these invasions that we may date properly speaking the history of modern dress for the Roman costume which was in use at the same time as that of the Franks the Huns the Vandals the Goths c was subjected to various changes down to the ninth century These modifications increased afterwards to such an extent that towards the fourteenth century the original type had altogether disappeared Illustration Figs four hundred and four hundred one Gallo Roman Costumes From Bas reliefs discovered in Paris in seventeen eleven underneath the Choir of Notre Dame It was quite natural that men living in a temperate climate and bearing arms only when in the service of the State should be satisfied with garments which they could wear without wrapping themselves up too closely The northern nations on the contrary had early learned to protect themselves against the severity of the climate in which they lived Thus the garments known by them as braies and by the Parthians as sarabara doubtless gave origin to those which have been respectively called by us chausses haut de chausses trousses gregues culottes pantalons c These wandering people had other reasons for preferring the short and close fitting garments to those which were long and full and these were their innate pugnacity which forced them ever to be under arms their habit of dwelling in forests and thickets their love of the chase and their custom of wearing armour The ancient Greeks and Romans always went bareheaded in the towns but in the country in order to protect themselves from the direct rays of the sun they wore hats much resembling our round hats made of felt plaited rushes or straw Other European nations of the same period also went bareheaded or wore caps made of skins of animals having no regularity of style and with the shape of which we are but little acquainted Shoes and head dresses of a definite style belong to a much more modern period as also do the many varieties of female dress which have been known at all times and in all countries under the general name of robes The girdle was only used occasionally and its adoption depended on circumstances the women used it in the same way as the men for in those days it was never attached to the dress The great difference in modern female costume consists in the fact of the girdle being part of the dress thus giving a long or short waist according to the requirements of fashion In the same manner a complete revolution took place in men s dress according as loose or tight long or short sleeves were introduced We shall commence our historical sketch from the fifth century at which period we can trace the blending of the Roman with the barbaric costume namely the combination of the long shapeless garment with that which was worn by the Germans and which was accompanied by tight fitting braies Thus in the recumbent statue which adorned the tomb of Clovis in the Church of the Abbey of saint Genevieve the King is represented as wearing the tunic and the toga but in addition Gallo Roman civilization had actually given him tight fitting braies somewhat similar to what we now call pantaloons Besides this his tunic is fastened by a belt which however was not a novelty in his time for the women then wore long dresses fastened at the waist by a girdle There is nothing very remarkable about his shoes since we find that the shoe or closed sandal was worn from the remotest periods by nearly all nations Figs four hundred two and four hundred three Illustration Fig four hundred two Costume of King Clovis Sixth Century From a Statue on his Tomb formerly in the Abbey of saint Genevieve Illustration Fig four hundred three Costume of King Childebert Seventh Century From a Statue formerly placed in the Refectory of the Abbey of saint Germain des Pres The cloak claims an equally ancient origin The principal thing worthy of notice is the amount of ornament with which the Franks enriched their girdles and the borders of their tunics and cloaks This fashion they borrowed from the Imperial court which having been transferred from Rome to Constantinople during the third century was not slow to adopt the luxury of precious stones and other rich decorations commonly in use amongst Eastern nations Following the example of Horace de Vielcastel the learned author of a history of the costumes of France we may here state that it is very difficult if not impossible to define the exact costume during the time of the early Merovingian periods The first writers who have touched upon this subject have spoken of it very vaguely or not being contemporaries of the times of which they wrote could only describe from tradition or hearsay Those monuments in which early costume is supposed to be represented are almost all of later date when artists whether sculptors or painters were not very exact in their delineations of costume and even seemed to imagine that no other style could have existed before their time than the one with which they were daily familiar In order to be as accurate as possible although after all we can only speak hypothetically we cannot do better than call to mind on the one hand what Tacitus says of the Germans that they were almost naked excepting for a short and tight garment round their waists and a little square cloak which they threw over the right shoulder and on the other to carry ourselves back in imagination to the ancient Roman costume We may notice moreover the curious description given of the Franks by Sidoine Apollinaire who says They tied up their flaxen or light brown hair above their foreheads into a kind of tuft and then made it fall behind the head like a horse s tail The face was clean shaved with the exception of two long moustaches They wore cloth garments fitting tight to the body and limbs and a broad belt to which they hung their swords But this is a sketch made at a time when the Frankish race was only known among the Gauls through its marauding tribes whose raids from time to time spread terror and dismay throughout the countries which they visited From the moment when the uncultivated tribes of ancient Germany formally took possession of the territory which they had withdrawn from Roman rule they showed themselves desirous of adopting the more gentle manners of the conquered nation In imitation of their chief says M Jules Quicherat the eminent antiquarian more than once the Franks doffed the war coat and the leather Belt and assumed the toga of Roman dignity More than once their flaxen hair was shown to advantage by flowing over the imperial mantle and the gold of the knights the purple of the senators and patricians the triumphal crowns the fasces and in short everything which the Roman Empire invented in order to exhibit its grandeur assisted in adding to that of our ancestors Illustration Figs four hundred four and four hundred five Saints in the Costume of the Sixth to the Eighth Centuries From Miniatures in old Manuscripts of the Royal Library of Brussels Designs by Count H de Vielcastel One great and characteristic difference between the Romans and the Franks should however be specially mentioned namely in the fashion of wearing the hair long a fashion never adopted by the Romans and which during the whole of the first dynasty was a distinguishing mark of kings and nobles among the Franks Agathias the Greek historian says The hair is never cut from the heads of the Frankish kings sons From early youth their hair falls gracefully over their shoulders it is parted on the forehead and falls equally on both sides it is with them a matter to which they give special attention We are told besides that they sprinkled it with gold dust and plaited it in small bands which they ornamented with pearls and precious metals Whilst persons of rank were distinguished by their long and flowing hair the people wore theirs more or less short according to the degree of freedom which they possessed and the serfs had their heads completely shaved It was customary for the noble and free classes to swear by their hair and it was considered the height of politeness to pull out a hair and present it to a person Fredegaire the chronicler relates that Clovis thus pulled out a hair in order to do honour to saint Germer Bishop of Toulouse and presented it to him upon this the courtiers hastened to imitate their sovereign and the venerable prelate returned home with his hand full of hair delighted at the flattering reception he had met with at the court of the Frankish king Durinig the Merovingian period the greatest insult that could be offered to a freeman was to touch him with a razor or scissors The degradation of kings and princes was carried out in a public manner by shaving their heads and sending them into a monastery on their regaining their rights and their authority their hair was always allowed to grow again We may also conclude that great importance was attached to the preservation of the hair even under the kings of the second dynasty for Charlemagne in his Capitulaires orders the hair to be removed as a punishment in certain crimes The Franks faithful to their ancient custom of wearing the hair long gradually gave up shaving the face At first they only left a small tuft on the chin but by degrees they allowed this to increase and in the sixth and seventh centuries freemen adopted the usual form of beard Amongst the clergy the custom prevailed of shaving the crown of the head in the same way as that adopted by certain monastic orders in the present day Priests for a long time wore beards but ceased to do so on their becoming fashionable amongst the laity Figs four hundred six four hundred seven Painters and sculptors therefore commit a serious error in representing the prelates and monks of those times with large beards As far as the monumental relics of those remote times allow us to judge the dress as worn by Clovis underwent but trifing modifications during the first dvnasty but during the reigns of Pepin and Charlemagne considerable changes were effected which resulted from the intercourse either of a friendly or hostile nature between the Franks and the southern nations About this time silk stuffs were introduced into the kingdom and the upper classes in order to distinguish themselves from the lower had their garments trimmed round with costly furs see chapter on Commerce Illustration Fig four hundred six and four hundred seven Costume of the Prelates from the Eighth to the Tenth Centuries After Miniatures in the Missal of saint Gregory in the National Library of Paris We have before stated see chapter on Private Life that Charlemagne who always was very simple in his tastes strenuously set his face against these novel introductions of luxury which he looked upon as tending to do harm Of what use are these cloaks he said in bed they cannot cover us on horseback they can neither protect us from the rain nor the wind and when we are sitting they can neither preserve our legs from the cold nor the damp He himself generally wore a large tunic made of otters skins On one occasion his courtiers went out hunting with him clothed in splendid garments of southern fashion which became much torn by the briars and begrimed with the blood of the animals they had killed Oh ye foolish men he said to them the next day as he showed them his own tunic which a servant had just returned to him in perfect condition after having simply dried it before the fire and rubbed it with his hands Whose garments are the more valuable and the more useful mine for which I have only paid a sou about twenty two francs of present money or yours which have cost so much From that time whenever this great king entered on a campaign the officers of his household even the most rich and powerful did not dare to show themselves in any clothes but those made of leather wool or cloth for had they on such occasions made their appearance dressed in silk and ornaments he would have sharply reproved them and have treated them as cowards or as effeminate and consequently unfit for the work in which he was about to engage Nevertheless this monarch who so severely proscribed luxury in daily life made the most magnificent display on the occasions of political or religious festivals when the imperial dignity with which he was invested required to be set forth by pompous ceremonial and richness of attire During the reign of the other Carlovingian kings in the midst of political troubles of internal wars and of social disturbances they had neither time nor inclination for inventing new fashions Monuments of the latter part of the ninth century prove indeed that the national dress had hardly undergone any change since the time of Charlemagne and that the influence of Roman tradition especially on festive occasions was still felt in the dress of the nobles Figs four hundred eight to four hundred eleven In a miniature of the large MS Bible given by the canons of Saint Martin of Tours in eight hundred sixty nine to Charles the Bald National Library of Paris we find the King sitting on his throne surrounded by the dignitaries of his court and by soldiers all dressed after the Roman fashion The monarch wears a cloak which seems to be made of cloth of gold and is attached to the shoulder by a strap or ribbon sliding through a clasp this cloak is embroidered in red on a gold ground the tunic is of reddish brown and the shoes are light red worked with gold thread In the same manuscript there is another painting representing four women listening to the discourse of a prophet From this we discover that the female costume of the time consisted of two tunics the under one being longer but less capacious than the other the sleeves of the former coming down tight to the wrists and being plaited in many folds whilst those of the latter open out and only reach to the elbow The lower part the neck and the borders of the sleeves are trimmed with ornamented bands the waist is encircled by a girdle just above the hips and a long veil finely worked and fastened on the head covers the shoulders and hangs down to the feet completely hiding the hair so that long plaits falling in front were evidently not then in fashion The under dress of these four women who all wear black shoes which were probably made of morocco leather are of various colours whereas the gowns or outer tunics are white Illustration Fig four hundred eight Costume of a Scholar of the Carlovingian Period saint Matthew writing his Gospel under the Inspiration of Christ From a Miniature in a Manuscript of the Ninth Century in the Burgundian Library Brussels drawn by Count H de Vielcastel Notwithstanding that under the Carlovingian dynasty it was always considered a shame and a dishonour to have the head shaved it must not be supposed that the upper classes continued to wear the long Merovingian style of hair After the reign of Charlemagne it was the fashion to shave the hair from above the forehead the parting being thus widened and the hair was so arranged that it should not fall lower than the middle of the neck Under Charles the Bald whose surname proves that he was not partial to long hair this custom fell into disuse or was abandoned and men had the greater part of their heads shaved and only kept a sort of cap of hair growing on the top of the head It is at this period that we first find the cowl worn This kind of common head dress made from the furs of animals or from woollen stuffs continued to be worn for many centuries and indeed almost to the present day It was originally only a kind of cap light and very small but it gradually became extended in size and successively covered the ears the neck and lastly even the shoulders No great change was made in the dress of the two sexes during the tenth century Nothing was more simple than the head dress of women says M Jules Quicherat nothing was less studied than their mode of wearing their hair nothing was more simple and yet finer than their linen The elegant appearance of their garments recalls that of the Greek and Roman women Their dresses were at times so tight as to display all the elegance of their form whilst at others they were made so high as completely to cover the neck the latter were called cottes hardies The cotte hardie which has at all times been part of the dress of French women and which was frequently worn also by men was a long tunic reaching to the heels fastened in at the waist and closed at the wrists Queens princesses and ladies of the nobility wore in addition a long cloak lined with ermine or a tunic with or without sleeves often too their dress consisted of two tunics and of a veil or drapery which was thrown over the head and fell down before and behind thus entirely surrounding the neck Illustration Fig four hundred nine Costume of a Scholar Fig four hundred ten Costume of a Bishop or Abbot Fac similes of Miniatures in a Manuscript of the Ninth Century Biblia Sacra in the Royal Library of Brussels We cannot find that any very decided change was made in dress before the end of the eleventh century The ordinary dress made of thick cloths and of coarse woollen stuffs was very strong and durable and not easily spoiled and it was usual as we still find in some provinces which adhere to old customs for clothes especially those worn on festive occasions and at ceremonials to be handed down as heirlooms from father to son to the third or fourth generation The Normans who came from Scandinavia towards the end of the tenth century A D nine hundred seventy with their short clothes and coats of mail at first adopted the dress of the French and continued to do so in all its various changes In the following century having found the Saxons and Britons in England clad in the garb of their ancestors slightly modified by the Roman style of apparel they began to make great changes in their manner of dressing themselves They more and more discarded Roman fashions and assumed similar costumes to those made in France at the same period Illustration Fig four hundred eleven Costume of Charles the Simple Tenth Century From a Miniature in the Rois de France by Du Tillet Manuscript of the Sixteenth Century Imperial Library of Paris Before proceeding further in our history of mediaeval dress we must forestall a remark which will not fail to be made by the reader and this is that we seem to occupy ourselves exclusively with the dress of kings queens and other people of note But we must reply that though we are able to form tolerably accurate notions relative to the dress of the upper classes during these remote periods we do not possess any reliable information relative to that of the lower orders and that the written documents as well as the sculptures and paintings are almost useless on this point Nevertheless we may suppose that the dress of the men in the lowest ranks of society has always been short and tight consisting of braies or tight drawers mostly made of leather of tight tunics of sayons or doublets and of capes or cloaks of coarse brown woollen The tunic was confined at the waist by a belt to which the knife the purse and sometimes the working tools were suspended The head dress of the people was generally a simple cap made of thick coarse woollen cloth or felt and often of sheep s skin During the twelfth century a person s rank or social position was determined by the head dress The cap was made of velvet for persons of rank and of common cloth for the poor The cornette which was always an appendage to the cap was made of cloth with which the cap might be fastened or adjusted on the head The mortier or round cap dates from the earliest centuries and was altered both in shape and material according to the various changes of fashion but lawyers of high position continued to wear it almost in its original shape and it became like a professional badge for judges and advocates In the miniatures of that time we find Charles the Good Count of Flanders who died in eleven twenty seven represented with a cap with a point at the top to which a long streamer is attached and a peak turned up in front A cap very similar but without the streamer and with the point turned towards the left is to be seen in a portrait of Geoffroy le Bel Comte de Maine in eleven fifty About the same period Agnes de Baudement is represented with a sort of cap made of linen or stuff with lappets hanging down over the shoulders she is dressed in a robe fastened round the waist and having long bands attached to the sleeves near the wrists Queen Ingeburge second wife of Philip Augustus also wore the tight gown fastened at the collar by a round buckle and two bands of stuff forming a kind of necklace she also used the long cloak and the closed shoes which had then begun to be made pointed Robert Comte de Dreux who lived at the same period is also dressed almost precisely like the Queen notwithstanding the difference of sex and rank his robe however only descends to the instep and his belt has no hangings in front The Queen is represented with her hair long and flowing but the count has his cut short Illustration Fig four hundred twelve Costume of King Louis le Jeune Miniature of the Rois de France by Du Tillet Sixteenth Century in the National Library of Paris Illustration Fig four hundred thirteen Royal Costume From a Miniature in a Manuscript of the Twelfth Century in the Burgundian Library Brussels Women in addition to their head dress often wore a broad band which was tied under the chin and gave the appearance of a kind of frame for the face Both sexes wore coloured bands on their shoes which were tied round the ankles like those of sandals and showed the shape of the foot The beard which was worn in full at the beginning of the twelfth century was by degrees modified both as to shape and length At first it was cut in a point and only covered the end of the chin but the next fashion was to wear it so as to join the moustaches Generally under Louis le Jeune Fig four hundred twelve moustaches went out of fashion We next find beards worn only by country people who according to contemporary historians desired to preserve a remembrance of their participation in the Crusades At the end of this century all chins were shaved The Crusades also gave rise to the general use of the purse which was suspended to the belt by a cord of silk or cotton and sometimes by a metal chain At the time of the Holy War it had become an emblem characteristic of pilgrims who before starting for Palestine received from the hands of the priest the cross the pilgrim s staff and the purse We now come to the time of Louis IX Figs four hundred fourteen to four hundred eighteen of that good king who according to the testimony of his historians generally dressed with the greatest simplicity but who notwithstanding his usual modesty and economy did not hesitate on great occasions to submit to the pomp required by the regal position which he held Sometimes says the Sire de Joinville he went into his garden dressed in a camel s hair coat a surcoat of linsey woolsey without sleeves a black silk cloak without a hood and a hat trimmed with peacocks feathers At other times he was dressed in a coat of blue silk a surcoat and mantle of scarlet satin and a cotton cap The surcoat sur cotte was at first a garment worn only by females but it was soon adopted by both sexes it was originally a large wrapper with sleeves and was thrown over the upper part of the robe cotte hence its name sur cotte Very soon it was made without sleeves doubtless as M Quicherat remarks that the under garment which was made of more costly material might be seen and then with the same object and in order that the due motion of the limbs might not be interfered with the surcoat was raised higher above the hips and the arm holes were made very large Illustration Fig four hundred fourteen Costume of a Princess dressed in a Cloak lined with Fur From a Miniature of the Thirteenth Century

cloak or surcoat is trimmed with ermine in front and has the appearance of what we should now call a fur shawl The young King has long hose and shoes similar in shape to high slippers In the same painting Queen Margaret his wife wears a gown with tight bodice opened out on the hips and having long and narrow sleeves she also has a cloak embroidered with fleurs de lis the long sleeves of which are slit up and bordered with ermine a kind of hood much larger than her head and over this a veil which passes under the chin without touching the face the shoes are long and seem to enclose the feet very tightly Illustration Fig four hundred sixteen Costumes of the Thirteenth Century Tristan and the beautiful Yseult From a Miniature in the Romance of Tristan Manuscript of the Fourteenth Century Imperial Library of Paris From this period gowns with tight bodices were generally adopted the women wore over them a tight jacket reaching to a little below the hips often trimmed with fur when the gown was richly ornamented and itself richly ornamented when the gown was plain They also began to plait the hair which fell down by the side of the face to the neck and they profusely decorated it with pearls or gold or silver ornaments Jeanne Queen of Navarre wife of Philippe le Bel is represented with a pointed cap on the turned up borders of which the hair clusters in thick curls on each side of the face on the chest is a frill turned down in two points the gown fastened in front by a row of buttons has long and tight sleeves with a small slit at the wrists closed by a button lastly the Queen wears over all a sort of second robe in the shape of a cloak the sleeves of which are widely slit in the middle At the end of the thirteenth century luxury was at its height at the court of France gold and silver pearls and precious stones were lavished on dress At the marriage of Philip III son of saint Louis the gentlemen were dressed in scarlet the ladies in cloth of gold embroidered and trimmed with gold and silver lace Massive belts of gold were also worn and chaplets sparkling with the same costly metal Moreover this magnificence and display see chapter on Private Life was not confined to the court for we find that it extended to the bourgeois class since Philippe le Bel by his edict of twelve ninety four endeavoured to limit this extravagance which in the eyes of the world had an especial tendency to obliterate or at least to conceal all distinctions of birth rank and condition Wealth strove hard at that time to be the sole standard of dress As we approach the fourteenth century an epoch of the Middle Ages at which after many changes of fashion and many struggles against the ancient Roman and German traditions modern national costume seems at last to have assumed a settled and normal character we think it right to recapitulate somewhat with a view to set forth the nature of the various elements which were at work from time to time in forming the fashions in dress In order to give more weight to our remarks we will extract almost word for word a few pages from the learned and excellent work which M Jules Quicherat has published on this subject Towards the year twelve eighty he says the dress of a man not of a man as the word was then used which meant serf but of one to whom the exercise of human prerogatives was permitted that is to say of an ecclesiastic a bourgeois or a noble was composed of six indispensable portions the braies or breeches the stockings the shoes the coat the surcoat or cotte hardie and the chaperon or head dress To these articles those who wished to dress more elegantly added on the body a shirt on the shoulders a mantle and on the head a hat or fronteau Illustration Fig four hundred seventeen Costumes of the Common People in the Fourteenth Century Italian Gardener and Woodman From two Engravings in the Bonnart Collection The braies or brayes were a kind of drawers generally knitted sometimes made of woollen stuff or silk and sometimes even of undressed leather Our ancestors derived this part of their dress from the ancient Gauls only the Gallic braies came down to the ankle whereas those of the thirteenth century only reached to the calf They were fastened above the hips by means of a belt called the braier By chausses was meant what we now call long stockings or hose The stockings were of the same colour and material as the braies and were kept up by the lower part of the braies being pulled over them and tied with a string The shoes were made of various kinds of leather the quality of which depended on the way in which they were tanned and were either of common leather or of leather which was similar to that we know as morocco and was called cordouan or cordua hence the derivation of the word cordouannier which has now become cordonnier Shoes were generally made pointed this fashion of the poulaines or Polish points was followed throughout the whole of Europe for nearly three hundred years and when first introduced the Church was so scandalized by it that it was almost placed in the catalogue of heresies Subsequently the taste respecting the exaggerated length of the points was somewhat modified but it had become so inveterate that the tendency for pointed shoes returning to their former absurd extremes was constantly showing itself The pointed shoes became gradually longer during the struggles which were carried on in the reign of Philippe le Bel between Church and State Besides the shoes there were also the estiviaux thus named from estiva summer thing because being generally made of velvet brocade or other costly material they could only be worn in dry weather The coat cotte corresponded with the tunic of the ancients it was a blouse with tight sleeves These sleeves were the only part of it which were exposed the rest being completely covered by the surcoats or cotte hardie a name the origin of which is obscure In shape the surcoat somewhat resembled a sack in which at a later period large slits were made in the arms as well as over the hips and on the chest through which appeared the rich furs and satins with which it was lined The ordinary material of the surcoat for the rich was cloth either scarlet blue or reddish brown or two or more of these colours mixed together and for the poor linsey woolsey or fustian The nobles princes or barons when holding a court wore surcoats of a colour to match their arms which were embroidered upon them but the lesser nobles who frequented the houses of the great spoke of themselves as in the robes of such and such a noble because he whose patronage they courted was obliged to provide them with surcoats and mantles These were of their patron s favourite colour and were called the livery livree on account of their distribution livraison which took place twice a year The word has remained in use ever since but with a different signification it is however so nearly akin to the original meaning that its affinity is evident Illustration Fig four hundred eighteen Costume of English Servants in the Fourteenth Century From Manuscripts in the British Museum Illustration Fig four hundred nineteen Costume of Philip the Good with Hood and Cockade From a Miniature in a Manuscript of the Period An interesting anecdote relative to this custom is to be found in the chronicles of Matthew Paris When saint Louis to the dismay of all his vassals and of his inferior servants had decided to take up the cross he succeeded in associating the nobles of his court with him in his vow by a kind of pious fraud Having had a certain number of mantles prepared for Christmas day he had a small white cross embroidered on each above the right shoulder and ordered them to be distributed among the nobles on the morning of the feast when they were about to go to mass which was celebrated some time before sunrise Each courtier received the mantle given by the King at the door of his room and put it on in the dark without noticing the white cross but when the day broke to his great surprise he saw the emblem worn by his neighbour without knowing that he himself wore it also They were surprised and amused says the English historian at finding that the King had thus piously entrapped them As it would have been unbecoming shameful and even unworthy of them to have removed these crosses they laughed heartily and said that the good King on starting as a pilgrim hunter had found a new method of catching men The chaperon adds M Quicherat was the national head dress of the ancient French as the cucullus which was its model was that of the Gauls We can imagine its appearance by its resemblance to the domino now worn at masked balls The shape was much varied during the reign of Philippe le Bel either by the diminution of the cape or by the lengthening of the hood which was always sufficiently long to fall on the shoulders In the first of these changes the chaperon no longer being tied round the neck required to be held on the head by something more solid For this reason it was set on a pad or roll which changed it into a regular cap The material was so stitched as to make it take certain folds which were arranged as puffs as ruffs or in the shape of a cock s comb this last fashion called cockade was especially in vogue Fig four hundred nineteen hence the origin of the French epithet coquard which would be now expressed by the word dandy Hats were of various shapes They were made of different kinds of felt or of otter or goat s skin or of wool or cotton The expression chapeau de fleurs hat of flowers which continually occurs in ancient works did not mean any form of hat but simply a coronet of forget me nots or roses which was an indispensable part of dress for balls or festivities down to the reign of Philippe de Valois thirteen forty seven Frontlets fronteaux a species of fillet made of silk covered with gold and precious stones superseded the chapeau de fleurs inasmuch as they had the advantage of not fading They also possessed the merit of being much more costly and were thus the means of establishing in a still more marked manner distinctions in the social positions of the wearers Illustration Fig four hundred twenty Costumes of a rich Bourgeoise of a Peasant woman and of a Lady of the Nobility of the Fourteenth Century From various painted Windows in the Churches of Moulins Bourbonnais Illustration Saint Catherine Surrounded by the Doctors of Alexandria A miniature from the Breviary of the cardinal Grimani attributed to Memling Bibl of Saint Marc Venice From a copy belonging to M Ambroise Firmin Didot There were two kinds of mantles one was open in front and fell over the back and a strap which crossed the chest held it fixed on the shoulders the other enveloping the body like a bell was slit up on the right side and was thrown back over the left arm it was made with a fur collar cut in the shape of a tippet This last has been handed down to us and is worn by our judges under the name of toge and epitoge It is a very common mistake to suppose that the shirt is an article of dress of modern invention on the contrary it is one of great antiquity and its coming into general use is the only thing new about it Lastly we have to mention the chape which was always regarded as a necessary article of dress The chape was the only protection against bad weather at a period when umbrellas and covered carriages were unknown It was sometimes called chape de pluie on account of the use to which it was applied and it consisted of a large cape with sleeves and was completely waterproof It was borne behind a master by his servant who on account of this service was called a porte chape It is needless to say that the common people carried it themselves either slung over their backs or folded under the arm If we now turn to female attire we shall find represented in it all the component parts of male dress and almost all of them under the same names It must be remarked however that the women s coats and surcoats often trailed on the ground that the hat which was generally called a couvre chef and consisted of a frame of wirework covered over with stuff which was embroidered or trimmed with lace was not of a conical shape and lastly that the chaperon which was always made with a tippet or chausse never turned over so as to form a cap We may add that the use of the couvre chef did not continue beyond the middle of the fourteenth century at which time women adopted the custom of wearing any kind of head dress they chose the hair being kept back by a silken net or crepine attached either to a frontlet or to a metal fillet or confined by a veil of very light material called a mollequin Fig four hundred twenty With the aid of our learned guide we have now reached a period end of the thirteenth century well adapted for this general study of the dress of our ancestors inasmuch as soon afterwards men s dress at least and especially that of young courtiers became most ridiculously and even indecently exaggerated To such an extent was this the case that serious calamities having befallen the French nation about this time and its fashions having exercised a considerable influence over the whole continent of Europe contemporary historians do not hesitate to regard these public misfortunes as a providential chastisement inflicted on France for its disgraceful extravagance in dress Illustration Fig four hundred twenty one Costumes of a young Nobleman and of a Bourgeois in the Fourteenth Century From a painted Window in the Church of Saint Ouen at Rouen and from a Window at Moulins Bourbonnais We must believe that God has permitted this as a just judgment on us for our sins say the monks who edited the Grande Chronique de saint Denis in thirteen forty six at the time of the unfortunate battle of Cressy although it does not belong to us to judge But what we see we testify to for pride was very great in France and especially amongst the nobles and others that is to say pride of nobility and covetousness There was also much impropriety in dress and this extended throughout the whole of France Some had their clothes so short and so tight that it required the help of two persons to dress and undress them and whilst they were being undressed they appeared as if they were being skinned Others wore dresses plaited over their loins like women some had chaperons cut out in points all round some had tippets of one cloth others of another and some had their head dresses and sleeves reaching to the ground looking more like mountebanks than anything else Considering all this it is not surprising if God employed the King of England as a scourge to correct the excesses of the French people And this is not the only testimony to the ridiculous and extravagant tastes of this unfortunate period One writer speaks with indignation of the goats beards with two points which seemed to put the last finishing touch of ridicule on the already grotesque appearance of even the most serious people of that period Another exclaims against the extravagant luxury of jewels of gold and silver and against the wearing of feathers which latter then appeared for the first time as accessories to both male and female attire Some censure and not without reason the absurd fashion of converting the ancient leather girdle meant to support the waist into a kind of heavy padded band studded with gilded ornaments and precious stones and apparently invented expressly to encumber the person wearing it Other contemporary writers and amongst these Pope Urban V and King Charles V Fig four hundred twenty two inveigh against the poulaines which had more than ever come into favour and which were only considered correct in fashion when they were made as a kind of appendix to the foot measuring at least double its length and ornamented in the most fantastical manner The Pope anathematized this deformity as a mockery of God and the holy Church and the King forbad craftsmen to make them and his subjects to wear them All this is as nothing in comparison with the profuse extravagance displayed in furs which was most outrageous and ruinous and of which we could not form an idea were it not for the items in certain royal documents from which we gather that in order to trim two complete suits for King John no fewer than six hundred and seventy martens skins were used It is also stated that the Duke of Berry the youngest son of that monarch purchased nearly ten thousand of these same skins from a distant country in the north in order to trim only five mantles and as many surcoats We read also that a robe made for the Duke of Orleans grandson of the same king required two thousand seven hundred and ninety ermines skins It is unnecessary to state that in consequence of this large consumption skins could only be purchased at the most extravagant prices for example fifty skins cost about one hundred francs or about six thousand of present currency showing to what an enormous expense those persons were put who desired to keep pace with the luxury of the times Fig four hundred twenty four Illustration Fig four hundred twenty two Costume of Charles V King of France From a Statue formerly in the Church of the Celestins Paris Illustration Fig four hundred twenty three Costume of Jeanne de Bourbon Wife of Charles V From a Statue formerly in the Church of the Celestins Paris We have already seen that Charles V used his influence which was unfortunately very limited in trying to restrain the extravagance of fashion This monarch did more than decree laws against indelicate or unseemly and ridiculous dress he himself never wore anything but the long and ample costume which was most becoming and which had been adopted in the preceding century His example it is true was little followed but it nevertheless had this happy resuit that the advocates of short and tight dresses as if suddenly seized with instinctive modesty adopted an upper garment the object of which seemed to be to conceal the absurd fashions which they had not the courage to rid themselves of This heavy and ungraceful tunic called a housse consisted of two broad bands of a more or less costly material which starting from the neck fell behind and before thus almost entirely concealing the front and back of the person and only allowing the under garments to be seen through the slits which naturally opened on each side of it A fact worthy of remark is that whilst male attire through a depravity of taste had extended to the utmost limit of extravagance women s dress on the contrary owing to a strenuous effort towards a dignified and elegant simplicity became of such a character that it combined all the most approved fashions of female costume which had been in use in former periods The statue of Queen Jeanne de Bourbon wife of Charles V formerly placed with that of her husband in the Church of the Celestins at Paris gives the most faithful representation of this charming costume to which our artists continually have recourse when they wish to depict any poetical scenes of the French Middle Ages Fig four hundred twenty three Illustration Fig four hundred twenty four Costumes of Bourgeois or Merchant of a Nobleman and of a Lady of the Court or rich Bourgeoise with the Head dress escoffion of the Fifteenth Century From a Painted Window of the Period at Moulins Bourbonnais and from a Painting on Wood of the same Period in the Musee de Cluny This costume without positively differing in style from that of the thirteenth century inasmuch as it was composed of similar elements was nevertheless to be distinguished by a degree of elegance which hitherto had been unknown The coat or under garment which formerly only showed itself through awkwardly contrived openings now displayed the harmonious outlines of the figure to advantage thanks to the large openings in the overcoat The surcoat kept back on the shoulders by two narrow bands became a sort of wide and trailing skirt which majestically draped the lower part of the body and lastly the external corset was invented which was a kind of short mantle falling down before and behind without concealing any of the fine outlines of the bust This new article of apparel which was kept in its place in the middle of the chest by a steel busk encased in some rich lace work was generally made of fur in winter and of silk in summer If we consult the numerous miniatures in manuscripts of this period in which the gracefulness of the costume was heightened by the colours employed we shall understand what variety and what richness of effect could be displayed without departing from the most rigid simplicity One word more in reference to female head dress The fashion of wearing false hair continued in great favour during the middle of the fourteenth century and it gave rise to all sorts of ingenious combinations which however always admitted of the hair being parted from the forehead to the back of the head in two equal masses and of being plaited or waved over the ears Nets were again adopted and head dresses which whilst permitting a display of masses of false hair hid the horsehair or padded puffs And lastly the escoffion appeared a heavy roll which being placed on a cap also padded produced the most clumsy outrageons and ungraceful shapes Fig four hundred twenty four At the beginning of the fifteenth century men s dress was still very short It consisted of a kind of tight waistcoat fastened by tags and of very close fitting breeches which displayed the outlines of the figure In order to appear wide at the shoulders artificial pads were worn called mahoitres The hair was allowed to fall on the forehead in locks which covered the eyebrows and eyes The sleeves were slashed the shoes armed with long metal points and the conical hat with turned up rim was ornamented with gold chains and various jewels The ladies during the reign of Charles VI still wore long trains to their dresses which they carried tucked up under their arms unless they had pages or waiting maids see chapter on Ceremonials The tendency however was to shorten these inconvenient trains as well as the long hanging and embroidered or fringed sleeves On the other hand ladies dresses on becoming shorter were trimmed in the most costly manner Their head dresses consisted of very large rolls surmounted by a high conical bonnet called a hennin the introduction of which into France was attributed to Queen Isabel of Bavaria wife of Charles VI It was at this period that they began to uncover the neck and to wear necklaces Illustration Fig four hundred twenty five Italian Costumes of the Fifteenth Century Notary and Sbirro From two Engravings in the Bonnart Collection Illustration Fig four hundred twenty six Costumes of a Mechanic s Wife and a rich Bourgeois in the latter part of the Fifteenth Century From Windows in the Cathedral of Moulins Bourbonnais Under Louis XI this costume already followed and adopted by the greatest slaves of fashion became more general In this year fourteen eighty seven says the chronicler Monstrelet ladies ceased to wear trains substituting for them trimmings of grebe of martens fur of velvet and of other materials of about eighteen inches in width some wore on the top of their heads rolls nearly two feet high shaped like a round cap which closed in above Others wore them lower with veils hanging from the top and reaching down to the feet Others wore unusually wide silk bands with very elegant buckles equally wide and magnificent gold necklaces of various patterns About this time too men took to wearing shorter clothes than ever having them made to fit tightly to the body after the manner of dressing monkeys which was very shameful and immodest and the sleeves of their coats and doublets were slit open so as to show their fine white shirts They wore their hair so long that it concealed their face and even their eyes and on their heads they wore cloth caps nearly a foot or more high They also carried according to fancy very splendid gold chains Knights and squires and even the varlets wore silk or velvet doublets and almost every one especially at court wore poulaines nine inches or more in length They also wore under their doublets large pads mahoitres in order to appear as if they had broad shoulders Under Charles VIII the mantle trimmed with fur was open in front its false sleeves being slit up above in order to allow the arms of the under coat to pass through The cap was turned up the breeches or long hose were made tight fitting The shoes with poulaines were superseded by a kind of large padded shoe of black leather round or square at the toes and gored over the foot with coloured material a fashion imported from Italy and which was as much exaggerated in France as the poulaine had formerly been The women continued to wear conical caps hennins of great height covered with immense veils their gowns were made with tight fitting bodies which thus displayed the outlines of the figure Figs four hundred twenty seven and four hundred twenty eight Under Louis XII Queen Anne invented a low head dress or rather it was invented for her consisting of strips of velvet or of black or violet silk over other bands of white linen which encircled the face and fell down over the back and shoulders the large sleeves of the dresses had a kind of turned over borders with trimmings of enormous width Men adopted short tunics plaited and tight at the waist The upper part of the garments of both men and women was cut in the form of a square over the chest and shoulders as most figures are represented in the pictures of Raphael and contemporary painters Illustration Italian Lacework in Gold Thread The cypher and arms of Henry III

Quedeville s Collection in Paris The Arms of Louis XI and Charlotte are painted behind the picture Illustration Fig four hundred twenty eight Costume of Mary of Burgundy Daughter of Charles the Bold Wife of Maximilian of Austria end of the Fifteenth Century From an old Engraving in the Collection of the Imperial Library Paris The introduction of Italian fashions which in reality did not much differ from those which had been already adopted but which exhibited better taste and a greater amount of elegance dates from the famous expedition of Charles VIII into Italy Figs four hundred twenty nine and four hundred thirty Full and gathered or puffed sleeves which gave considerable gracefulness to the upper part of the body succeeded to the mahoitres which had been discarded since the time of Louis XI A short and ornamental mantle a broad brimmed hat covered with feathers and trunk hose the ample dimensions of which earned for them the name of trousses formed the male attire at the end of the fifteenth century Women wore the bodies of their dresses closely fitting to the figure embroidered trimmed with lace and covered with gilt ornaments the sleeves were very large and open and for the most part they still adhered to the heavy and ungraceful head dress of Queen Anne of Brittany The principal characteristic of female dress at the time was its fulness men s on the contrary with the exception of the mantle or the upper garment was usually tight and very scanty We find that a distinct separation between ancient and modern dress took place as early as the sixteenth century in fact our present fashions may be said to have taken their origin from about that time It was during this century that men adopted clothes closely fitting to the body overcoats with tight sleeves felt hats with more or less wide brims and closed shoes and boots The women also wore their dresses closely fitting to the figure with tight sleeves low crowned hats and richly trimmed petticoats These garments which differ altogether from those of antiquity constitute as it were the common type from which have since arisen the endless varieties of male and female dress and there is no doubt that fashion will thus be continually changing backwards and forwards from time to time sometimes returning to its original model and sometimes departing from it Illustration Figs four hundred twenty nine and four hundred thirty Costumes of Young Nobles of the Court of Charles VIII before and after the Expedition into Italy From Miniatures in two Manuscripts of the Period in the National Library of Paris During the sixteenth century ladies wore the skirts of their dresses which were tight at the waist and open in front very wide displaying the lower part of a very rich under petticoat which reached to the ground completely concealing the feet This like the sleeves with puffs which fell in circles to the wrists was altogether an Italian fashion Frequently the hair was turned over in rolls and adorned with precious stones and was surmounted by a small cap coquettishly placed either on one side or on the top of the head and ornamented with gold chains jewels and feathers The body of the dress was always long and pointed in front Men wore their coats cut somewhat after the same shape their trunk hose were tight but round the waist they were puffed out They wore a cloak which only reached as far as the hips and was always much ornamented they carried a smooth or ribbed cap on one side of the head and a small upright collar adorned the coat This collar was replaced after the first half of the sixteenth century by the high starched ruff which was kept out by wires ladies wore it still larger when it had somewhat the appearance of an open fan at the back of the neck If we take a retrospective glance at the numerous changes of costume which we have endeavoured to describe in this hurried sketch we shall find that amongst European nations during the Middle Ages there was but one common standard of fashion which varied from time to time according to the particular custom of each country and according to the peculiarities of each race In Italy for instance dress always maintained a certain character of grandeur ever recalling the fact that the influence of antiquity was not quite lost In Germany and Switzerland garments had generally a heavy and massive appearance in Holland still more so Figs four hundred thirty six and four hundred thirty seven England uniformly studied a kind of instinctive elegance and propriety It is a curious fact that Spain invariably partook of the heaviness peculiar to Germany either because the Gothic element still prevailed there or that the Walloon fashions had a special attraction to her owing to associations and general usage France was then as it is now fickle and capricious fantastical and wavering but not from indifference but because she was always ready to borrow from every quarter anything which pleased her She however never failed to put her own stamp on whatever she adopted thus making any fashion essentially French even though she had only just borrowed it from Spain England Germany or Italy In all these countries we have seen and still see entire provinces adhering to some ancient costume causing them to differ altogether in character from the rest of the nation This is simply owing to the fact that the fashions have become obsolete in the neighbouring places for every local costume faithfully and rigorously preserved by any community at a distance from the centre of political action or government must have been originally brought there by the nobles of the country Thus the head dress of Anne of Brittany is still that of the peasant women of Penhoet and of Labrevack and the hennin of Isabel of Bavaria is still the head dress of Normandy Illustration Fig four hundred thirty one Costumes of a Nobleman or a very rich Bourgeois of a Bourgeois or Merchant and of a Noble Lady or rich Bourgeoise of the Time of Louis XII From Miniatures in Manuscripts of the Period in the Imperial Library of Paris Illustration Fig four hundred thirty two Costume of a rich Bourgeoise and of a Noble or Person of Distinction of the Time of Francis I From a Window in the Church of saint Ouen at Rouen by Gaignieres National Library of Paris Although the subject has reached the limits we have by the very nature of this work assigned to it we think it well to overstep them somewhat in order briefly to indicate the last connecting link between modern fashions and those of former periods Illustration Figs four hundred thirty three and four hundred thirty four Costumes of the Ladies and Damsels of the Court of Catherine de Medicis After Cesare Vecellio Under Francis I the costumes adopted from Italy remained almost stationary Fig four hundred thirty two Under Henri II Figs four hundred thirty three and four hundred thirty four and especially after the death of that prince the taste for frivolities made immense progress and the style of dress in ordinary use seemed day by day to lose the few traces of dignity which it had previously possessed Catherine de Medicis had introduced into France the fashion of ruffs and at the beginning of the fourteenth century Marie de Medicis that of small collars Dresses tight at the waist began to be made very full round the hips by means of large padded rolls and these were still more enlarged under the name of vertugadins corrupted from vertu gardiens by a monstrous arrangement of padded whalebone and steel which subsequently became the ridiculous paniers which were worn almost down to the commencement of the present century and the fashion seems likely to come into vogue again Illustration Fig four hundred thirty five Costume of a Gentleman of the French Court of the End of the Sixteenth Century Fac simile of a Miniature in the Livre de Poesies Manuscript dedicated to Henry IV Under the last of the Valois men s dress was short the jacket was pointed and trimmed round with small peaks the velvet cap was trimmed with aigrettes the beard was pointed a pearl hung from the left ear and a small cloak or mantle was carried on the shoulder which only reached to the waist The use of gloves made of scented leather became universal Ladies wore their dresses long very full and very costly little or no change being made in these respects during the reign of Henry IV At this period the men s high hose were made longer and fuller especially in Spain and the Low Countries and the fashion of large soft boots made of doeskin or of black morocco became universal on account of their being so comfortable We may remark that the costume of the bourgeois was for a long time almost unchanged even in the towns Never having adopted either the tight fitting hose or the balloon trousers they wore an easy jerkin a large cloak and a felt hat which the English made conical and with a broad brim Towards the beginning of the seventeenth century the high hose which were worn by the northern nations profusely trimmed was transformed into the culotte which was full and open at the knees A division was thus suddenly made between the lower and the upper part of the hose as if the garment which covered the lower limbs had been cut in two and garters were then necessarily invented The felt hat became over almost the whole of Europe a cap taking the exact form of the head and having a wide flat brim turned up on one side High heels were added to boots and shoes which up to that time had been flat and with single soles Two centuries later a terrible social agitation took place all over Europe after which male attire became mean ungraceful plain and more paltry than ever whereas female dress the fashions of which were perpetually changing from day to day became graceful and elegant though too often approaching to the extravagant and absurd Illustration Figs four hundred thirty six and four

Gutenberg tm electronic works Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support Project Gutenberg tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U S unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook s eBook number often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII compressed zipped HTML and others Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number The replaced older file is renamed VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility http www gutenberg net This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg tm including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks EBooks posted prior to November two thousand three with eBook numbers BELOW ten thousand are filed in directories based on their release date If you want to download any of these eBooks directly rather than using the regular search system you may utilize the following addresses and just download by the etext year http www gutenberg net etextsix Or etext five four three two one zero ninety nine ninety eight ninety seven ninety six ninety five ninety four ninety
