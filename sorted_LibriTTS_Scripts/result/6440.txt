PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ELSIE DINSMORE Produced by Vital Debroey Charles Franks and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team ELSIE DINSMORE BY MARTHA FINLEY CHAPTER FIRST I never saw an eye so bright And yet so soft as hers It sometimes swam in liquid light And sometimes swam in tears It seemed a beauty set apart For softness and for sighs missus WELBY The school room at Roselands was a very pleasant apartment the ceiling it is true was somewhat lower than in the more modern portion of the building for the wing in which it was situated dated back to the old fashioned days prior to the Revolution while the larger part of the mansion had not stood more than twenty or thirty years but the effect was relieved by windows reaching from floor to ceiling and opening on a veranda which overlooked a lovely flower garden beyond which were fields and woods and hills The view from the veranda was very beautiful and the room itself looked most inviting with its neat matting its windows draped with snow white muslin its comfortable chairs and pretty rosewood desks Within this pleasant apartment sat Miss Day with her pupils six in number She was giving a lesson to Enna the youngest the spoiled darling of the family the pet and plaything of both father and mother It was always a trying task to both teacher and scholar for Enna was very wilful and her teacher s patience by no means inexhaustible There exclaimed Miss Day shutting the book and giving it an impatient toss on to the desk go for I might as well try to teach old Bruno I presume he would learn about as fast And Enna walked away with a pout on her pretty face muttering that she would tell mamma Young ladies and gentlemen said Miss Day looking at her watch I shall leave you to your studies for an hour at the end of which time I shall return to hear your recitations when those who have attended properly to their duties will be permitted to ride out with me to visit the fair Oh that will be jolly exclaimed Arthur a bright eyed mischief loving boy of ten Hush said Miss Day sternly let me hear no more such exclamations and remember that you will not go unless your lessons are thoroughly learned Louise and Lora addressing two young girls of the respective ages of twelve and fourteen that French exercise must be perfect and your English lessons as well Elsie to a little girl of eight sitting alone at a desk near one of the windows and bending over a slate with an appearance of great industry every figure of that example must be correct your geography lesson recited perfectly and a page in your copybook written without a blot Yes ma am said the child meekly raising a pair of large soft eyes of the darkest hazel for an instant to her teacher s face and then dropping them again upon her slate And see that none of you leave the room until I return continued the governess Walter if you miss one word of that spelling you will have to stay at home and learn it over Unless mamma interferes as she will be pretty sure to do muttered Arthur as the door closed on Miss Day and her retreating footsteps were heard passing down the hall For about ten minutes after her departure all was quiet in the school room each seemingly completely absorbed in study But at the end of that time Arthur sprang up and flinging his book across the room exclaimed There I know my lesson and if I didn t I shouldn t study another bit for old Day or Night either Do be quiet Arthur said his sister Louise I can t study in such a racket Arthur stole on tiptoe across the room and coming up behind Elsie tickled the back of her neck with a feather She started saying in a pleading tone Please Arthur don t It pleases me to do he said repeating the experiment Elsie changed her position saying in the same gentle persuasive tone O Arthur please let me alone or I never shall be able to do this example What all this time on one example you ought to be ashamed Why I could have done it half a dozen times over I have been over and over it replied the little girl in a tone of despondency and still there are two figures that will not come right How do you know they are not right little puss shaking her curls as he spoke Oh please Arthur don t pull my hair I have the answer that s the way I know Well then why don t you just set the figures down I would Oh no indeed that would not be honest Pooh nonsense nobody would be the wiser nor the poorer No but it would be just like telling a lie But I can never get it right while you are bothering me so said Elsie laying her slate aside in despair Then taking out her geography she began studying most diligently But Arthur continued his persecutions tickling her pulling her hair twitching the book out of her hand and talking almost incessantly making remarks and asking questions till at last Elsie said as if just ready to cry Indeed Arthur if you don t let me alone I shall never be able to get my lessons Go away then take your book out on the veranda and learn your lessons there said Louise I ll call you when Miss Day comes Oh no Louise I cannot do that because it would be disobedience replied Elsie taking out her writing materials Arthur stood over her criticising every letter she made and finally jogged her elbow in such a way as to cause her to drop all the ink in her pen upon the paper making quite a large blot Oh cried the little girl bursting into tears now I shall lose my ride for Miss Day will not let me go and I was so anxious to see all those beautiful flowers Arthur who was really not very vicious felt some compunction when he saw the mischief he had done Never mind Elsie said he I can fix it yet Just let me tear out this page and you can begin again on the next and I ll not bother you I ll make these two figures come right too he added taking up her slate Thank you Arthur said the little girl smiling through her tears you are very kind but it would not be honest to do either and I had rather stay at home than be deceitful Very well miss said he tossing his head and walking away since you won t let me help you it is all your own fault if you have to stay at home Elsie exclaimed Louise I have no patience with you such ridiculous scruples as you are always raising I shall not pity you one bit if you are obliged to stay at home Elsie made no reply but brushing away a tear bent over her writing taking great pains with every letter though saying sadly to herself all the time It s of no use for that great ugly blot will spoil it all She finished her page and excepting the unfortunate blot it all looked very neat indeed showing plainly that it had been written with great care She then took up her slate and patiently went over and over every figure of the troublesome example trying to discover where her mistake had been But much time had been lost through Arthur s teasing and her mind was so disturbed by the accident to her writing that she tried in vain to fix it upon the business in hand and before the two troublesome figures had been made right the hour was past and Miss Day returned Oh thought Elsie if she will only hear the others first I may be able to get this and the geography ready yet and perhaps if Arthur will be generous enough to tell her about the blot she may excuse me for it But it was a vain hope Miss Day had no sooner seated herself at her desk than she called Elsie come here and say that lesson and bring your copybook and slate that I may examine your work Elsie tremblingly obeyed The lesson though a difficult one was very tolerably recited for Elsie knowing Arthur s propensity for teasing had studied it in her own room before school hours But Miss Day handed back the book with a frown saying I told you the recitation must be perfect and it was not She was always more severe with Elsie than with any other of her pupils The reason the reader will probably be able to divine ere long There are two incorrect figures in this example said she laying down the slate after glancing over its contents Then taking up the copy book she exclaimed Careless disobedient child did I not caution you to be careful not to blot your book There will be no ride for you this morning You have failed in everything Go to your seat Make that example right and do the next learn your geography lesson over and write another page in your copy book and mind if there is a blot on it you will get no dinner Weeping and sobbing Elsie took up her books and obeyed During this scene Arthur stood at his desk pretending to study but glancing every now and then at Elsie with a conscience evidently ill at ease She cast an imploring glance at him as she returned to her seat but he turned away his head muttering It s all her own fault for she wouldn t let me help her As he looked up again he caught his sister Lora s eyes fixed on him with an expression of scorn and contempt He colored violently and dropped his eyes upon his book Miss Day said Lora indignantly I see Arthur does not mean to speak and as I cannot bear to see such injustice I must tell you that it is all his fault that Elsie has failed in her lessons for she tried her very best but he teased her incessantly and also jogged her elbow and made her spill the ink on her book and to her credit she was too honorable to tear out the leaf from her copy book or to let him make her example right both which he very generously proposed doing after causing all the mischief Is this so Arthur asked Miss Day angrily The boy hung his head but made no reply Very well then said Miss Day you too must stay at home Surely said Lora in surprise you will not keep Elsie since I have shown you that she was not to blame Miss Lora replied her teacher haughtily I wish you to understand that I am not to be dictated to by my pupils Lora bit her lip but said nothing and Miss Day went on hearing the lessons without further remark In the meantime the little Elsie sat at her desk striving to conquer the feelings of anger and indignation that were swelling in her breast for Elsie though she possessed much of the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit was not yet perfect and often had a fierce contest with her naturally quick temper Yet it was seldom very seldom that word or tone or look betrayed the existence of such feelings and it was a common remark in the family that Elsie had no spirit The recitations were scarcely finished when the door opened and a lady entered dressed for a ride Not through yet Miss Day she asked Yes madam we are just done replied the teacher closing the French grammar and handing it to Louise Well I hope your pupils have all done their duty this morning and are ready to accompany us to the fair said missus Dinsmore But what is the matter with Elsie She has failed in all her exercises and therefore has been told that she must remain at home replied Miss Day with heightened color and in a tone of anger and as Miss Lora tells me that Master Arthur was partly the cause I have forbidden him also to accompany us Excuse me Miss Day for correcting you said Lora a little indignantly but I did not say partly for I am sure it was entirely his fault Hush hush Lora said her mother a little impatiently how can you be sure of any such thing Miss Day I must beg of you to excuse Arthur this once for I have quite set my heart on taking him along He is fond of mischief I know but he is only a child and you must not be too hard upon him Very well madam replied the governess stiffly you have of course the best right to control your own children missus Dinsmore turned to leave the room Mamma asked Lora is not Elsie to be allowed to go too Elsie is not my child and I have nothing to say about it Miss Day who knows all the circumstances is much better able than I to judge whether or no she is deserving of punishment replied missus Dinsmore sailing out of the room You will let her go Miss Day said Lora inquiringly Miss Lora replied Miss Day angrily I have already told you I was not to be dictated to I have said Elsie must remain at home and I shall not break my word Such injustice muttered Lora turning away Lora said Louise impatiently why need you concern yourself with Elsie s affairs for my part I have no pity for her so full as she is of nonsensical scruples Miss Day crossed the room to where Elsie was sitting leaning her head upon the desk struggling hard to keep down the feelings of anger and indignation aroused by the unjust treatment she had received Did I not order you to learn that lesson over said the governess and why are you sitting here idling Elsie dared not speak lest her anger should show itself in words so merely raised her head and hastily brushing away her tears opened the book But Miss Day who was irritated by missus Dinsmore s interference and also by the consciousness that she was acting unjustly seemed determined to vent her displeasure upon her innocent victim Why do you not speak she exclaimed seizing Elsie by the arm and shaking her violently Answer me this instant Why have you been idling all the morning I have not replied the child hastily stung to the quick by her unjust violence I have tried hard to do my duty and you are punishing me when I don t deserve it at all How dare you there take that for your impertinence said Miss Day giving her a box on the ear Elsie was about to make a still more angry reply but she restrained herself and turning to her book tried to study though the hot blinding tears came so thick and fast that she could not see a letter De carriage am waiting ladies an missus in a hurry said a servant opening the door and Miss Day hastily quitted the room followed by Louise and Lora and Elsie was left alone She laid down the geography and opening her desk took out a small pocket Bible which bore the marks of frequent use She turned over the leaves as though seeking for some particular passage at length she found it and wiping away the blinding tears she read these words in a low murmuring tone For this is thankworthy if a man for conscience toward God endure grief suffering wrongfully For what glory is it if when ye be buffeted for your faults ye shall take it patiently but if when ye do well and suffer for it ye take it patiently this is acceptable with God For even hereunto were ye called because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that ye should follow His steps Oh I have not done it I did not take it patiently I am afraid I am not following in His steps she cried bursting into an agony of tears and sobs My dear little girl what is the matter asked a kind voice and a soft hand was gently laid on her shoulder The child looked up hastily O Miss Allison she said is it you I thought I was quite alone And so you were my dear until this moment replied the lady drawing up a chair and sitting down close beside her I was on the veranda and hearing sobs came in to see if I could be of any assistance You look very much distressed will you not tell me the cause of your sorrow Elsie answered only by a fresh burst of tears They have all gone to the fair and left you at home alone perhaps to learn a lesson you have failed in reciting said the lady inquiringly Yes ma am said the child but that is not the worst and her tears fell faster as she laid the little Bible on the desk and pointed with her finger to the words she had been reading Oh she sobbed I I did not do it I did not bear it patiently I was treated unjustly and punished when I was not to blame and I grew angry Oh I m afraid I shall never be like Jesus never never The child s distress seemed very great and Miss Allison was extremely surprised She was a visitor who had been in the house only a few days and herself a devoted Christian had been greatly pained by the utter disregard of the family in which she was sojourning for the teachings of God s word Rose Allison was from the North and mister Dinsmore the proprietor of Roselands was an old friend of her father to whom he had been paying a visit and finding Rose in delicate health he had prevailed upon her parents to allow her to spend the winter months with his family in the more congenial clime of their Southern home My poor child she said passing her arm around the little one s waist my poor little Elsie that is your name is it not Yes ma am Elsie Dinsmore replied the little girl Well Elsie let me read you another verse from this blessed book Here it is The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin And here again If any man sin we have an advocate with the Father Jesus Christ the righteous Dear Elsie if we confess our sins He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins Yes ma am said the child I have asked Him to forgive me and I know He has but I am so sorry oh so sorry that I have grieved and displeased Him for O Miss Allison I do love Jesus and want to be like Him always Yes dear child we must grieve for our sins when we remember that they helped to slay the Lord But I am very very glad to learn that you love Jesus and are striving to do His will I love Him too and we will love one another for you know He says By this shall men know that ye are my disciples if ye have love one to another said Miss Allison stroking the little girl s hair and kissing her tenderly Will you love me Oh how glad I am exclaimed the child joyfully I have nobody to love me but poor old mammy And who is mammy asked the lady My dear old nurse who has always taken care of me Have you not seen her ma am Perhaps I may I have seen a number of nice old colored women about here since I came But Elsie will you tell me who taught you about Jesus and how long you have loved Him Ever since I can remember replied the little girl earnestly and it was dear old mammy who first told me how He suffered and died on the cross for us Her eyes filled with tears and her voice quivered with emotion She used to talk to me about it just as soon as I could understand anything she continued and then she would tell me that my own dear mamma loved Jesus and had gone to be with Him in heaven and how when she was dying she put me a little wee baby I was then not quite a week old into her arms and said Mammy take my dear little baby and love her and take care of her just as you did of me and O mammy be sure that you teach her to love God Would you like to see my mamma Miss Allison And as she spoke she drew from her bosom a miniature set in gold and diamonds which she wore suspended by a gold chain around her neck and put it in Rose s hand It was the likeness of a young and blooming girl not more than fifteen or sixteen years of age She was very beautiful with a sweet gentle winning countenance the same soft hazel eyes and golden brown curls that the little Elsie possessed the same regular features pure complexion and sweet smile Miss Allison gazed at it a moment in silent admiration then turning from it to the child with a puzzled expression she said But Elsie I do not understand are you not sister to Enna and the rest and is not missus Dinsmore own mother to them all Yes ma am to all of them but not to me nor my papa Their brother Horace is my papa and so they are all my aunts and uncles Indeed said the lady musingly I thought you looked very unlike the rest And your papa is away is he not Elsie Yes ma am he is in Europe He has been away almost ever since I was born and I have never seen him Oh how I do wish he would come home how I long to see him Do you think he would love me Miss Allison Do you think he would take me on his knee and pet me as grandpa does Enna I should think he would dear I don t know how he could help loving his own dear little girl said the lady again kissing the little rosy cheek But now she added rising I must go away and let you learn your lesson Then taking up the little Bible and turning over the leaves she asked Would you like to come to my room sometimes in the mornings and evenings and read this book with me Elsie Oh yes ma am dearly exclaimed the child her eyes sparkling with pleasure Come then this evening if you like and now goodbye for the present And pressing another kiss on the child s cheek she left her and went back to her own room where she found her friend Adelaide Dinsmore a young lady near her own age and the eldest daughter of the family Adelaide was seated on a sofa busily employed with some fancy work You see I am making myself quite at home she said looking up as Rose entered I cannot imagine where you have been all this time Can you not In the school room talking with little Elsie Do you know Adelaide I thought she was your sister but she tells me not No she is Horace s child I supposed you knew but if you do not I may just as well tell you the whole story Horace was a very wild boy petted and spoiled and always used to having his own way and when he was about seventeen quite a forward youth he was too he must needs go to New Orleans to spend some months with a schoolmate and there he met and fell desperately in love with a very beautiful girl a year or two younger than himself an orphan and very wealthy Fearing that objections would be made on the score of their youth et cetera et cetera he persuaded her to consent to a private marriage and they had been man and wife for some months before either her friends or his suspected it Well when it came at last to papa s ears he was very angry both on account of their extreme youth and because as Elsie Grayson s father had made all his money by trade he did not consider her quite my brother s equal so he called Horace home and sent him North to college Then he studied law and since that he has been traveling in foreign lands But to return to his wife it seems that her guardian was quite as much opposed to the match as papa and the poor girl was made to believe that she should never see her husband again All their letters were intercepted and finally she was told that he was dead so as Aunt Chloe says she grew thin and pale and weak and melancholy and while the little Elsie was yet not quite a week old she died We never saw her she died in her guardian s house and there the little Elsie stayed in charge of Aunt Chloe who was an old servant in the family and had nursed her mother before her and of the housekeeper missus Murray a pious old Scotch woman until about four years ago when her guardian s death broke up the family and then they came to us Horace never comes home and does not seem to care for his child for he never mentions her in his letters except when it is necessary in the way of business She is a dear little thing said Rose I am sure he could not help loving her if he could only see her Oh yes she is well enough and I often feel sorry for the lonely little thing but the truth is I believe we are a little jealous of her she is so extremely beautiful and heiress to such an immense fortune Mamma often frets and says that one of these days she will quite eclipse her younger daughters But then said Rose she is almost as near her own grand daughter No she is not so very near replied Adelaide for Horace is not mamma s son He was seven or eight years old when she married papa and I think she was never particularly fond of him

none	none	yes thought Rose that explains it Poor little Elsie No wonder you pine for your father s love and grieve over the loss of the mother you never knew She is an odd child said Adelaide I don t understand her she is so meek and patient she will fairly let you trample upon her It provokes papa He says she is no Dinsmore or she would know how to stand up for her own rights and yet she has a temper I know for once in a great while it shows itself for an instant only an instant though and at very long intervals and then she grieves over it for days as though she had committed some great crime while the rest of us think nothing of getting angry half a dozen times in a day And then she is forever poring over that little Bible of hers what she sees so attractive in it I m sure I cannot tell for I must say I find it the dullest of dull books Do you said Rose how strange I had rather give up all other books than that one Thy testimonies have I taken as a heritage forever for they are the rejoicing of my heart How sweet are thy words unto my taste Yea sweeter than honey to my mouth Do you really love it so Rose asked Adelaide lifting her eyes to her friend s face with an expression of astonishment do tell me why For its exceeding great and precious promises Adelaide for its holy teachings for its offers of peace and pardon and eternal life I am a sinner Adelaide lost ruined helpless hopeless and the Bible brings me the glad news of salvation offered as a free unmerited gift it tells me that Jesus died to save sinners just such sinners as I I find that I have a heart deceitful above all things and desperately wicked and the blessed Bible tells me how that heart can be renewed and where I can obtain that holiness without which no man shall see the Lord I find myself utterly unable to keep God s holy law and it tells me of One who has kept it for me I find that I deserve the wrath and curse of a justly offended God and it tells me of Him who was made a curse for me I find that all my righteousnesses are as filthy rags and it offers me the beautiful spotless robe of Christ s perfect righteousness Yes it tells me that God can be just and the justifier of him who believes in Jesus Rose spoke these words with deep emotion then suddenly clasping her hands and raising her eyes she exclaimed Thanks be unto God for His unspeakable gift For a moment there was silence Then Adelaide spoke Rose said she you talk as if you were a great sinner but I don t believe it it is only your humility that makes you think so Why what have you ever done Had you been a thief a murderer or guilty of any other great crime I could see the propriety of your using such language with regard to yourself but for a refined intelligent amiable young lady excuse me for saying it dear Rose but such language seems to me simply absurd Man looketh upon the outward appearance but the Lord pondereth the heart said Rose gently No dear Adelaide you are mistaken for I can truly say mine iniquities have gone over my head as a cloud and my transgressions as a thick cloud Every duty has been stained with sin every motive impure every thought unholy From my earliest existence God has required the undivided love of my whole heart soul strength and mind and so far from yielding it I live at enmity with Him and rebellion against His government until within the last two years For seventeen years He has showered blessings upon me giving me life health strength friends and all that was necessary for happiness and for fifteen of those years I returned Him nothing but ingratitude and rebellion For fifteen years I rejected His offers of pardon and reconciliation turned my back upon the Saviour of sinners and resisted all the strivings of God s Holy Spirit and will you say that I am not a great sinner Her voice quivered and her eyes were full of tears Dear Rose said Adelaide putting her arm around her friend and kissing her cheek affectionately don t think of these things religion is too gloomy for one so young as you Gloomy dear Adelaide replied Rose returning the embrace I never knew what true happiness was until I found Jesus My sins often make me sad but religion never Oft I walk beneath the cloud Dark as midnight s gloomy shroud But when fear is at the height Jesus comes and all is light CHAPTER SECOND Thy injuries would teach patience to blaspheme Yet still thou art a dove BEAUMONT S Double Marriage When forced to part from those we love Though sure to meet to morrow We yet a kind of anguish prove And feel a touch of sorrow But oh what words can paint the fears When from these friends we sever Perhaps to part for months for years Perhaps to part forever ANON When Miss Allison had gone and Elsie found herself once more quite alone she rose from her chair and kneeling down with the open Bible before her she poured out her story of sins and sorrows in simple child like words into the ears of the dear Saviour whom she loved so well confessing that when she had done well and suffered for it she had not taken it patiently and earnestly pleading that she might be made like unto the meek and lowly Jesus Low sobs burst from her burdened heart and the tears of penitence fell upon the pages of the holy book But when she rose from her knees her load of sin and sorrow was all gone and her heart made light and happy with a sweet sense of peace and pardon Once again as often before the little Elsie was made to experience the blessedness of the man whose transgression is forgiven whose sin is covered She now set to work diligently at her studies and ere the party returned was quite prepared to meet Miss Day having attended faithfully to all she had required of her The lesson was recited without the smallest mistake every figure of the examples worked out correctly and the page of the copy book neatly and carefully written Miss Day had been in a very captious mood all day and seemed really provoked that Elsie had not given her the smallest excuse for fault finding Handing the book back to her she said very coldly I see you can do your duties well enough when you choose Elsie felt keenly the injustice of the remark and longed to say that she had tried quite as earnestly in the morning but she resolutely crushed down the indignant feeling and calling to mind the rash words that had cost her so many repentant tears she replied meekly I am sorry I did not succeed better this morning Miss Day though I did really try and I am still more sorry for the saucy answer I gave you and I ask your pardon for it You ought to be sorry replied Miss Day severely and I hope you are for it was a very impertinent speech indeed and deserving of a much more severe punishment than you received Now go and never let me hear anything of the kind from you again Poor little Elsie s eyes filled with tears at these ungracious words accompanied by a still more ungracious manner but she turned away without a word and placing her books and slate carefully in her desk left the room Rose Allison was sitting alone in her room that evening thinking of her far distant home when hearing a gentle rap at her door she rose and opened it to find Elsie standing there with her little Bible in her hand Come in darling she said stooping to give the little one a kiss I am very glad to see you I may stay with you for half an hour Miss Allison if you like said the child seating herself on the low ottoman pointed out by Rose and then mammy is coming to put me to bed It will be a very pleasant half hour to both of us I hope replied Rose opening her Bible They read a chapter together Rose now and then pausing to make a few explanations and then kneeling down she offered up a prayer for the teachings of the Spirit and for God s blessing on themselves and all their dear ones Dear little Elsie she said folding the child in her arms when they had risen from their knees how I love you already and how very glad I am to find that there is one in this house beside myself who loves Jesus and loves to study His word and to call upon His name Yes dear Miss Allison and there is more than one for mammy loves Him too very dearly replied the little girl earnestly Does she darling Then I must love her too for I cannot help loving all who love my Saviour Then Rose sat down and drawing the little girl to a seat on her knee they talked sweetly together of the race they were running and the prize they hoped to obtain at the end of it of the battle they were fighting and the invisible foes with whom they were called to struggle the armor that had been provided and of Him who had promised to be the Captain of their salvation and to bring them off more than conquerors They were pilgrims in the same straight and narrow way and it was very pleasant thus to walk a little while together Then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another and the Lord hearkened and heard it and a book of remembrance was written before Him for them that feared the Lord and that thought upon His name And they shall be mine saith the Lord of hosts in that day when I make up my jewels and I will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him That is mammy coming for me said Elsie as a low knock was heard at the door Come in said Rose and the door opened and a very nice colored woman of middle age looking beautifully neat in her snow white apron and turban entered with a low courtesy asking Is my little missus ready for bed now Yes said Elsie jumping off Rose s lap but come here mammy I want to introduce you to Miss Allison How do you do Aunt Chloe I am very glad to know you since Elsie tells me you are a servant of the same blessed Master whom I love and try to serve said Rose putting her small white hand cordially into Chloe s dusky one Deed I hope I is missus replied Chloe pressing it fervently in both of hers I s only a poor old black sinner but de good Lord Jesus He loves me jes de same as if I was white an I love Him an all His chillen with all my heart Yes Aunt Chloe said Rose He is our peace and hath made both one and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us so that we are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of God and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone Yes missus dat s it for sure ole Chloe knows dat s in de Bible an if we be built on dat bressed corner stone we s safe ebery one I se heard it many s de time an it fills dis ole heart with joy an peace in believing she exclaimed raising her tearful eyes and clasping her hands But good night missus I must put my chile to bed she added taking Elsie s hand Good night Aunt Chloe come in again said Rose And good night to you too dear little Elsie folding the little girl again in her arms Ain t dat a bressed young lady darlin exclaimed Chloe earnestly as she began the business of preparing her young charge for bed O mammy I love her so much she s so good and kind replied the child and she loves Jesus and loves to talk about Him She reminds me of your dear mamma Miss Elsie but she s not so handsome replied the nurse with a tear in her eye ole Chloe tinks dere s nebber any lady so beautiful as her dear young missus was Elsie drew out the miniature and kissed it murmuring Dear darling mamma then put it back in her bosom again for she always wore it day and night She was standing in her white night dress the tiny white feet just peeping from under it while Chloe brushed back her curls and put on her night cap Dere now darlin you s ready for bed she exclaimed giving the child a hug and a kiss No mammy not quite replied the little girl and gliding away to the side of the bed she knelt down and offered up her evening prayer Then coming back to the toilet table she opened her little Bible saying Now mammy I will read you a chapter while you are getting ready for bed The room was large and airy and Aunt Chloe who was never willing to leave her nursling but watched over her night and day with the most devoted affection slept in a cot bed in one corner Tank you my dear young missus you s berry good she said beginning the preparations for the night by taking off her turban and replacing it by a thick night cap When the chapter was finished Elsie got into bed saying Now mammy you may put out the light as soon as you please and be sure to call me early in the morning for I have a lesson to learn before

none	none	 That I will darlin replied the old woman spreading the cover carefully over her Good night my pet your ole mammy hopes her chile will have pleasant dreams Rose Allison was an early riser and as the breakfast hour at Roselands was eight o clock she always had an hour or two for reading before it was time to join the family circle She had asked Elsie to come to her at half past seven and punctually at the hour the little girl s gentle rap was heard at her door Come in said Rose and Elsie entered looking as bright and fresh and rosy as the morning She had her little Bible under her arm and a bouquet of fresh flowers in her hand Good morning dear Miss Allison she said dropping a graceful courtesy as she presented it I have come to read and I have just been out to gather these for you because I know you love flowers Thank you darling they are very lovely said Rose accepting the gift and bestowing a caress upon the giver You are quite punctual she added and now we can have our half hour together before breakfast The time was spent profitably and pleasantly and passed so quickly that both were surprised when the breakfast bell rang Miss Allison spent the whole fall and winter at Roselands and it was very seldom during all that time that she and Elsie failed to have their morning and evening reading and prayer together Rose was often made to wonder at the depth of the little girl s piety and the knowledge of divine things she possessed But Elsie had had the best of teaching Chloe though entirely uneducated was a simple minded earnest Christian and with a heart full of love to Jesus had as we have seen early endeavored to lead the little one to Him and missus Murray the housekeeper whom Adelaide had mentioned and who had assisted Chloe in the care of the child from the time of her birth until a few months before Rose s coming when she had suddenly been summoned home to Scotland had proved a very faithful friend She was an intelligent woman and devotedly pious and had carefully instructed this lonely little one for whom she felt almost a parent s affection and her efforts to bring her to a saving knowledge of Christ had been signally owned and blessed of God and in answer to her earnest prayers the Holy Spirit had vouchsafed His teachings without which all human instruction must ever be in vain And young as Elsie was she had already a very lovely and well developed Christian character Though not a remarkably precocious child in other respects she seemed to have very clear and correct views on almost every subject connected with her duty to God and her neighbor was very truthful both in word and deed very

none	none	in her observance of the Sabbath though the rest of the family were by no means particular in that respect very diligent in her studies respectful to superiors and kind to inferiors and equals and she was gentle sweet tempered patient and forgiving to a remarkable degree Rose became strongly attached to her and the little girl fully returned her affection Elsie was very sensitive and affectionate and felt keenly the want of sympathy and love for which at the time of Rose s coming she had no one to look to but poor old Chloe who loved her with all her heart It is true Adelaide sometimes treated her almost affectionately and Lora who had a very strong sense of justice occasionally interfered and took her part when she was very unjustly accused but no one seemed really to care for her and she often felt sad and lonely mister Dinsmore though her own grandfather treated her with entire neglect seemed to have not the slightest affection for her and usually spoke of her as old Crayson s grandchild missus Dinsmore really disliked her because she looked upon her as the child of a stepson for whom she had never felt any affection and also as the future rival of her own children while the governess and the younger members of the family following the example of their elders treated her with neglect and occasionally even with abuse Miss Day knowing that she was in no danger of incurring the displeasure of her superiors by so doing vented upon her all the spite she dared not show to her other pupils and continually she was made to give up her toys and pleasures to Enna and even sometimes to Arthur and Walter It often cost her a struggle and had she possessed less of the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit her life had been wretched indeed But in spite of all her trials and vexations little Elsie was the happiest person in the family for she had in her heart that peace which the world can neither give nor take away that joy which the Saviour gives to His own and no man taketh from them She constantly carried all her sorrows and troubles to Him and the coldness and neglect of others seemed but to drive her nearer to that Heavenly Friend until she felt that while possessed of His love she could not be unhappy though treated with scorn and abuse by all the world The good are better made by ill As odors crushed are sweeter still And even so it seemed to be with little Elsie her trials seemed to have only the effect of purifying and making more lovely her naturally amiable character Elsie talked much and thought more of her absent and unknown father and longed with an intensity of desire for his return home It was her dream by day and by night that he had come that he had taken her to his heart calling her his own darling child his precious little Elsie for such were the loving epithets she often heard lavished upon Enna and which she longed to hear addressed to herself But from month to month and year to year that longed for return had been delayed until the little heart had grown sick with hope deferred and was often weary with its almost hopeless waiting But to return Elsie said Adelaide as Miss Allison and the little girl entered the breakfast room on the morning after Elsie s disappointment the fair is not over yet and Miss Allison and I are going to ride out there this afternoon so if you are a good girl in school you may go with us Oh thank you dear Aunt Adelaide exclaimed the little girl clapping her hands with delight how kind you are and I shall be so glad Miss Day frowned and looked as if she wanted to reprove her for her noisy demonstrations of delight but standing somewhat in awe of Adelaide said nothing But Elsie suddenly relapsed into silence for at that moment missus Dinsmore entered the room and it was seldom that she could utter a word in her presence without being reproved and told that children should be seen and not heard though her own were allowed to talk as much as they pleased Miss Day seemed cross missus Dinsmore was moody and taciturn complaining of headache and mister Dinsmore occupied with the morning paper and so the meal passed off in almost unbroken silence Elsie was glad when it was over and hastening to the school room she began her tasks without waiting for the arrival of the regular hour for study She had the room entirely to herself and had been busily engaged for half an hour in working out her examples when the opening of the door caused her to look up and to her dismay Arthur entered He did not however as she feared begin his customary course of teasing and tormenting but seated himself at his desk leaning his head upon his hand in an attitude of dejection Elsie wondered what ailed him his conduct was so unusual and she could not help every now and then sending an inquiring glance toward him and at length she asked What is the matter Arthur Nothing much said he gruffly turning his back to her Thus repulsed she said no more but gave her undivided attention to her employment and so diligent was she that Miss Day had no excuse whatever for fault finding this morning Her tasks were all completed within the required time and she enjoyed her promised ride with her aunt and Miss Allison and her visit to the fair very much indeed It was still early when they returned and finding that she had nearly an hour to dispose of before tea time Elsie thought she would finish a drawing which she had left in her desk in the school room While searching for it and her pencil she heard Lora s and Arthur s voices on the veranda She did not notice what they were saying until her own name struck her ear Elsie is the only person Lora was saying who can and probably will help you for she has plenty of money and she is so kind and generous but if I were you I should be ashamed to ask her after the way you acted toward her I wish I hadn t teased her so yesterday replied Arthur disconsolately but it s such fun I can t help it sometimes Well I know I wouldn t ask a favor of anybody I had treated so said Lora walking away Elsie sat still a few moments working at her drawing and wondering all the time what it was Arthur wanted and thinking how glad she would be of an opportunity of returning him good for evil She did not like though to seek his confidence but presently hearing him heave a deep sigh she rose and went out on the veranda He was leaning on the railing in an attitude of dejection his head bent down and his eyes fixed on the floor She went up to him and laying her hand softly on his shoulder said in the sweet gentle tones natural to her What ails you Arthur Can I do anything for you I will be very glad if I can No yes he answered hesitatingly I wouldn t like to ask you after after Oh never mind said Elsie quickly I do not care anything about that now I had the ride to day and that was better still because I went with Aunt Adelaide and Miss Allison Tell me what you want Thus encouraged Arthur replied I saw a beautiful little ship yesterday when I was in the city it was only five dollars and I ve set my heart on having it but my pocket money s all gone and papa won t give me a cent until next month s allowance is due and by that time the ship will be gone for it s such a beauty somebody ll be sure to buy it Won t your mamma buy it for you asked Elsie No she says she hasn t the money to spare just now You know it s near the end of the month and they ve all spent their allowances except Louise and she says she ll not lend her money to such a spendthrift as I am Elsie drew out her purse and seemed just about to put it into his hand but apparently changing her mind she hesitated a moment and then returning it to her pocket said with a half smile I don t know Arthur five dollars is a good deal for a little girl like me to lay out at once I must think about it a little I don t ask you to give it he replied scornfully I ll pay it back in two weeks Well I will see by to morrow morning she said darting away while he sent an angry glance after her muttering the word stingy between his teeth Elsie ran down to the kitchen asking of one and another of the servants as she passed Where s Pompey The last time she put the question to Phoebe the cook but was answered by Pompey himself Here am Pomp Miss Elsie what does little missy want wid dis chile Are you going to the city to night Pompey Yes Miss Elsie I se got some arrants to do for missus an de family in ginral an I ben gwine start in bout ten minutes Little missy wants sumpin eh Elsie motioned to him to come close to her and then putting her purse into his hands she told him in a whisper of Arthur s wish and directed him to purchase the coveted toy and bring it to her if possible without letting any one else know anything about it And keep half a dollar for yourself Pompey to pay you for your trouble she added in conclusion Tank you little missy he replied with a broad grin of satisfaction dat be berry good pay and Pomp am de man to do dis business up for you bout right The tea bell rang and Elsie hastened away to answer the summons She looked across the table at Arthur with a pleasant smile on her countenance but he averted his eyes with an angry scowl and with a slight sigh she turned away her head and did not look at him again during the meal Pompey executed his commission faithfully and when Elsie returned to her own room after her evening hour with Miss Rose Chloe pointed out the little ship standing on the mantel Oh it s a little beauty cried Elsie clapping her hands and dancing up and down with delight how Arthur will be pleased Now mammy can you take it to the school room and put it on Master Arthur s desk without anybody seeing you Ole Chloe ll try darlin she said taking it in her hands Oh wait one moment exclaimed Elsie and taking a card she wrote on it A present to Arthur from his niece Elsie Then laying it on the deck of the little vessel There mammy she said I think that will do but please look out first to see whether any one is in the hall Coast all clear darlin replied Chloe after a careful survey all de chillens am in bed before dis time I spec And taking a candle in one hand and the little ship in the other she started for the school room She soon returned with a broad grin of satisfaction on her black face saying All right darlin I put him on Massa Arthur s desk an nobody de wiser So Elsie went to bed very happy in the thought of the pleasure Arthur would have in receiving her present She was hurrying down to the breakfast room the next morning a little in advance of Miss Rose who had stopped to speak to Adelaide when Arthur came running up behind her having just come in by a side door from the garden and seizing her round the waist he said Thank you Elsie you re a real good girl She sails beautifully I ve been trying her on the pond But it mustn t be a present you must let me pay you back when I get my allowance Oh no Arthur that would spoil it all she answered quickly you are entirely welcome and you know my allowance is so large that half the time I have more money than I know how to spend I should like to see the time that would be the case with me said he laughing Then in a lower tone Elsie I m sorry I teased you so I ll not do it again soon Elsie answered him with a grateful look as she stepped past him and quietly took her place at the table Arthur kept his word and for many weeks entirely refrained from teasing Elsie and while freed from that annoyance she was always able to have her tasks thoroughly prepared and though her governess was often unreasonable and exacting and there was scarcely a day in which she was not called upon to yield her own wishes or pleasures or in some way to inconvenience herself to please Walter or Enna or occasionally the older members of the family yet it was an unusually happy winter to her for Rose Allison s love and uniform kindness shed sunshine on her path She had learned to yield readily to others and when fretted or saddened by unjust or unkind treatment a few moments alone with her precious Bible and her loved Saviour made all right again and she would come from those sweet communings looking as serenely happy as if she had never known an annoyance She was a wonder to all the family Her grandfather would sometimes look at her as without a frown or a pout she would give up her own wishes to Enna and shaking his head say She s no Dinsmore or she would know how to stand up for her own rights better than that I don t like such tame spirited people She s not Horace s child it never was an easy matter to impose upon or conquer him He was a boy of spirit What a strange child Elsie is Adelaide remarked to her friend one day I am often surprised to see how sweetly she gives up to all of us really she has a lovely temper I quite envy her it was always hard for me to give up my own way I do not believe it was easy for her at first said Rose I think her sweet disposition is the fruit of a work of grace in her heart It is the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which God alone can bestow I wish I had it then said Adelaide sighing You have only to go to the right source to obtain it dear Adelaide replied her friend gently And yet said Adelaide I must say I sometimes think that as papa says there is something mean spirited and cowardly in always giving up to other people It would indeed be cowardly and wrong to give up principle replied Rose but surely it is noble and generous to give up our own wishes to another where no principle is involved Certainly you are right said Adelaide musingly And now I recollect that readily as Elsie gives up her own wishes to others on ordinary occasions I have never known her to sacrifice principle but on the contrary she has several times made mamma excessively angry by refusing to romp and play with Enna on the Sabbath or to deceive papa when questioned with regard to some of Arthur s misdeeds yet she has often borne the blame of his faults when she might have escaped by telling of him Elsie is certainly very different from any of the rest of us and if it is piety that makes her what she is I think piety is a very lovely thing Elsie s mornings were spent in the school room in the afternoon she walked or rode out sometimes in company with her young uncles and aunts and sometimes alone a negro boy following at a respectful distance as a protector In the evening there was almost always company in the parlor and she found it pleasanter to sit beside the bright wood fire in her own room with her fond old nurse for a companion than to stay there or with the younger ones in the sitting room or nursery If she had no lesson to learn she usually read aloud to Chloe as she sat knitting by the fire and the Bible was the book generally preferred by both and then when she grew weary of reading she would often take a stool and sitting down close to Chloe put her head in her lap saying Now mammy tell me about mamma And then for the hundredth time or more the old woman would go over the story of the life and death of her dear young missus as she always called her telling of her beauty her goodness and of her sorrows and sufferings during the last year of her short life It was a story which never lost its charm for Elsie a story which the one never wearied of telling nor the other of hearing Elsie would sit listening with her mother s miniature in her hand gazing at it with tearful eyes then press it to her lips murmuring My own mamma poor dear mamma And when Chloe had finished that story she would usually say Now mammy tell me all about papa But upon this subject Chloe had very little information to give She knew him only as a gay handsome young stranger whom she had seen occasionally during a few months and who had stolen all the sunshine from her beloved young mistress life and left her to die alone yet she did not blame him when speaking to his child for the young wife had told her that he had not forsaken her of his own free choice and though she could not quite banish from her own mind the idea that he had not been altogether innocent in the matter she breathed no hint of it to Elsie for Chloe was a sensible woman and knew that to lead the little one to think ill of her only remaining parent would but tend to make her unhappy Sometimes Elsie would ask very earnestly Do you thing papa loves Jesus mammy And Chloe would reply with a doubtful shake of the head Dunno darlin but ole Chloe prays for him ebery day And so do I Elsie would answer dear dear papa how I wish he would come home And so the winter glided away and spring came and Miss Allison must soon return home It was now the last day of March and her departure had been fixed for the second of April For a number of weeks Elsie had been engaged during all her spare moments in knitting a purse for Rose wishing to give her something which was the work of her own hands knowing that as such it would be more prized by her friend than a costlier gift She had just returned from her afternoon ride and taking out her work she sat down to finish it She was in her own room with no companion but Chloe who sat beside her knitting as usual Elsie worked on silently for some time then suddenly holding up her purse she exclaimed See mammy it is all done but putting on the tassel Isn t it pretty and won t dear Miss Allison be pleased with it It really was very pretty indeed of crimson and gold and beautifully knit and Chloe looking at it with admiring eyes said I spec she will darlin I tink it s berry handsome At this moment Enna opened the door and came in Elsie hastily attempted to conceal the purse by thrusting it into her pocket but it was too late for Enna had seen it and running toward her cried out Now Elsie just give that to me No Enna replied Elsie mildly I cannot let you have it because it is for Miss Rose I will have it exclaimed the child resolutely and if you don t give it to me at once I shall just go and tell mamma I will let you take it in your hand a few moments to look at it if you will be careful not to soil it Enna said Elsie in the same gentle tone and if you wish I will get some more silk and beads and make you one just like it but I cannot give you this because I would not have time to make another for Miss Rose No I shall just have that one and I shall have it to keep said Enna attempting to snatch it out of Elsie s hand But Elsie held it up out of her reach and after trying several times in vain to get it Enna left the room crying and screaming with passion Chloe locked the door saying Great pity darlin we forgot to do dat fore Miss Enna came I se fraid she gwine bring missus for make you gib um up Elsie sat down to her work again but she was very pale and her little hands trembled with agitation and her soft eyes were full of tears Chloe s fears were but too well founded for the next moment hasty steps were heard in the passage and the handle of the door was laid hold of with no very gentle grasp and then as it refused to yield to her touch missus Dinsmore s voice was heard in an angry tone giving the command Open this door instantly Chloe looked at her young mistress You will have to said Elsie tearfully slipping her work into her pocket again and lifting up her heart in prayer for patience and meekness for she well knew she would have need of both missus Dinsmore entered leading the sobbing Enna by the hand her face was flushed with passion and addressing Elsie in tones of violent anger she asked What is the meaning of all this you good for nothing hussy Why are you always tormenting this poor child Where is that paltry trifle that all this fuss is about let me see it this instant Elsie drew the purse from her pocket saying in tearful trembling tones It is a purse I was making for Miss Rose ma am and I offered to make another just like it for Enna but I cannot give her this one because there would not be time to make another before Miss Rose goes away You can not give it to her indeed You will not you mean but I say you shall and I ll see if I m not mistress in my own house Give it to the child this instant I ll not have her crying her eyes out that you may be humored in all your whims There are plenty of handsomer ones to be had in the city and if you are too mean to make her a present of it I ll buy you another to morrow But that would not be my work and this is replied Elsie still retaining the purse loath to let it go Nonsense what difference will that make to Miss Rose said missus Dinsmore and snatching it out of her hand she gave it to Enna saying There my pet you shall have it Elsie is a naughty mean stingy girl but she shan t plague you while your mamma s about Enna cast a look of triumph at Elsie and ran off with her prize followed by her mother while poor Elsie hid her face in Chloe s lap and cried bitterly It required all Chloe s religion to keep down her anger and indignation at this unjust and cruel treatment of her darling and for a few moments she allowed her to sob and cry without a word only soothing her with mute caresses not daring to trust her voice lest her anger should find vent in words But at length when her feelings had grown somewhat calmer she said soothingly Nebber mind it my poor darlin chile Just go to de city and buy de prettiest purse you can find for Miss Rose But Elsie shook her head sadly I wanted it to be my own work she sobbed and now there is no time Oh I ll tell you what my pet exclaimed Chloe suddenly dere s de purse you was aknittin for your papa an dey wouldn t send it for you you can get dat done for de lady and knit another for your papa fore he comes home Elsie raised her head with a look of relief but her face clouded again as she replied But it is not quite done and I haven t the beads to finish it with and Miss Rose goes day after to morrow Nebber mind dat darlin said Chloe jumping up Pomp he been gwine to de city dis berry afternoon an we ll tell him to buy de beads an den you can get de purse finished fore to morrow night an de lady don t go till de next day an so it gwine all come right yet Oh yes that will do dear old mammy I m so glad you thought of it said Elsie joyfully And rising she went to her bureau and unlocking a drawer took from it a bead purse of blue and gold quite as handsome as the one of which she had been so ruthlessly despoiled and rolling it up in a piece of paper she handed it to Chloe saying There mammy please give it to Pomp and tell him to match the beads and the silk exactly Chloe hastened in search of Pomp but when she found him he insisted that he should not have time to attend to Miss Elsie s commission and do his other errands and Chloe knowing that he in common with all the other servants was very fond of the little girl felt satisfied that it was not merely an excuse therefore did not urge her request She stood a moment in great perplexity then suddenly exclaimed I ll go myself Miss Elsie will spare me an I ll go right long wid you Pomp Chloe was entirely Elsie s servant having no other business than to wait upon her and take care of her clothing and her room and the little girl of course readily gave her permission to accompany Pomp and do the errand But it was quite late ere Chloe returned and the little girl spent the evening alone in her own room She was sadly disappointed that she could not even have her hour with Miss Rose who was detained in the parlor with company whom she could not leave and so the evening seemed very long and wore away very slowly But at last Chloe came and in answer to her eager inquiries displayed her purchases with great satisfaction saying Yes darlin I se got de berry t ings you wanted Oh yes said Elsie examining them with delight they are just right and now I can finish it in a couple of hours Time to get ready for bed now ain t it pet asked Chloe but before the little girl had time to answer a servant knocked at the door and handed in a note for her It was from Miss Allison and hastily tearing it open she read DEAR ELSIE I am very sorry that we cannot have our reading together this evening but be sure darling to come to me early in the morning it will be our last opportunity for dear child I have another disappointment for you I had not expected to leave before day after to morrow but I have learned this evening that the vessel sails a day sooner than I had supposed and therefore I shall be obliged to start on my journey to morrow Your friend ROSE Elsie dropped the note on the floor and burst into tears What de matter darlin asked Chloe anxiously Oh Miss Rose dear dear Miss Rose is going tomorrow she sobbed Then hastily drying her eyes she said But I have no time for crying I must sit up and finish the purse to night because there will not be time to morrow It was long past her usual hour for retiring when at last her task or rather her labor of love was completed Yet she was up betimes and at the usual hour her gentle rap was heard at Miss Allison s door Rose clasped her in her arms and kissed her tenderly O Miss Rose dear dear Miss Rose what shall I do without you sobbed the little girl I shall have nobody to love me now but mammy You have another and a better friend dear Elsie who has said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee whispered Rose with another tender caress Yes said Elsie wiping away her tears and He is your Friend too and don t you think Miss Rose He will bring us together again some day I hope so indeed darling We must keep very close to Him dear Elsie we must often commune with Him in secret often study His word and try always to do His will Ah dear child if we can only have the assurance that that dear Friend is with us that we have His presence and His love we shall be supremely happy though separated from all earthly friends I know dear little one that you have peculiar trials and that you often feel the want of sympathy and love but you may always find them in Jesus And now we will have our reading and prayer as usual She took the little girl in her lap and opening the Bible read aloud the fourteenth chapter of John a part of that touching farewell of our Saviour to His sorrowing disciples and then they knelt to pray Elsie was only a listener for her little heart was too full to allow her to be anything more My poor darling Rose said again taking her in her arms we will hope to meet again before very long Who knows but your papa may come home and some day bring you to see me It seems not unlikely as he is so fond of traveling Elsie looked up smiling through her tears Oh how delightful that would be she said But it seems as though my papa would never come she added with a deep drawn sigh Well darling we can hope Rose answered cheerfully And dear child though we must be separated in body for a time we can still meet in spirit at the mercy seat Shall we not do so at this hour every morning Elsie gave a joyful assent And I shall write to you darling Rose said I will write on my journey if I can so that you will get the letter in a week from the time I leave and then you must write to me will you If you won t care for the mistakes Miss Rose But you know I am a very little girl and I wouldn t like to let Miss Day read my letter to you to correct it But I shall be so very glad to get yours I never had a letter in my life I sha n t care for mistakes at all dear and no one shall see your letters but myself said Rose kissing her I should be as sorry as you to have Miss Day look at them Elsie drew out the purse and put it in her friend s hand saying It is all my own work dear Miss Rose I thought you would value it more for that And indeed I shall darling replied Rose with tears of pleasure in her eyes It is beautiful in itself but I shall value it ten times more because it is your gift and the work of your own dear little hands But the breakfast bell now summoned them to join the rest of the family and in a few moments after they left the table the carriage which was to take Rose to the city was at the door Rose had endeared herself to all old and young and they were loath to part with her One after another bade her an affectionate farewell Elsie was the last Rose pressed her tenderly to her bosom and kissed her again and again saying in a voice half choked with grief God bless and keep you my poor little darling my dear dear little Elsie Elsie could not speak and the moment the carriage had rolled away with her friend she went to her own room and locking herself in cried long and bitterly She had learned to love Rose very dearly and to lean upon her very much and now the parting from her with no certainty of ever meeting her again in this world was the severest trial the poor child had ever known CHAPTER THIRD The morning blush was lighted up by hope The hope of meeting him Miss LANDON Unkindness do thy office poor heart break A week had now passed away since Miss Allison s departure and Elsie to whom it had been a sad and lonely one was beginning to look eagerly for her first letter It is just a week to day since Rose left remarked Adelaide at the breakfast table and I think we ought to hear from her soon She promised to write on her journey Ah here comes Pomp with the letters now she added as the servant man entered the room bearing in his hand the bag in which he always brought the letters of the family from the office in the neighboring city whither he was sent every morning Pomp you are late this morning said missus Dinsmore Yes missus replied the negro scratching his head de horses am berry lazy spec dey s got de spring fever Do make haste papa and see if there is not one from Rose said Adelaide coaxingly as her father took the bag and very deliberately adjusted his spectacles before opening it Have patience young lady said he Yes here is a letter for you and one for Elsie tossing them across the table as he spoke Elsie eagerly seized hers and ran away to her own room to read it It was a feast to her this first letter and from such a dear friend too It gave her almost as much pleasure for the moment as Miss Rose s presence could have afforded She had just finished its perusal and was beginning it again when she heard Adelaide s voice calling her by name and the next moment she entered the room saying Well Elsie I suppose you have read your letter and now I have another piece of news for you Can you guess what it is she asked looking at her with a strange smile Oh no Aunt Adelaide please tell me Is dear Miss Rose coming back O nonsense what a guess said Adelaide No stranger than that My brother Horace your papa has actually sailed for America and is coming directly home Elsie sprang up her cheeks flushed and her little heart beating wildly O Aunt Adelaide she cried is it really true is he coming and will he be here soon He has really started at last but how soon he will be here I don t know replied her aunt turning to leave the room I have told you all I know about it Elsie clasped her hands together and sank down upon a sofa Miss Rose s letter prized so highly a moment before lying unheeded at her feet for her thoughts were far away following that unknown parent as he crossed the ocean trying to imagine how he would look how he would speak what would be his feelings toward her Oh she asked with a beating heart will he love me My own papa will he let me love him will he take me in his arms and call me his own darling child But who could answer the anxious inquiry She must just wait until the slow wheels of time should bring the much longed for yet sometimes half dreaded arrival Elsie s lessons were but indifferently recited that morning and Miss Day frowned and said in a tone of severity that it did not agree with her to receive letters and that unless she wished her papa to be much displeased with her on his expected arrival she must do a great deal better than that She had touched the right chord then for Elsie intensely anxious to please that unknown father and if possible gain his approbation and affection gave her whole mind to her studies with such a determined purpose that the governess could find no more cause for complaint But while the child is looking forward to the expected meeting with such longing affection for him how is it with the father Horace Dinsmore was like his father an upright moral man who paid an outward respect to the forms of religion but cared nothing for the vital power of godliness trusted entirely to his morality and looked upon Christians as hypocrites and deceivers He had been told that his little Elsie was one of these and though he would not have acknowledged it even to himself it had prejudiced him against her Then too in common with all the Dinsmores he had a great deal of family pride and though old mister Grayson had been a man of sterling worth intelligent honest and pious and had died very wealthy yet because he was known to have begun life as a poor boy the whole family were accustomed to speak as though Horace had stooped very much in marrying his heiress And Horace himself had come to look upon his early marriage as a piece of boyish folly of which he was rather ashamed and so constantly had mister Dinsmore spoken in his letters of Elsie as old Grayson s grandchild that he had got into the habit of looking upon her as a kind of disgrace to him especially as she had always been described to him as a disagreeable troublesome child He had loved his wife with all the warmth of his passionate nature and had mourned bitterly over her untimely death but years of study travel and worldly pleasures had almost banished her image from his mind and he seldom thought of her except in connection with the child for whom he felt a secret dislike Scarcely anything but the expected arrival was now spoken or thought of at Roselands and Elsie was not the only one to whom old Time seemed to move with an unusually laggard pace But at length a letter came telling them that they might look upon it as being but one day in advance of its writer and now all was bustle and preparation O mammy mammy exclaimed Elsie jumping up and down and clapping her hands for joy as she came in from her afternoon ride just think papa dear papa will be here to morrow morning She seemed wild with delight but suddenly sobered down and a look of care stole over the little face as the torturing question recurred to her mind Will he love me She stood quite still with her eyes fixed thoughtfully and almost sadly upon the floor while Chloe took off her riding dress and cap and smoothed her hair As she finished arranging her dress she clasped the little form in her arms and pressed a fond kiss on the fair brow thinking to herself that was the sweetest and loveliest little face she had ever looked upon Just at that moment an unusual bustle was heard in the house Elsie started changed color and stood listening with a throbbing heart Presently little feet were heard running rapidly down the hall and Walter throwing open the door called out Elsie he s come and catching her hand hurried her along to the parlor door Stop stop Walter she gasped as they reached it and she leaned against the wall her heart throbbing so wildly she could scarcely breathe What is the matter said he are you ill come along and pushing the door open he rushed in dragging her after him So over wrought were the child s feelings that she nearly fainted everything in the room seemed to be turning round and for an instant she scarcely knew where she was But a strange voice asked And who is this and looking up as her grandfather pronounced her name she saw a stranger standing before her very handsome and very youthful looking in spite of a heavy dark beard and mustache who exclaimed hastily What this great girl my child really it is enough to make a man feel old Then taking her hand he stooped and coldly kissed her lips She was trembling violently and the very depth of her feelings kept her silent and still her hand lay still in his cold and clammy He held it an instant at the same time gazing searchingly into her face then dropped it saying in a tone of displeasure I am not an ogre that you need be so afraid of me but there you may go I will not keep you in terror any longer She rushed away to her own room and there throwing herself upon the bed wept long and wildly It was the disappointment of a lifelong hope Since her earliest recollection she had looked and longed for this hour and it seemed as though the little heart would break with its weight of bitter anguish She was all alone for Chloe had gone down to the kitchen to talk over the arrival not doubting that her darling was supremely happy in the possession of her long looked for parent And so the little girl lay there with her crushed and bleeding heart sobbing mourning weeping as though she would weep her very life away without an earthly friend to speak one word of comfort O papa papa she sobbed my own papa you do not love me me your own little girl Oh my heart will break O mamma mamma if I could only go to you for there is no one here to love me and I am so lonely oh so lonely and desolate And thus Chloe found her when she came in an hour later weeping and sobbing out such broken exclamations of grief and anguish She was much surprised but comprehending at once how her child was suffering she raised her up in her strong arms and laying the little head lovingly against her bosom she smoothed the tangled hair kissed the tear swollen eyes and bathed the throbbing temples saying My precious pet my darlin chile your ole mammy loves you better dan life an did my darlin forget de almighty Friend dat says I have loved thee with an everlasting love an I will never leave thee nor forsake thee He sticks closer dan a brudder precious chile and says though a woman forget her sucking child He will not forget His chillen Mothers love dere chillens better dan fathers darlin and so you see Jesus love is better dan all other love and I knows you hes got dat O mammy ask Him to take me to Himself and to mamma for oh I am very lonely and I want to die Hush hush darlin old Chloe nebber could ask dat dis ole heart would break for sure Yous all de world to your old mammy darlin and you know we must all wait de Lord s time Then ask Him to help me to be patient she said in a weary tone And O mammy she added with a burst of bitter tears ask Him to make my father love me I will darlin I will sobbed Chloe pressing the little form closer to her heart an don t you go for to be discouraged right away for I se sure Massa Horace must love you fore long The tea bell rang and the family gathered about the table but one chair remained unoccupied Where is Miss Elsie asked Adelaide of one of the servants Dunno missus was the reply Well then go and see said Adelaide perhaps she did not hear the bell The servant returned in a moment saying that Miss Elsie had a bad headache and did not want any supper mister Horace Dinsmore paused in the conversation he was carrying on with his father to listen to the servant s announcement I hope she is not a sickly child said he addressing Adelaide is she subject to such attacks Not very replied his sister dryly for she had seen the meeting and felt really sorry for Elsie s evident disappointment I imagine crying has brought this on He colored violently and said in a tone of great displeasure Truly the return of a parent is a cause for grief yet I hardly expected my presence to be quite so distressing to my only child I had no idea that she had already learned to dislike me so thoroughly She doesn t said Adelaide she has been looking and longing for your return ever since I have known her Then she has certainly been disappointed in me her grief is not at all complimentary explain it as you will Adelaide made no reply for she saw that he was determined to put an unfavorable construction upon Elsie s conduct and feared that any defence she could offer would only increase his displeasure It was a weary aching head the little girl laid upon her pillow that night and the little heart was sad and sore yet she was not altogether comfortless for she had turned in her sorrow to Him who has said Suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not and she had the sweet assurance of His love and favor It was with a trembling heart hoping yet fearing longing and yet dreading to see her father that Elsie descended to the breakfast room the next morning She glanced timidly around but he was not there Where is papa Aunt Adelaide she asked He is not coming down to breakfast as he feels quite fatigued with his journey replied her aunt so you will not see him this morning and perhaps not at all to day for there will be a good deal of company here this afternoon and evening Elsie sighed and looked sadly disappointed She found it very difficult to attend to her lessons that morning and every time the door opened she started and looked up half hoping it might be her papa But he did not come and when the dinner hour arrived the children were told that they were to dine in the nursery on account of the large number of guests to be entertained in the dining room The company remained until bedtime she was not called down to the parlor and so saw nothing of her father that day But the next morning Chloe told her the children were to breakfast with the family as all the visitors had left excepting one or two gentlemen So Elsie went down to the breakfast room where to her surprise she found her papa sitting alone reading the morning paper He looked up as she entered Good morning papa she said in half trembling tones He started a little for it was the first time he had ever been addressed by that title and it sounded strange to his ears gave her a glance of mingled curiosity and interest half held out his hand but drawing it back again simply said Good morning Elsie and returned to his paper Elsie stood irresolutely in the middle of the floor wanting yet not daring to go to him But just at that instant the door opened and Enna looking rosy and happy came running in and rushing up to her brother climbed upon his knee and put her arms around his neck saying Good morning brother Horace I want a kiss You shall have it little pet said he throwing down his paper Then kissing her several times and hugging her in his arms he said You are not afraid of me are you nor sorry that I have come home No indeed said Enna He glanced at Elsie as she stood looking at them her large soft eyes full of tears She could not help feeling that Enna had her place and was receiving the caresses that should have been lavished upon herself Jealous thought her father I cannot bear jealous people and he gave her a look of displeasure that cut her to the heart and she turned quickly away and left the room to hide the tears she could no longer keep back I am envious she thought jealous of Enna Oh how wicked And she prayed silently Dear Saviour help me take away these sinful feelings Young as she was she was learning to have some control over her feelings and in a few moments she had so far recovered her composure as to be able to return to the breakfast room and take her place at the table where the rest were already seated her sweet little face sad indeed and bearing the traces of tears but quite calm and peaceful Her father took no further notice of her and she did not dare trust herself to look at him The servants filled her plate and she ate in silence feeling it a great relief that all were too busily engaged in talking and eating to pay any attention to her She scarcely raised her eyes from her plate and did not know how often a strange gentleman who sat nearly opposite fixed his upon her As she left the room at the conclusion of the meal he asked while following her with his eyes Is that one of your sisters Dinsmore No said he coloring slightly she is my daughter Ah indeed said his friend I remember to have heard that you had a child but had forgotten it Well you have no reason to be ashamed of her she is lovely perfectly lovely has the sweetest little face I ever saw Will you ride Travilla asked mister Dinsmore hastily as though anxious to change the subject I don t care if I do was the reply and they went out together Some hours later in the day Elsie was at the piano in the music room practising when a sudden feeling that some one was in the room caused her to turn and look behind her mister Travilla was standing there Excuse me said he bowing politely but I heard the sound of the instrument and being very fond of music I ventured to walk in Elsie was very modest and rather timid too but also very polite so she said No excuse is necessary but will you not take a seat sir though I fear my music will not afford you any pleasure for you know I am only a little girl and cannot play very well yet Thank you said he taking a seat by her side And now will you do me the favor to repeat the song I heard you singing a few moments since Elsie immediately complied though her cheeks burned and her voice trembled at first from embarrassment but it grew stronger as she proceeded and in the last verse was quite steady and full She had a very fine voice for a child of her age its sweetness was remarkable both in singing and speaking and she had also a good deal of musical talent which had been well cultivated for she had had good teachers and had practised with great patience and perseverance Her music was simple as suited her years but her performance of it was very good indeed mister Travilla thanked her very heartily and complimented her singing then asked for another and another song another and another piece chatting with her about each until they grew quite familiar and Elsie lost all feeling of embarrassment Elsie I think is your name is it not he asked after a little Yes sir said she Elsie Dinsmore And you are the daughter of my friend mister Horace Dinsmore Yes sir Your papa has been absent a long time and I suppose you must have quite forgotten him No sir not forgotten for I never had seen him Indeed said he in a tone of surprise then since he is an entire stranger to you I suppose you cannot have much affection for him Elsie raised her large dark eyes to his face with an expression of astonishment Not love papa my own dear papa who has no child but me Oh sir how could you think that Ah I see I was mistaken said he smiling I thought you could hardly care for him at all but do you think that he loves you Elsie dropped her face into her hands and burst into an agony of tears The young gentleman looked extremely vexed with himself My poor little girl my poor dear little girl he said stroking her hair forgive me I am very very sorry for my thoughtless question Do be comforted my poor child for whether your papa loves you now or not I am quite sure he soon will Elsie now dried her tears rose and closed the instrument He assisted her and then asked if she would not take a little walk with him in the garden She complied and feeling really very sorry for the wound he had so thoughtlessly inflicted as well as interested in his little companion he exerted all his powers to entertain her talked with her about the plants and flowers described those he had seen in foreign lands and related incidents of travel usually choosing those in which her father had borne a part because he perceived that they were doubly interesting to her Elsie having been thrown very much upon her own resources for amusement and having a natural love for books and constant access to her grandfather s well stocked library had read many more and with much more thought than most children of her age so that mister Travilla found her a not uninteresting companion and was often surprised at the intelligence shown by her questions and replies When the dinner bell rang he led her in and seated her by himself and never was any lady more carefully waited upon than little Elsie at this meal Two or three other gentlemen guests were present giving their attention to the older ladies of the company and thus mister Travilla seemed to feel quite at liberty to devote himself entirely to her attending to all her wants talking with her and making her talk Elsie now and then stole a glance at missus Dinsmore fearing her displeasure but to her great relief the lady seemed too much occupied to notice her Once she looked timidly at her father and her eyes met his He was looking at her with an expression half curious half amused She was at a loss to understand the look but satisfied that there was no displeasure in it her heart grew light and her cheeks flushed with happiness Really Dinsmore said mister Travilla as they stood together near one of the windows of the drawing room soon after dinner your little girl is remarkably intelligent as well as remarkably pretty and I have discovered that she has quite a good deal of musical talent Indeed I think it is quite a pity that she does not belong to you Travilla instead of me since you seem to appreciate her so much more highly replied the father laughing I wish she did said his friend But seriously Dinsmore you ought to love that child for she certainly loves you devotedly He looked surprised How do you know he asked It was evident enough from what I saw and heard this morning Dinsmore she would value a caress from you more than the richest jewel Doubtful replied Horace hastily quitting the room for Elsie had come out on to the portico in her riding suit and Jim her usual attendant was bringing up her horse Are you going to ride Elsie asked her father coming up to her Yes papa she said raising her eyes to his face He lifted her in his arms and placed her on the horse saying to the servant as he did so Now Jim you must take good care of my little girl Tears of happiness rose in Elsie s eyes as she turned her horse s head and rode down the avenue He called me his little girl she murmured to herself and bade Jim take good care of me Oh he will love me soon as good kind mister Travilla said he would Her father was still standing on the portico looking after her How well she sits her horse remarked Travilla who had stepped out and stood close by his side Yes I think she does was the reply in an absent tone He was thinking of a time some eight or nine years before when he had assisted another Elsie to mount her horse and had ridden for hours at her side All the afternoon memories of the past came crowding thickly on his mind and an emotion of tenderness began to spring up in his heart toward the child of her who had once been so dear to him and as he saw the little girl ride up to the house on her return he again went out and lifting her from her horse asked kindly Had you a pleasant ride my dear Oh yes papa very pleasant she said looking up at him with a face beaming with delight He stooped and kissed her saying I think I shall ride with you one of these days should you like it Oh so very very much papa she answered eagerly He smiled at her earnestness and she hastened away to her room to change her dress and tell Chloe of her happiness Alas it was but a transient gleam of sunshine that darted across her path to be lost again almost instantly behind the gathering clouds More company came so that the drawing room was quite full in the evening and though Elsie was there her father seemed too much occupied with the guests to give her even a glance She sat alone and unnoticed in a corner her eyes following him wherever he moved and her ear strained to catch every tone of his voice until mister Travilla disengaging himself from a group of ladies and gentlemen on the opposite side of the room came up to her and taking her by the hand led her to a pleasant looking elderly lady who sat at a centre table examining some choice engravings which mister Dinsmore had brought with him from Europe Mother said mister Travilla This is my little friend Elsie Ah said she giving the little girl a kiss I am glad to see you my dear mister Travilla set a chair for her close to his mother and then sat down on her other side and taking up the engravings one after another he explained them to her in a most entertaining manner generally having some anecdote to tell in connection with each Elsie was so much amused and delighted with what he was saying that she at last quite forgot her father and did not notice where he was Suddenly mister Travilla laid down the engraving he had in his hand saying Come Miss Elsie I want my mother to hear you play and sing will you not do me the favor to repeat that song I admired so much this morning Oh mister Travilla exclaimed the little girl blushing and trembling I could not play or sing before so many people Please excuse me Elsie said her father s voice just at her side go immediately and do as the gentleman requests His tone was very stern and as she lifted her eyes to his face she saw that his look was still more so and tremblingly and tearfully she rose to obey Stay said mister Travilla kindly pitying her distress I withdraw my request But I do not withdraw my command said her father in the same stern tone go at once Elsie and do as I bid you She obeyed instantly struggling hard to overcome her emotion mister Travilla scolding himself inwardly all the time for having brought her into such trouble selected her music and placing it before her as she took her seat at the instrument whispered encouragingly Now Miss Elsie only have confidence in yourself that is all that is necessary to your success But Elsie was not only embarrassed but her heart was well nigh broken by her father s sternness and the tears would fill her eyes so that she could see neither notes nor words She attempted to play the prelude but blundered sadly her embarrassment increasing every moment Never mind said mister Travilla never mind the prelude but just begin the song She made the attempt but fairly broke down and burst into tears before she had got through the first verse Her father had come up behind her and was standing there looking much mortified Elsie he said leaning down and speaking in a low stern tone close to her ear I am ashamed of you go to your room and to your bed immediately With a heart almost bursting with grief and mortification she obeyed him and her pillow was wet with many bitter tears ere the weary eyes closed in slumber When she came down the next morning she learned to her great grief that mister Travilla and his mother had returned to their own home she was very sorry she had not been permitted to say good bye to her friend and for several days she felt very sad and lonely for all her father s coldness of manner had returned and he scarcely ever spoke to her while the younger members of the family ridiculed her for her failure in attempting to play for company and Miss Day who seemed unusually cross and exacting often taunted her with it also These were sad dark days for the little girl she tried most earnestly to attend to all her duties but so depressed were her spirits so troubled was her mind that she failed repeatedly in her lessons and so was in continual disgrace with Miss Day who threatened more than once to tell her papa It was a threat which Elsie dreaded extremely to have put in execution and Miss Day seeing that it distressed her used it the more frequently and thus kept the poor child in constant terror How to gain her father s love was the constant subject of her thoughts and she tried in many ways to win his affection She always yielded a ready and cheerful obedience to his commands and strove to anticipate and fulfil all his wishes But he seldom noticed her unless to give a command or administer a rebuke while he lavished many a caress upon his little sister Enna Often Elsie would watch him fondling her until unable any longer to control her feelings she would rush away to her own room to weep and mourn in secret and pray that her father might some day learn to love her She never complained even to poor old Aunt Chloe but the anxious nurse watched all these things with the jealous eye of affection she saw that her child as she delighted to call her was very unhappy and was growing pale and melancholy and her heart ached for her and many were the tears she shed in secret over the sorrows of her nursling Don t pear so sorrowful darlin she sometimes said to her try to be merry like Miss Enna and run and jump on Massa Horace s knee and den I tink he will like you better O mammy I can t Elsie would say I don t dare to do it And Chloe would sigh and shake her head sorrowfully CHAPTER FOURTH With more capacity for love than earth Bestows on most of mortal mould and birth BYRON What are our hopes Like garlands on afflictions s forehead worn Kissed in the morning and at evening torn DAVENPORT S King John and Matilda Such had been the state of affairs for about a week when one morning Elsie and her father met at the breakfast room door Good morning papa she said timidly Good morning Elsie he replied in an unusually pleasant tone Then taking her by the hand he led her in and seated her beside himself at the table Elsie s cheek glowed and her eyes sparkled with pleasure There were several guests present and she waited patiently while they and the older members of the family were being helped At length it was her turn Elsie will you have some meat asked her grandfather No said her father answering for her once a day is as often as a child of her age ought to eat meat she may have it at dinner but never for breakfast or tea The elder mister Dinsmore laughed saying Really Horace I had no idea you were so notionate I always allowed you to eat whatever you pleased and I never saw that it hurt you But of course you must manage your own child in your own way If you please papa I had rather have some of those hot cakes said Elsie timidly as her father laid a slice of bread upon her plate No said he decidedly I don t approve of hot bread for children you must eat the cold Then to a servant who was setting down a cup of coffee beside the little girl s plate Take that away Pomp and bring Miss Elsie a tumbler of milk Or would you prefer water Elsie Milk if you please papa she replied with a little sigh for she was extremely fond of coffee and it was something of a trial to give it up Her father put a spoonful of stewed fruit upon her plate and as Pompey set down a tumbler of rich milk beside it said Now you have your breakfast before you Elsie Children in England are not allowed to eat butter until they are ten or eleven years of age and I think it an excellent plan to make them grow up rosy and healthy I have neglected my little girl too long but I intend to begin to take good care of her now he added with a smile and laying his hand for an instant upon her head The slight caress and the few kind words were quite enough to reconcile Elsie to the rather meagre fare and she ate it with a happy heart But the meagre fare became a constant thing while the caresses and kind words were not and though she submitted without a murmur she could not help sometimes looking with longing eyes at the coffee and hot buttered rolls of which she was very fond But she tried to be contented saying to herself Papa knows best and I ought to be satisfied with whatever he gives me Isn t it delightful to have your papa at home Elsie mister Dinsmore one morning overheard Arthur saying to his little girl in a mocking tone It s very pleasant to live on bread and water isn t it eh I don t live on bread and water Elsie replied a little indignantly Papa always allows me to have as much good rich milk and cream and fruit as I want or I can have eggs or cheese or honey or anything else except meat and hot cakes and butter and coffee and who wouldn t rather do without such things all their lives than not have a papa to love them And besides you know Arthur that I can have all the meat I want at dinner Pooh that s nothing and I wouldn t give much for all the love you get from him said Arthur scornfully There was something like a sob from Elsie and as her father rose and went to the window he just caught a glimpse of her white dress disappearing down the garden walk What do you mean sir by teasing Elsie in that manner he exclaimed angrily to Arthur who still stood where the little girl had left him leaning against one of the pillars of the portico I only wanted to have a little fun returned the boy doggedly Well sir I don t approve of such fun and you will please to let the child alone in future replied his brother as he returned to his newspaper again But somehow the paper had lost its interest He seemed constantly to hear that little sob and to see a little face all wet with tears of wounded feeling Just then the school bell rang and suddenly throwing down his paper he took a card from his pocket wrote a few words upon it and calling a servant said Take this to Miss Day Elsie was seated at her desk beginning her morning s work when the servant entered and handed the card to the governess Miss Day glanced at it and said Elsie your father wants you You may go Elsie rose in some trepidation and left the room wondering what her papa could want with her Where is papa Fanny she asked of the servant In de drawin room Miss Elsie was the reply and she hastened to seek him there He held out his hand as she entered saying with a smile Come here daughter It was the first time he had called her that and it sent a thrill of joy to her heart She sprang to his side and taking her hand in one of his and laying the other gently on her head and bending it back a little he looked keenly into her face It was bright enough now yet the traces of tears were very evident You have been crying he said in a slightly reproving tone I am afraid you do a great deal more of that than is good for you It is a very babyish habit and you must try to break yourself of it The little face flushed painfully and the eyes filled again There he said stroking her hair don t begin it again I am going to drive over to Ion where your friend mister Travilla lives to spend the day would my little daughter like to go with me Oh so very much papa she answered eagerly There are no little folks there he said smiling nobody to see but mister Travilla and his mother But I see you want to go so run and ask Aunt Chloe to get you ready Tell her I want you nicely dressed and the carriage will be at the door in half an hour Elsie bounded away to do his bidding her face radiant with happiness and at the specified time came down again looking so very lovely that her father gazed at her with proud delight and could not refrain from giving her a kiss as he lifted her up to place her in the carriage Then seating himself beside her he took her hand in his and closing the door with the other bade the coachman drive on I suppose you have never been to Ion Elsie he said inquiringly No sir but I have heard Aunt Adelaide say she thought it a very pretty place replied the little girl So it is almost as pretty as Roselands said her father Travilla and I have known each other from boyhood and I spent many a happy day at Ion and we had many a boyish frolic together before I ever thought of you He smiled and patted her cheek as he spoke Elsie s eyes sparkled O papa she said eagerly won t you tell me about those times It seems so strange that you were ever a little boy and I was nowhere He laughed Then said musingly It seems but a very little while to me Elsie since I was no older than you are now He heaved a sigh and relapsed into silence Elsie wished very much that he would grant her request but did not dare to disturb him by speaking a word and they rode on quietly for some time until a squirrel darting up a tree caught her eye and she uttered an exclamation O papa did you see that squirrel look at him now perched up on that branch There we have passed the tree and now he is out of sight This reminded mister Dinsmore of a day he had spent in those woods hunting squirrels when quite a boy and he gave Elsie an animated account of it One of the incidents of the day had been the accidental discharge of the fowling piece of one of his young companions close at Horace Dinsmore s side missing him by but a hair s breadth I felt faint and sick when I knew how near I had been to death he said as he finished his narrative Elsie had been listening with breathless interest Dear papa she murmured laying her little cheek against his hand how good God was to spare your life If you had been killed I could never have had you for my papa Perhaps you might have had a much better one Elsie he said gravely Oh no papa I wouldn t want any other she replied earnestly pressing his hand to her lips Ah here we are exclaimed her father as at that instant the carriage turned into a broad avenue up which they drove quite rapidly and the next moment they had stopped the coachman had thrown open the carriage door and mister Dinsmore springing out lifted his little girl in his arms and set her down on the steps of the veranda Ah Dinsmore how do you do Glad to see you and my little friend Elsie too Why this is really kind cried mister Travilla in his cheerful hearty way as hurrying out to welcome them he shook mister Dinsmore cordially by the hand and kissed Elsie s cheek Walk in walk in he continued leading the way into the house my mother will be delighted to see you both Miss Elsie especially for she seems to have taken a very great fancy to her If missus Travilla s greeting was less boisterous it certainly was not lacking in cordiality and she made Elsie feel at home at once taking off her bonnet smoothing her hair and kissing her affectionately The gentlemen soon went out together and Elsie spent the morning in missus Travilla s room chatting with her and assisting her with some coarse garments she was making for her servants missus Travilla was an earnest Christian and the lady and the little girl were not long in discovering the tie which existed between them missus Travilla being also a woman of great discernment and having known Horace Dinsmore nearly all his life had conceived a very correct idea of the trials and difficulties of Elsie s situation and without alluding to them at all gave her some most excellent advice which the little girl received very thankfully They were still chatting together when mister Travilla came in saying Come Elsie I want to take you out to see my garden hot house et cetera We will just have time before dinner Will you go along mother No I have some little matters to attend to before dinner and will leave you to do the honors replied the lady and taking the little girl s hand he led her out Where is papa asked Elsie Oh he s in the library looking over some new books replied mister Travilla He always cared more for books than anything else But what do you think of my flowers Oh they are lovely What a variety you have what a splendid cape jessamine that is and there is a variety of cactus I never saw before Oh you have a great many more and handsomer I think than we have at Roselands exclaimed Elsie as she passed admiringly from one to another mister Travilla was much pleased with the admiration she expressed for he was very fond of his flowers and took great pride in showing them But they were soon called in to dinner where Elsie was seated by her father I hope this little girl has not given you any trouble missus Travilla said he looking gravely at her Oh no the lady hastened to say I have enjoyed her company very much indeed and hope you will bring her to see me again very soon After dinner as the day was very warm they adjourned to the veranda which was the coolest place to be found it being on the shady side of the house and also protected by thick trees underneath which a beautiful fountain was playing But the conversation was upon some subject which did not interest Elsie and she presently stole away to the library and seating herself in a corner of the sofa was soon lost to everything around her in the intense interest with which she was reading a book she had taken from the table Ah that is what you are about Miss Elsie a bookworm just like your father I see I had been wondering what had become of you for the last two hours exclaimed mister Travilla s pleasant voice and sitting down beside her he took the book from her hand and putting it behind him said Put it away now you will have time enough to finish it and I want you to talk to me Oh please let me have it she pleaded I shall not have much time for papa will soon be calling me to go home No no he is not to take you away I have made a bargain with him to let me keep you said mister Travilla very gravely We both think that there are children enough at Roselands without you and so your papa has given you to me and you are to be my little girl and call me papa in future Elsie gazed earnestly in his face for an instant saying in a half frightened tone You are only joking mister Travilla Not a bit of it said he can t you see that I m in earnest His tone and look were both so serious that for an instant Elsie believed he meant all that he was saying and springing to her feet with a little cry of alarm she hastily withdrew her hand which he had taken and rushing out to the veranda where her father still sat conversing with missus Travilla she flung herself into his arms and clinging to him hid her face on his breast sobbing O papa dear papa don t give me away please don t I will be so good I will do everything you bid me I Why Elsie what does all this mean exclaimed mister Dinsmore in great surprise and perplexity while mister Travilla stood in the doorway looking half amused half sorry for what he had done O papa sobbed the little girl still clinging to him as though fearing she should be torn from his arms mister Travilla says you have given me to him O papa don t give me away Pooh nonsense Elsie I am ashamed of you how can you be so very silly as to believe for one moment anything so perfectly absurd as that I should think of giving you away Why I would as soon think of parting with my eyes Elsie raised her head and gazed searchingly into his face then with a deep drawn sigh of relief dropped it again saying Oh I am so glad Really Miss Elsie said Travilla coming up and patting her on the shoulder I can t say that I feel much complimented and indeed I don t see why you need have been so very much distressed at the prospect before you for I must say I have vanity enough to imagine that I should make the better or at least the more indulgent father of the two Come now wouldn t you be willing to try me for a month if your papa will give consent Elsie shook her head I will let you have your own way in everything urged Travilla coaxingly and I know that is more than he does I don t want my own way mister Travilla I know it wouldn t always be a good way replied Elsie decidedly Her father laughed and passed his hand caressingly over her curls I thought you liked me little Elsie said Travilla in a tone of disappointment So I do mister Travilla I like you very much she replied Well don t you think I would make a good father I am sure you would be very kind and that I should love you very much but not so much as I love my own papa because you know you are not my papa and never can be even if he should give me to you mister Dinsmore laughed heartily saying I think you may as well give it up Travilla it seems I ll have to keep her whether or no for she clings to me like a leech Well Elsie you will at least come to the piano and play a little for me will you not asked Travilla smiling But Elsie still clung to her father seeming loath to leave him until he said in his grave decided way Go Elsie go at once and do as you are requested Then she rose instantly to obey Travilla looked somewhat vexed I wish he afterward remarked to his mother that Dinsmore was not quite so ready to second my requests with his commands I want Elsie s compliance to be voluntary else I think it worth very little Elsie played and sang until they were called to tea after which she sat quietly by her father s side listening to the conversation of her elders until the carriage was announced Well my daughter said mister Dinsmore when they were fairly upon their way to Roselands have you had a pleasant day Oh very pleasant papa excepting She paused looking a little embarrassed Well excepting what he asked smiling down at her Excepting when mister Travilla frightened me so papa she replied moving closer to his side blushing and casting down her eyes And you do love your own papa best and don t want to exchange him for another he said inquiringly as he passed his arm affectionately around her waist Oh no dear papa not for anybody else in all the world she said earnestly He made no reply in words but looking highly gratified bent down and kissed her cheek He did not speak again during their ride but when the carriage stopped he lifted her out and setting her gently down bade her a kind good night saying it was time for mammy to put her to bed She ran lightly up stairs and springing into her nurse s arms exclaimed O mammy mammy what a pleasant pleasant day I have had Papa has been so kind and so were mister Travilla and his mother I se berry glad darlin an I hope you gwine hab many more such days replied Chloe embracing her fondly and then proceeding to take off her bonnet and prepare her for bed while Elsie gave her a minute account of all the occurrences of the day not omitting the fright mister Travilla had given her and how happily her fears had been relieved You look berry happy my darlin pet said Chloe clasping her nursling again in her arms when her task was finished Yes mammy I am happy oh so happy because I do believe that papa is beginning to love me a little and I hope that perhaps after a while he will love me very much The tears gathered in her eyes as she spoke The next afternoon as Elsie was returning from her walk she met her father Elsie said he in a reproving tone I have forbidden you to walk out alone are you disobeying me No papa she replied meekly raising her eyes to his face I was not alone until about five minutes ago when Aunt Adelaide and Louise left me They said it did not matter as I was so near home and they were going to make a call and did not want me along Very well he said taking hold of her hand and making her walk by his side How far have you been We went down the river bank to the big spring papa I believe it is a little more than a mile that way but when we came home we made it shorter by coming across some of the fields and through the meadow Through the meadow said mister Dinsmore don t you go there again Elsie unless I give you express permission Why papa she asked looking up at him in some surprise Because I forbid it he replied sternly that is quite enough for you to know all you have to do is to obey and you need never ask me why when I give you an order Elsie s eyes filled and a big tear rolled quickly down her cheek I did not mean to be naughty papa she said struggling to keep down a sob and I will try never to ask why again There is another thing said he You cry quite too easily it is entirely too babyish for a girl of your age you must quit it I will try papa said the little girl wiping her eyes and making a great effort to control her feelings They had entered the avenue while this conversation was going on and were now drawing near the house and just at this moment a little girl about Elsie s age came running to meet them exclaiming O Elsie I m glad you ve come at last We ve been here a whole hour mamma and Herbert and I and I ve been looking for you all this time How do you do Miss Lucy Carrington I see you can talk as fast as ever said mister Dinsmore laughing and holding out his hand Lucy took it saying with a little pout To be sure mister Dinsmore it isn t more than two or three weeks since you were at our house and I wouldn t forget how to talk in that time Then looking at Elsie she went on We ve come to stay a week won t we have a fine time and catching her friend round the waist she gave her a hearty squeeze I hope so said Elsie returning the embrace I am glad you have come Is your papa here Miss Lucy asked mister Dinsmore Yes sir but he s going home again to night and then he ll come back for us next week I must go in and speak to him said mister Dinsmore Elsie do you entertain Lucy Yes sir I will said Elsie Come with me to my room won t you Lucy Yes but won t you speak to mamma first and Herbert too you are such a favorite with both of them and they still are in the dressing room for mamma is not very well and was quite fatigued with her ride Lucy led the way to her mamma s room as she spoke Elsie following Ah Elsie dear how do you do I m delighted to see you said missus Carrington rising from the sofa as they entered Then drawing the little girl closer to her she passed her arm affectionately around her waist and kissed her several times I suppose you are very happy now that your papa has come home at last she said looking searchingly into Elsie s face I remember you used to be looking forward so to his return constantly talking of it and longing for it Poor Elsie conscious that her father s presence had not brought with it the happiness she had anticipated and yet unwilling either to acknowledge that fact or tell an untruth was at a loss what to say But she was relieved from the necessity of replying by Herbert Lucy s twin brother a pale sickly looking boy who had for several years been a sufferer from hip complaint O Elsie he exclaimed catching hold of her hand and squeezing it between both of his I m ever so glad to see you again Yes said missus Carrington Herbert always says nobody can tell him such beautiful stories as Elsie and nobody but his mother and his old mammy was half so kind to run and wait on him when he was laid on his back for so many weeks He missed you very much when we went home and often wished he was at Roselands again How is your hip now Herbert asked Elsie looking pityingly at the boy s pale face Oh a great deal better thank you I can take quite long walks sometimes now though I still limp and cannot run and leap like other boys They chatted a few moments longer and then Elsie went to her room to have her hat taken off and her hair made smooth before the tea bell should ring The two little girls were seated together at the table Elsie s papa being on her other side How nice these muffins are Don t you like them Elsie asked Lucy as she helped herself to a third or fourth Yes very much said Elsie cheerfully Then what are you eating that cold bread for and you haven t got any butter either Pompey why don t hand Miss Elsie the butter No Lucy I mustn t have it Papa does not allow me to eat hot cakes or butter said Elsie in the same cheerful tone in which she had spoken before Lucy opened her eyes very wide and drew in her breath Well she exclaimed I guess if my papa should try that on me I d make such a fuss he d have to let me eat just whatever I wanted Elsie knows better than to do that said mister Dinsmore who had overheard the conversation she would only get sent away from the table and punished for her naughtiness I wouldn t do it anyhow papa said Elsie raising her eyes beseechingly to his face No daughter I don t believe you would he replied in an unusually kind tone and Elsie s face flushed with pleasure Several days passed away very pleasantly Lucy sharing Elsie s studies in the mornings while Herbert remained with his mamma and then in the afternoon all walking or riding out together unless the weather was too warm when they spent the afternoon playing in the veranda on the shady side of the house and took their ride or walk after the sun was down Arthur and Walter paid but little attention to Herbert as his lameness prevented him from sharing in the active sports which they preferred for they had never been taught to yield their wishes to others and were consequently extremely selfish and overbearing but Elsie was very kind and did all in her power to interest and amuse him One afternoon they all walked out together attended by Jim but Arthur and Walter unwilling to accommodate their pace to Herbert s slow movements were soon far in advance Jim following close at their heels They re quite out of sight said Herbert presently and I m very tired Let s sit down on this bank girls I want to try my new bow and you may run and pick up my arrows for me Thank you sir said Lucy laughing Elsie may do it if she likes but as for me I mean to take a nap this nice soft grass will make an elegant couch and throwing herself down she soon was or pretended to be in a sound slumber while Herbert seating himself with his back against a tree amused himself with shooting his arrows here and there Elsie running for them and bringing them to him until she was quite heated and out of breath Now I must rest a little Herbert she said at length sitting down beside him Shall I tell you a story Oh yes do I like your stories and I don t mind leaving off shooting till you re done said he laying down his bow Elsie s story lasted about ten minutes and when she had finished Herbert took up his bow again saying I guess you re rested now Elsie and sent an arrow over into the meadow There just see how far I sent that do run and bring it to me Elsie he cried and let me see if I can t hit that tree next time I ve but just missed it I m tired Herbert but I ll run and bring it to you this once replied Elsie forgetting entirely her father s prohibition but then you must try to wait until Jim comes back before you shoot any more So saying she darted away and came back in a moment with the arrow in her hand But a sudden recollection had come over her just as she left the meadow and throwing down the arrow at the boy s feet she exclaimed in an agitated tone O Herbert I must go home just as quickly as I can I had forgotten oh how could I forget oh what will papa say Why what s the matter asked Herbert in alarm Never mind said Elsie sobbing There are the boys coming they will take care of you and I must go home Good bye And she ran quickly up the road Herbert following her retreating form with wondering eyes Elsie sped onward crying bitterly as she went Where is papa she inquired of a servant whom she met in the avenue Dunno Miss Elsie but I reckon Massa Horace am in de house kase his horse am in de stable Elsie hardly waited for the answer but hurrying into the house went from room to room looking and asking in vain for her father He was not in the drawing room or the library or his own apartments She had just come out of this and meeting a chamber maid in the hall she exclaimed O Fanny where is papa can t you tell me for I must see him Here I am Elsie what do you want with me called out her father s voice from the veranda where she had neglected to look What do you want he repeated as his little girl appeared before him with her flushed and tearful face Elsie moved slowly toward him with a timid air and downcast eyes I wanted to tell you something papa she said in a low tremulous tone Well I am listening said he taking hold of her hand and drawing her to his side What is it are you sick or hurt No papa not either but but O papa I have been a very naughty girl she exclaimed bursting into tears and sobbing violently I disobeyed you papa I I have been in the meadow Is it possible Would you dare to do so when I so positively forbade it only the other day he said in his sternest tone while a dark frown gathered on his brow Elsie I shall have to punish you I did not intend to disobey you papa she sobbed I quite forgot that you had forbidden me to go there That is no excuse no excuse at all said he severely You must remember my commands and if your memory is so poor I shall find means to strengthen it He paused a moment still looking sternly at the little trembling sobbing girl at his side then asked What were you doing in the meadow tell me the whole story that I may understand just how severely I ought to punish you Elsie gave him all the particulars and when upon questioning her closely he perceived how entirely voluntary her confession had been his tone and manner became less stern and he said quite mildly Well Elsie I shall not be very severe with you this time as you seem to be very penitent and have made so full and frank a confession but beware how you disobey me again for you will not escape so easily another time and remember I will not take forgetfulness as any excuse Go now to Aunt Chloe and tell her from me that she is to put you immediately to bed It is only the middle of the afternoon papa said Elsie deprecatingly If it were much earlier Elsie it would make no difference you must go at once to your bed and stay there until to morrow morning What will Lucy and Herbert think when they come in and can t find me papa she said weeping afresh You should have thought of that before you disobeyed me he answered very gravely If you are hungry he added you may ask Chloe to get you a slice of bread or a cracker for your supper but you can have nothing else Elsie lingered looking timidly up into his face as though wanting to say something but afraid to venture Speak Elsie if you have anything more to say he said encouragingly Dear papa I am so sorry I have been so naughty she murmured leaning her head against the arm of his chair while the tears rolled fast down her cheeks won t you please forgive me papa it seems to me I can t go to sleep to night if you are angry with me He seemed quite touched by her penitence Yes Elsie he said I do forgive you I am not at all angry with you now and you may go to sleep in peace Good night my little daughter and he bent down and pressed his lips to her brow Elsie held up her face for another and he kissed her lips Good night dear papa she said I hope I shall never be such a naughty girl again And she went to her room made almost happy by that kiss of forgiveness Elsie was up quite early the next morning and had learned all her lessons before breakfast As she came down the stairs she saw through the open door her papa standing with some of the men servants apparently gazing at some object lying on the ground She ran out and stood on the steps of the portico looking at them and wondering what they were doing Presently her father turned round and seeing her held out his hand calling Come here Elsie She sprang quickly down the steps and running to him put her hand in his saying Good morning papa Good morning daughter said he I have something to show you And leading her forward a few paces he pointed to a large rattlesnake lying there O papa she cried starting back and clinging to him It will not hurt you now he said it is dead the men killed it this morning in the meadow Do you see now why I forbade you to go there O papa she murmured in a low tone of deep feeling laying her cheek affectionately against his hand I might have lost my life by my disobedience How good God was to take care of me Oh I hope I shall never be so naughty again I hope not said he gravely but not unkindly and I hope that you will always after this believe that your father has some good reason for his commands even although he may not choose to explain it to you Yes papa I think I will she answered humbly The breakfast bell had rung and he now led her in and seated her at the table Lucy Carrington looked curiously at her and soon took an opportunity to whisper Where were you last night Elsie I couldn t find you and your papa wouldn t say what had become of you though I am quite sure he knew I ll tell you after breakfast replied Elsie blushing deeply Lucy waited rather impatiently until all had risen from the table and then putting her arm round Elsie s waist she drew her out on to the veranda saying now Elsie tell me you know you promised I was in bed replied Elsie dropping her eyes while the color mounted to her very hair In bed before five o clock exclaimed Lucy in a tone of astonishment Why what was that for Papa sent me replied Elsie with an effort I had been naughty and disobeyed him Why how strange Do tell me what you had done exclaimed Lucy with a face full of curiosity Papa had forbidden me to go into the meadow I forgot all about it and ran in there to get Herbert s arrow for him replied Elsie looking very much ashamed Was that all why my papa wouldn t have punished me for that said Lucy He might have scolded me a little if I had done it on purpose but if I had told him I had forgotten he would only have said You must remember better next time Papa says that forgetfulness is no excuse that I am to remember his commands and if I forget he will have to punish me to make me remember better next time said Elsie He must be very strict indeed I m glad he is not my papa replied Lucy in a tone of great satisfaction Come little girls make haste and get ready we are to start in half an hour said Adelaide Dinsmore calling to them from the hall door The whole family old and young including visitors were on that day to go on a picnic up the river taking their dinner along and spending the day in the woods They had been planning this excursion for several days and the children especially had been looking forward to it with a great deal of pleasure Am I to go Aunt Adelaide did papa say so asked Elsie anxiously as she and Lucy hastened to obey the summons I presume you are to go of course Elsie we have been discussing the matter for the last three days always taking it for granted that you were to make one of the party and he has never said you should not replied Adelaide good naturedly so make haste or you will be too late But here comes your papa now she added as the library door opened and mister Dinsmore stepped out into the hall where they were standing Horace Elsie is to go of course I do not see the of course Adelaide said he dryly No Elsie is not to go she must stay at home and attend to her lessons as usual A look of keen disappointment came over Elsie s face but she turned away without a word and went upstairs while Lucy casting a look of wrathful indignation at mister Dinsmore ran after her and following her into her room she put her arm round her neck saying Never mind Elsie it s too bad and I wouldn t bear it I d go in spite of him No no Lucy I must obey my father God says so and besides I couldn t do that if I wanted to for papa is stronger than I am and would punish me severely if I were to attempt such a thing replied Elsie hastily brushing away a tear that would come into her eye Then I d coax him said Lucy Come I ll go with you and we will both try No replied Elsie with a hopeless shake of the head I have found out already that my papa never breaks his word and nothing could induce him to let me go now that he has once said I should not But you will have to leave me Lucy or you will be too late Good bye then said Lucy turning to go but I think it is a great shame and I shan t half enjoy myself without you Well now Horace I think you might let the child go was Adelaide s somewhat indignant rejoinder to her brother as the two little girls disappeared I can t conceive what reason you can have for keeping her at home and she looks so terribly disappointed Indeed Horace I am sometimes half inclined to think you take pleasure in thwarting that child You had better call me a tyrant at once Adelaide said he angrily and turning very red but I must beg to be permitted to manage my own child in my own way and I cannot see that I am under any obligation to give my reasons either to you or to any one else Well if you did not intend to let her go I think you might have said so at first and not left the poor child to build her hopes upon it only to be disappointed I must say I think it was cruel Until this morning Adelaide he replied I did intend to let her go for I expected to go myself but I find I shall not be able to do so as I must meet a gentleman on business and as I know that accidents frequently occur to such pleasure parties I don t feel willing to let Elsie go unless I could be there myself to take care of her Whether you believe it or not it is really regard for my child s safety and not cruelty that leads me to refuse her this gratification You are full of notions about that child Horace said Adelaide a little impatiently I m sure some of the rest of us could take care of her No in case of accident you would all have enough to do to take care of yourselves and I shall not think of trusting Elsie in the company since I cannot be there myself he answered decidedly and Adelaide seeing he was not to be moved from his determination gave up the attempt and left the room to prepare for her ride It was a great disappointment to Elsie and for a few moments her heart rose up in rebellion against her father She tried to put away the feeling but it would come back for she could not imagine any reason for his refusal to let her go excepting the disobedience of the day before and it seemed hard and unjust to punish her twice for the same fault especially as he would have known nothing about it but for her own frank and voluntary confession It was a great pity she had not heard the reasons he gave her Aunt Adelaide for then she would have been quite submissive and content It is indeed true that she ought to have been as it was but our little Elsie though sincerely desirous to do right was not yet perfect and had already strangely forgotten the lesson of the morning She watched from the veranda the departure of the pleasure seekers all apparently in the gayest spirits She was surprised to see that her father was not with them and it half reconciled her to staying at home although she hardly expected to see much of him but there was something pleasant in the thought that he wanted her at home because he was to be there himself it looked as though he really had some affection for her and even a selfish love was better than none I do not mean that these were Elsie s thoughts no she never would have dreamed of calling her father selfish but the undefined feeling was there as she watched him hand the ladies into the carriage and then turn and reenter the house as they drove off But Miss Day s bell rang and Elsie gathered up her books and hastened to the school room Her patience and endurance were sorely tried that morning for Miss Day was in an exceedingly bad humor being greatly mortified and also highly indignant that she had not been invited to make one of the picnic party and Elsie had never found her more unreasonable and difficult to please and her incessant fault finding and scolding were almost more than the little girl could bear in addition to her own sad disappointment But at last the morning which had seldom seemed so long was over and Elsie dismissed from the school room for the day At dinner instead of the usual large party there were only her father and the gentleman with whom he was transacting business Miss Day and herself The gentleman was not one of those who care to notice children but continued to discuss business and politics with mister Dinsmore without seeming to be in the least aware of the presence of the little girl who sat in perfect silence eating whatever her father saw fit to put upon her plate and Elsie was very glad indeed when at length Miss Day rose to leave the table and her papa told her she might go too He called her back though before she had gone across the room to say that he had intended to ride with her that afternoon but found he should not be able to do so and she must take Jim for a protector as he did not wish her either to miss her ride or to go entirely alone He spoke very kindly Elsie thought with remorse of the rebellious feelings of the morning and had she been alone with her father would certainly have confessed them expressing her sorrow and asking forgiveness but she could not do so before a third person more especially a stranger and merely saying Yes papa I will she turned away and left the room Jim was bringing up her horse as she passed the open door and she hastened up stairs to prepare for her ride O mammy she suddenly exclaimed as Chloe was trying on her hat is Pomp going to the city to day Yes darlin he gwine start directly said Chloe arranging her nursling s curls to better advantage and finishing her work with a fond caress Oh then mammy take some money out of my purse and tell him to buy me a pound of the very nicest candy he can find said the little girl eagerly I haven t had any for a long time and I feel hungry for it to day What they had bought for the picnic looked so good but you know I didn t get any of it The picnic party returned just before tea time and Lucy Carrington rushed into Elsie s room eager to tell her what a delightful day they had had She gave a very glowing account of their sports and entertainment interrupting herself every now and then to lament over Elsie s absence assuring her again and again that it had been the only drawback upon her own pleasure and that she thought that Elsie s papa was very unkind indeed to refuse her permission to go As Elsie listened the morning s feelings of vexation and disappointment returned in full force and though she said nothing she allowed her friend to accuse her father of cruelty and injustice without offering any remonstrance In the midst of their talk the tea bell rang and they hurried down to take their places at the table where Lucy went on with her narrative though in a rather subdued tone Elsie now and then asking a question until mister Dinsmore turned to his daughter saying in his stern way Be quiet Elsie you are talking entirely too much for a child of your age don t let me hear you speak again until you have left the table Elsie s face flushed and her eyes fell under the rebuke and during the rest of the meal not a sound escaped her lips Come Elsie let us go into the garden and finish our talk said Lucy putting her arm affectionately around her friend s waist as they left the table your papa can t hear us there and we ll have a good time Papa only stopped us because we were talking too much at the table said Elsie apologetically I m sure he is willing you should tell me all about what a nice time you all had But Lucy she added lowering her voice please don t say again that you think papa was unkind to keep me at home to day I m sure he knows best and I ought not to have listened to a word of that kind about him O well never mind I won t talk so any more said Lucy good naturedly as they skipped down the walk together but I do think he s cross and I wish you were my sister that you might have my kind good papa for yours too she added drawing her arm more closely about her friend s waist Thank you Lucy said Elsie with a little sigh I would like to be your sister but indeed I would not like to give up my own dear papa for I love him oh so much Why how funny when he s so cross to you exclaimed Lucy laughing Elsie put her hand over her friend s mouth and Lucy pushed it away saying Excuse me I forgot but I ll try not to say it again While the little girls were enjoying their talk in the garden a servant with a small bundle in her hand came out on the veranda where mister Horace Dinsmore was sitting smoking a cigar and casting an inquiring glance around asked if he knew where Miss Elsie was What do you want with her he asked Only to give her dis bundle massa dat Pomp jus brought from de city Give it to me he said extending his hand to receive it A few moments afterward Elsie and her friend returned to the house and meeting Pomp she asked him if he had brought her candy He replied that he had got some that was very nice indeed and he thought that Fanny had carried it to her and seeing Fanny near he called to her to know what she had done with it Why Pomp Massa Horace he told me to give it to him said the girl Elsie turned away with a very disappointed look You ll go and ask him for it won t you asked Lucy who was anxious to enjoy a share of the candy as well as to see Elsie gratified No said Elsie sighing I had rather do without it Lucy coaxed for a little while but finding it impossible to persuade Elsie to approach her father on the subject finally volunteered to do the errand herself Elsie readily consented and Lucy trembling a little in spite of her boast that she was not afraid of him walked out on to the veranda where mister Dinsmore was still sitting and putting on an air of great confidence said mister Dinsmore will you please to give me Elsie s candy she wants it Did Elsie send you he asked in a cold grave tone Yes sir replied Lucy somewhat frightened Then if you please Miss Lucy you may tell Elsie to come directly to me Lucy ran back to her friend and Elsie received the message in some trepidation but as no choice was now left her she went immediately to her father Did you want me papa she asked timidly Yes Elsie I wish to know why you send another person to me for what you want instead of coming yourself It displeases me very much and you may rest assured that you will never get anything that you ask for in that way Elsie hung her head in silence Are you going to answer me he asked in his severe tone Why did you send Lucy instead of coming yourself I was afraid papa she whispered almost under her breath Afraid afraid of what he asked with increasing displeasure Of you papa she replied in a tone so low that he could scarcely catch the words although he bent down his ear to receive her reply If I were a drunken brute in the habit of knocking you about beating and abusing you there might be some reason for your fear Elsie he said coloring with anger but as it is I see no excuse for it at all and I am both hurt and displeased by it I am very sorry papa I won t do so again she said tremblingly There was a moment s pause and then she asked in a timid hesitating way Papa may I have my candy if you please No you may not he said decidedly and understand and remember that I positively forbid you either to buy or eat anything of the kind again without my express permission Elsie s eyes filled and she had a hard struggle to keep down a rising sob as she turned away and went slowly back to the place where she had left her friend Have you got it asked Lucy eagerly Elsie shook her head What a shame exclaimed Lucy indignantly He s just as cross as he can be He s a tyrant so he is just a hateful old tyrant and I wouldn t care a cent for him if I were you Elsie I m glad he is not my father so I am I m afraid he doesn t love me much sighed Elsie in low tearful tones for he hardly ever lets me have anything or go anywhere that I want to Well never mind I ll send and buy a good lot tomorrow and we ll have a regular feast said Lucy soothingly as she passed her arm around her friend s waist and drew her down to a seat on the portico step Thank you Lucy you can buy for yourself if you like but not for me for papa has forbidden me to eat anything of the sort Oh of course we ll not let him know anything about it said Lucy But Elsie shook her head sadly saying with a little sigh No Lucy you are very kind but I cannot disobey papa even if he should never know it because that would be disobeying God and He would know it Dear me how particular you are exclaimed Lucy a little pettishly Elsie said mister Dinsmore speaking from the door what are you doing there Did I not forbid you to be out in the evening air I did not know you meant the doorstep papa I thought I was only not to go down into the garden replied the little girl rising to go in I see you intend to make as near an approach to disobedience as you dare said her father Go immediately to your room and tell mammy to put you to bed Elsie silently obeyed and Lucy casting an indignant glance at mister Dinsmore was about to follow her when he said I wish her to go alone if you please Miss Lucy and with a frown and a pout the little girl walked into the drawing room and seated herself on the sofa beside her mamma mister Dinsmore walked out on to the portico and stood there watching the moon which was just rising over the treetops Horace said Arthur emerging from the shadow of a tree near by and approaching his brother Elsie thinks you re a tyrant She says you never let her have anything or go anywhere and you re always punishing her She and Lucy have had a fine time out here talking over your bad treatment of her and planning to have some candy in spite of you Arthur I do not believe that Elsie would deliberately plan to disobey me and whatever faults she may have I am very sure she is above the meanness of telling tales replied mister Dinsmore in a tone of severity as he turned and went into the house while Arthur looking sadly crestfallen crept away out of sight When Elsie reached her room she found that Chloe was not there for not expecting that her services would be required at so early an hour she had gone down to the kitchen to have a little chat with her fellow servants Elsie rang for her and then walking to the window stood looking down into the garden in an attitude of thoughtfulness and dejection She was mentally taking a review of the manner in which she had spent the day as was her custom before retiring The retrospect had seldom been so painful to the little girl She had a very tender conscience and it told her now that she had more than once during the day indulged in wrong feelings toward her father that she had also allowed another to speak disrespectfully of him giving by her silence a tacit approval of the sentiments uttered and more than that had spoken complainingly of him herself Oh she murmured half aloud as she covered her face with her hands and the tears trickled through her fingers how soon I have forgotten the lesson papa taught me this morning and my promise to trust him without knowing his reasons I don t deserve that he should love me or be kind and indulgent when I am so rebellious What s de matter darlin asked Chloe s voice in pitiful tones as she took her nursling in her arms and laid her little head against her bosom passing her hand caressingly over the soft bright curls your ole mammy can t bear to see her pet cryin like dat O mammy mammy I ve been such a wicked girl to day Oh I m afraid I shall never be good never be like Jesus I m afraid He is angry with me for I have disobeyed Him to day sobbed the child Darlin said Chloe earnestly didn t you read to your ole mammy dis very morning dese bressed words If any man sin we have an advocate with the Father Jesus Christ the righteous an de other If we confess our sins He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins Go to de dear bressed Lord Jesus darlin an ax Him to forgive you an I knows He will Yes He will replied the little girl raising her head and dashing away her tears He will forgive my sins and take away my wicked heart and give me right thoughts and feelings How glad I am you remembered those sweet texts you dear old mammy she added twining her arms lovingly around her nurse s neck And then she delivered her papa s message and Chloe began at once to prepare her for bed Elsie s tears had ceased to flow but they were still trembling in her eyes and the little face wore a very sad and troubled expression as she stood patiently passive in her nurse s hands Chloe had soon finished her labors and then the little girl opened her Bible and as usual read a few verses aloud though her voice trembled and once or twice a tear fell on the page then closing the book she stole away to the side of the bed and knelt down She was a good while on her knees and several times as the sound of a low sob fell upon Chloe s ear she sighed and murmured to herself Poor darlin dear bressed lamb your ole mammy don t like to hear dat Then as the child rose from her kneeling posture she went to her and taking her in her arms folded her in a fond embrace calling her by the most tender and endearing epithets and telling her that her old mammy loved her better than life better than anything in the wide world Elsie flung her arms around her nurse s neck and laid her head upon her bosom saying Yes my dear old mammy I know you love me and I love you too But put me in bed now or papa will be displeased What makes you so onrestless darlin asked Chloe half an hour afterward can t you go to sleep no how O mammy if I could only see papa just for one moment to tell him something Do you think he would come to me sighed the little girl Please mammy go down and see if he is busy Don t say a word if he is but if not ask him to come to me for just one minute Chloe left the room immediately but returned the next moment saying I jes looked into de parlor darlin an Mass Horace he mighty busy playin chess wid Miss Lucy s mamma an I didn t say nuffin to him Jes you go sleep my pet an tell Mass Horace all bout it in de mornin Elsie sighed deeply and turning over on her pillow cried herself to sleep Chloe was just putting the finishing touches to the little girl s dress the next morning when Lucy Carrington rapped at the door Good morning Elsie she said I was in a hurry to come to you because it is my last day you know Wasn t it too bad of your father to send you off to bed so early last night No Lucy papa has a right to send me to bed whenever he pleases and besides I was naughty and deserved to be punished and it was not much more than half an hour earlier than my usual bedtime You naughty exclaimed Lucy opening her eyes very wide Mamma often says she wishes I was half as good Elsie sighed but made no answer Her thoughts seemed far away She was thinking of what she had been so anxious the night before to say to her father and trying to gain courage to do it this morning If I could only get close to him when nobody was by and he would look and speak kindly to me I could do it then she murmured to herself Come Aunt Chloe aren t you done I want to have a run in the garden before breakfast said Lucy somewhat impatiently as Chloe tied and untied Elsie s sash several times Well Miss Lucy I se done now she answered passing her hand once more over her nursling s curls but Mass Horace he mighty pertickler bout Miss Elsie Yes said Elsie papa wants me always to look very nice and neat and when I go down in the morning he just gives me one glance from head to foot and if anything is wrong he is sure to see it and send me back immediately to have it made right Now mammy please give me my hat and let us go You s got plenty ob time chillens de bell won t go for to ring dis hour remarked the old nurse tying on Elsie s hat My chile looks sweet an fresh as a moss rosebud dis mornin she added talking to herself as she watched the two little girls tripping down stairs hand in hand They skipped up and down the avenue several times and ran all round the garden before it was time to go in Then Elsie went up to Chloe to have her hair made smooth again She was just descending for the second time to the hall where she had left Lucy when they saw a carriage drive up to the front door There s papa cried Lucy joyfully as it stopped and a gentleman sprang out and came up the steps into the portico and in an instant she was in his arms receiving such kisses and caresses as Elsie had vainly longed for all her life Lucy had several brothers but was an only daughter and a very great pet especially with her father Elsie watched them with a wistful look and a strange aching at her heart But presently mister Carrington set Lucy down and turning to her gave her a shake of the hand and then a kiss saying How do you do this morning my dear I m afraid you are hardly glad to see me as I come to take Lucy away for I suppose you have been having fine times together Yes sir indeed we have and I hope you will let her come again Oh yes certainly but the visits must not be all on one side I shall talk to your papa about it and perhaps persuade him to let us take you along this afternoon to spend a week at Ashlands Oh how delightful cried Lucy clapping her hands Elsie do you think he will let you go I don t know I m afraid not replied the little girl doubtfully You must coax him as I do my papa said Lucy But at this Elsie only shook her head and just then the breakfast bell rang mister Dinsmore was already in the breakfast room and Elsie going up to him said Good morning papa Good morning Elsie he replied but his tone was so cold that even if no one else had been by she could not have said another word He had not intended to be influenced by the information Arthur had so maliciously given him the night before yet unconsciously he was and his manner to his little daughter was many degrees colder than it had been for some time After breakfast Lucy reminded Elsie of a promise she had made to show her some beautiful shells which her father had collected in his travels and Elsie led the way to the cabinet a small room opening into the library and filled with curiosities They had gone in alone but were soon followed by Arthur Walter and Enna Almost everything in the room belonged to mister Horace Dinsmore and Elsie knowing that many of the articles were rare and costly and that he was very careful of them begged Enna and the boys to go out lest they should accidentally do some mischief I won t replied Arthur I ve just as good a right to be here as you As he spoke he gave her a push which almost knocked her over and in catching at a table to save herself from falling she threw down a beautiful vase of rare old china which mister Dinsmore prized very highly It fell with a loud crash and lay scattered in fragments at their feet There see what you ve done exclaimed Arthur as the little group stood aghast at the mischief It happened that mister Dinsmore was just then in the library and the noise soon brought him upon the scene of action Who did this he asked in a wrathful tone looking from one to the other Elsie said Arthur she threw it down and broke it Troublesome careless child I would not have taken a hundred dollars for that vase he exclaimed Go to your room go this instant and stay there until I send for you and remember if you ever come in here again without permission I shall punish you He opened the door as he spoke and Elsie flew across the hall up the stairs and into her own room without once pausing or looking back Now go out every one of you and don t come in here again this is no place for children said mister Dinsmore turning the others into the hall and shutting and locking the door upon them You ought to be ashamed Arthur Dinsmore exclaimed Lucy indignantly it was all your own fault and Elsie was not to blame at all and you know it I didn t touch the old vase and I m not going to take the blame of it either I can tell you miss replied Arthur moving off followed by Walter and Enna while Lucy walked to the other end of the hall and stood looking out of the window debating in her own mind whether she had sufficient courage to face mister Dinsmore and make him understand where the blame of the accident ought to lie At length she seemed to have solved the question for turning about and moving noiselessly down the passage to the library door she gave a timid little rap which was immediately answered by mister Dinsmore s voice saying Come in Lucy opened the door and walked in closing it after her mister Dinsmore sat at a table writing and he looked up with an expression of mingled surprise and impatience What do you want Miss Lucy he said speak quickly for I am very busy I just wanted to tell you sir replied Lucy speaking up quite boldly that Elsie was not at all to blame about the vase for it was Arthur who pushed her and made her fall against the table and that was the way the vase came to fall and break What made him push her he asked Just because Elsie asked him and Walter and Enna to go out for fear they might do some mischief mister Dinsmore s pen was suspended over the paper for a moment while he sat thinking with a somewhat clouded brow but presently turning to the little girl he said quite pleasantly Very well Miss Lucy I am much obliged to you for your information for I should be very sorry to punish Elsie unjustly And now will you do me the favor to go to her and tell her that her papa says she need not stay in her room any longer Yes sir I will replied Lucy her face sparkling with delight as she hurried off with great alacrity to do his bidding She found Elsie in her room crying violently and throwing her arms around her neck she delivered mister Dinsmore s message concluding with So now Elsie you see you needn t cry nor feel sorry any more but just dry your eyes and let us go down into the garden and have a good time Elsie was very thankful to Lucy and very glad that her papa now knew that she was not to blame but she was still sorry for his loss and his words had wounded her too deeply to be immediately forgotten indeed it was some time before the sore spot they had made in her heart was entirely healed But she tried to forget it all and enter heartily into the sports proposed by Lucy The Carringtons were not to leave until the afternoon and the little girls spent nearly the whole morning in the garden coming into the drawing room a few moments before the dinner bell rang missus Carrington sat on a sofa engaged with some fancy work while Herbert who had not felt well enough to join the other children had stretched himself out beside her putting his head in her lap mister Carrington and mister Horace Dinsmore were conversing near by Lucy ran up to her papa and seated herself upon his knee with her arm around his neck while Elsie stopped a moment to speak to Herbert and then timidly approaching her father with her eyes upon the floor said in a low half frightened tone that reached no ear but his I am very sorry about the vase papa He took her hand and drawing her close to him pushed back the hair from her forehead with his other hand and bending down to her said almost in a whisper Never mind daughter we will forget all about it I am sorry I spoke so harshly to you since Lucy tells me you were not so much to blame Elsie s face flushed with pleasure and she looked up gratefully but before she had time to reply missus Carrington said Elsie we want to take you home with us to spend a week will you go I should like to very much indeed ma am if papa will let me replied the little girl looking wistfully up into his face Well mister Dinsmore what do you say I hope you can have no objection said missus Carrington looking inquiringly at him while her husband added Oh yes Dinsmore you must let her go by all means you can certainly spare her for a week and it need be no interruption to her lessons as she can share with Lucy in the instructions of our governess who is really a superior teacher mister Dinsmore was looking very grave and Elsie knew from the expression of his countenance what his answer would be before he spoke He had noticed the indignant glance Lucy had once or twice bestowed upon him and remembering Arthur s report of the conversation between the two little girls the night before had decided in his own mind that the less Elsie saw of Lucy the better I thank you both for your kind attention to my little girl he replied courteously but while fully appreciating your kindness in extending the invitation I must beg leave to decline it as I am satisfied that home is the best place for her at present Ah no I suppose we ought hardly to have expected you to spare her so soon after your return said missus Carrington but really I am very sorry to be refused for Elsie is such a good child that I am always delighted to have Lucy and Herbert with her Perhaps you think better of her than she deserves missus Carrington I find that Elsie is sometimes naughty and in need of correction as well as other children and therefore I think it best to keep her as much as possible under my own eye replied mister Dinsmore looking very gravely at his little daughter as he spoke Elsie s face flushed painfully and she had hard work to keep from bursting into tears It was a great relief to her that just at that moment the dinner bell rang and there was a general movement in the direction of the dining room Her look was touchingly humble as her father led her in and seated her at the table She was thinking Papa says I am naughty sometimes but oh how very naughty he would think me if he knew all the wicked feelings I had yesterday As soon as they had risen from the table missus Carrington bade Lucy go up to her maid to have her bonnet put on as the carriage was already at the door Elsie would have gone with her but her father had taken her hand again and he held it fast She looked up inquiringly into his face Stay here he said Lucy will be down again in a moment And Elsie stood quietly at his side until Lucy returned But even then her father did not relinquish his hold of her hand and all the talking the little girls could do must be done close at his side Yet as he was engaged in earnest conversation with mister Carrington and did not seem to be listening to them Lucy ventured to whisper to Elsie I think it s real mean of him he might let you go No replied Elsie in the same low tone I m sure papa knows best and besides I have been naughty and don t deserve to go though I should like to dearly Well good bye said Lucy giving her a kiss It was not until mister Carrington s carriage was fairly on its way down the avenue that mister Dinsmore dropped his little girl s hand and then he said I want you in the library Elsie come to me in half an hour Yes papa I will she replied looking a little frightened You need not be afraid he said in a tone of displeasure I am not going to hurt you Elsie blushed and hung her head but made no reply and he turned away and left her She could not help wondering what he wanted with her and though she tried not to feel afraid it was impossible to keep from trembling a little as she knocked at the library door Her father s voice said Come in and entering she found him alone seated at a table covered with papers and writing materials while beside the account book in which he was writing lay a pile of money in bank notes and gold and silver Here Elsie he said laying down his pen I want to give you your month s allowance Your grandfather has paid it to you heretofore but of course now that I am at home I attend to everything that concerns you You have been receiving eight dollars I shall give you ten and he counted out the money and laid it before her as he spoke but I shall require a strict account of all that you spend I want you to learn to keep accounts for if you live you will some day have a great deal of money to take care of and here is a blank book that I have prepared so that you can do so very easily Every time that you lay out or give away any money you must set it down here as soon as you come home be particular about that lest you should forget something because you must bring your book to me at the end of every month and let me see how much you have spent and what is the balance in hand and if you are not able to make it come out square and tell me what you have done with every penny you will lose either the whole or a part of your allowance for the next month according to the extent of your delinquency Do you understand Yes sir Very well Let me see now how much you can remember of your last month s expenditures Take the book and set down everything you can think of Elsie had a good memory and was able to remember how she had spent almost every cent during the time specified and she set down one item after another and then added up the column without any mistake That was very well done said her father approvingly And then running over the items half aloud Candy half a dollar remember Elsie there is to be no more money disposed of in that way not as a matter of economy by any means but because I consider is very injurious I am very anxious that you should grow up strong and healthy I would not for anything have you a miserable dyspeptic Then suddenly closing the book and handing it to her he said inquiringly You were very anxious to go to Ashlands I would have liked to go papa if you had been willing she replied meekly I am afraid Lucy is not a suitable companion for you Elsie I think she puts bad notions into your head he said very gravely Elsie flushed and trembled and was just opening her lips to make her confession when the door opened and her grandfather entered She could not speak before him and so remained silent Does she not sometimes say naughty things to you asked her father speaking so low that her grandfather could not have heard Yes sir replied the little girl almost under her breath I thought so said he and therefore I shall keep you apart as entirely as possible and I hope there will be no murmuring on your part No papa you know best she answered very humbly Then putting the money into her hands he dismissed her When she had gone out he sat for a moment in deep thought Elsie s list of articles bought with her last month s allowance consisted almost entirely of gifts for others generally the servants There were some beads and sewing silk for making a purse and a few drawing materials but with the exception of the candy she had bought nothing else for herself This was what her father was thinking of She is a dear unselfish generous little thing he said to himself However I may be mistaken I must not allow myself to judge from only one month She seems submissive too he had overheard what passed between her and Lucy at parting but perhaps that was for effect she probably suspected I could hear her and she thinks me a tyrant and obeys from fear not love This thought drove away all the tender feeling that had been creeping into his heart and when he next met his little daughter his manner was as cold and distant as ever and Elsie found it impossible to approach him with sufficient freedom to tell him what was in her heart CHAPTER FIFTH Man is unjust but God is just and finally justice Triumphs LONGFELLOW S Evangeline How disappointment tracks The steps of hope MISS LANDON One afternoon the next week after the Carringtons had left 
2943-171000-0000	train-other-500	the younger members of the family Arthur
none	none	 Elsie Walter and Enna were setting out to take a walk 
2943-171000-0001	train-other-500	when Elsie seeing a gold chain depending from the pocket of Arthur s jacket exclaimed
none	none	 O Arthur how could you take grandpa s watch 
2943-171000-0002	train-other-500	Do put it away for you will be almost sure to injure it Hold your tongue Elsie I ll do as I please was the polite rejoinder But Arthur you know that grandpa would never let you take it
2943-171000-0003	train-other-500	I have often heard him say that it was very valuable
none	none	 for it was seldom that so good a one could be had at any price and I know that he paid a great deal for it Well if he prizes it so he needn t have left it lying on his table and so I ll just teach him a lesson it s about time he learnt to be careful O Arthur do put it away pleaded Elsie if anything should happen to it what will grandpa say I know he will be very angry and ask us all who did it 
2943-171000-0004	train-other-500	and you know I cannot tell a lie and if he asks me if it was you I cannot say no Yes I ll trust you for telling tales replied Arthur sneeringly
none	none	 but if you do I ll pay you for it 
2943-171000-0005	train-other-500	He ran down the avenue as he spoke Walter and Enna following and Elsie slowly bringing up the rear looking the picture of distress for she knew not what to do seeing that Arthur would not listen to her remonstrances and as often happened
2943-171000-0006	train-other-500	all the older members of the family were out
none	none	 and thus there was no authority that could be appealed to in time to prevent the mischief which she had every reason to fear would be done 
2943-171000-0007	train-other-500	Once she thought of turning back
none	none	 that she might escape the necessity of being a witness in the case 
2943-171000-0008	train-other-500	but remembering that her father told her she must walk with the others that afternoon
none	none	 and also that as she had already seen the watch in Arthur s possession 
2943-171000-0009	train-other-500	her testimony would be sufficient to convict him even if she saw no more she gave up the idea and hurried on with the faint hope that she might be able to induce Arthur to refrain from indulging in such sports as would be likely to endanger the watch or else to give it into her charge
none	none	 At any other time she would have trembled at the thought of touching it 
2943-171000-0010	train-other-500	but now she felt so sure it would be safer with her than with him
none	none	 that she would gladly have taken the responsibility 
2943-171000-0011	train-other-500	The walk was far from being a pleasure that afternoon
none	none	 the boys ran so fast that it quite put her out of breath to keep up with them and then every little while Arthur would cut some caper that made her tremble for the watch answering her entreaties that he would either give it into her care or walk along quietly with sneers and taunts and declarations of his determination to do just exactly as he pleased and not be ruled by her But at length while he was in the act of climbing a tree the watch dropped from his pocket and fell to the ground 
2943-171000-0012	train-other-500	striking with considerable force Elsie uttered a scream and Arthur now thoroughly frightened himself
none	none	 jumped down and picked it up 
2943-171000-0013	train-other-500	The crystal was broken the back dented and how much the works were injured they could not tell but it had ceased to run
none	none	 O Arthur see what you ve done exclaimed Walter What will papa say said Enna 
2943-171000-0014	train-other-500	while Elsie stood pale and trembling not speaking a word You hush exclaimed Arthur fiercely I ll tell you what
none	none	 if any of you dare to tell of me I ll make you sorry for it to the last day of your life Do you hear The question was addressed to Elsie in a tone of defiance Arthur said she grandpa will know that somebody did it and surely you would not wish an innocent person to be punished for your fault 
2943-171000-0015	train-other-500	I don t care who gets punished so that papa does not find out that I did it said he furiously
none	none	 and if you dare to tell of me 
2943-171000-0016	train-other-500	I ll pay you for it I shall say nothing unless it becomes necessary to save the innocent or I am forced to speak but in that case I shall tell the truth replied Elsie firmly Arthur doubled up his fist and made a plunge at her as if he meant to knock her down
2943-171000-0017	train-other-500	but Elsie sprang behind the tree and then ran so fleetly toward the house that he was not able to overtake her until his passion had had time to cool When they reached the house Arthur replaced the watch on his father s table whence he had taken it
none	none	 and then they all awaited his return with what courage they might I say Wally said Arthur drawing his little brother aside and speaking in a low tone having first sent a cautious glance around to assure himself that no one else was within hearing I say what would you give me for that new riding whip of mine O Arthur anything I ve got exclaimed the little boy eagerly But you wouldn t give it up I know and you re only trying to tease me No indeed Wal I mean to give it to you if you ll only be a good fellow and do as I tell you What he asked with intense interest Tell papa that Jim broke the watch But he didn t replied the child opening his eyes wide with astonishment Well what of that you little goose exclaimed Arthur impatiently papa doesn t know that But Jim will get punished said Walter and I don t want to tell such a big story either Very well sir then you ll not get the whip and besides if you don t do as I wish I m certain you ll see a ghost one of these nights for there s one comes to see me sometimes and I ll send him right off to you Oh don t Arthur don t I d die of fright cried the little boy who was very timid glancing nervously around as if he expected the ghost to appear immediately I tell you I will though if you don t do as I say he ll come this very night and carry you off and never bring you back O Arthur don t let him come and I ll say anything you want me to cried the little fellow in great terror That s a good boy I knew you would said Arthur smiling triumphantly And turning away from Walter he next sought out Enna and tried his threats and persuasions upon her with even better success Elsie had gone directly to her own room where she sat trembling every time a footstep approached her door lest it should be a messenger from her grandfather No one came however and at last the tea bell rang and on going down she found to her relief that her grandfather and his wife had not yet returned You look pale Elsie said her father giving her a scrutinizing glance as she took her seat by his side Are you well Yes papa quite well she replied 
2943-171000-0018	train-other-500	He looked at her again a little anxiously but said no more and as soon as the meal was concluded Elsie hastened away to her own room again It was still early in the evening
none	none	 when mister and missus Dinsmore returned 
2943-171000-0019	train-other-500	for once bringing no company with them and he had not been many minutes in the house ere he took up his watch and of course instantly discovered the injury it had sustained His suspicions at once fell upon Arthur whose character for mischief was well established and burning with rage
2943-171000-0020	train-other-500	watch in hand he repaired to the drawing room which he entered asking in tones tremulous with passion
none	none	 Where is Arthur Young rascal this is some of his work 
2943-171000-0021	train-other-500	he added holding up the injured article My dear how can you say so have you any proof asked his wife deprecatingly
none	none	 adding in her softest tones 
2943-171000-0022	train-other-500	my poor boy seems to get the blame of everything that goes wrong He gets no more than he deserves replied her husband angrily Arthur Arthur I say where are you
none	none	 He is in the garden sir I think I saw him walking in the shrubbery a moment since said mister Horace Dinsmore 
2943-171000-0023	train-other-500	The father instantly despatched a servant to bring him in sending a second in search of the overseer while a third was ordered to assemble all the house servants I will sift this matter to the bottom and child or servant the guilty one shall suffer for it
2943-171000-0024	train-other-500	exclaimed the old gentleman pacing angrily up and down the room Arthur
none	none	 said he sternly as the boy made his appearance looking somewhat pale and alarmed 
2943-171000-0025	train-other-500	how dared you meddle with my watch I didn t sir I never touched it he replied boldly yet avoiding his father s eye as he uttered the deliberate falsehood There my dear I told you so exclaimed his mother triumphantly
none	none	 I don t believe you said his father and if you are guilty as I strongly suspect you had better confess it at once before I find it out in some other way 
2943-171000-0026	train-other-500	I didn t do it sir It was Jim
none	none	 and I can prove it by Walter and Enna we all saw it fall from his pocket when he was up in a tree and he cried like anything when he found it was broken and said he didn t mean to do it any harm he was only going to wear it a little while and then put it back all safe but now master would be dreadfully angry and have him flogged That I will if it is true exclaimed the old gentleman passionately he shall be well whipped and sent out to work on the plantation 
2943-171000-0027	train-other-500	I ll keep no such meddlers about my house He looked at Enna
none	none	 What do you know of this he asked It is true papa I saw him do it she replied with a slight blush and sending an uneasy glance around the room 
2943-171000-0028	train-other-500	Did you see it too Walter asked his father Yes sir replied the little fellow in a low reluctant tone but please papa don t punish him I m sure he didn t mean to break it Hold your tongue he shall be punished as he deserves cried the old gentleman furiously
none	none	 Here sir turning to the overseer and pointing to Jim take the fellow out and give him such a flogging as he will remember 
2943-171000-0029	train-other-500	Elsie was sitting in her own room trying to learn a lesson for the next day but finding great difficulty in fixing her thoughts upon it when she was startled by the sudden entrance of Aunt Chloe who with her apron to her eyes was sobbing violently
none	none	 O mammy mammy what s the matter has anything happened to you inquired the little girl in a tone of great alarm 
2943-171000-0030	train-other-500	starting to her feet and dropping her book in her haste and fright Why sobbed Chloe
none	none	 Jim he s been an gone an broke ole master s watch an he s gwine be whipped an old Aunt Phoebe she s cryin fit to break her ole heart bout her boy kase Elsie waited to hear no more but darting out into the hall and encountering her father on his way to his room she rushed up to him pale and agitated 
2943-171000-0031	train-other-500	and seizing his hand looked up eagerly into his face exclaiming with a burst of tears and sobs O papa papa don t oh don t let them whip poor Jim
none	none	 mister Dinsmore s countenance was very grave almost distressed I am sorry it is necessary daughter he said 
2943-171000-0032	train-other-500	but Jim has done very wrong and deserves his punishment and I cannot interfere
none	none	 Oh no papa he did not indeed he did not break the watch I know he didn t for I was by and saw it all 
2943-171000-0033	train-other-500	Is it possible said he in a tone of surprise
none	none	 then tell me who did do it It could not have been you Elsie 
2943-171000-0034	train-other-500	and he looked searchingly into her face
none	none	 Oh no papa I would never have dared to touch it But please don t make me tell tales but I know it wasn t Jim 
2943-171000-0035	train-other-500	Oh do stop them quickly before they begin to whip him Aunt Chloe said mister Dinsmore go down to my father and tell him it is my request that the punishment should be delayed a few moments until I come down
none	none	 Then taking Elsie s hand he led her into her room again and seating himself drew her to his side saying with grave decision Now my daughter if you want to save Jim it will be necessary for you to tell all you know about this affair I don t like to tell tales papa pleaded the little girl I think it so very mean Is it not enough for me to tell that I know Jim didn t do it No Elsie I have already said that it is quite necessary for you to tell all you know O papa don t make me I don t like to do it she urged with tears in her eyes I should be very much ashamed of you and quite unwilling to own you as my child if under any other circumstances you were willing to tell tales he replied in a tone of kindness that quite surprised Elsie who always trembled at the very thought of opposing the slightest resistance to his will but he added firmly it is the only way to save Jim if you do not now make a full disclosure of all you know he will be severely whipped and sent away to work on the plantation which will distress his poor old mother exceedingly 
2943-171000-0036	train-other-500	Elsie I think you would be doing very wickedly to allow an innocent person to suffer when you can prevent it and besides I will add the weight of my authority and say you must do it at once
none	none	 and you well know my daughter that there can be no question as to the duty of obedience to your father He paused gazing earnestly down into the little tearful downcast blushing face at his side 
2943-171000-0037	train-other-500	Have I not said enough to convince you of your duty he asked Yes papa I will tell you all about it
none	none	 she answered in a tremulous tone Her story was told with evident reluctance but in a simple straightforward manner that attested its truthfulness mister Dinsmore listened in silence but with an expression of indignation on his handsome features 
2943-171000-0038	train-other-500	and the moment she had finished he rose and again taking her hand led her from the room saying as he did so You must repeat this story to your grandfather O papa must I Won t you tell him please don t make me do it she pleaded tremblingly and hanging back
none	none	 My daughter you must he replied so sternly that she dared not make any further resistance but quietly submitted to be led into her grandfather s presence He was still in the drawing room walking about in a disturbed and angry manner and now and then casting a suspicious glance upon Arthur who sat pale and trembling in a corner looking the picture of guilt and misery 
2943-171000-0039	train-other-500	for he had heard Chloe deliver his brother s message and feared that exposure awaited him Walter had stolen away to cry over Jim s punishment and wish that he had had the courage to tell the truth at first but saying to himself that it was too late now his father wouldn t believe him
2943-171000-0040	train-other-500	and he would make it up to Jim somehow even if it took all his pocket money for a month None of the other members of the family had left the room and all wore an anxious expectant look as mister Dinsmore entered leading Elsie by the hand
2943-171000-0041	train-other-500	I have brought you another witness sir he said for it seems Elsie was present when the mischief was done Ah exclaimed the old gentlemen then I may hope to get at the truth Elsie who broke my watch It was not Jim grandpa indeed indeed it was not but
none	none	 oh please don t make me say who it was replied the little girl beseechingly 
2943-171000-0042	train-other-500	Elsie exclaimed her father in a tone of stern reproof O papa how can I she sobbed trembling and clinging to his hand as she caught a threatening look from Arthur Come come child you must tell us all you know about it said her grandfather
2943-171000-0043	train-other-500	or else I can t let Jim off mister Dinsmore was looking down at his little girl and following the direction of her glance perceived the cause of her terror Don t be afraid to speak out and tell all you know daughter for I will protect you he said
none	none	 pressing the little trembling hand in his and at the same time giving Arthur a meaning look Yes yes speak out child speak out at once 
2943-171000-0044	train-other-500	no one shall hurt you for telling the truth exclaimed her grandfather impatiently
none	none	 I will grandpa she said trembling and weeping but please don t be very angry with Arthur if you will forgive him this time I think he will never meddle any more and I am quite sure he did not mean to break it So it was you after all you young rascal 
2943-171000-0045	train-other-500	I knew it from the first cried the old gentleman striding across the room seizing the boy by the shoulder and shaking him roughly But go on Elsie let us have the whole story he added turning to her again but still keeping his hold upon Arthur
2943-171000-0046	train-other-500	You young dog he added when she had finished Yes I ll forgive you
none	none	 when you ve had a good sound flogging and a week s solitary confinement on bread and water but not before So saying he was about to lead him from the room when Elsie suddenly sprang forward and with clasped hands and flushed eager face she pleaded earnestly beseechingly O grandpa don t whip him don t punish him He will never be so naughty again 
2943-171000-0047	train-other-500	Will you Arthur Let me pay for the watch grandpa and don t punish him I would so like to do it It isn t the moneyed value of the watch I care for child replied the old gentleman contemptuously
none	none	 and besides where would you get so much money I am rich grandpa am I not Didn t my mamma leave me a great deal of money asked the little girl casting down her eyes and blushing painfully No Elsie said her father very gently as he took her hand and led her back to the side of his chair again you have nothing but what I choose to give you until you come of age which will not be for a great many years yet But you will give me the money to pay for the watch papa won t you she asked pleadingly No I certainly shall not for I think Arthur should be left to suffer the penalty of his own misdeeds he replied in a very decided tone and besides he added your grandfather has already told you that it is not the pecuniary loss he cares for No but I will teach this young rascal to let my property alone 
2943-171000-0048	train-other-500	said the elder gentleman with almost fierce determination as he tightened his grasp upon the boy s arm and dragged him from the room Arthur cast a look of hatred and defiance at Elsie as he went out that made her grow pale with fear and tremble so that she could scarcely stand
2943-171000-0049	train-other-500	Her father saw both the look and its effect and drawing the little trembler closer to him he put his arm around her and stroking her hair said in a low soothing tone
none	none	 Don t be frightened daughter I will protect you She answered him with a grateful look and a long sigh of relief 
2943-171000-0050	train-other-500	and he was just about to take her on his knee when visitors were announced and changing his mind he dismissed her to her room and she saw no more of him that evening Oh if they only hadn t come just now thought the sorely disappointed child
none	none	 as she went out with slow reluctant steps I m sure they wouldn t if they had only known I m sure quite sure papa was going to take me on his knee and they prevented him Oh will be ever think of doing it again 
2943-171000-0051	train-other-500	Dear dear papa if you could only know how I long to sit there But missus Dinsmore who had hastily retired on the exit of Arthur and his father from the drawing room was now sailing majestically down the hall on her return thither
none	none	 and Elsie catching sight of her and being naturally anxious to avoid a meeting just then at once quickened her pace very considerably almost running up the stairs to her own room where she found old Aunt Phoebe Jim s mother waiting to speak with her 
2943-171000-0052	train-other-500	The poor old creature was overflowing with gratitude and her fervent outpouring of thanks and blessings almost made Elsie forget her disappointment for the time Then Jim came to the door asking to see Miss Elsie and poured out his thanks amid many sobs and tears
none	none	 for the poor fellow had been terribly frightened indeed so astounded by the unexpected charge that he had not had a word to say in his own defence beyond an earnest and reiterated assertion of his entire innocence to which however his angry master had paid no attention 
2943-171000-0053	train-other-500	But at length Phoebe remembered that she had some baking to do and calling on Jim to come right along and split up some dry wood to heat her oven she went down to the kitchen followed by her son and Elsie was left alone with her nurse
2943-171000-0054	train-other-500	Chloe sat silently knitting and the little girl with her head leaning upon her hand and her eyes fixed thoughtfully upon the floor was rehearsing again and again in her own mind all that had just passed between her papa and herself
2943-171000-0055	train-other-500	dwelling with lingering delight upon everything approaching to a caress every kind word every soothing tone of his voice and then picturing to herself all that he might have done and said if those unwelcome visitors had not come in and put an end to the interview
2943-171000-0056	train-other-500	and half hoping that he would send for her when they had gone she watched the clock and listened intently for every sound But her bedtime came and she dared not stay up any longer for his orders had been peremptory that she should always retire precisely at that hour
2943-171000-0057	train-other-500	unless she had his express permission to remain up longer She lay awake for some time thinking of his unwonted kindness and indulging fond hopes for the future then fell asleep to dream
2943-171000-0058	train-other-500	that she was on her father s knee and felt his arms folded lovingly about her and his kisses warm upon her cheek Her heart beat quickly as she entered the breakfast room the next morning The family were just taking their places at the table
none	none	 and her half eager half timid Good morning papa was answered by a grave absent Good morning Elsie and turning to his father and entering into a conversation with him on some business matter he took no further notice of his little daughter 
2943-171000-0059	train-other-500	excepting to see that her plate was well supplied with such articles of food as he allowed her to eat Elsie was sadly disappointed and lingered about the room in the vain hope of obtaining a smile or caress but presently her father went out
2943-171000-0060	train-other-500	saying to the elder mister Dinsmore that he was going to ride over to Ion and would probably not return before night then with a sigh the little girl went back to her own room to prepare her morning lessons
2943-171000-0061	train-other-500	Elsie was now happily free from Arthur s persecutions for a time for even after his release he was too much afraid of his brother openly to offer her any very serious annoyance though he plotted revenge in secret
2943-171000-0062	train-other-500	yet the little girl s situation was far from comfortable and her patience often severely tried for missus Dinsmore was excessively angry with her on Arthur s account and whenever her father was not present treated her in the most unkind manner and from the same cause the rest of the family
none	none	 with the exception of her grandpa and Aunt Adelaide 
2943-171000-0063	train-other-500	were unusually cold and distant while her father although careful to see that all her wants were attended to seldom took any further notice of her unless to reprove her for some childish fault which however trifling never escaped his eye
2943-171000-0064	train-other-500	You seem said Adelaide to him one day as he sent Elsie from the room for some very slight fault to expect that child to be a great deal more perfect than any grown person I ever saw and to understand all about the rules of etiquette
2943-171000-0065	train-other-500	If you please Adelaide said he haughtily I should like to be allowed to manage my own child as I see proper without any interference from others
none	none	 Excuse me replied his sister I had no intention of interfering but really Horace I do think you have no idea how eagle eyed you are for faults in her nor how very stern is the tone in which you always reprove her I have known Elsie a great deal longer than you have and I feel very certain that a gentle reproof would do her quite as much good and not wound her half so much Enough Adelaide exclaimed her brother impatiently If I were ten years younger than yourself instead of that much older there might be some propriety in your advising and directing me thus as it is I must say I consider it simply impertinent And he left the room with an angry stride while Adelaide looked after him with the thought I am glad you have no authority over me All that Adelaide had said was true yet Elsie never complained never blamed her father even in her heart but in her deep humility thought it was all because she was so very naughty or careless and she was continually making resolutions to be oh so careful always to do just right and please dear papa so that some day he might learn to love her But alas that hope was daily growing fainter and fainter his cold and distant manner to her and his often repeated reproofs had so increased her natural timidity and sensitiveness that she was now very constrained in her approaches to him and seldom ventured to move or speak in his presence and he would not see that this timidity and embarrassment were the natural results of his treatment but attributed it all to want of affection He saw that she feared him and to that feeling alone he gave credit for her uniform obedience to his commands while he had no conception of the intense but now almost despairing love for him that burned in that little heart and made the young life one longing earnest desire and effort to gain his affection CHAPTER SIXTH Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me Psalm xxiii four Tis but the cruel artifice of fate Thus to refine and vary on our woes To raise us from despair and give us hopes Only to plunge us in the gulf again And make us doubly wretched TRAP s Abramuh It was Sabbath morning and Elsie ready dressed for church stood in the portico waiting for her father to come down and lift her into the carriage in which Adelaide Louisa and Enna were already seated The coachman was in his seat and the horses a pair of young and fiery steeds purchased by mister Dinsmore only a few days before were impatiently stamping and tossing their heads 
2943-171001-0000	train-other-500	requiring quite an exertion of strength to hold them in I don t exactly like the actions of those horses Ajax remarked mister Dinsmore as he came out putting on his gloves I did not intend to have them put in harness to day Why did you not give us the old bays
none	none	 Kase Marster Horace 
2943-171001-0001	train-other-500	ole Kate she s got a lame foot

2943-171001-0002	train-other-500	an I reckoned I mout jis as well use em to day Do you feel quite sure of being able to hold them in asked his master glancing uneasily first at the horses and then at Elsie
none	none	 Ki marster dis here chile ben able to hold in a most anything 
2943-171001-0003	train-other-500	exclaimed the negro exhibiting a double row of dazzlingly white teeth an besides I se drove dese here hosses twice fore now an dey went splendid Hold em in Yes sah easy as nuffin
2943-171001-0004	train-other-500	Elsie said her father still looking a little uneasy in spite of Ajax s boasting I think it would be just as well for you to stay at home Elsie made no reply in words but her answering look spoke such intense disappointment
2943-171001-0005	train-other-500	such earnest entreaty that saying Ah well I suppose there is no real danger and since you seem so anxious to go I will not compel you to stay at home he lifted her into the carriage and seating himself beside her ordered the coachman to drive on as carefully as he could
2943-171001-0006	train-other-500	Elsie change seats with me
none	none	 said Enna I want to sit beside Brother Horace 
2943-171001-0007	train-other-500	No replied mister Dinsmore laying his hand on his little daughter s shoulder Elsie s place is by me and she shall sit nowhere else
2943-171001-0008	train-other-500	Do you think we are in any danger of being run away with asked Adelaide a little anxiously as she observed him glancing once or twice out of the window
none	none	 and was at the same time sensible that their motion was unusually rapid 
2943-171001-0009	train-other-500	The horses are young and fiery but Ajax is an excellent driver he replied evasively adding You may be sure that if I had thought the danger very great I would have left Elsie at home They reached the church without accident
2943-171001-0010	train-other-500	but on their return the horses took fright while going down a hill and rushed along at a furious rate which threatened every instant to upset the carriage Elsie thought they were going very fast but did not know that there was real danger
2943-171001-0011	train-other-500	until her father suddenly lifted her from her seat and placing her between his knees held her tightly as though he feared she would be snatched from his grasp Elsie looked up into his face
none	none	 It was deadly pale and his eyes were fixed upon her with an expression of anguish 
2943-171001-0012	train-other-500	Dear papa she whispered God will take care of us I would give all I am worth to have you safe at home he answered hoarsely pressing her closer and closer to him O even in that moment of fearful peril
2943-171001-0013	train-other-500	when death seemed just at hand those words and the affectionate clasp of her father s arm sent a thrill of intense joy to the love famished heart of the little girl But destruction seemed inevitable Lora was leaning back half fainting with terror
2943-171001-0014	train-other-500	Adelaide scarcely less alarmed while Enna clung to her sobbing most bitterly Elsie alone preserved a cheerful serenity She had built her house upon the rock and knew that it would stand Her destiny was in her Heavenly Father s hands
2943-171001-0015	train-other-500	and she was content to leave it there Even death had no terrors
none	none	 to the simple unquestioning faith of the little child 
2943-171001-0016	train-other-500	who had put her trust in Jesus But they were not to perish thus for at that moment a powerful negro
none	none	 who was walking along the road hearing an unusual sound turned about caught sight of the vehicle coming toward him at such a rapid rate and instantly comprehending the peril of the travellers planted himself in the middle of the road and at the risk of life and limb caught the horses by the bridle 
2943-171001-0017	train-other-500	the sudden and unexpected check throwing them upon their haunches and bringing the carriage to an instant stand still Thank God we are saved That fellow shall be well rewarded for his brave deed exclaimed mister Dinsmore throwing open the carriage door
2943-171001-0018	train-other-500	Then leaping to the ground he lifted Elsie out set her down and gave his hand to his sisters one after the other They were almost at the entrance of the avenue and all preferred to walk the short distance to the house rather than again trust themselves to the horses
2943-171001-0019	train-other-500	mister Dinsmore lingered a moment to speak to the man who had done them such good service and to give some directions to the coachman and then taking the hand of his little girl who had been waiting for him he walked slowly on
none	none	 neither of them speaking a word until they reached the house when he stooped and kissed her cheek 
2943-171001-0020	train-other-500	asking very kindly if she had recovered from her fright Yes papa she answered in a quiet tone I knew that God would take care of us Oh wasn t He good to keep us all from being killed Yes he said very gravely
2943-171001-0021	train-other-500	Go now and let mammy get you ready for dinner As Elsie was sitting alone in her room that afternoon
none	none	 she was surprised by a visit from Lora it being very seldom that the elder girls cared to enter her apartment Lora looked a little pale and more grave and thoughtful than Elsie had ever seen her For a while she sat in silence then suddenly burst out Oh Elsie I can t help thinking all the time 
2943-171001-0022	train-other-500	what if we had been killed where would we all be now where would I have been I believe you would have gone straight to heaven Elsie but
none	none	 I oh I should have been with the rich man the minister read about this morning lifting up my eyes in torment And Lora covered her face with her hands and shuddered Presently she went on again I was terribly frightened and so were the rest all but you Elsie tell me do what kept you from being afraid 
2943-171001-0023	train-other-500	I was thinking said Elsie gently turning over the leaves of her little Bible as she spoke of this sweet verse Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me
none	none	 and oh Lora it made me so happy to think that Jesus was there with me and that if I were killed I should only fall asleep to wake up again in His arms then how could I be afraid Ah I would give anything to feel as you do said Lora sighing But tell me Elsie did you not feel afraid for the rest of us I m sure you must know that we are not Christians we don t even pretend to be Elsie blushed and looked down It all passed so quickly you know Lora almost in a moment she said 
2943-171001-0024	train-other-500	so that I only had time to think of papa and myself and I have prayed so much for him
none	none	 that I felt quite sure God would spare him until he should be prepared to die It was very selfish I know she added with deep humility but it was only for a moment and I can t tell you how thankful I was for all our spared lives 
2943-171001-0025	train-other-500	Don t look so as if you had done something very wicked Elsie
none	none	 replied Lora sighing again I m sure we have given you little enough reason to care whatever becomes of us 
2943-171001-0026	train-other-500	but oh Elsie if you can only tell me how to be a Christian I mean now to try very hard indeed I am determined never to rest until I am one Oh Lora how glad I am cried Elsie joyfully
2943-171001-0027	train-other-500	for I know that if you are really in earnest you will succeed
none	none	 for no one ever yet failed who tried aright Jesus said Every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened Is not that encouraging And listen to what God says here in this verse Ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me with all your heart So you see dear Lora if you will only seek the Lord with your whole heart you may be sure quite sure of finding Him Yes said Lora but you have not answered my question how am I to seek 
2943-171001-0028	train-other-500	that is what means am I to use to get rid of my sins and get a new heart how make myself pleasing in the sight of God what must I do to be saved
none	none	 That is the very question the jailer put to Paul 
2943-171001-0029	train-other-500	and he answered Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved
none	none	 replied Elsie quickly turning to the chapter and pointing out the text with her finger that Lora might see that she had quoted it correctly 
2943-171001-0030	train-other-500	And in answer to your other question How shall I get rid of my sins see here In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanliness That is in Zechariah
2943-171001-0031	train-other-500	then John tells us what that fountain is when he says The blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin and again Unto Him that loved us and washed us from our sins in His own blood
none	none	 Yes Elsie but what must I do asked Lora eagerly Do Lora only believe replied Elsie in the same earnest tone Jesus has done and suffered all that is necessary 
2943-171001-0032	train-other-500	and now we have nothing at all to do but go to Him and be washed in that fountain believe Him when He says I give unto them eternal life just accept the gift and trust and love Him that is the whole of it
2943-171001-0033	train-other-500	and it is so simple that even such a little girl as I can understand it But surely Elsie I can I must do something Yes God tells us to repent and He says Give me thine heart you can do that
2943-171001-0034	train-other-500	you can love Jesus at least He will enable you to if you ask Him and He will teach you to be sorry for your sins the Bible says He is exalted to give repentance and remission of sins and if you ask Him He will give them to you
2943-171001-0035	train-other-500	It is true we cannot do anything good of ourselves without the help of the Holy Spirit we can do nothing right because we are so very wicked but then we can always get that help if we ask for it Jesus said
2943-171001-0036	train-other-500	Your Heavenly Father is more willing to give His Holy Spirit to them that ask Him than parents are to give good gifts unto their children Oh Lora don t be afraid to ask for it don t be afraid to come to Jesus for He says
none	none	 Him that cometh unto Me I will in nowise cast out 
2943-171001-0037	train-other-500	and He is such a precious Saviour so kind and loving But remember that you must come very humbly feeling that you are a great sinner and not worthy to be heard and only hoping to be forgiven because Jesus died The Bible says
2943-171001-0038	train-other-500	God resisteth the proud but giveth grace unto the humble
none	none	 Lora lingered the greater part of the afternoon in Elsie s room asking her questions or listening to her while she read the Scriptures or repeated some beautiful hymn or spoke in her sweet childish way of her own peace and joy in believing in Jesus But at last Lora went to her own room and Elsie had another quiet half hour to herself before the tea bell again called the family together 
2943-171001-0039	train-other-500	Elsie answered the summons with a light heart a heart that thrilled with a new and strange sense of happiness as she remembered her father s evident anxiety for her safety during their perilous ride recalling each word and look
2943-171001-0040	train-other-500	and feeling again in imagination the clasp of his arm about her waist Ah surely papa does love me she murmured to herself over and over again and when he met her at the table with a kind smile
none	none	 and laying his hand caressingly on her head asked in an affectionate tone 
2943-171001-0041	train-other-500	How does my little daughter do this evening her cheeks flushed and her eyes grew bright with happiness and she longed to throw her arms around his neck and tell him how very very much she loved him But that was quite impossible at the table and before all the family
2943-171001-0042	train-other-500	so she merely raised her glad eyes to his face and answered I am very well thank you papa But after all this occurrence produced but little change in Elsie s condition her father treated her a little more affectionately for a day or two
2943-171001-0043	train-other-500	and then gradually returned to his ordinary stern cold manner indeed before the week was out she was again in sad disgrace She was walking alone in the garden one afternoon when her attention was attracted by a slight fluttering noise
2943-171001-0044	train-other-500	which seemed to proceed from an arbor near by and on hastily turning in to ascertain the cause she found a tiny and beautiful humming bird confined under a glass vase in its struggles to escape it was fluttering and beating against the walls of its prison
none	none	 thus producing the sound the little girl had heard in passing Elsie was very tender hearted and could never see any living creature in distress without feeling a strong desire to relieve its sufferings She knew that Arthur was in the habit of torturing every little insect and bird that came in his way 
2943-171001-0045	train-other-500	and had often drawn his persecutions upon herself by interfering in behalf of the poor victim and now the thought instantly flashed upon her that this was some of his work and that he would return ere long to carry out his cruel purposes
none	none	 Then at once arose the desire to release the little prisoner and save it further suffering and without waiting to reflect a moment she raised the glass and the bird was gone 
2943-171001-0046	train-other-500	Then she began to think with a little tremor how angry Arthur would be but it was too late to think of that now and after all she did not stand in very great dread of the consequences especially as she felt nearly sure of her father s approval of what she had done
2943-171001-0047	train-other-500	having several times heard him reprove Arthur for his cruel practices Not caring to meet Arthur then however she hastily retreated to the house where she seated herself in the veranda with a book It was a very warm afternoon
none	none	 and that being on the east side of the house and well protected by trees shrubbery and vines was as cool a spot as could be found on the place 
2943-171001-0048	train-other-500	Arthur Walter and Enna sat on the floor playing jack stones a favorite game with them
none	none	 and Louise was stretched full length on a settee buried in the latest novel 
2943-171001-0049	train-other-500	Hush she said as Walter gave a sudden shout at a successful toss Enna had just made can t you be quiet
none	none	 Mamma is taking her afternoon nap and you will disturb her and besides I cannot read in such a noise 
2943-171001-0050	train-other-500	Elsie wondered why Arthur did not go to see after his bird but soon forgot all about it in the interest with which she was poring over the story of the Swiss Family Robinson The jack stone players were just finishing their game
2943-171001-0051	train-other-500	when they were all startled by the sudden appearance of mister Horace Dinsmore upon the scene
none	none	 asking in a tone of great wrath 
2943-171001-0052	train-other-500	who had been down in the garden and liberated the humming bird he had been at such pains to catch because it was one of a rare species
none	none	 and he was anxious to add it to his collection of curiosities Elsie was terribly frightened and would have been glad at that moment to sink through the floor she dropped her book in her lap and clasping her hands over her beating heart 
2943-171001-0053	train-other-500	grew pale and red by turns while she seemed choking with the vain effort to speak and acknowledge herself the culprit as conscience told her she ought But her father was not looking at her his eye was fixed on Arthur
2943-171001-0054	train-other-500	I presume it was you sir he said very angrily and if so you may prepare yourself for either a flogging or a return to your prison for one or the other I am determined you shall have I didn t do it any such thing replied the boy fiercely
2943-171001-0055	train-other-500	Of course you will deny it said his brother but we all know that your word is good for nothing Papa
none	none	 said a trembling little voice 
2943-171001-0056	train-other-500	Arthur did not do it it was I
none	none	 You exclaimed her father in a tone of mingled anger and astonishment 
2943-171001-0057	train-other-500	as he turned his flashing eye upon her
none	none	 you Elsie can it be possible that this is your doing 
2943-171001-0058	train-other-500	Elsie s book fell on the floor and covering her face with both hands she burst into sobs and tears Come here to me this instant he said seating himself on the settee from which Louise had risen on his entrance
2943-171001-0059	train-other-500	Come here and tell me what you mean by meddling with my affairs in this way Please papa please don t be so very angry with me
none	none	 sobbed the little girl as she rose and came forward in obedience to his command I didn t know it was your bird and I didn t mean to be naughty No you never mean to be naughty according to your own account he said your badness is all accident but nevertheless I find you a very troublesome mischievous child 
2943-171001-0060	train-other-500	it was only the other day you broke a valuable vase he forgot in his anger how little she had really been to blame for that and now you have caused me the loss of a rare specimen which I had spent a great deal of time and effort in procuring
2943-171001-0061	train-other-500	Really Elsie I am sorely tempted to administer a very severe punishment Elsie caught at the arm of the settee for support Tell me what you did it for was it pure love of mischief asked her father sternly taking hold of her arm and holding her up by it
2943-171001-0062	train-other-500	No papa she answered almost under her breath I was sorry for the little bird I thought Arthur had put it there to torture it and so I let it go
none	none	 I did not mean to do wrong papa indeed I did not 
2943-171001-0063	train-other-500	and the tears fell faster and faster Indeed said he you had no business to meddle with it let who would have put it there Which hand did it This one papa sobbed the child indicating her right hand He took it in his and held it a moment
none	none	 while the little girl stood tremblingly awaiting what was to come next He looked at the downcast tearful face the bosom heaving with sobs and then at the little trembling hand he held so soft and white and tender and the sternness of his countenance relaxed somewhat it seemed next to impossible to inflict pain upon anything so tender and helpless 
2943-171001-0064	train-other-500	and for a moment he was half inclined to kiss and forgive her But no he had been very much irritated at his loss and the remembrance of it again aroused his anger and well nigh extinguished the little spark of love and compassion
none	none	 that had burned for a moment in his heart 
2943-171001-0065	train-other-500	She should be punished though he would not inflict physical pain See Elsie laughed Louise maliciously
none	none	 he is feeling in his pocket for his knife I suspect he intends to cut your hand off Elsie started and the tearful eyes were raised to her father s face with a look half of terrified entreaty half of confidence that such could not be his intention 
2943-171001-0066	train-other-500	Hush Louise exclaimed her brother sternly you know you are not speaking truly and that I would as soon think of cutting off my own hand as my child s You should never speak anything but truth especially to children
none	none	 I think it is well enough to frighten them a little sometimes and I thought that was what you were going to do replied Louise looking somewhat mortified at the rebuke 
2943-171001-0067	train-other-500	No said her brother that is a very bad plan and one which I shall never adopt Elsie will learn in time if she does not know it now that I never utter a threat which I do not intend to carry out and never break my word He had drawn a handkerchief from his pocket while speaking
2943-171001-0068	train-other-500	I shall tie this hand up Elsie he said proceeding to do so those who do not use their hands aright must be deprived of the use of them There let me see if that will keep it out of mischief I shall tie you up hand and foot before long if you continue such mischievous pranks
none	none	 Now go to your room and stay there until tea time Elsie felt deeply bitterly disgraced and humiliated as she turned to obey and it needed not Arthur s triumphant chuckle nor the smirk of satisfaction on Enna s face to add to the keen suffering of her wounded spirit this slight punishment was more to her than a severe chastisement would have been to many another child for the very knowledge of her father s displeasure was enough at any time to cause great pain to her sensitive spirit and gentle loving heart 
2943-171001-0069	train-other-500	Walter who was far more tender hearted than either his brother or sister felt touched by the sight of her distress and ran after her to say Never mind Elsie I am ever so sorry for you and I don t think you were the least bit naughty She thanked him with a grateful look
none	none	 and a faint attempt to smile through her tears 
2943-171001-0070	train-other-500	then hurried on to her room where she seated herself in a chair by the window and laying her arms upon the sill rested her head upon them and while the bitter tears fell fast from her eyes she murmured half aloud
none	none	 Oh why am I always so naughty always doing something to displease my dear papa how I wish I could be good and make him love me I am afraid he never will if I vex him so often 
2943-171001-0071	train-other-500	Then an earnest importunate prayer for help to do right and wisdom to understand how to gain her father s love went up from the almost despairing little heart to Him whose ear is ever open unto the cry of His suffering children
2943-171001-0072	train-other-500	And thus between weeping mourning and praying an hour passed slowly away and the tea bell rang Elsie started up but sat down again feeling that she would much rather do without her supper
none	none	 than show her tear swollen eyes and tied up hand at the table But she was not to be left to her choice in the matter for presently there came a messenger bringing a peremptory command from her father to come down immediately to her supper Did you not hear the bell he asked in his sternest tone as she tremblingly took her seat at his side 
2943-171001-0073	train-other-500	Yes sir she answered in a low tremulous tone Very well then remember that you are always to come down the moment the bell rings unless you are directed otherwise or are sick and the next time you are so late I shall send you away without your meal
2943-171001-0074	train-other-500	I don t want any supper papa she said humbly Hush he replied severely I will have no pouting or sulking you must just eat your supper and behave yourself
none	none	 Stop this crying at once he added in an undertone as he spread some preserves on a piece of bread and laid it on her plate 
2943-171001-0075	train-other-500	or I shall take you away from the table and if I do you will be very sorry
none	none	 He watched her a moment while she made a violent effort to choke back her tears 
2943-171001-0076	train-other-500	What is your hand tied up for Elsie asked her grandfather have you been hurt Elsie s face flushed painfully but she made no reply
none	none	 You must speak when you are spoken to said her father answer your grandfather s question at once 
2943-171001-0077	train-other-500	Papa tied it up
none	none	 because I was naughty replied the little girl vainly striving to suppress a sob 
2943-171001-0078	train-other-500	Her father made a movement as if about to lead her from the table O papa don t she cried in terror I will be good Let me have no more crying then said he this is shameful behavior for a girl eight years old
2943-171001-0079	train-other-500	it would be bad enough in a child of Enna s age He took out his handkerchief and wiped her eyes Now said he begin to eat your supper at once and don t let me have to reprove you again Elsie tried to obey but it seemed very difficult
none	none	 indeed almost impossible while she knew that her father was watching her closely and felt that everybody else was looking at her and thinking What a naughty little girl you are Oh thought the poor child if papa would only quit looking at me and the rest would forget all about me and eat their suppers 
2943-171001-0080	train-other-500	maybe I could keep from crying Then she sent up a silent prayer for help struggling hard to keep back the tears and sobs that were almost suffocating her and taking up her slice of bread tried to eat
none	none	 She was very thankful to her Aunt Adelaide for addressing a question to her papa just at that moment thus taking his attention from her and then adroitly setting them all to talking until the little girl had had time to recover her composure at least in a measure May I go to my room now papa 
2943-171001-0081	train-other-500	asked the timid little voice as they rose from the table No he said taking her hand and leading her out to the veranda where he settled himself in an easy chair and lighted a cigar Bring me that book that lies yonder on the settee he commanded She brought it
2943-171001-0082	train-other-500	Now said he bring that stool and set yourself down here close at my knee and let me see if I can keep you out of mischief for an hour or two May I get a book to read papa she asked timidly No said he shortly
none	none	 You may just do what I bid you and nothing more nor less She sat down as he directed with her face turned toward him and tried to amuse herself with her own thoughts and watching the expression of his countenance as he read on and on turning leaf after leaf too much interested in his book to take any further notice of her How handsome my papa is thought the little girl gazing with affectionate admiration into his face And then she sighed and tears trembled in her eyes again 
2943-171001-0083	train-other-500	She admired her father and loved him oh so dearly as she often whispered to herself but would she ever meet with anything like a return of her fond affection There was an aching void in her heart which nothing else could fill
2943-171001-0084	train-other-500	must it always be thus was her craving for affection never to be satisfied O papa my own papa will you never love me mourned the sad little heart Ah if I could only be good always perhaps he would
none	none	 but I am so often naughty whenever he begins to be kind I am sure to do something to vex him 
2943-171001-0085	train-other-500	and then it is all over Oh I wish I could be good I will try very very hard Ah if I might climb on his knee now and lay my head on his breast and put my arms round his neck and tell him how sorry I am that I have been naughty
2943-171001-0086	train-other-500	and made him lose his bird and how much oh how much I love him But I know I never could tell him that I don t know how to express it no words could I am sure And if he would forgive me and kiss me and call me his dear little daughter
none	none	 Oh will he ever call me that Or if I might only stand beside him and lay my head on his shoulder and he would put his arm around me it would make me so happy An exclamation from Enna caused Elsie to turn her head and suddenly springing to her feet she exclaimed in an eager excited way 
2943-171001-0087	train-other-500	Papa there is a carriage coming up the avenue it must be visitors please please papa let me go to my room Why he asked coolly looking up from his book why do you wish to go
2943-171001-0088	train-other-500	Because I don t want to see them papa she said hanging her head and blushing deeply I don t want them to see me You are not usually afraid of visitors he replied in the same cool tone But they will see that my hand is tied up
2943-171001-0089	train-other-500	and they will ask what is the matter O papa do please do let me go quickly before they get here she pleaded in an agony of shame and haste No said he
none	none	 I shall not let you go 
2943-171001-0090	train-other-500	if it were only to punish you for getting off the seat where I bade you stay without permission You will have to learn that I am to be obeyed at all times and under all circumstances Sit down and don t dare to move again until I give you leave Elsie sat down without another word
2943-171001-0091	train-other-500	but two bitter scalding tears rolled quickly down her burning cheeks You needn t cry Elsie said her father
none	none	 it is only an old gentleman who comes to see your grandfather on business and who as he never notices children will not be at all likely to ask any questions I hope you will learn some day Elsie to save your tears until there is really some occasion for them The old gentleman had alighted while mister Dinsmore was speaking Elsie saw that he was alone 
2943-171001-0092	train-other-500	and the relief was so great that for once she scarcely heeded her father s rebuke Another half hour passed and mister Dinsmore still sat reading taking no notice of Elsie who afraid to speak or move was growing very weary and sleepy
2943-171001-0093	train-other-500	She longed to lay her head on her father s knee but dared not venture to take such a liberty but at length she was so completely overpowered by sleep as to do so unconsciously The sound of his voice pronouncing her name aroused her
2943-171001-0094	train-other-500	You are tired and sleepy said he if you would like to go to bed you may do so Thank you papa she replied rising to her feet
none	none	 Well he said seeing her hesitate speak if you have anything to say I am very sorry I was naughty papa Will you please forgive me The words were spoken very low and almost with a sob Will you try not to meddle in future and not to cry at the table or pout and sulk when you are punished 
2943-171001-0095	train-other-500	he asked in a cold grave tone Yes sir I will try to be a good girl always said the humble little voice Then I will forgive you he replied taking the handkerchief off her hand Still Elsie lingered
2943-171001-0096	train-other-500	She felt as if she could not go without some little token of forgiveness and love some slight caress He looked at her with an impatient Well Then in answer to her mute request
none	none	 No he said I will not kiss you to night you have been entirely too naughty Go to your room at once Aunt Chloe was absolutely frightened by the violence of her child s grief as she rushed into the room and flung herself into her arms weeping and sobbing most vehemently What s de matter darlin she asked in great alarm O mammy mammy sobbed the child papa wouldn t kiss me he said I was too naughty O mammy will he ever love me now CHAPTER SEVENTH The smallest worm will turn being trodden on SHAKESPEARE Richard III A blossom full of promise is life s joy That never comes to fruit Hope for a time Suns the young flow ret in its gladsome light And it looks flourishing a little while Tis pass d we know not whither but tis gone MISS LANDON It was Miss Day s custom to present to the parents of her pupils a monthly report of their conduct and recitations The regular time for this had occurred once since mister Horace Dinsmore s return when she of course handed Elsie s to him It was very satisfactory for Elsie was a most diligent scholar carrying her religious principles into that as well as everything else and disposed as Miss Day was to find fault with her she could seldom see any excuse for so doing in either her conduct or recitations mister Dinsmore glanced over the report and handed it back saying It is all very good very satisfactory indeed I am glad to see that she is industrious and well behaved for I wish her to grow up an intelligent and amiable woman Elsie who was standing near heard the words and they sent a glow of pleasure to her cheeks She looked up eagerly but her father turned and walked away without taking any notice of her and the glow of happiness faded and the soft eyes filled with tears of wounded feeling It was now time for a second report but alas the past month had been a most unfortunate one for the little girl the weather was very warm and she had felt languid and weak and so much were her thoughts occupied with the longing desire to gain her father s love so depressed were her spirits by her constant failure to do so that she often found it impossible to give her mind to her lessons Arthur too during much of the time before and since the week of his imprisonment had been more than usually annoying shaking her chair and jogging her elbow so frequently when she was writing that her copy book presented by no means so good an appearance as usual and never had Miss Day made out so poor a report for her She carried it with much secret satisfaction to the little girl s father and entered a long complaint of the child s idleness and inattention Send her to me he said angrily She will find me in my own room Miss Day had left Elsie in the school room putting her desk in order after the day s work and she found her still there on her return Elsie said she with a malicious smile your father wishes to see you immediately He is in his room The child turned red and pale by turns and trembled so violently that for a moment she was quite unable to move for she guessed from Miss Day s countenance what was probably in store for her I advise you to go at once said that lady for no doubt the longer you wait the worse it will be for you At the same moment mister Dinsmore s voice was heard calling in a stern angry tone Elsie Making a violent effort to control her feelings she started up and hastened to obey The door of his room stood open and she walked in asking in a trembling voice Did you call me papa Yes said he I did Come here to me He was sitting with the copy book and report in his hand and there was much severity in both tone and look as he addressed her She obeyed instantly but trembling violently and with a face pale as death and eyes filled with tears She lifted them pleadingly to his face and touched by her evident terror and distress he said in a tone somewhat less stern Can you tell me Elsie how it happens that your teacher brings me so bad a report of your conduct and lessons during the past month She says you have been very idle and the report tells the same story and this copy book presents a shameful appearance The child answered only by tears and sobs They seemed to irritate him Elsie he said sternly when I ask a question I require an answer and that instantly O papa she answered pleadingly I couldn t study I m very sorry I ll try to do better only don t be very angry with me dear papa I am angry with you very angry indeed said he in the same severe tone and very strongly inclined to punish you You couldn t study eh What reason can you assign pray Were you not well I don t know sir sobbed the little girl You don t know Very well then I think you could not be very ill without knowing it and so you seem to have no excuse at all to offer However I will not inflict any punishment upon you this time as you seem to be really sorry and have promised to do better but beware how you let me see such a report as this or hear such complaints of idleness again unless you wish to be severely punished and I warn you that unless your next copy book presents a better appearance than this I certainly shall punish you There are a number of pages here that look quite well he continued turning over the leaves that shows what you can do if you choose now there is an old saying A bird that can sing and won t sing must be made to sing Hush as Elsie seemed about to speak not a word You may go now And throwing himself back in his easy chair he took up a newspaper and began to read Yet Elsie lingered her heart so yearned for one word or look of sympathy and love she so longed to throw herself into his arms and tell him how dearly how very dearly she loved him she did so hunger and thirst for one fond caress ah how could she go away without it now when for the very first time she found herself alone with him in his own room where she had never ventured before but where she had often been in her brightest dreams And so she lingered trembling hoping fearing but presently he looked up with a cold Why do you stand there I gave you permission to go go at once And with a sinking heart she turned away and sought the solitude of her own room there to weep and mourn and pray that she might one day possess the love she so pined for and bitterly to reproach herself for having by the failures of the past month put it farther from her And soon a thought came to her which added greatly to her distress If Arthur continued his persecutions how could she make the next copy book more presentable and in case it were not her father had said positively that he would punish her and oh how could she bear punishment from him when a word or look of displeasure almost broke her heart Miss Day seldom remained in the school room during the whole of the writing hour and sometimes the older girls were also absent so that Arthur had ample opportunity to indulge his mischievous propensities for Elsie was above the meanness of telling tales and had she not been Arthur was so great a favorite with his mother that she would have brought a great deal of trouble upon herself by so doing She therefore saw no escape from the dreaded punishment unless she could persuade the perverse boy to cease his annoyances and of that there was little hope But she carried her trouble to her Heavenly Father and asked Him to help her She was still on her knees pouring out her sobs and prayers when some one knocked at the door She rose and opened it to find her Aunt Adelaide standing there Elsie she said I am writing to Miss Rose have you any word to send You may write a little note if you choose and I will enclose it in my letter But what is the matter child she suddenly exclaimed kindly taking the little girl s hand in hers With many tears and sobs Elsie told her the whole story not omitting her papa s threat and her fear that she could not on account of Arthur s persecutions avoid incurring the punishment Adelaide s sympathies were enlisted and she drew the sobbing child to her side saying as she pressed a kiss on her cheek Never mind Elsie I will take my book or needle work to the school room every day and sit there during the writing hour But why don t you tell your papa about it Because I don t like to tell tales Aunt Adelaide and it would make your mamma so angry with me and besides I can t tell papa anything Ah I understand and no wonder he is strangely stern to the poor child I mean to give him a good talking to murmured Adelaide more as if thinking aloud than talking to Elsie Then kissing the little girl again she rose hastily and left the room with the intention of seeking her brother but he had gone out and when he returned he brought several gentlemen with him and she had no opportunity until the desire to interfere in the matter had passed from her mind And it shall come to pass that before they call I will answer and while they are yet speaking I will hear The promise had been fulfilled to Elsie and help had been sent her in her trouble When her Aunt Adelaide left her Elsie first carefully locking the door to guard against a surprise visit from Enna went to her bureau and unlocking a drawer took out a purse she was knitting for her father to replace the one she had given to Miss Allison She had commenced it before his return and having spent upon it nearly every spare moment since when she could feel secure from intrusion she now had it nearly completed Ah many a silent tear had fallen as she worked and many a sigh over disappointed hopes had been woven into its bright meshes of gold and blue But now she had been much comforted and encouraged by her aunt s sympathy and kind promise of assistance and though there were still traces of tears upon it the little face looked quite bright and cheerful again as she settled herself in her little sewing chair and began her work The small white fingers moved right briskly the bright shining needles glancing in and out while the thoughts quite as busy ran on something in this fashion Ah I am so sorry I have done so badly the past month no wonder papa was vexed with me I don t believe I ever had such a bad report before What has come over me It seems as if I can t study and must have a holiday I wonder if it is all laziness I m afraid it is and that I ought to be punished I wish I could shake it off and feel industrious as I used to I will try very hard to do better this month and perhaps I can It is only one month and then June will be over and Miss Day is going North to spend July and August and maybe September and so we shall have a long holiday Surely I can stand it one month more it will soon be over though it does seem a long time and besides this month we are not to study so many hours because it is so warm and there s to be no school on Saturdays none to morrow so that I can finish this Ah I wonder if papa will be pleased and she sighed deeply I m afraid it will be a long long time before he will be pleased with me again I have displeased him twice this week first about the bird and now this bad report and that shameful copy book But oh I will try so hard next month and dear Aunt Adelaide will keep Arthur from troubling me and I m determined my copy book shall look neat and not have a single blot in it I wonder how I shall spend the vacation Last summer I had such a delightful visit at Ashlands and then they were here all the rest of the time It was then poor Herbert had such a dreadful time with his hip Ah how thankful I ought to be that I am not lame and have always been so healthy But I m afraid papa won t let me go there this summer nor ask them to visit me because he said he thought Lucy was not a suitable companion for me I was very naughty when she was here and I ve been naughty a great many times since Oh dear shall I never never learn to be good It seems to me I am naughty now much oftener than I used to be before papa came home I m afraid he will soon begin to punish me severely as he threatened to day I wonder what he means A crimson tide suddenly swept over the fair face and neck and dropping her work she covered her face with her hands Oh he couldn t couldn t mean that how could I ever bear it and yet if it would make me really good I think I wouldn t mind the pain but the shame and disgrace oh it would break my heart I could never hold up my head again Oh can he mean that But I must just try to be so very good that I will never deserve punishment and then it will make no difference to me what he means And with this consolatory reflection she took up her work again Mammy is papa in his room asked Elsie the next afternoon as she put the finishing touches to her work No darlin Marster Horace he rode out wid de strange gentlemen more than an hour ago Elsie laid her needles away in her work basket and opening her writing desk selected a bit of note paper on which she wrote in her very best hand A present for my dear papa from his little daughter Elsie This she carefully pinned to the purse and then carried it to her papa s room intending to leave it on his toilet table Fearing that he might possibly have returned she knocked gently at the door but receiving no answer opened it and went in but she had not gone more than half way across the room when she heard his voice behind her asking in a tone of mingled surprise and displeasure What are you doing here in my room in my absence Elsie She started and turned round pale and trembling and lifting her eyes pleadingly to his face silently placed the purse in his hand He looked first at it and then at her I made it for you dear papa she said in a low tremulous tone do please take it It is really very pretty he said examining it is it possible it is your work I had no idea you had so much taste and skill Thank you daughter I shall take it and use it with a great deal of pleasure He took her hand as he spoke and sitting down lifted her to his knee saying Elsie my child why do you always seem so afraid of me I don t like it With a sudden impulse she threw her arms round his neck and pressed her lips to his cheek then dropping her head on his breast she sobbed O papa dear papa I do love you so very dearly will you not love me O papa love me a little I know I ve been naughty very often but I will try to be good Then for the first time he folded her in his arms and kissed her tenderly saying in a moved tone I do love you my darling my own little daughter Oh the words were sweeter to Elsie s ear than the most delicious music her joy was too great for words for anything but tears Why do you cry so my darling he asked soothingly stroking her hair and kissing her again and again O papa because I am so happy so very happy she sobbed Do you indeed care so very much for my love he asked then my daughter you must not tremble and turn pale whenever I speak to you as though I were a cruel tyrant O papa I cannot help it when you look and speak so sternly I love you so dearly I cannot bear to have you angry with me but I am not afraid of you now That is right he said caressing her again But there is the tea bell he added setting her down Go into the dressing room there and bathe your eyes and then come to me She hastened to do his bidding and then taking her hand he led her down and seated her in her usual place by his side There were visitors and all his conversation was addressed to them and the older members of the family but he now and then bestowed a kind look upon his little girl and attended carefully to all her wants and Elsie was very happy Everything now went on very pleasantly with our little friend for some days she did not see a great deal of her father as he was frequently away from home for a day or two and when he returned generally brought a number of visitors with him but whenever he did notice her it was very kindly and she was gradually overcoming her fear of him and constantly hoping that the time would soon come when he would have more leisure to bestow upon her She was happy now and with a mind at ease was able to learn her lessons well and as her Aunt Adelaide faithfully kept her promise and thus freed her from Arthur s annoyances she was enabled to do justice to her writing She took great pains her copy book showed a marked improvement in her penmanship and its pages had not yet been defaced by a single blot so that she was looking forward with pleasing anticipations to the time when her report should again be presented to her father But alas one unfortunate morning it happened that Miss Day was in a very bad humor indeed peevish fretful irritable and unreasonable to the last degree and as usual Elsie was the principal sufferer from her ill humor She found fault with everything the little girl did scolded her shook her refused to explain the manner of working out a very difficult example or to permit her to apply to any one else for assistance and then punished her because it was done wrong and when the child could no longer keep back her tears called her a baby for crying and a dunce for not understanding her arithmetic better All this Elsie bore meekly and patiently not answering a word but her meekness seemed only to provoke the governess the more and finally when Elsie came to recite her last lesson she took pains to put her questions in the most perplexing form and scarcely allowing the child an instant to begin her reply answered them herself then throwing down the book scolded her vehemently for her bad lesson and marked it in her report as a complete failure Poor Elsie could bear no more but bursting into tears and sobs said Miss Day I did know my lesson every word of it if you had asked the questions as usual or had given me time to answer I say that you did not know it that it was a complete failure replied Miss Day angrily and you shall just sit down and learn it every word over I do know it if you will hear me right said Elsie indignantly and it is very unjust in you to mark it a failure Impudence exclaimed Miss Day furiously how dare you contradict me I shall take you to your father And seizing her by the arm she dragged her across the room and opening the door pushed her into the passage Oh don t Miss Day pleaded the little girl turning toward her pale and tearful don t tell papa I will so just walk along with you was the angry rejoinder as she pushed her before her to mister Dinsmore s door It stood open and he sat at his desk writing What is the matter he asked looking up as they appeared before the door Elsie has been very impertinent sir said Miss Day she not only accused me of injustice but contradicted me flatly Is it possible said he frowning angrily Come here to me Elsie and tell me is it true that you contradicted your teacher Yes papa sobbed the child Very well then I shall certainly punish you for I will never allow anything of the kind As he spoke he picked up a small ruler that lay before him at the same time taking Elsie s hand as though he meant to use it on her O papa she cried in a tone of agonized entreaty But he laid it down again saying No I shall punish you by depriving you of your play this afternoon and giving you only bread and water for your dinner Sit down there he added pointing to a stool Then with a wave of his hand to the governess I think she will not be guilty of the like again Miss Day The governess left the room and Elsie sat down on her stool crying and sobbing violently while her father went on with his writing Elsie he said presently cease that noise I have had quite enough of it She struggled to suppress her sobs but it was almost impossible and she felt it a great relief when a moment later the dinner bell rang and her father left the room In a few moments a servant came in carrying on a small waiter a tumbler of water and a plate with a slice of bread on it Dis am drefful poor fare Miss Elsie he said setting it down beside her but Massa Horace he say it all you can hab but if you say so dis chile tell ole Phoebe to send up somethin better fore Massa Horace gits through his dinner Oh no thank you Pompey you re very kind but I would not disobey or deceive papa replied the little girl earnestly and I am not at all hungry He lingered a moment seeming loath to leave her to dine upon such fare You had better go now Pompey she said gently I am afraid you will be wanted He turned and left the room muttering something about disagreeable good for nothing Miss Day Elsie felt no disposition to eat and when her father returned half an hour afterward the bread and water were still untouched What is the meaning of this he asked in a stern angry tone why have you not eaten what I sent you I am not hungry papa she said humbly Don t tell me that he replied it is nothing but stubbornness and I shall not allow you to show such a temper Take up that bread this moment and eat it You shall eat every crumb of the bread and drink every drop of the water She obeyed him instantly breaking off a bit of bread and putting it in her mouth while he stood watching her with an air of stern cold determination but when she attempted to swallow it seemed utterly impossible I cannot papa she said it chokes me You must he replied I am going to be obeyed Take a drink of water and that will wash it down It was a hard task but seeing that there was no escape she struggled to obey and at length every crumb of bread and drop of water had disappeared Now Elsie said her father in a tone of great severity never dare to show me such a temper as this again you will not escape so easily next time remember I am to be obeyed always and when I send you anything to eat you are to eat it It had not been temper at all and his unjust severity almost broke her heart but she could not say one word in her own defence He looked at her a moment as she sat there trembling and weeping then saying I forbid you to leave this room without my permission don t venture to disobey me Elsie sit where you are until I return he turned to go Papa she asked pleadingly may I have my books to learn my lessons for to morrow Certainly he said I will send a servant with them And my Bible too please papa Yes yes he answered impatiently as he went out and shut the door Jim was just bringing up Elsie s horse as mister Dinsmore passed through the hall and he stepped out to order it back to the stable saying that Miss Elsie was not going to ride What is the trouble with Elsie asked his sister Adelaide as he returned to the drawing room and seated himself beside her She has been impertinent to her governess and I have confined her to my room for the rest of the day he replied rather shortly Are you sure Horace that Elsie was so much to blame asked his sister speaking in a tone too low to reach any ear but his I am certain from what Lora tells me that Miss Day is often cruelly unjust to her more so than to any other of her pupils He looked at her with a good deal of surprise Are you not mistaken he asked No it is a positive fact that she does at times really abuse her Indeed I shall certainly not allow that he said coloring with anger But in this instance Adelaide he added thoughtfully I think you must be mistaken for Elsie acknowledged that she had been impertinent I did not condemn her unheard stern and severe as you think me If she was Horace believe me it must have been only after great provocation and her acknowledgment of it is no proof at all to my mind for Elsie is so humble she would think she must have been guilty of impertinence if Miss Day accused her of it Surely not Adelaide she is by no means wanting in sense he replied in a tone of incredulity not unmixed with annoyance Then he sat thinking a moment half inclined to go to his child and inquire more particularly into the circumstances but soon relinquished the idea saying to himself No if she does not choose to be frank with me and say what she can in her own defence she deserves to suffer and besides she showed such stubbornness about eating that bread He was very proud and did not like to acknowledge even to himself that he had punished his child unjustly much less to her and it was not until near tea time that he returned to his room entering so softly that Elsie did not hear him She was sitting just where he had left her bending over her Bible an expression of sadness and deep humility on the sweet little face so young and fair and innocent She did not seem aware of his presence until he was close beside her when looking up with a start she said in a voice full of tears Dear papa I am very sorry for all my naughtiness will you please forgive me Yes he said certainly I will if you are really sorry and stooping he kissed her coldly saying Now go to your room and let Chloe dress you for tea She rose at once gathered up her books and went out The little heart was very sad for her father s manner was so cold she feared he would never love her again And she was particularly distressed by the bad mark given her for recitation that day because she knew the time was now drawing very near when her report must be handed in to her papa and the delight with which she had hitherto looked forward to receiving his well merited approbation was now changed to fear and dread of his displeasure yet she knew she had not deserved the bad mark and again and again she determined that she would tell her father all about it but his manner had now become so cold and stern that she could not summon up courage to do so but put it off from day to day until it was too late CHAPTER EIGHTH He that pursues an act that is attended With doubtful issues for the means had need Of policy and force to make it speed T NABB s Unfortunate Mother Joy never feasts so high As when the first course is of misery 
3319-171003-0000	train-other-500	SUCKLING s Aglaura It was Friday and the next morning was the when the reports were to be presented School had closed and all but Elsie had already left the room
none	none	 but she was carefully arranging the books writing and drawing materials et cetera in her desk 
3319-171003-0001	train-other-500	for she was very neat and orderly in her habits When she had quite finished her work she took up her report book and glanced over it As her eye rested for an instant upon the one bad mark she sighed a little and murmured to herself I am so sorry
3319-171003-0002	train-other-500	I wish papa knew how little I really deserved it I don t know why I never can get the courage to tell him Then laying it aside she opened her copy book and turned over the leaves with unalloyed pleasure for not one of its pages was defaced by a single blot
3319-171003-0003	train-other-500	and from beginning to end it gave evidence of painstaking carefulness and decided improvement Ah surely this will please dear papa she exclaimed half aloud How good Aunt Adelaide was to sit here with me
3319-171003-0004	train-other-500	Then putting it carefully in its place she closed and locked the desk
none	none	 and carrying the key to her room laid it on the mantel where she was in the habit of keeping it 
3319-171003-0005	train-other-500	Now it so happened that afternoon that Arthur who had made himself sick by over indulgence in sweetmeats and had in consequence been lounging about the house doing nothing for the last day or two remained at home while all the rest of the family were out walking riding or visiting
3319-171003-0006	train-other-500	He was not usually very fond of reading
none	none	 but while lying on the lounge in the nursery very much in want of some amusement 
3319-171003-0007	train-other-500	it suddenly occurred to him that he would like to look at a book he had seen Elsie reading that morning To be sure the book belonged to her and she was not there to be consulted as to her willingness to lend it but that made no difference to Arthur who had very little respect for the rights of property
3319-171003-0008	train-other-500	excepting where his own were concerned Elsie he knew was out and Chloe in the kitchen so feeling certain there would be no one to interfere with him he went directly to the little girl s room to look for the book He soon found it lying on the mantel but the desk key lay right beside it
3319-171003-0009	train-other-500	and as he caught sight of that he gave a half scream of delight for he guessed at once to what lock it belonged and felt that he now could accomplish the revenge he had plotted ever since the affair of the watch He put out his hand to take it
3319-171003-0010	train-other-500	but drew it back again and stood for a moment balancing in his mind the chances of detection He could deface Elsie s copy book but Adelaide could testify to the little girl s carefulness and the neatness of her work up to that very day for she had been in the school room that morning during the writing hour
3319-171003-0011	train-other-500	But then Adelaide had just left home to pay a visit to a friend living at some distance
none	none	 and would not return for several weeks so there was little danger from that quarter 
3319-171003-0012	train-other-500	Miss Day to be sure knew the appearance of Elsie s book quite as well but there was still less danger of her interference
none	none	 and he was pretty certain no one else knew 
3319-171003-0013	train-other-500	So he decided to run the risk and laying down the book he took the key went to the door looked carefully up and down the hall to make sure of not being seen by any of the servants and having satisfied himself on that point hurried to the school room unlocked Elsie s desk took out her copy book
none	none	 and dipping a pen in the ink 
3319-171003-0014	train-other-500	proceeded deliberately to blot nearly every page in it on some he made a large blot on others a small one and on some two or three and also scribbled between the lines and on the margin so as completely to deface poor Elsie s work
3319-171003-0015	train-other-500	But to do Arthur justice though he knew his brother would be pretty sure to be very angry with Elsie he did not know of the threatened punishment He stopped once or twice as he thought he heard a footstep and shut down the lid until it had passed when he raised it again and went on with his wicked work
3319-171003-0016	train-other-500	It did not take long however and he soon replaced the copy book in the precise spot in which he had found it wiped the pen and put it carefully back in its place relocked the desk hurried back to Elsie s room put the key just where he had found it and taking the book
3319-171003-0017	train-other-500	returned to the nursery without having met any one He threw himself down on a couch and tried to read but in vain he could not fix his attention upon the page
none	none	 could think of nothing but the mischief he had done 
3319-171003-0018	train-other-500	and its probable consequences and now when it was too late he more than half repented yet as to confessing and thus saving Elsie from unmerited blame he did not for a single moment entertain the thought
3319-171003-0019	train-other-500	But at length it suddenly occurred to him that if it became known that he had been into Elsie s room to get the book he might be suspected and he started up with the intention of replacing it But he found that it was too late she had already returned for he heard her voice in the hall
3319-171003-0020	train-other-500	so he lay down again and kept the book until she came in search of it He looked very guilty as the little girl came in but not seeming to notice it she merely said I am looking for my book I thought perhaps some one might have brought it in here Oh you have it Arthur
3319-171003-0021	train-other-500	well keep it if you wish I can read it just as well another time Here take it said he roughly pushing it toward her
none	none	 I don t want it tisn t a bit pretty I think it is very interesting and you are quite welcome to read it if you wish she answered mildly 
3319-171003-0022	train-other-500	but if you don t care to I will take it Young ladies and gentlemen said the governess as they were about closing their exercises the next morning this is the regular day for the reports and they are all made out
none	none	 Miss Elsie here is yours bring your copy book and carry both to your papa 
3319-171003-0023	train-other-500	Elsie obeyed not without some trembling yet hoping as there was but one bad mark in the report and the copy book showed such evident marks of care and painstaking her papa would not be very seriously displeased
3319-171003-0024	train-other-500	It being the last day of the term the exercises of the morning had varied somewhat from the usual routine and the writing hour had been entirely omitted thus it happened that Elsie had not opened her copy book and was in consequence still in ignorance of its sadly altered appearance
3319-171003-0025	train-other-500	She found her father in his room He took the report first from her hand and glancing over it said with a slight frown I see you have one very bad mark for recitation but as there is only one and the others are remarkably good I will excuse it
3319-171003-0026	train-other-500	Then taking the copy book and opening it much to Elsie s surprise and alarm he gave her a glance of great displeasure turned rapidly over the leaves then laying it down said in his sternest tones I see I shall have to keep my promise Elsie
3319-171003-0027	train-other-500	What papa she asked turning pale with terror What said he do you ask me what Did I not tell you positively that I would punish you if your copy book this month did not present a better appearance than it did last O papa does it not
none	none	 I tried so very hard and there are no blots in it 
3319-171003-0028	train-other-500	No blots said he what do you call these and he turned over the leaves again holding the book so that she could see them and showing that almost every one was blotted in several places Elsie gazed at them in unfeigned astonishment
3319-171003-0029	train-other-500	then looking up into his face she said earnestly but fearfully Papa I did not do it Who did then he asked Indeed papa I do not know she replied I must inquire into this business he said rising
3319-171003-0030	train-other-500	and if it is not your fault you shall not be punished but if I find you have been telling me a falsehood Elsie I shall punish you much more severely than if you had not denied your fault And taking her by the hand as he spoke he led her back to the school room Miss Day said he showing the book
3319-171003-0031	train-other-500	Elsie says these blots are not her work can you tell me whose they are Miss Elsie generally tells the truth sir replied Miss Day sarcastically but I must say that in this instance I think she has failed as her desk has a good lock and she herself keeps the key
none	none	 Elsie he asked 
3319-171003-0032	train-other-500	turning to her is this so Yes papa And have you ever left your desk unlocked or the key lying about No papa I am quite certain I have not she answered unhesitatingly though her voice trembled and she grey very pale
3319-171003-0033	train-other-500	Very well then I am quite certain you have told me a falsehood since it is evident this must have been your work Elsie I can forgive anything but falsehood but that I never will forgive Come with me I shall teach you to speak the truth to me at least if to no one else
3319-171003-0034	train-other-500	and taking her hand again he led or rather dragged her from the room for he was terribly angry his face fairly pale with passion Lora came in while he was speaking and certain that Elsie would never be caught in a falsehood her eye quickly sought Arthur s desk
none	none	 He was sitting there with a very guilty countenance 
3319-171003-0035	train-other-500	She hastily crossed the room and speaking in a low tone said Arthur you have had a hand in this business I very well know now confess it quickly or Horace will half kill Elsie You don t know anything about it said he doggedly
3319-171003-0036	train-other-500	Yes I do she answered and if you do not speak out at once I shall save Elsie and find means to prove your guilt afterwards
none	none	 so you had much better confess Go away he exclaimed angrily I have nothing to confess 
3319-171003-0037	train-other-500	Seeing it was useless to try to move him Lora turned away and hurried to Horace s room which in her haste she entered without knocking he having fortunately neglected to fasten the door She was just in time he had a small riding whip in his hand
3319-171003-0038	train-other-500	and Elsie stood beside him pale as death too much frightened even to cry and trembling so that she could scarcely stand He turned an angry glance on his sister as she entered but taking no notice of it she exclaimed eagerly Horace
3319-171003-0039	train-other-500	don t punish Elsie for I am certain she is innocent He laid down the whip asking How do you know it what proof have you I shall be very glad to be convinced he added his countenance relaxing somewhat in its stern and angry expression
3319-171003-0040	train-other-500	In the first place replied his sister there is Elsie s established character for truthfulness in all the time she has been with us we have ever found her perfectly truthful in word and deed And then Horace what motive could she have had for spoiling her book
3319-171003-0041	train-other-500	knowing as she did that certain punishment would follow Besides
none	none	 I am sure Arthur is at the bottom of this 
3319-171003-0042	train-other-500	for though he will not acknowledge he does not deny it Ah yes and now I recollect
none	none	 I saw and examined Elsie s book only yesterday 
3319-171003-0043	train-other-500	and it was then quite free from blots A great change had come over her brother s countenance while she was speaking Thank you Lora he said cordially as soon as she had done you have quite convinced me and saved me from punishing Elsie as unjustly as severely
3319-171003-0044	train-other-500	That last assurance I consider quite sufficient of itself to establish her innocence Lora turned and went out feeling very happy and as she closed the door Elsie s papa took her in his arms saying in loving tender tones My poor little daughter my own darling child
3319-171003-0045	train-other-500	I have been cruelly unjust to you have I not Dear papa you thought I deserved it she said with a burst of tears and sobs throwing her arms around his neck and laying her head on his breast
3319-171003-0046	train-other-500	Do you love me Elsie dearest he asked folding her closer to his heart
none	none	 Ah so very very much better 
3319-171003-0047	train-other-500	than all the world beside O papa if you would only love me The last word was almost a sob I do my darling my own precious child he said caressing her again and again I do love my little girl
none	none	 although I may at times seem cold and stern 
3319-171003-0048	train-other-500	and I am more thankful than words can express that I have been saved from punishing her unjustly
none	none	 I could never forgive myself if I had done it I would rather have lost half I am worth ah I fear it would have turned all her love for me into hatred and justly too No papa oh no no nothing could ever 
3319-171003-0049	train-other-500	do that and the little arms were clasped closer and closer about his neck and the tears again fell like rain as she timidly pressed her quivering lips to his cheek There there daughter don t cry any more we will try to forget all about it and talk of something else
3319-171003-0050	train-other-500	he said soothingly Elsie dear your Aunt Adelaide thinks perhaps you were not so very much to blame the other day and now I want you to tell me all the circumstances for though I should be very sorry to encourage you to find fault with your teacher
3319-171003-0051	train-other-500	I am by no means willing to have you abused Please papa don t ask me she begged Aunt Lora was there and she will tell you about it No Elsie he said very decidedly I want the story from you and remember
3319-171003-0052	train-other-500	I want every word that passed between you and Miss Day as far as you can possibly recall it Seeing that he was determined Elsie obeyed him though with evident reluctance
none	none	 and striving to put Miss Day s conduct in as favorable a light as consistent with truth 
3319-171003-0053	train-other-500	while she by no means extenuated her own yet her father listened with feelings of strong indignation Elsie he said when she had done
none	none	 if I had known all this at the time I should not have punished you at all 
3319-171003-0054	train-other-500	Why did you not tell me my daughter
none	none	 how you have been ill treated and provoked O papa I could not you know you did not ask me 
3319-171003-0055	train-other-500	I did ask you if it was true that you contradicted her did I not Yes papa and it was true You ought to have told me the whole story though but I see how it was I frightened you by my sternness
3319-171003-0056	train-other-500	Well daughter he added kissing her tenderly I shall endeavor to be less stern in future
none	none	 and you must try to be less timid and more at your ease with me 
3319-171003-0057	train-other-500	I will papa she replied meekly but indeed I cannot help feeling frightened when you are angry with me
none	none	 mister Dinsmore sat there a long time with his little daughter on his knee 
3319-171003-0058	train-other-500	caressing her more tenderly than ever before and Elsie was very happy and talked more freely to him than she had ever done telling him of her joys and her sorrows how dearly she had loved Miss Allison what happy hours they had spent together in studying the Bible and in prayer
3319-171003-0059	train-other-500	how grieved she was when her friend went away
none	none	 and how intensely she enjoyed the little letter now and then received from her 
3319-171003-0060	train-other-500	and he listened to it all apparently both pleased and interested encouraging her to go on by an occasional question or a word of assent or approval What is this Elsie he asked taking hold of the chain she always wore around her neck
3319-171003-0061	train-other-500	and drawing the miniature from her bosom But as he touched the spring the case flew open revealing the sweet girlish face it needed not Elsie s low murmured Mamma to tell him who that lovely lady was
3319-171003-0062	train-other-500	He gazed upon it with emotion carried back in memory to the time when for a few short months she had been his own most cherished treasure Then looking from it to his child he murmured Yes she is very like the same features
3319-171003-0063	train-other-500	the same expression complexion
none	none	 hair and all will be the very counterpart of her if she lives 
3319-171003-0064	train-other-500	Dear papa am I like mamma asked Elsie who had caught a part of his words Yes darling very much indeed and I hope you will grow more so You loved mamma she said inquiringly Dearly very dearly
3319-171003-0065	train-other-500	O papa tell me about her do dear papa she pleaded eagerly I have not much to tell he said sighing I knew her only for a few short months ere we were torn asunder never to meet again on earth
3319-171003-0066	train-other-500	But we may hope to meet her in heaven dear papa said Elsie softly for she loved Jesus and if we love Him we shall go there too when we die Do you love Jesus papa she timidly inquired for she had seen him do a number of things which she knew to be wrong
3319-171003-0067	train-other-500	such as riding out for pleasure on the Sabbath reading secular newspapers and engaging in worldly conversation and she greatly feared he did not But instead of answering her question he asked Do you Elsie Oh yes sir
none	none	 very very much even better than I love you my own dear papa 
3319-171003-0068	train-other-500	How do you know he asked looking keenly into her face Just as I know that I love you papa or any one else she replied lifting her eyes to his face in evident surprise at the strangeness of the question
3319-171003-0069	train-other-500	Ah papa she added in her own sweet simple way I do so love to talk of Jesus to tell Him all my troubles and ask Him to forgive my sins and make me holy and then it is so sweet to know that He loves me and will always love me
3319-171003-0070	train-other-500	even if no one else does He kissed her very gravely and set her down saying Go now my daughter and prepare for dinner it is almost time for the bell You are not displeased papa she inquired looking up anxiously into his face
3319-171003-0071	train-other-500	No darling not at all he replied stroking her hair Shall I ride with my little girl this afternoon Oh papa do you really mean it I shall be so glad she exclaimed joyfully Very well then he said
3319-171003-0072	train-other-500	it is settled But go now there is the bell No stay he added quickly as she turned to obey
none	none	 think a moment and tell me where you put the key of your desk yesterday 
3319-171003-0073	train-other-500	for it must have been then the mischief was done Had you it with you when you rode out Suddenly Elsie s face flushed and she exclaimed Eagerly
none	none	 Ah I remember now I left it on the mantelpiece papa and 
3319-171003-0074	train-other-500	But here she paused as if sorry she had said so much And what he asked I think I had better not say it papa
none	none	 I m afraid I ought not 
3319-171003-0075	train-other-500	for I don t really know anything and it seems so wrong to suspect people You need not express any suspicions said her father I do not wish you to do so
none	none	 but I must insist upon having all the facts you can furnish me with Was Aunt Chloe in your room all the time you were away No sir she told me she went down to the kitchen directly after I left 
3319-171003-0076	train-other-500	and did not come up again until after I returned Very well
none	none	 do you know whether any one else entered the room during your absence 
3319-171003-0077	train-other-500	I do not know papa but I think Arthur must have been in because when I came home I found him reading a book which I had left lying on the mantel piece she answered in a low reluctant tone Ah ha
none	none	 that is just it I see it all now he exclaimed 
3319-171003-0078	train-other-500	with a satisfied nod There that will do Elsie go now and make haste down to your dinner But Elsie lingered and in answer to a look of kind inquiry from her father said coaxingly Please papa
3319-171003-0079	train-other-500	don t be very angry with him I think he did not know how much I cared about my book You are very forgiving Elsie but go child
none	none	 I shall not abuse him 
3319-171003-0080	train-other-500	mister Dinsmore answered with an imperative gesture and the little girl hurried from the room It happened that just at this time the elder mister Dinsmore and his wife were paying a visit to some friends in the city and thus Elsie s papa had been left head of the house for the time
3319-171003-0081	train-other-500	Arthur knowing this to be the state of affairs
none	none	 and that though his father was expected to return that evening his mother would be absent for some days 
3319-171003-0082	train-other-500	was beginning to be a good deal fearful of the consequences of his misconduct and not without reason for his brother s wrath was now fully aroused and he was determined that the boy should not on this occasion escape the penalty of his misdeeds
3319-171003-0083	train-other-500	Arthur was already in the dining room when mister Dinsmore came down
none	none	 Arthur said he I wish you to step into the library a moment I have something to say to you I don t want to hear it 
3319-171003-0084	train-other-500	muttered the boy with a dogged look and standing perfectly still I dare say not sir but that makes no difference replied his brother Walk into the library at once Arthur returned a scowl of defiance muttering almost under his breath I ll do as I please about that
3319-171003-0085	train-other-500	but cowed by his brother s determined look and manner he slowly and reluctantly obeyed Now sir said mister Dinsmore when he had him fairly in the room and had closed the door behind them I wish to know how you came to meddle with Elsie s copy book
3319-171003-0086	train-other-500	I didn t was the angry rejoinder Take care sir I know all about it said mister Dinsmore in a warning tone it is useless for you to deny it Yesterday while Elsie was out and Aunt Chloe in the kitchen you went to her room
3319-171003-0087	train-other-500	took the key of her desk from the mantel piece where she had left it went to the school room and did the mischief hoping to get her into trouble thereby and then relocking the desk and returning the key to its proper place thought you had escaped detection
3319-171003-0088	train-other-500	and I was very near giving my poor innocent little girl the whipping you so richly deserve Arthur looked up in astonishment Who told you he asked nobody saw me then catching himself said hastily I tell you I didn t do it I don t know anything about it
3319-171003-0089	train-other-500	Will you dare to tell me such a falsehood as that again exclaimed mister Dinsmore angrily taking him by the collar and shaking him roughly
none	none	 Let me alone now whined the culprit I want my dinner I say 
3319-171003-0090	train-other-500	You ll get no dinner to day I can tell you replied his brother I am going to lock you into your bedroom and keep you there until your father comes home and then if he doesn t give you the flogging you deserve I will for I intend you shall have your deserts for once in your life
3319-171003-0091	train-other-500	I know that all this is in revenge for Elsie s forced testimony in the affair of the watch and I gave you fair warning then that I would see to it that any attempt to abuse my child should receive its just reward He took the boy by the arm as he spoke to lead him from the room
3319-171003-0092	train-other-500	At first Arthur seemed disposed to resist but soon seeing how useless it was to contend against such odds he resigned himself to his fate saying sullenly You wouldn t treat me this way if mamma was at home She is not however as it happens
3319-171003-0093	train-other-500	though I can tell you that even she could not save you now replied his brother as he opened the bedroom door and pushing him in locked it upon him and put the key in his pocket
none	none	 mister Horace Dinsmore had almost unbounded influence over his father who was very proud of him the old gentleman also utterly despised everything mean and underhanded and upon being made acquainted by Horace with Arthur s misdemeanors he inflicted upon him as severe a punishment as any one could have desired CHAPTER NINTH Keep the Sabbath day to sanctify it as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee Deut v twelve She is mine own And I as rich in having such a jewel As twenty seas if all their sand were pearl The water nectar and the rocks pure gold SHAKESPEARE Two Gentlemen of Verona And now happy days had come to the little Elsie Her father treated her with the tenderest affection and kept her with him almost constantly seeming scarcely willing to have her out of his sight for an hour He took her with him wherever he went in his rides and walks and visits to the neighboring planters She was much admired for her beauty and sweetness of disposition much caressed and flattered but through it all lost none of her native modesty but was ever the same meek gentle little girl She felt grateful for all the kindness she received and liked to visit with her papa but her happiest days were spent at home on those rare occasions when they were free from visitors and she could sit for hours on his knee or by his side talking or reading to him or working at her embroidery or knitting and listening while he read He helped her with all her studies taught her something of botany and geology in their walks helped her to see and correct the faults of her drawings sang with her when she played bought her quantities of new music and engaged the best masters to instruct her in short took a lively interest in all her pursuits and pleasures gave her every indulgence and lavished upon her the tenderest caresses He was very proud of her beauty her sweetness her intelligence and talent and nothing pleased him better than to hear them spoken of by others in terms of praise And Elsie was very happy the soft eyes grew bright with happiness and the little face lost its pensive expression and became as round rosy and merry as Enna s Miss Day went North expecting to be absent several months and Elsie s papa took her traveling spending some time at different watering places It was her first journey since she had been old enough to care for such things and she enjoyed it exceedingly They left home in July and did not return until September so that the little girl had time to rest and recruit both mentally and physically and was ready to begin her studies again with zeal and energy yet it was so pleasant to be her papa s constant companion and she had so enjoyed her freedom from the restraints of the school room that she was not at all sorry to learn on their arrival at Roselands that the governess would still be absent for some weeks How bright and happy the child looks was Adelaide s remark on the day of their return as from the opposite side of the room she watched the speaking countenance of the little girl who was giving Enna and the boys an animated description of her journey Yes said Lora and how entirely she seems to have overcome her fear of her father for at that instant Elsie suddenly left the little group and running to him leaned confidingly on his knee while apparently urging some request which he answered with a smile and a nod of acquiescence when she left the room and presently returned carrying a richly bound book of engravings Yes Elsie had lost her fear of her father and could now talk to him and tell him her feelings and wishes as freely as ever Enna did and no wonder for in all these weeks he had never given her one harsh word or look but indeed he had had no occasion to do so for she was always docile and obedient It was Sabbath afternoon the first Sabbath after their return and Elsie was in her own room alone with the books she loved best her Bible hymnbook and Pilgrim s Progress She had spent a very happy hour in self examination reading and prayer and was singing to herself in a low tone her favorite hymn I lay my sins on Jesus while turning over the leaves of her Bible to find the story of Elijah which she had promised to read to Chloe that afternoon when a child s footsteps were heard coming down the hall the handle of the door was turned hastily and then as it refused to yield Enna s voice called out in a fretful imperious tone Open this door Elsie Dinsmore I want in I say Elsie sighed as she thought There is an end to my nice afternoon but she rose at once and quickly crossing the room opened the door asking pleasantly What do you want Enna I told you I wanted to come in replied Enna saucily and now you ve got to tell me a story to amuse me mamma says so because you know I ve got a cold and she won t let me go out Well Enna said Elsie patiently I am going to read a very beautiful story to mammy and you are quite welcome to sit here and listen I sha n t have it read I said you were to tell it I don t like to hear reading replied Enna in her imperious way at the same time taking quiet possession of Elsie s little rosewood rocking chair a late present from her papa and highly prized by the little girl on that account and beginning to scratch with her thumb nail upon the arm Oh don t scratch my pretty new chair Enna Elsie entreated it is papa s present and I wouldn t have it spoiled for a great deal I will who cares for your old chair was the reply in a scornful tone as she gave another and harder dig with her nail You re a little old maid so particular with all your things that s what mamma says you are Now tell me that story I will tell you a story if you will stop scratching my chair Enna said Elsie almost with tears in her eyes I will tell you about Elijah on Mount Carmel or Beishazzar s feast or the children in the fiery furnace or I sha n t hear any of those I don t want any of your old Bible stories interrupted Enna insolently You must tell me that pretty fairy tale Herbert Carrington is so fond of No Enna I cannot tell you that to day replied Elsie speaking gently but very firmly I say you shall screamed Enna springing to her feet I ll just go and tell mamma and she ll make you do it Stay Enna said Elsie catching her hand to detain her I will tell you any story I know that is suitable for the Sabbath but I cannot tell the fairy tale to day because you know it would be wrong I will tell it to you to morrow though if you will wait You re a bad girl and I ll just tell mamma of you exclaimed Enna passionately jerking her hand away and darting from the room Oh if papa was only at home sighed Elsie sinking into her rocking chair pale and trembling but she knew that he had gone out riding and would probably not return for some time he had invited her to accompany him but she had begged to be allowed to stay at home and he had let her have her wish As she feared she was immediately summoned to missus Dinsmore s presence Elsie said that lady severely are you not ashamed of yourself to refuse Enna such a small favor especially when the poor child is not well I must say you are the most selfish disobliging child I ever saw I offered to tell her a Bible story or anything suitable for the Sabbath day replied Elsie meekly but I cannot tell the fairy tale because it would be wrong Nonsense there s no harm at all in telling fairy tales to day any more than any other day that is just an excuse Elsie said missus Dinsmore angrily I don t want her old Bible stories I won t have them I want that pretty fairy tale sobbed Enna passionately make her tell it mamma Come come what is all this fuss about asked the elder mister Dinsmore coming in from an adjoining room Nothing said his wife except that Enna is not well enough to go out and wants a fairy story to pass away the time which Elsie alone is acquainted with but is too lazy or too self willed to relate He turned angrily to his little granddaughter Ah indeed is that it Well there is an old saying A bird that can sing and won t sing must be made to sing Elsie was opening her lips to speak but missus Dinsmore bade her be silent and then went on She pretends it is all on account of conscientious scruples It isn t fit for the Sabbath she says Now I say it is a great piece of impertinence for a child of her years to set up her opinion against yours and mine and I know very well it is nothing but an excuse because she doesn t choose to be obliging Of course it is nothing in the world but an excuse responded mister Dinsmore hotly Elsie s face flushed and she answered a little indignantly No grandpa indeed it is not merely an excuse but Do you dare to contradict me you impertinent little hussy cried the old gentleman interrupting her in the middle of her sentence and catching her by the arm he shook her violently then picking her up and setting her down hard upon a chair he said Now miss sit you there until your father comes home then we will see what he thinks of such impertinence and if he doesn t give you the complete whipping you deserve I miss my guess Please grandpa I Hold your tongue don t dare to speak another word until your father comes home said he threateningly If you don t choose to say what you re wanted to you shall not talk at all Then going to the door he called a servant and bade him tell mister Horace as soon as he returned that he wished to see him For the next half hour and a very long one it seemed to her Elsie sat there wishing for and yet dreading her father s coming Would he inflict upon her the punishment which her grandfather evidently wished her to receive without pausing to inquire into the merits of the case or would he listen patiently to her story And even if he did might he not still think her deserving of punishment She could not answer these questions to her own satisfaction A few months ago she would have been certain of a very severe chastisement and even now she trembled with fear for though she knew beyond a doubt that he loved her dearly she knew also that he was a strict and severe disciplinarian and never excused her faults At last her ear caught the sound of his step in the hall and her heart beat fast and faster as it drew nearer until he entered and addressing his father asked Did you wish to see me sir Yes Horace I want you to attend to this girl replied the old gentleman with a motion of the head toward Elsie She has been very impertinent to me What Elsie impertinent is it possible I certainly expected better things of her His tone expressed great surprise and turning to his little daughter he regarded her with a grave sad look that brought the tears to her eyes dearly as she loved him it seemed almost harder to bear than the old expression of stern severity It is hard to believe he said that my little Elsie would be guilty of such conduct but if she has been of course she must be punished for I cannot allow anything of the kind Go Elsie to my dressing room and remain there until I come to you Papa she began bursting into tears Hush he said with something of the old sternness not a word but obey me instantly Then as Elsie went sobbing from the room he seated himself and turning to his father said Now sir if you please I should like to hear the whole story precisely what Elsie has done and said and what was the provocation for that must also be taken into the account in order that I may be able to do her justice If you do her justice you will whip her well remarked his father in a tone of asperity Horace colored violently for nothing aroused his ire sooner than any interference between him and his child but controlling himself he replied quite calmly If I find her deserving of punishment I will not spare her but I should be sorry indeed to punish her unjustly Will you be so good as to tell me what she has done mister Dinsmore referred him to his wife for the commencement of the trouble and she made out as bad a case against Elsie as possible but even then there seemed to her father to be very little to condemn and when missus Dinsmore was obliged to acknowledge that it was Elsie s refusal to humor Enna in her desire for a particular story which Elsie thought it not best to relate on the Sabbath he bit his lip with vexation and told her in a haughty tone that though he did not approve of Elsie s strict notions regarding such matters yet he wished her to understand that his daughter was not to be made a slave to Enna s whims If she chose to tell her a story or to do anything else for her amusement he had no objection but she was never to be forced to do it against her inclination and Enna must understand that it was done as a favor and not at all as her right You are right enough there Horace remarked his father but that does not excuse Elsie for her impertinence to me In the first place I must say I agree with my wife in thinking it quite a piece of impertinence for a child of her years to set up her opinion against mine and besides she contradicted me flatly He then went on to repeat what he had said and Elsie s denial of the charge using her exact words but quite a different tone and suppressing the fact that he had interrupted her before she had finished her sentence Elsie s tone though slightly indignant had still been respectful but from her grandfather s rehearsal of the scene her father received the impression that she had been exceedingly saucy and he left the room with the intention of giving her almost as severe a punishment as her grandfather would have prescribed On the way up to his room however his anger had a little time to cool and it occurred to him that it would be no more than just to hear her side of the story ere he condemned her Elsie was seated on a couch at the far side of the room and as he entered she turned on him a tearful pleading look that went straight to his heart His face was grave and sad but there was very little sternness in it as he sat down and took her in his arms For a moment he held her without speaking while she lifted her eyes timidly to his face Then he said as he gently stroked the hair back from her forehead I am very sorry very sorry indeed to hear so bad an account of my little daughter I am afraid I shall have to punish her and I don t like to do it She answered not a word but burst into tears and hiding her face on his breast sobbed aloud I will not condemn you unheard Elsie he said after a moment s pause tell me how you came to be so impertinent to your grandfather I did not mean to be saucy papa indeed I did not she sobbed Stop crying then daughter he said kindly and tell me all about it I know there was some trouble between you and Enna and I want you to tell me all that occurred and every word spoken by either of you as well as all that passed between missus Dinsmore your grandfather and yourself I am very glad that I can trust my little girl to speak the truth I am quite sure she would not tell a falsehood even to save herself from punishment he added tenderly Thank you dear papa for saying that said Elsie raising her head and almost smiling through her tears I will try to tell it just as it happened She then told her story simply and truthfully repeating as he bade her every word that had passed between Enna and herself and between her and her grandparents Her words to her grandfather sounded very different repeated in her quiet respectful tones and when she added that if he would have allowed her she was going on to explain that it was not any unwillingness to oblige Enna but the fear of doing wrong that led her to refuse her request her father thought that after all she deserved very little blame Do you think I was very saucy papa she asked anxiously when she had finished her story So much depends upon the tone Elsie he said that I can hardly tell if you used the same tone in speaking to your grandpa that you did in repeating your words to me just now I don t think it was very impertinent though the words themselves were not as respectful as they ought to have been You must always treat my father quite as respectfully as you do me and I think with him too that there is something quite impertinent in a little girl like you setting up her opinion against that of her elders You must never try it with me my daughter Elsie hung down her head in silence for a moment then asked in a tremulous tone Are you going to punish me papa Yes he said but first I am going to take you down stairs and make you beg your grandfather s pardon I see you don t want to do it he added looking keenly into her face but you must and I hope I shall not be obliged to enforce obedience to my commands I will do whatever you bid me papa she sobbed but I did not mean to be saucy Please papa tell me what to say You must say Grandpa I did not intend to be impertinent to you and I am very sorry for whatever may have seemed saucy in my words or tones will you please to forgive me and I will try always to be perfectly respectful in future You can say all that with truth I think Yes papa I am sorry and I do intend to be respectful to grandpa always she answered brushing away her tears and putting her hand in his He then led her into her grandfather s presence saying Elsie has come to beg your pardon sir That is as it should be replied the old gentleman glancing triumphantly at his wife I told her you would not uphold her in any such impertinence No said his son with some displeasure in his tone I will neither uphold her in wrongdoing nor suffer her to be imposed upon Speak my daughter and say what I bade you Elsie sobbed out the required words Yes I must forgive you of course replied her grandfather coldly but I hope your father is not going to let you off without proper punishment I will attend to that I certainly intend to punish her as she deserves said his son laying a marked emphasis upon the concluding words of his sentence Elsie wholly misunderstood him and so trembled with fear as he led her from the room that she could scarcely walk seeing which he took her in his arms and carried her up stairs she sobbing on his shoulder He did not speak until he had locked the door carried her across the room and seated himself upon the couch again with her upon his knee Then he said in a soothing tone as he wiped away her tears and kissed her kindly You need not tremble so my daughter I am not going to be severe with you She looked up in glad surprise I said I would punish you as you deserve he said with a smile and I intend to keep you shut up here with me until bed time I shall not allow you to go down stairs to tea and besides I am going to give you a long lesson to learn which I shall require you to recite to me quite perfectly before you can go to bed Elsie grew frightened again at the mention of the lesson for she feared it might be something which she could not conscientiously study on the Sabbath but all her fear and trouble vanished as she saw her father take up a Bible that lay on the table and turn over the leaves as though selecting a passage Presently he put it into her hands and pointing to the thirteenth and fourteenth chapters of John s Gospel bade her carry the book to a low seat by the window and sit there until she had learned them perfectly O papa what a nice lesson she exclaimed looking up delightedly into his face but it won t be any punishment because I love these chapters dearly and have read them so often that I almost know every word already Hush hush he said pretending to be very stern don t tell me that my punishments are no punishments I don t allow you to talk so just take the book and learn what I bid you and if you know those two already you may learn the next Elsie laughed kissed his hand and tripped away to her window while he threw himself down on the couch and took up a newspaper more as a screen to his face however than for the purpose of reading for he lay there closely watching his little daughter as she sat in the rich glow of the sunset with her sweet grave little face bending over the holy book The darling he murmured to himself she is lovely as an angel and she is mine mine only mine own precious one and loves me with her whole soul Ah how can I ever find it in my heart to be stern to her Ah if I were but half as good and pure as she is I should be a better man than I am And he heaved a deep sigh Half an hour had passed and still Elsie bent over her book The tea bell rang and mister Dinsmore started up and crossing the room bent down and stroked her hair Do you know it darling he asked Almost papa and she looked up into his face with a bright sweet smile full of affection With a sudden impulse he caught her in his arms and kissing her again and again said with emotion Elsie my darling I love you too well I could never bear to lose you You must love Jesus better my own precious papa she replied clasping her little arms around his neck and returning his caresses He held her a moment and then putting her down said I shall send you up some supper and I want you to eat it don t behave as you did about the bread and water once a good while ago Will it be bread and water this time papa she asked with a smile You will see he said laughingly and quitted the room Elsie turned to her book again but in a few moments was interrupted by the entrance of a servant carrying on a silver waiter a plate of hot buttered muffins a cup of jelly another of hot coffee and a piece of broiled chicken Elsie was all astonishment Why Pomp she asked did papa send it Yes Miss Elsie deed he did replied the servant with a grin of satisfaction as he set down his burden I reckon you been berry nice gal dis day or else Marster Horace tink you little bit sick Papa is very good and I am much obliged to you too Pomp said the little girl laying aside her book and seating herself before the waiter Jes ring de bell Miss Elsie ef you want more and dis chile fotch em up Marster Horace say so hisself And the grinning negro bowed himself out chuckling with delight for Elsie had always been a great favorite with him Dear papa Elsie said when he came in again and smilingly asked if she had eaten her prison fare what a good supper you sent me But I thought you didn t allow me such things Don t you know said he playfully laying his hand upon her head that I am absolute monarch of this small kingdom and you are not to question my doings or decrees Then in a more serious tone No daughter I do not allow it as a regular thing because I do not think it for your good but for once I thought it would not hurt you I know you are not one to presume upon favors and I wanted to indulge you a little because I fear my little girl has been made to suffer perhaps more than she quite deserved this afternoon His voice had a very tender tone as he uttered the concluding words and stooping he pressed his lips to her forehead Don t think though he added the next moment that I am excusing you for impertinence not at all but it was what you have had to suffer from Enna s insolence I shall put a stop to that for I will not have it I don t mind it much papa said Elsie gently I am quite used to it for Enna has always treated me so And why did I never hear of it before he asked half angrily It is abominable not to be endured he exclaimed and I shall see that Miss Enna is made to understand that my daughter is fully her equal in every respect and always to be treated as such He paused but Elsie half frightened at his vehemence made no reply and he went on I have no doubt your grandfather and his wife would have been better pleased had I forced you to yield to Enna s whim but I had no idea of such a thing you shall use your own pleasure whenever she is concerned but if I had bidden you to tell her that story it would have been a very different matter you need never set up your will or your opinion of right and wrong against mine Elsie for I shall not allow it I don t altogether like some of those strict notions you have got into your head and I give you fair warning that should they ever come into collision with my wishes and commands they will have to be given up But don t look so alarmed daughter I hope it may never happen and we will say no more about it to night he added kindly for she had grown very pale and trembled visibly O papa dear papa don t ever bid me do anything wrong it would break my heart she said laying her head on his shoulder as he sat down and drew her to his side I never intend to bid you do wrong but on the contrary wish you always to do right But then daughter I must be the judge of what is wrong or right for you you must remember that you are only a very little girl and not yet capable of judging for yourself and all you have to do is to obey your father without murmuring or hesitation and then there will be no trouble His tone though mild and not unkind was very firm and decided and Elsie s heart sank she seemed to feel herself in the shadow of some great trouble laid up in store for her in the future But she strove and ere long with success to banish the foreboding of evil which oppressed her and give herself up to the enjoyment of present blessings Her father loved her dearly she knew that and he was not now requiring her to do aught against her conscience and perhaps he never might he had said so himself and God could incline his heart to respect her scruples or if in His infinite wisdom He saw that the dreaded trial was needed He would give her strength to bear it for had He not promised As thy day so shall thy strength be Her father s arm was around her and she had been standing silently with her face hidden on his shoulder while these thoughts were passing through her mind and the little heart going up in prayer to God for him and for herself What is my little girl thinking of he asked presently A good many things papa she said raising her face now quite peaceful and happy again I was thinking of what you had just been saying to me and that I am so glad I know that you love me dearly and I was asking God to help us both to do His will and that I might always be able to do what you bid me without disobeying Him she added simply and then asked May I say my lesson now papa I think I know it quite perfectly Yes he said in an absent way bring me the book Elsie brought it and putting it into his hands drew up a stool and sat down at his feet resting her arm on his knee and looking up into his face then in her sweet low voice she repeated slowly and feelingly with true and beautiful emphasis the chapters he had given her to learn that most touching description of the Last Supper and our Saviour s farewell address to His sorrowing disciples Ah papa is it not beautiful she exclaimed laying her head upon his knee while the tears trembled in her eyes Is not that a sweet verse Having loved His own which were in the world He loved them unto the end It seems so strange that He could be so thoughtful for them so kind and loving when all the time He knew what a dreadful death He was just going to die and knew besides that they were all going to run away and leave Him alone with His cruel enemies Oh it is so sweet to know that Jesus is so loving and that He loves me and will always love me even to the end forever How do you know that Elsie he asked I know that He loves me papa because I love Him and He has said I love them that love me and I know that He will love me always because He has said I have loved thee with an everlasting love and in another place I will never leave thee nor forsake thee But do you think you are good enough daughter for Jesus to love you Ah papa I know I am not at all good I have a very wicked heart and often my thoughts and feelings are all wrong and Jesus knows all about it but it does not keep Him from loving me for you know it was sinners He died to save Ah papa how good and kind He was Who could help loving Him I used to feel so lonely and sad sometimes papa that I think my heart would have broken quite and I should have died if I had not had Jesus to love me When were you so sad and lonely darling he asked in a moved tone as he laid his hand gently on her head and stroked her hair caressingly Sometimes when you were away papa and I had never seen you but then I used to think of you and my heart would long and ache so to see you and hear you call me daughter and to lay my head against your breast and feel your arms folding me close to your heart as you do so often now She paused a moment and struggled hard to keep down the rising sobs as she added But when you came papa and I saw you did not love me oh papa that was the worst I thought I could never never bear it I thought my heart would break and I wanted to die and go to Jesus and to mamma The little frame shook with sobs My poor darling my poor little pet he said taking her in his arms again and caressing her with the greatest tenderness it was very hard very cruel I don t know how I could steel my heart so against my own little child but I had been very much prejudiced and led to suppose that you looked upon me with fear and dislike as a hated tyrant Elsie lifted her eyes to his face with a look of extreme surprise O papa she exclaimed how could you think that I have always loved you ever since I can remember When Elsie went to her room that evening she thought very seriously of all that had occurred during the afternoon and all that her papa had said to her and to her usual petitions was added a very fervent one that he might never bid her break any command of God or if he did that she might have strength given her according to her day A shadow had fallen on her pathway faint but perceptible a light fleecy cloud obscured the brightness of her sun yet it was not for some weeks that even the most distant mutterings of the coming storm could be heard CHAPTER TENTH If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath from doing thy pleasure on my holy day and call the Sabbath a Delight the Holy of the Lord Honorable and shalt honor him not doing thine own ways nor finding thine own pleasure nor speaking thine own words Isaiah Iviii thirteen Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God judge ye Acts iv nineteen Quite a number of guests had dined at Roselands They were nearly all gentlemen and were now collected in the drawing room laughing jesting talking politics and conversing with each other and the ladies upon various worldly topics apparently quite forgetful that it was the Lord s day which He has commanded to be kept holy in thought and word as well as deed May I ask what you are in search of mister Eversham inquired Adelaide as she noticed one of the guests glance around the room with a rather disappointed air Yes Miss Adelaide I was looking for little Miss Elsie Travilla has given me so very glowing an account of her precocious musical talent that I have conceived a great desire to hear her play and sing Do you hear that Horace asked Adelaide turning to her brother Yes and I shall be most happy to gratify you Eversham replied the young father with a proud smile He crossed the room to summon a servant but as he placed his hand upon the bell rope missus Dinsmore arrested his movement Stay Horace she said you had better not send for her May I be permitted to ask why madam he inquired in a tone of mingled surprise and annoyance Because she will not sing answered the lady coolly Pardon me madam but I think she will if I bid her to do it he said with flashing eyes No she will not persisted missus Dinsmore in the same cold quiet tone she will tell you she is wiser than her father and that it would be a sin to obey him in this Believe me she will most assuredly defy your authority so you had better take my advice and let her alone thus sparing yourself the mortification of exhibiting before your guests your inability to govern your child mister Dinsmore bit his lip with vexation Thank you he said haughtily but I prefer convincing you that that inability lies wholly in your own imagination and I am quite at a loss to understand upon what you found your opinion as Elsie has never yet made the very slightest resistance to my authority He had given the bell rope a vigorous pull while speaking and a servant now appearing in answer to the summons he sent him with a message to Elsie requiring her presence in the drawing room Then turning away from his step mother who looked after him with a gleam of triumph in her eye he joined the group of gentlemen already gathered about the piano where Adelaide had just taken her seat and begun a brilliant overture Yet outwardly calm and self satisfied as his demeanor may have been Horace Dinsmore was even now regretting the step he had just taken for remembering Elsie s conscientious scruples regarding the observance of the Sabbath which he had for the moment forgotten he foresaw that there would be a struggle probably a severe one and though having always found her docile and yielding he felt no doubt of the final result he would willingly have avoided the contest could he have done so without a sacrifice of pride but as he said to himself with a slight sigh he had now gone too far to retreat and then he had all along felt that this struggle must come some time and perhaps it was as well now as at any other Elsie was alone in her own room spending the Sabbath afternoon in her usual manner when the servant came to say that her papa wished to see her in the drawing room The little girl was a good deal alarmed at the summons for the thought instantly flashed upon her He is going to bid me play and sing or do something else which it is not right to do on the Sabbath day But remembering that he never had done so she hoped he might not now yet ere she obeyed the call she knelt down for a moment and prayed earnestly for strength to do right however difficult it might be Come here daughter her father said as she entered the room He spoke in his usual pleasant affectionate tone yet Elsie started trembled and turned pale for catching sight of the group at the piano and her Aunt Adelaide just vacating the music stool she at once perceived what was in store for her Here Elsie said her father selecting a song which she had learned during their absence and sang remarkably well I wish you to sing this for my friends they are anxious to hear it Will not to morrow do papa she asked in a low tremulous tone missus Dinsmore who had drawn near to listen now looked at Horace with a meaning smile which he affected not to see Certainly not Elsie he said we want it now You know it quite well enough without any more practice I did not want to wait for that reason papa she replied in the same low trembling tones but you know this is the holy Sabbath day Well my daughter and what of that I consider this song perfectly proper to be sung to day and that ought to satisfy you that you will not be doing wrong to sing it remember what I said to you some weeks ago and now sit down and sing it at once without any more ado O papa I cannot sing it to day please let me wait until to morrow Elsie he said in his sternest tones sit down to the piano instantly and do as I bid you and let me hear no more of this nonsense She sat down but raising her pleading eyes brimful of tears to his face she repeated her refusal Dear papa I cannot sing it to day I cannot break the Sabbath Elsie you must sing it said he placing the music before her I have told you that it will not be breaking the Sabbath and that is sufficient you must let me judge for you in these matters Let her wait until to morrow Dinsmore tomorrow will suit us quite as well urged several of the gentlemen while Adelaide good naturedly said Let me play it Horace I have no such scruples and presume I can do it nearly as well as Elsie No he replied when I give my child a command it is to be obeyed I have said she should play it and play it she must she is not to suppose that she may set up her opinion of right and wrong against mine Elsie sat with her little hands folded in her lap the tears streaming from her downcast eyes over her pale cheeks She was trembling but though there was no stubbornness in her countenance the expression meek and humble she made no movement toward obeying her father s order There was a moment of silent waiting then he said in his severest tone Elsie you shall sit there till you obey me though it should be until to morrow morning Yes papa she replied in a scarcely audible voice and they all turned away and left her You see now that you had better have taken my advice Horace remarked missus Dinsmore in a triumphant aside I knew very well how it would end Excuse me said he but it has not ended and ere it does I think she will learn that she has a stronger will than her own to deal with Elsie s position was a most uncomfortable one her seat high and uneasy and seeming to grow more and more so as the weary moments passed slowly away No one came near her or seemed to notice her yet she could hear them conversing in other parts of the room and knew that they were sometimes looking at her and timid and bashful as she was it seemed hard to bear Then too her little heart was very sad as she thought of her father s displeasure and feared that he would withdraw from her the affection which had been for the last few months the very sunshine of her life Besides all this the excitement of her feelings and the close and sultry air for it was a very warm day had brought on a nervous headache She leaned forward and rested her head against the instrument feeling in momentary danger of falling from her seat Thus two long hours had passed when mister Travilla came to her side and said in a compassionate tone I am really very sorry for you my little friend but I advise you to submit to your papa I see you are getting very weary sitting there and I warn you not to hope to conquer him I have known him for years and a more determined person I never saw Had you not better sing the song it will not take five minutes and then your trouble will be all over Elsie raised her head and answered gently Thank you for your sympathy mister Travilla you are very kind but I could not do it because Jesus says He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and I cannot disobey Him even to please my own dear papa But Miss Elsie why do you think it would be disobeying Him Is there any verse in the Bible which says you must not sing songs on Sunday mister Travilla it says the Sabbath is to be kept holy unto the Lord that we are not to think our own thoughts nor speak our own words nor do our own actions but all the day must be spent in studying God s word or worshipping and praising Him and there is no praise in that song not one word about God or heaven That is very true Elsie but still it is such a very little thing that I cannot think there would be much harm in it or that God would be very angry with you for doing it O mister Travilla she said looking up at him in great surprise surely you know that there is no such thing as a little sin and don t you remember about the man who picked up sticks on the Sabbath day No what was it God commanded that he should be stoned to death and it was done Would you not have thought that a very little thing mister Travilla Yes I believe I should said he turning away with a very grave face Dinsmore he said going up to his friend I am sure that child is conscientious had you not better give up to her in this instance Never Travilla he answered with stern decision This is the first time she has rebelled against my authority and if I let her conquer now she will think she is always to have her own way No cost what it may I must subdue her she will have to learn that my will is law Right Horace said the elder mister Dinsmore approvingly let her understand from the first that you are to be master it is always the best plan Excuse me Dinsmore said Travilla but I must say that I think a parent has no right to coerce a child into doing violence to its conscience Nonsense replied his friend a little angrily Elsie is entirely too young to set up her opinion against mine she must allow me to judge for her in these matters for some years to come Eversham who had been casting uneasy glances at Elsie all the afternoon now drawing his chair near to Adelaide said to her in an undertone Miss Adelaide I am deeply sorry for the mischief I have unwittingly caused and if you can tell me how to repair it you will lay me under lasting obligations Adelaide shook her head There is no moving Horace when he has once set his foot down she said and as to Elsie I doubt whether any power on earth can make her do what she considers wrong Poor little thing said Eversham sighing where in the world did she get such odd notions Partly from a pious Scotch woman who had a good deal to do with her in her infancy and partly from studying the Bible I believe She is always at it Indeed and he relapsed into thoughtful silence Another hour passed slowly away and then the tea bell rang Elsie asked her father coming to her side are you ready to obey me now if so we will wait a moment to hear the song and then you can go to your tea with us Dear papa I cannot break the Sabbath she replied in a low gentle tone without lifting her head Very well then I cannot break my word you must sit there until you will submit and until then you must fast You are not only making yourself miserable by your disobedience and obstinacy Elsie but are mortifying and grieving me very much he added in a subdued tone that sent a sharp pang to the loving little heart and caused some very bitter tears to fall as he turned away and left her The evening passed wearily away to the little girl the drawing room was but dimly lighted for the company had all deserted it to wander about the grounds or sit in the portico enjoying the moonlight and the pleasant evening breeze and the air indoors seemed insupportably close and sultry At times Elsie could scarcely breathe and she longed intensely to get out into the open air every moment her seat grew more uncomfortable and the pain in her head more severe her thoughts began to wander she forgot where she was everything became confused and at length she lost all consciousness Several gentlemen among whom were mister Horace Dinsmore and mister Travilla were conversing together on the portico when they were suddenly startled by a sound as of something falling Travilla who was nearest the door rushed into the drawing room followed by the others A light quick quick a light he cried raising Elsie s insensible form in his arms the child has fainted One of the others instantly snatching a lamp from a distant table brought it near and the increased light showed Elsie s little face ghastly as that of a corpse while a stream of blood was flowing from a wound in the temple made by striking against some sharp corner of the furniture as she fell She was a pitiable sight indeed with her fair face her curls and her white dress all dabbled in blood Dinsmore you re a brute exclaimed Travilla indignantly as he placed her gently on a sofa Horace made no reply but with a face almost as pale as her own bent over his little daughter in speechless alarm while one of the guests who happened to be a physician hastily dressed the wound and then applied restoratives It was some time ere consciousness returned and the father trembled with the agonizing fear that the gentle spirit had taken its flight But at length the soft eyes unclosed and gazing with a troubled look into his face bent so anxiously over her she asked Dear papa are you angry with me No darling he replied in tones made tremulous with emotion not at all What was it she asked in a bewildered way what did I do what has happened Never mind daughter he said you have been ill but you are better now so don t think any more about it She had better be put to bed at once said the physician There is blood on my dress cried Elsie in a startled tone where did it come from You fell and hurt your head replied her father raising her gently in his arms but don t talk any more now Oh I remember she moaned an expression of keen distress coming over her face papa Hush hush not a word more we will let the past go he said kissing her lips I shall carry you to your room now and see you put to bed He held her on his knee her head resting on his shoulder while Chloe prepared her for rest Are you hungry daughter he asked No papa I only want to go to sleep There Aunt Chloe that will do he said as the old nurse tied on the child s night cap and raising her again in his arms he carried her to the bed and was about to place her on it Oh papa my prayers first you know she cried eagerly Never mind them to night said he you are not able Please let me dear papa she pleaded I cannot go to sleep without Yielding to her entreaties he placed her on her knees and stood beside her listening to her murmured petitions in which he more than once heard his own name coupled with a request that he might be made to love Jesus When she had finished he again raised her in his arms kissed her tenderly several times and then laid her carefully on the bed saying as he did so Why did you ask Elsie that I might love Jesus Because papa I do so want you to love Him it would make you so happy and besides you cannot go to heaven without it the Bible says so Does it and what makes you think I don t love Him Dear papa please don t be angry she pleaded tearfully but you know Jesus says He that keepeth my commandments he it is that loveth me He stooped over her Good night daughter he said Dear dear papa she cried throwing her arm round his neck and drawing down his face close to hers I do love you so very very much Better than anybody else he asked No papa I love Jesus best you next He kissed her again and with a half sigh turned away and left the room He was not entirely pleased not quite willing that she should love even her Saviour better than himself Elsie was very weary and was soon asleep She waked the next morning feeling nearly as well as usual and after she had had her bath and been dressed by Chloe s careful hands the curls being arranged to conceal the plaster that covered the wound on her temple there was nothing in her appearance except a slight paleness to remind her friends of the last night s accident She was sitting reading her morning chapter when her father came in and taking a seat by her side lifted her to his knee saying as he caressed her tenderly My little daughter is looking pretty well this morning how does she feel Quite well thank you papa she replied looking up into his face with a sweet loving smile He raised the curls to look at the wounded temple then as he dropped them again he said with a shudder Elsie do you know that you were very near being killed last night No papa was I she asked with an awe struck countenance Yes the doctor says if that wound had been made half an inch nearer your eye I should have been childless His voice trembled almost too much for utterance as he finished his sentence and he strained her to his heart with a deep sigh of thankfulness for her escape Elsie was very quiet for some moments and the little face was almost sad in its deep thoughtfulness What are you thinking of darling he asked She raised her eyes to his face and he saw that they were brimful of tears O papa she said dropping her head on his breast while the bright drops fell like rain down her cheeks would you have been so very sorry Sorry darling do you not know that you are more precious to me than all my wealth all my friends and relatives put together Yes I would rather part with everything else than lose this one little girl he said kissing her again and again Dear dear papa how glad I am that you love me so much she replied and then relapsed into silence He watched her changing countenance for some time then asked What is it darling I was just thinking she said whether I was ready to go to heaven and I believe I was for I know that I love Jesus and then I was thinking how glad mamma would have been to see me don t you think she would papa I can t spare you to her yet he replied with emotion and I think she loves me too well to wish it As Miss Day had not yet returned Elsie s time was still pretty much at her own disposal excepting when her papa gave her something to do so after breakfast finding that he was engaged with some one in the library she took her Bible and seeking out a shady retreat in the garden sat down to read The Bible was ever the book of books to her and this morning the solemn tender feelings naturally caused by the discovery of her recent narrow escape from sudden death made it even more than usually touching and beautiful in her eyes She had been alone in the arbor for some time when hearing a step at her side she looked up showing a face all wet with tears It was mister Travilla who stood beside her In tears little Elsie Pray what may the book be that effects you so he asked sitting down by her side and taking it from her hand The Bible I declare he exclaimed in surprise What can there be in it that you find so affecting O mister Travilla said the little girl does it not make your heart ache to read how the Jews abused our dear dear Saviour and then to think that it was all because of our sins she sobbed He looked half distressed half puzzled it seemed a new idea to him Really my little Elsie he said you are quite original in your ideas I suppose I ought to feel unhappy about these things but indeed the truth is I have never thought much about them Then you don t love Jesus she answered mournfully Ah mister Travilla how sorry I am Why Elsie what difference can it make to you whether I love Him or not Because mister Travilla the Bible says If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ let him be anathema maranatha accursed from God Oh sir think how dreadful You cannot be saved unless you love Jesus and believe on Him Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved That is what God says in his word She spoke with deep solemnity the tears trembling in her eyes He was touched but for a while sat perfectly silent Then he said with an effort to speak lightly Ah well my little friend I certainly intend to repent and believe before I die but there is time enough yet mister Travilla she said laying her hand on his arm and looking earnestly into his face how do you know that there is time enough yet don t put it off I beg of you She paused a moment then asked Do you know mister Travilla how near I came to being killed last night He nodded Well suppose I had been killed and had not loved Jesus where would I be now He put his arm round her and giving her a kiss said I don t think you would have been in any very bad place Elsie a sweet amiable little girl who has never harmed any one would surely not fare very badly in another world She shook her head very gravely Ah mister Travilla you forget the anathema maranatha if I had not loved Jesus and had my sins washed away in His blood I could not have been saved Just at this moment a servant came to tell Elsie that her papa wanted her in the drawing room and mister Travilla taking her hand led her into the house They found the company again grouped about the piano listening to Adelaide s music Elsie went directly to her father and stood by his side putting her hand in his with a gesture of confiding affection He smiled down at her and kept fast hold of it until his sister had risen from the instrument when putting Elsie in her place he said Now my daughter let us have that song Yes papa she replied beginning the prelude at once I will do my very best And so she did The song was both well played and well sung and her father looked proud and happy as the gentlemen expressed their pleasure and asked for another and another Thus the clouds which had so suddenly obscured little Elsie s sky seemed to have vanished as speedily as they had arisen Her father again treated her with all his wonted affection and there even seemed to be a depth of tenderness in his love which it had not known before for he could not forget how nearly he had lost her

none	none	 In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said I thank thee O Father Lord of heaven and earth that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes even so Father for so it seemed good in thy sight Luke x twenty one Says the Apostle Paul I say the truth in Christ I lie not my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost that I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart for I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren my kinsmen according to the flesh Brethren my heart s desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they might be saved And such dear reader is in greater or less degree the feeling of every renewed heart loving Jesus it would fain have others love Him too it desires the salvation of all but for that of its own dear ones it longs and labors and prays it is like Jacob wrestling with the angel when he said I will not let thee go except thou bless me And thus it was with Elsie She knew now that her father was not a Christian that he had no real love for Jesus none of the true fear of God before his eyes She saw that if he permitted her to read to him from God s word as he sometimes did it was not that he felt any pleasure in listening but only to please her she had no reason to suppose he ever prayed and though he went regularly to church it was because he considered it proper and respectable to do so and not that he cared to worship God or to learn His will This conviction which had gradually dawned upon Elsie until now it amounted to certainty caused her great grief she shed many tears over it in secret and very many and very earnest were the prayers she offered up for her dear father s conversion She was sitting on his knee one evening in the drawing room while he and several other gentlemen were conversing on the subject of religion They were discussing the question whether or no a change of heart were necessary to salvation The general opinion seemed to be that it was not and Elsie listened with pain while her father expressed his decided conviction that all who led an honest upright moral life and attended to the outward observances of religion were quite safe He could see no necessity for a change of heart he did not believe in the doctrine of total depravity not he no indeed he thought the world much better than many people would have us believe Elsie fixed her eyes on his face with a very mournful gaze while he was speaking but he was busy with his argument and did not notice her But one of the guests was just expressing his approval of mister Dinsmore s sentiments when catching sight of Elsie s face he stopped remarking Your little girl looks as if she had something to say on the subject what is it my dear Elsie blushed hesitated and looked at her father Yes speak my daughter if you have anything to say he said encouragingly Elsie lifted her eyes timidly to the gentleman s face as she replied I was just thinking sir of what our Saviour said to Nicodemus Verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God Marvel not that I said unto thee Ye must be born again She repeated these words of inspiration with a deep earnest solemnity that seemed to impress every hearer For a moment there was a deep hush in the room Then the gentleman asked Well my little lady and what is meant by being born again O sir she replied surely you know that it means to have the image of God lost in Adam s fall restored to us it means what David asked for when he prayed Create in me a clean heart O God and renew a right spirit within me Where did you learn all this he asked looking at her with mingled surprise and admiration In the Bible sir she modestly replied You seem to have read it to some purpose said he and now since you consider that change so necessary can you tell me how it is to be brought about God s Holy Spirit alone can change a sinner s heart sir And how am I to secure His aid he asked Elsie answered with a text God is more willing to give His Holy Spirit to them that ask Him than parents are to give good gifts unto their children He paused a moment then asked Have you obtained this new heart Miss Elsie I hope I have sir she replied the sweet little face all suffused with blushes and the soft downcast eyes filling with tears Why do you think so he asked again I think there is a text that says you must be able always to give a reason for the hope that is in you or something to that effect is there not Yes sir Be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear Then raising her eyes to his face with a touching mixture of deep humility and holy boldness she continued And this sir is my answer Jesus says Him that cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out and I believe Him I did go to Him and He did not cast me out but forgave my sins and taught me to love Him and desire to serve Him all my life This conversation between the gentleman and the little girl had drawn the attention of all present and now missus Dinsmore who had more than once shown signs of impatience said Well Elsie I think you have now talked quite enough for a child of your age Then pulling out her watch It is high time for little folks to be in bed Elsie blushing deeply would have retired immediately but her father held her fast saying as he gave his stepmother an angry glance You need not go Elsie unless you choose I am quite capable of judging when it is time to send you to bed I would rather go if you please papa whispered Elsie who had a great dread of missus Dinsmore s anger Very well then you may do as you like he replied giving her a good night kiss 
3440_171006_000033_000001	train-clean-100	And with a graceful good night to the company the little girl left the room 
none	none	Her questioner followed her with an admiring glance then turning to her father exclaimed warmly She is a remarkably intelligent child Dinsmore one that any father might be proud of I was astonished at her answers Yes remarked Travilla a text has been running in my head ever since you commenced your conversation something about these things being hid from the wise and prudent and revealed unto babes And he added I am sure if ever I saw one who possessed that new nature of which she spoke it is she herself 
3440_171006_000035_000002	train-clean-100	Has she any faults Dinsmore 
none	none	Very few I think though she would tell you a different story replied her father with a gratified smile The next morning Elsie was sitting reading her Bible when she suddenly felt a hand laid on her head and her father s voice said Good morning little daughter Ah papa is that you she asked raising her head to give him a smile of joyful welcome I did not know you were there Ah I have been watching you for several minutes he said always poring over the same book Elsie do you never tire of it No indeed papa it is always new and I do love it so it is so very sweet May I read a little to you she added coaxingly Yes I love to listen to anything read by my darling he said sitting down and taking her on his knee She opened at the third chapter of John s Gospel and read it through At the sixteenth verse For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish but have everlasting life she paused and asked Was not that a wonderful gift papa and wonderful love that prompted it Yes he said absently stroking her hair She finished the chapter and closing the book laid her head on his breast asking Dear papa don t you believe the Bible Certainly daughter I am not an infidel he replied in a careless tone Well then papa she continued half hesitatingly does not this chapter teach very plainly that we must love Jesus and have new hearts if we want to go to heaven Yes he said I dare say it does Then taking the book from her he laid it aside and giving her a kiss said I was much pleased with your intelligent answers to mister Lee last evening Elsie sighed and her eyes filled with tears It was not what she wanted What an odd child you are he said laughing You really look as though I had been scolding instead of praising you She dropped her head on his breast and burst into tears and sobs Why Elsie my own darling what ails you he asked in great surprise O papa she sobbed I want you to love Jesus Oh is that all he said And setting her on her feet he took her by the hand and led her out into the garden where they met mister Travilla and another gentleman who immediately entered into conversation with mister Dinsmore while Elsie wandered about amongst the flowers and shrubs gathering a nosegay for her Aunt Adelaide CHAPTER TWELFTH She had waited for their coming She had kiss d them o er and o er And they were so fondly treasured For the words of love they bore Words that whispered in the silence She had listened till his tone Seemed to linger in the echo Darling thou art all mine own missus J C NEAL Pray what weighty matter is troubling your young brain birdie asked Adelaide laughingly laying her hand on Elsie s shoulder Judging from the exceeding gravity of your countenance one might imagine that the affairs of the nation had been committed to your care O auntie can t you help me won t you answered the little girl looking up coaxingly into the bright cheerful face bent over her Help you in what reading with your book upside down eh asked Adelaide pointing with a quizzical look at the volume of fairy tales in her little niece s lap Oh cried Elsie coloring and laughing in her turn I was not reading and did not know that my book was wrong side up But Aunt Adelaide you know Christmas is coming soon and I want to give papa something and I am quite puzzled about it I thought of slippers but he has a very handsome pair and besides there would hardly be time to work them as I have so many lessons a purse won t do either because I have given him one already and I would like it to be something worth more than either slippers or purse But you are so much wiser than I can t you help me think So this is what has kept you so quiet and demure all day that I have scarcely once heard you laugh or sing quite an unusual state of things of late and Adelaide playfully pinched the round rosy cheek Ahem let me put on my thinking cap assuming an air of comic gravity Ah yes I have it your miniature little one of course what could please him better Oh yes cried Elsie clapping her hands that will do nicely why didn t I think of it Thank you auntie But then she added her countenance falling how can I get it taken without his knowledge you know the surprise is half the fun Never mind my dear I ll find a way to manage that replied Adelaide confidently so just run away with you now and see how much money you can scrape together to spend on it It won t take long to count it Elsie said with a merry laugh But here is papa just coming in at the door I hope he won t suspect what we have been talking about and she bounded away to meet him and claim the kiss he never refused her now Once Adelaide would not have been surprised at Elsie s quietness Patient and sweet tempered the little girl had always been but more especially after her father s return from Europe very quiet and timid seeming to shrink from observation with a constant dread of incurring reproof or punishment but the last few happy months during which her father had continued to lavish upon her every proof of the tenderest affection had wrought a great change in her her manner had lost its timidity she moved about the house with a light and joyous step and it was no unusual thing to hear her merry silvery laugh ring out or her sweet voice carolling like some wild bird of the wood the natural outgushings of her joy and thankfulness for the little heart that had so long been famishing for love that had often grown so weary and sick in its hungering and thirsting for it was now fully satisfied and revelled in its new found happiness I have got it all arranged nicely Elsie Adelaide said coming into the room with a very pleased face as the little girl was preparing for bed that evening Your papa is going away in a day or two to attend to some business matters connected with your property and will be absent at least two weeks so unless he should take it into his head to carry you along we can easily manage about the picture Elsie looked up with a countenance of blank dismay Why said Adelaide laughing I thought you d be delighted with my news and instead of that you look as if I had read you your death warrant O Aunt Adelaide two whole weeks without seeing papa just think how long Pooh nonsense child it will be gone before you know it But now tell me how much money have you I have saved my allowance for two months that makes twenty dollars you know auntie and I have a little change besides do you think it will be enough Hardly I m afraid but I can lend you some if necessary Thank you auntie Elsie answered gratefully you are very kind but I couldn t take it because papa has told me expressly that I must never borrow money nor run into debt in any way Dear me exclaimed Adelaide a little impatiently Horace certainly is the most absurdly strict person I ever met with But never mind I think we can manage it somehow she added in a livelier tone as she stooped to kiss her little niece good night Elsie s gentle rap was heard very early at her papa s door the next morning He opened it immediately and springing into his arms she asked almost tearfully Are you going away papa Yes darling he said caressing her fondly I must leave home for a few weeks and though I at first thought of taking you with me upon further consideration I have decided that it will be better to leave you here yet if you desire it very much my pet I will take you along Shall I You know I would always rather be with you than anywhere else papa she answered laying her head on his shoulder but you know best and I am quite willing to do whatever you say That is right daughter my little Elsie is a good obedient child he said pressing her closer to him When are you going papa she asked her voice trembling a little To morrow directly after dinner daughter So soon she sighed The sooner I leave you the sooner I shall return you know darling he said patting her cheek and smiling kindly on her Yes papa but two weeks seems such a long long time He smiled At your age I suppose it does but when you are as old as I am you will think it very short But to make it pass more quickly you may write me a little letter every day and I will send you one just as often Oh thank you papa that will be so pleasant she answered with a brightening countenance I do so love to get letters and I would rather have one from you than from anybody else Ah then I think you ought to be willing to spare me for two weeks I have been thinking my little girl might perhaps be glad of a little extra pocket money for buying Christmas gifts he said taking out his purse Would you Yes papa oh very much indeed He laughed at her eager tone and putting a fifty dollar note into her hand asked Will that be enough Elsie s eyes opened wide with astonishment I never before had half so much as this she exclaimed May I spend it all papa Provided you don t throw it away he answered gravely but don t forget that I require a strict account of all your expenditure Must I tell you every thing I buy she asked her countenance falling considerably Yes my child you must not until after Christmas however if you would rather not I will not mind it so much then she answered looking quite relieved but indeed papa it is a great deal of trouble Ah my little girl must not be lazy he said shaking his head gravely This was Elsie s first parting from her father since they had learned to know and love each other and when the time came to say good by she clung to him and seemed so loath to let him go that he quite repented of his determination to leave her at home O papa papa I cannot bear to have you go and leave me behind she sobbed I feel as if you were never coming back Why my own darling he said kissing her again and again why do you talk so I shall certainly be at home again in a fortnight but if I had thought you would feel so badly I would have made arrangements to take you with me It is too late now however and you must let me go dearest Be a good girl while I am gone and when I return I will bring you some handsome presents So saying he embraced her once more then putting her gently from him sprang into the carriage and was driven rapidly away Elsie stood watching until it was out of sight and then ran away to her own room to put her arms round her nurse s neck and hide her tears on her bosom Dere dere darlin dat will do now Massa Horace he be back fore long and ole Chloe don like for to see her chile stressin herself so and the large dusky hand was passed lovingly over the bright curls and tenderly wiped away the falling tears But O mammy I m afraid he will never come back I m afraid the steamboat boiler will burst or the cars will run off the track or Hush hush darlin dat s wicked you must jes trust de Lord to take care of Massa Horace He s jes as able to do it one place as in tudder an ef you an your ole mammy keep prayin for Massa I se sure he ll come back safe kase don t you remember what de good book says If any two of you agree Oh yes dear mammy thank you for remembering it exclaimed the little girl lifting her head and smiling through her tears I won t cry any more now but will just try to keep thinking how glad I will be when papa comes home again A very sensible resolution my dear said Adelaide putting her head in at the door so come dry your eyes and let mammy put on your bonnet and cloak as fast as possible for I have begged a holiday for you and am going to carry you off to the city to do some shopping et cetera Ah I think I know what that et cetera means auntie don t I laughed Elsie as she hastened to obey Dear me how very wise some people are said her aunt smiling and nodding good naturedly But make haste my dear for the carriage is at the door When Elsie laid her head upon her pillow that night she acknowledged to herself that in spite of her father s absence and she had at times missed him sadly the day had been a very short and pleasant one to her owing to her Aunt Adelaide s thoughtful kindness in taking her out into new scenes and giving agreeable occupation to her thoughts She rose at her usual early hour the next morning and though feeling lonely comforted herself with the hope of receiving the promised letter and her face was full of eager expectation as her grandfather in his usual leisurely manner opened the bag and distributed its contents Two letters for Elsie he said in a tone of surprise just as she was beginning to despair of her turn coming at all Ah one is from Horace I see and the other from Miss Allison no doubt Elsie could hardly restrain her eagerness while he held them in his hand examining and commenting upon the address postmark et cetera But at length he tossed them to her remarking There if you are done your breakfast you had better run away and read them Oh thank you grandpa she said gladly availing herself of his permission Elsie is fortunate to day observed Lora looking after her I wonder which she will read first Her father s of course replied Adelaide He is more to her than all the rest of the world put together A matter of small concern to the rest of the world I opine remarked missus Dinsmore dryly Perhaps so mamma said Adelaide quietly yet I think there are some who prize Elsie s affection Yes Adelaide was right Miss Rose s letter was neglected and almost forgotten while Elsie read and reread her papa s with the greatest delight It gave an amusing account of the day s journey but what constituted its chief charm for the little girl was that it was filled with expressions of the tenderest affection for her Then came the pleasant task of answering which occupied almost all her spare time for letter writing was still to her a rather new and difficult business Miss Allison having hitherto been her only correspondent And this was a pleasure which was renewed every day for her papa faithfully kept his promise each morning bringing her a letter until at length one came announcing the speedy return of the writer Elsie was almost wild with delight Aunt Adelaide she cried running to her to communicate the glad tidings papa says he will be here this very afternoon Well my dear as we have already attended to all the business that needed to be kept secret from him I am very glad to hear it especially for your sake replied Adelaide looking up for a moment from the book she was reading and then returning to it again while her little niece danced out of the room with her papa s letter still in her hand and a face beaming with happiness She met missus Dinsmore in the hall Why are you skipping about in that mad fashion Elsie she asked severely I believe you will never learn to move and act like a lady I will try madam indeed Elsie answered subsiding into a slow and steady gait which would not have disgraced a woman of any age but I was so glad that papa is coming home to day that I could not help skipping Indeed and with a scornful toss of the head missus Dinsmore sailed past her and entered the drawing room Elsie had once on her first arrival at Roselands addressed missus Dinsmore in the innocence of her heart as grandma but that lady s horrified look and indignant repudiation of the ancient title had made a deep impression on the little girl s memory and effectually prevented any repetition of the offence As the hour drew near when her father might reasonably be expected Elsie took her station at one of the drawing room windows overlooking the avenue and the moment the carriage appeared in sight she ran out and stood waiting for him on the steps of the portico mister Dinsmore put out his head as they drove up the avenue and the first object that caught his eye was the fairy like form of his little daughter in her blue merino dress and the golden brown curls waving in the wind He sprang out and caught her in his arms the instant the carriage stopped My darling darling child he cried kissing her over and over again and pressing her fondly to his heart how glad I am to have you in my arms again Papa papa my own dear dear papa she exclaimed throwing her arms around his neck I m so happy now that you have come home safe and well Are you darling but I must not keep you out in this wind for it is quite chilly He set her down and leaving the servant to attend lo his baggage led her into the hall Will you come into the drawing room papa she said there is a bright warm fire there Is there not one in my dressing room he asked Yes papa a very good one Then we will go there I dare say the rest of the family are in no great hurry to see me and I want my little girl to myself for half an hour he said leading the way up stairs as he spoke They found as Elsie had reported a very bright fire in the dressing room A large easy chair was drawn up near it and a handsome dressing gown and slippers were placed ready for use all the work of Elsie s loving little hands He saw it all at a glance and with a pleased smile stooped and kissed her again saying My dear little daughter is very thoughtful for her papa s comfort Then exchanging his warm out door apparel and heavy boots for the dressing gown and slippers he seated himself in the chair and took her on his knee Well daughter he said passing his hand caressingly over her curls papa has brought you a present will you have it now or shall it be kept for Christmas Keep it for Christmas papa she answered gayly Christmas is almost here and besides I don t want to look at anything but you to night Very well look at me as much as you like was his laughing rejoinder And now tell me have you been a good girl in my absence As good as I ever am I believe papa I tried very hard but you can ask Miss Day No I am entirely satisfied with your report for I know my little daughter is quite truthful Elsie colored with pleasure then calling to mind the time when he had for a moment suspected her of falsehood she heaved a deep sigh dropping her head upon his breast He seemed to understand her thoughts for pressing his lips to her forehead he said gently and kindly I think I shall never again doubt my little daughter s truth She looked up with a grateful smile Miss Day has gone away to stay until after New Year s day papa she said and so our holidays have begun Ah I am very well satisfied said he I think you have earned a holiday and I hope you will enjoy it But I don t know that I shall let you play all the time he added with a smile I have some notion of giving you a lesson now and then myself Dear papa how pleasant she exclaimed delightedly I do so love to say lessons to you Well then we will spend an hour together every morning But are you not to have some company Oh yes papa quite a house full she said with a slight sigh The Percys and the Howards and all the Carringtons and some others too I believe Why do you sigh daughter he asked do you not expect to enjoy their company Yes sir I hope so she answered rather dubiously but when there are so many and they stay so long they are apt to disagree and that you know is not pleasant I am sure I shall enjoy the hour with you better than anything else it is so sweet to be quite alone with my own darling papa and the little arm stole softly round his neck again and the rosy lips touched his cheek Well when are the little plagues coming he asked returning her caress Some of them to morrow papa no Monday to morrow is Sabbath day Shall I bring in de trunks now massa asked mister Dinsmore s servant putting his head in at the door Yes John certainly Why you brought back a new one papa didn t you asked Elsie as John carried in one she was sure she had never seen before and in obedience to a motion of her father s hand set it down quite near them Yes my dear it is yours There John unlock it tossing him the key And now daughter get down and see what you can find in it worth having Elsie needed no second bidding but in an instant was on her knees beside the trunk eager to examine its contents Take the lid off the band box first and see what is there said her father O papa how very pretty she cried as she lifted out a beautiful little velvet hat adorned with a couple of ostrich feathers I am very glad it pleases you my darling he said putting it on her head and gazing at her with proud delight in her rare beauty There it fits exactly and is very becoming Then taking it off he returned it to the box and bade her look further I am reserving the present for Christmas he said in answer to her inquiring look Elsie turned to the trunk again Dear papa how good you are to me she said looking up at him almost with tears of pleasure in her eyes as she lifted out one after another a number of costly toys which she examined with exclamations of delight and then several handsome dresses some of the finest softest merino and others of thick rich silk all ready made in fashionable style and doing credit to his taste and judgment and lastly a beautiful velvet pelisse trimmed with costly fur just the thing to wear with her pretty new hat He laughed and patted her cheek We must have these dresses tried on he said at least one of them for as they were all cut by the same pattern one of your old dresses which I took with me I presume they will all fit alike There take this one to mammy and tell her to put it on you and then come back to me Oh I wondered how you could get them the right size papa Elsie answered as she skipped gayly out of the room She was back again in a very few moments arrayed in the pretty silk he had selected Ah it seems to be a perfect fit said he turning her round and round with a very gratified look Mammy must dress you to morrow in one of these new frocks and your pretty hat and pelisse Elsie looked troubled Well what is it he asked I am afraid I shall be thinking of them in church papa if I wear them then for the first time Pooh nonsense what harm if you do This squeamishness Elsie is the one thing about you that displeases me very much But there don t look so distressed my pet I dare say you will get over it by and by and be all I wish indeed I sometimes think you have improved a little already in that respect Oh what a pang these words sent to her heart was it indeed true that she was losing her tenderness of conscience that she was becoming less afraid of displeasing and dishonoring her Saviour than in former days The very thought was anguish Her head drooped upon her bosom and the small white hands were clasped convulsively together while a bitter repenting cry a silent earnest prayer for pardon and help went up to Him whose ear is ever open to the cry of His children Her father looked at her in astonishment What is it darling he asked drawing her tenderly toward him and pushing back the curls from her face why do you look so pained what did I say that could have hurt you so I did not mean to be harsh and severe for it was a very trifling fault She hid her face on his shoulder and burst into an agony of tears It was not that papa but but But what my darling don t be afraid to tell me he answered soothingly O papa I I am afraid I don t love Jesus as much as I did she faltered out between her sobs Ah that is it eh Well well you needn t cry any more I think you are a very good little girl though rather a silly one I am afraid and quite too morbidly conscientious He took her on his knee as he spoke wiped away her tears and then began talking in a lively strain of something else Elsie listened and answered him cheerfully but all the evening he noticed that whenever she was quiet an unusual expression of sadness would steal over her face What a strange child she is he said to himself as he sat musing over the fire after sending her to bed I cannot understand her it is very odd how often I wound when I intend to please her As for Elsie she scarcely thought of her new finery so troubled was her tender conscience so pained her little heart to think that she had been wandering from her dear Saviour But Elsie had learned that if any man sin we have an advocate with the Father Jesus Christ the righteous and to Him she went with her sin and sorrow she applied anew to the pardoning peace speaking blood of Christ that blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel and thus the sting of conscience was taken away and her peace restored and she was soon resting quietly on her pillow for so He giveth His beloved sleep Even her father s keen searching glance when she came to him in the morning could discover no trace of sadness in her face very quiet and sober it was but entirely peaceful and happy and so it remained all through the day Her new clothes did not trouble her she was hardly conscious of wearing them and quite able to give her usual solemn and fixed attention to the services of the sanctuary Where are you going daughter mister Dinsmore asked as Elsie gently withdrew her hand from his on leaving the dining room To my room papa she replied Come with me he said I want you What do you want me for papa she asked as he sat down and took her on his knee What for why to keep to love and to look at he said laughing I have been away from my little girl so long that now I want her close by my side or on my knee all the time Do you not like to be with me Dearly well my own darling papa she answered flinging her little arms around his neck and laying her head on his breast He fondled her and chatted with her for some time then still keeping her on his knee took up a book and began to read Elsie saw with pain that it was a novel and longed to beg him to put it away and spend the precious hours of the holy Sabbath in the study of God s word or some of the lesser helps to Zion s pilgrims which the saints of our own or other ages have prepared But she knew that it would be quite out of place for a little child like her to attempt to counsel or reprove her father and that tenderly as he loved and cherished her he would never for one moment allow her to forget their relative positions At length she ventured to ask softly Papa may I go to my own room now What for he asked are you tired of my company No sir oh no but I want she hesitated and hung her head for an instant while the rich color mounted to cheek and brow then raising it again she said fearlessly I always want to spend a little while with my best Friend on Sabbath afternoon papa He looked puzzled and also somewhat displeased I don t understand you Elsie he said you surely can have no better friend than your own father and can it be possible that you love any one else better than you love me Again the little arms were round his neck and hugging him close and closer she whispered It was Jesus I meant papa you know He loves me even better than you do and I must love Him best of all but there is no one else that I love half so much as I love you my own dear dear precious father Well you may go but only for a little while mind he answered giving her a kiss and setting her down Nay he added hastily stay as long as you like if you feel it a punishment to be kept here with me I would rather do without you Oh no no papa she said beseechingly and with tears in her eyes I do so love to be with you Please don t be angry please let me come back soon No darling I am not angry he answered smoothing her hair and smiling kindly on her come back just when you like and the sooner the better Elsie did not stay away very long in less than an hour she returned bringing her Bible and Pilgrim s Progress with her Her father welcomed her with a smile and then turned to his novel again while she drew a stool to his side and sitting down leaned her head against his knee and read until the short winter day began to close in and mister Dinsmore whose hand had been every now and then laid caressingly upon her curls said Put away your book now daughter it is growing too dark for you to read without straining your eyes Please papa let me finish the paragraph first may I she asked No you must always obey the instant I speak to you Elsie rose at once and without another word laid her books upon the table then coming back claimed her accustomed place upon his knee with her head resting on his shoulder He put his arm around her and they sat silently thus for some moments At length Elsie asked Papa did you ever read Pilgrim s Progress Yes a good while ago when I was quite a boy And you did not like it papa Yes very much though I have nearly forgotten the story now Do you like it Very much indeed papa I think it comes next to the Bible Next to the Bible eh well I believe you are the only little girl of my acquaintance who thinks that the most beautiful and interesting book in the world But let me see what is this Pilgrim s Progress about some foolish story of a man with a great load on his back is it not Foolish papa oh I am sure you don t mean it you couldn t think it foolish Ah I know by your smile that you are only saying it to tease me It is a beautiful story papa about Christian how he lived in the City of Destruction and had a great burden on his back which he tried in every way to get rid of but all in vain until he came to the Cross but then it seemed suddenly to loosen of itself and dropped from his back and rolled away and fell into the sepulchre where it could not be seen any more Well and is not that a foolish story can you see any sense or meaning in it he asked with a slight smile and a keen glance into the eager little face upturned to his Ah papa I know what it means she answered in a half sorrowful tone Christian with the load on his back is a person who has been convinced of sin by God s Holy Spirit and feels his sins a heavy burden too heavy for him to bear and then he tries to get rid of them by leaving off his wicked ways and by doing good deeds but he soon finds he can t get rid of his load that way for it only grows heavier and heavier until at last he gives up trying to save himself and just goes to the cross of Jesus Christ and the moment he looks to Jesus and trusts in Him his load of sin is all gone mister Dinsmore was surprised as indeed he had often been at Elsie s knowledge of spiritual things Who told you all that he asked I read it in the Bible papa and besides I know because I have felt it He did not speak again for some moments and then he said very gravely I am afraid you read too many of those dull books I don t want you to read things that fill you with sad and gloomy thoughts and make you unhappy I want my little girl to be merry and happy as the day is long Please don t forbid me to read them papa she pleaded with a look of apprehension for indeed they don t make me unhappy and I love them so dearly You need not be alarmed I shall not do so unless I see that they do affect your spirits he answered in a reassuring tone and she thanked him with her own bright sweet smile She was silent for a moment then asked suddenly Papa may I say some verses to you Some time he said but not now for there is the tea bell and taking her hand he led her down to the dining room They went to the drawing room after tea but did not stay long There were no visitors and it was very dull and quiet there no one seeming inclined for conversation Old mister Dinsmore sat nodding in his chair Louise was drumming on the piano and the rest were reading or sitting listlessly saying nothing and Elsie and her papa soon slipped away to their old seat by his dressing room fire Sing something for me my pet some of those little hymns I often hear you singing to yourself he said as he took her on his knee and Elsie gladly obeyed Some of the pieces she sang alone but in others which were familiar to him her father joined his deep bass notes to her sweet treble at which she was greatly delighted Then they read several chapters of the Bible together and thus the evening passed so quickly and pleasantly that she was very much surprised when her papa taking out his watch told her it was her bed time O papa it has been such a nice nice evening she said as she bade him good night so like the dear old times I used to have with Miss Rose only She paused and colored deeply Only what darling he asked drawing her caressingly to him Only papa if you would pray with me like she did she whispered winding her arms about his neck and hiding her face on his shoulder That I cannot do my pet I have never learned how and so I fear you will have to do all the praying for yourself and me too he said with a vain effort to speak lightly for both heart and conscience were touched The only reply was a tightening of the clasp of the little arms about his neck and a half suppressed sob then two trembling lips touched his a warm tear fell on his cheek and she turned away and ran quickly from the room Oh how earnest and importunate were Elsie s pleadings at a throne of grace that night that her dear dear papa might soon be taught to love Jesus and how to pray to Him Tears fell fast while she prayed but she rose from her knees feeling a joyful assurance that her petitions had been heard and would be granted in God s own good time She had hardly laid her head upon her pillow when her father came in and saying I have come to sit beside my little girl till she falls asleep placed himself in a chair close by her side taking her hand in his and holding it as she loved so to have him do I am so glad you have come papa she said her whole face lighting up with pleased surprise Are you he answered with a smile I m afraid I am spoiling you but I can t help it to night I think you forget your wish to repeat some verses to me Oh yes papa she said but may I say them now He nodded assent and she went on They are some Miss Rose sent me in one of her letters She cut them out of a newspaper she said and sent them to me because she liked them so much and I too think they are very sweet The piece is headed THE PILGRIM S WANTS I want a sweet sense of Thy pardoning love That my manifold sins are forgiven That Christ as my Advocate pleadeth above That my name is recorded in heaven I want every moment to feel That thy Spirit resides in my heart That his power is present to cleanse and to heal And newness of life to impart I want oh I want to attain Some likeness my Saviour to thee That longed for resemblance once more to regain Thy comeliness put upon me I want to be marked for thine own Thy seal on my forehead to wear To receive that new name on the mystic white stone Which none but thyself can declare I want so in thee to abide As to bring forth some fruit to thy praise The branch which thou prunest though feeble and dried May languish but never decays I want thine own hand to unbind Each tie to terrestrial things Too tenderly cherished too closely entwined Where my heart so tenaciously clings I want by my aspect serene My actions and words to declare That my treasure is placed in a country unseen That my heart s best affections are there I want as a trav ller to haste Straight onward nor pause on my way Nor forethought in anxious contrivance to waste On the tent only pitched for a day I want and this sums up my prayer To glorify thee till I die Then calmly to yield up my soul to thy care And breathe out in faith my last sigh Footnote These beautiful words are not mine nor do I know either the name of the author or where they were originally published He was silent for a moment after she had repeated the last verse then laying his hand softly on her head and looking searchingly into her eyes he asked And does my little one really wish all that those words express Yes papa for myself and for you too she answered O papa I do want to be all that Jesus would have me just like Him so like Him that everybody who knows me will see the likeness and know that I belong to Him Nay you belong to me he said leaning over her and patting her cheek Hush not a syllable from your lips I will have no gainsaying of my words he added with a mixture of authority and playfulness as she seemed about to reply Now shut your eyes and go to sleep I will have no more talking to night She obeyed at once the white lids gently closed over the sweet eyes the long dark lashes rested quietly on the fair round cheek and soon her soft regular breathing told that she had passed into the land of dreams Her father sat still holding the little hand and still gazing tenderly upon the sweet young face till something in its expression reminding him of words she had just repeated I want to be marked for thine own Thy seal on my forehead to wear he laid it gently down rose and bent over her with a troubled look Ah my darling that prayer is granted already he murmured for ah me you seem almost too good and pure for earth But oh God forbid that you should be taken from me to that place where I can see that your heart is even now How desolate should I be and he turned away with a shiver and a heavy sigh and hastily quitted the room CHAPTER THIRTEENTH An angel face its sunny wealth of hair In radiant ripples bathed the graceful throat And dimpled shoulders

none	none	 The cold gray light of a winter morning was stealing in through the half closed blinds as Elsie awoke and started up in bed with the thought that this was the day on which several of her young guests were expected 
3334-171008-0001	train-other-500	and that her papa had promised her a walk with him before breakfast if she were ready in time

3334-171008-0011	train-other-500	Oh yes mammy and that reminds me that papa said I must eat a cracker or something before I take my walk because he thinks it isn t good for people to exercise much on an entirely empty stomach said Elsie

none	none	 It still wanted a few minutes of eight o clock when Elsie s gentle rap was heard at her papa s dressing room door 
3334-171008-0013	train-other-500	He opened it and stooping to give her a good morning kiss said with a pleased smile How bright and well my darling looks Had you a good night s rest

3334-171008-0016	train-other-500	Yes papa I ate a cracker and I think I will not get very hungry before nine o clock and I m very glad we have so much time for our walk she replied as she took her place on his knee Shall we not start soon Presently he said stroking her hair
none	none	 but it will not hurt you to get well warmed first for it is a sharp morning You are very careful of me dear papa she said laying her head on his breast 
3334-171008-0017	train-other-500	and oh it is so nice to have a papa to love me and take care of me And it is so nice to have a dear little daughter to love and to take care of he answered pressing her closer to him
3334-171008-0018	train-other-500	The house was still very quiet no one seeming to be astir but the servants as mister Dinsmore and Elsie went down the stairs and passed out through the hall
none	none	 O papa it is going to be such a nice day and I feel so happy Elsie gayly exclaimed as they started down the avenue Do you daughter he said regarding her with an expression of intense yearning affection I wish I could make you always as gay and happy as you are at this moment 
3334-171008-0019	train-other-500	But alas it cannot be my darling he added with a sigh I know that papa she said with sudden gravity for man that is born of woman is of few days and full of trouble the Bible says
3334-171008-0020	train-other-500	but I don t feel frightened at that because it tells me besides that Jesus loves me
none	none	 oh so dearly 
3334-171008-0021	train-other-500	and will never leave nor forsake me and that He has all power in heaven and in earth and will never let anything happen to me but what shall do me good
none	none	 O papa it is such a happy thing to have the dear Lord Jesus for your friend It is strange how everything seems to lead your thoughts to Him he said giving her a wondering look 
3334-171008-0022	train-other-500	Yes papa it is because I love Him so she answered simply and the father sighed as the thought arose Better than she loves me even as she told me herself Ah I would I could be all
3334-171008-0023	train-other-500	everything to her as she is fast becoming to me I cannot feel satisfied and yet I believe few daughters love their fathers as well as she loves me and fondly pressing the little hand he held he looked down upon her with beaming eyes
3334-171008-0024	train-other-500	She raised hers to his face with an expression of confiding affection and as though she had read his thoughts Yes papa she said I love you dearly dearly too
none	none	 better than all the world besides Breakfast always a plentiful and inviting meal at Roselands 
3334-171008-0026	train-other-500	was already upon the table when they returned and they brought to it appetites sufficiently keen to make it very enjoyable Elsie spent the first hour after breakfast at the piano practising and the second in her papa s dressing room
3334-171008-0027	train-other-500	studying and reciting to him then they took a long ride on horseback and when they returned she found that quite a number of the expected guests had already arrived Among them was Caroline Howard a favorite friend of Elsie s
3334-171008-0028	train-other-500	a pretty sweet tempered little girl about a year older than herself Caroline had been away paying a long visit to some friends in the North and so the two little girls had not met for nearly a year and of course they had a great deal to say to each other
3334-171008-0029	train-other-500	They chatted a few moments in the drawing room and then Elsie carried her friend off with her to her own room that they might go on with their talk while she was getting dressed for dinner
none	none	 Caroline had much to tell of her Northern relatives 
3334-171008-0030	train-other-500	and of all she had seen and heard and Elsie of her new found parent and her happiness in being so loved and cared for and so the little tongues ran very fast neither of them feeling Chloe s presence any restraint But
3334-171008-0031	train-other-500	she soon completed her task and went out leaving the two sitting on the sofa together laughing and talking merrily while awaiting the summons to dinner
none	none	 which they were to take that day along with their elders 
3334-171008-0032	train-other-500	How pretty your hair is Elsie said Caroline winding the glossy ringlets around her finger I wish you d give me one of these curls I want to get a bracelet made for mamma and she thinks so much of you and your hair is such a lovely color
none	none	 that I am sure she would be delighted with one made of it 
3334-171008-0033	train-other-500	A Christmas gift is it to be asked Elsie
none	none	 but how will you get it done in time for you know day after to morrow is Christmas 
3334-171008-0034	train-other-500	Yes I know but if I could get into the city this afternoon I think I might get them to promise it by to morrow night
none	none	 Well you shall have the curl at any rate if you will just take the scissors and help yourself and poor mammy will have the fewer to curl the next time Elsie answered laughingly 
3334-171008-0035	train-other-500	But mind she added as Caroline prepared to avail herself of the permission
none	none	 that you take it where it will not be missed 
3334-171008-0036	train-other-500	Of course I will I don t want to spoil your beauty though you are so much prettier than I was Caroline s laughing rejoinder There she cried holding up the severed ringlet isn t it a beauty but don t look scared it will never be missed among so many
3334-171008-0037	train-other-500	I don t even miss it myself although I know it is gone
none	none	 Well Elsie said shaking back her curls suppose we go down to the drawing room now and I will ask papa to take us to the city this afternoon 
3334-171008-0038	train-other-500	or if he is too busy to go himself to let Pomp or Ajax drive us in I think it would be better fun to go alone Elsie don t you asked Caroline with some hesitation adding quickly
none	none	 Don t be vexed but I must confess 
3334-171008-0039	train-other-500	I am more than half afraid of your father
none	none	 Oh you wouldn t be Carry if you knew him 
3334-171008-0040	train-other-500	Elsie answered in her eager way I was a little myself at first but now I love him so dearly I never want to go anywhere without him
none	none	 They found mister Dinsmore in the drawing room where most of the guests and the older members of the family were assembled 
3334-171008-0041	train-other-500	He was conversing with a strange gentleman and his little girl stood quietly at his side patiently waiting until he should be ready to give her his attention She had to wait some moments for the gentlemen were discussing some political question
3334-171008-0042	train-other-500	and were too much engaged to notice her But at length her father put his arm around her and with a kind smile asked What is it daughter
none	none	 Carry and I want to go to the city this afternoon 
3334-171008-0043	train-other-500	won t you take us papa I wish I could my dear but I have an engagement which makes it quite impossible
none	none	 Ah I m so sorry but then papa we may have one of the carriages and Pomp or Ajax to drive us may we not 
3334-171008-0044	train-other-500	No daughter I am sorry to disappoint you but I am afraid you are too young to be trusted on such an expedition with only a servant You must wait until to morrow when I can take you myself But papa we want to go to day
3334-171008-0045	train-other-500	Oh please do say yes we want to go so very much and I m sure we could do very nicely by ourselves Her arm was around his neck and both tone and look were very coaxing
3334-171008-0046	train-other-500	My little daughter forgets that when papa says no she is never to ask again Elsie blushed and hung her head His manner was quite too grave and decided for her to venture another word
3334-171008-0047	train-other-500	What is the matter what does Elsie want asked Adelaide who was standing near and had overheard enough to have some idea of the trouble mister Dinsmore explained
none	none	 and Adelaide at once offered to take charge of the little girls saying that she intended shopping a little in the city herself that very afternoon 
3334-171008-0048	train-other-500	Thank you said her brother looking very much pleased that obviates the difficulty entirely Elsie you may go if missus Howard gives Caroline permission
none	none	 Thank you dear papa thank you so very much she answered gratefully and then ran away to tell Carry of her success 
3334-171008-0049	train-other-500	and secure missus Howard s permission which was easily obtained
none	none	 Elsie had intended buying some little present for each of the house servants 
3334-171008-0050	train-other-500	and had taken a great deal of pleasure in making out a list of such articles as she thought would be suitable but on examining her purse she found to her dismay that she had already spent so much on the miniature and various gifts intended for other members of the family
none	none	 that there was very little left and it was with a very sober almost sorrowful face that she came down to take her place in the carriage it brightened instantly though as she caught sight of her father waiting to see her off 
3334-171008-0051	train-other-500	All ready my darling he said holding out his hand I think you will have a pleasant ride Ah yes if you were only going too papa she answered regretfully
none	none	 Quite impossible my pet but here is something to help you in your shopping 
3334-171008-0052	train-other-500	use it wisely and he put a twenty dollar gold piece in her hand
none	none	 Oh thank you papa how good and kind you are to me she exclaimed her whole face lighting up with pleasure now I can buy some things I wanted to get for mammy and the rest But how could you know I wanted more money 
3334-171008-0053	train-other-500	He only smiled lifted her up in his arms and kissed her fondly
none	none	 then 
3334-171008-0054	train-other-500	placing her in the carriage said to the coachman Drive carefully Ajax you are carrying my greatest treasure Nebber fear marster
none	none	 dese ole horses nebber tink ob running away replied the negro with a bow and a grin 
3334-171008-0055	train-other-500	as he touched his horses with the whip and drove off It was growing quite dark when the carriage again drove up the avenue and mister Horace Dinsmore who was beginning to feel a little anxious came out to receive them and ask what had detained them so long
3334-171008-0056	train-other-500	Long said Adelaide in a tone of surprise you gentlemen really have no idea what an undertaking it is to shop Why I thought we got through in a wonderfully short time
none	none	 O papa I have bought such quantities of nice things cried Elsie springing into his arms 
3334-171008-0057	train-other-500	Such as tobacco pipes red flannel
none	none	 et cetera remarked Adelaide laughing 
3334-171008-0058	train-other-500	Indeed Miss Adelaide exclaimed Carry somewhat indignantly
none	none	 you forget the But Elsie s little hand was suddenly placed over her mouth and Carry laughed pleasantly saying 
3334-171008-0059	train-other-500	Ah I forgot I mustn t tell Papa papa cried Elsie catching hold of his hand
none	none	 do come with me to my room and let me show you my purchases I will darling he answered pinching her cheek 
3334-171008-0060	train-other-500	Here Bill to a servant carry these bundles to Miss Elsie s room Then picking her up he tossed her over his shoulder and carried her up stairs as easily as though she had been a baby she clinging to him and laughing merrily
3334-171008-0061	train-other-500	Why papa how strong you are she said as he set her down I believe you can carry me as easily as I can my doll
none	none	 To be sure you are my doll said he and a very light burden for a man of my size and strength 
3334-171008-0062	train-other-500	But here come the bundles what a number no wonder you were late in getting home
none	none	 Oh yes papa see I want to show you and catching up one of them she hastily tore it open displaying a very gay handkerchief 
3334-171008-0063	train-other-500	This is a turban for Aunt Phillis and this is a pound of tobacco for old Uncle Jack and a nice pipe too Look mammy won t he be pleased
none	none	 And here s some flannel for poor old 
3334-171008-0064	train-other-500	Aunt Dinah who has the rheumatism and that oh no no mammy don t you open that It s a nice shawl for her papa she whispered in his ear
none	none	 Ah he said smiling and which is my present You had better point it out lest I should stumble upon it and learn the secret too soon 
3334-171008-0065	train-other-500	There is none here for you sir she replied looking up into his face with an arch smile I would give you the bundle you carried up stairs just now
none	none	 but I m afraid you would say that was not mine to give because it belongs to you already 
3334-171008-0066	train-other-500	Indeed it does and I feel richer in that possession than all the gold of California could make me he said pressing her to his heart She looked surpassingly lovely at that moment her cheeks burning and her eyes sparkling with excitement
3334-171008-0067	train-other-500	the dark fur trimmed pelisse and the velvet hat and plumes setting off to advantage the whiteness of her pure complexion and the glossy ringlets falling in rich masses on her shoulders
3334-171008-0068	train-other-500	My own papa I m so glad I do belong to you she said throwing her arms around his neck and laying her cheek to his for an instant
none	none	 Then springing away she added But I must show you the rest of the things 
3334-171008-0069	train-other-500	there are a good many more And she went on opening bundle after bundle displaying their contents and telling him for whom she intended them until at last they had all been examined and then she said a little wearily
3334-171008-0070	train-other-500	Now mammy please put them all away until to morrow But first take off my things and get me ready to go downstairs No daughter mister Dinsmore said in a gentle but firm tone
3334-171008-0071	train-other-500	you are not ready to have them put away until the price of each has been set down in your book
none	none	 Oh papa she pleaded won t to morrow do I m tired now and isn t it almost tea time No never put off till to morrow what may as well be done to day 
3334-171008-0072	train-other-500	There is nearly an hour yet before tea and I do not think it need fatigue you much Elsie s face clouded and the slightest approach to a pout might have been perceived I hope my little girl is not going to be naughty
3334-171008-0073	train-other-500	he said very gravely Her face brightened in an instant No papa she answered cheerfully I will be good and do whatever you bid me
none	none	 That is my own darling said he and I will help you and it will not take long 
3334-171008-0074	train-other-500	He opened her writing desk as he spoke and took out her account book Oh papa she cried in a startled tone springing forward and taking hold of his hand please please don t look you know you said I need not show you until after Christmas
3334-171008-0075	train-other-500	No I will not he replied smiling at her eagerness
none	none	 you shall put down the items in the book while I write the labels and Aunt Chloe pins them on Will that do Oh that s a nice plan papa she said gayly as she threw off her hat and pelisse 
3334-171008-0076	train-other-500	and seating herself before the desk took out her pen and ink Chloe put the hat and pelisse carefully away brought a comb and brush and smoothed her nursling s hair and then began her share of the business on hand
3334-171008-0077	train-other-500	Half an hour s work finished it all and Elsie wiped her pen and laid it away saying joyously
none	none	 Oh I m so glad it is all done 
3334-171008-0078	train-other-500	Papa knew best after all did he not asked her father drawing her to him and patting her cheek Yes papa she said softly you always know best and I am very sorry I was naughty He answered with a kiss and taking her hand led her down to the drawing room
none	none	 After tea the young people adjourned to the nursery where they amused themselves with a variety of innocent games 
3334-171008-0079	train-other-500	Quite early in the evening and greatly to Elsie s delight
none	none	 her father joined them and though some of the young strangers were at first rather shy of him 
3334-171008-0080	train-other-500	they soon found that he could enter heartily into their sports and before the time came to separate for the night he had made himself very popular with nearly all Time flew fast and Elsie was very much surprised when the clock struck eight
3334-171008-0081	train-other-500	Half past was her bedtime and as she now and then glanced up at the dial plate she thought the hands had never moved so fast As it struck the half hour she drew near her father s side Papa she asked is the clock right
none	none	 Yes my dear it is he replied comparing it with his watch And must I go to bed now she asked 
3334-171008-0082	train-other-500	half hoping for permission to stay up a little longer Yes daughter keep to rules
none	none	 Elsie looked disappointed and several little voices urged Oh do let her stay up another hour or at least till nine o clock 
3334-171008-0083	train-other-500	No I cannot often allow a departure from rules he said kindly but firmly and to morrow night Elsie will find it harder to go to bed in season than to night Bid your little friends good night my dear and go at once
3334-171008-0084	train-other-500	Elsie obeyed readily and cheerfully You too papa she said coming to him last No darling he answered laying his hand caressingly on her head and smiling approvingly on her
3334-171008-0085	train-other-500	I will come for my good night kiss before you are asleep Elsie looked very glad and went away feeling herself the happiest little girl in the land in spite of the annoyance of being forced to leave the merry group in the nursery
3334-171008-0086	train-other-500	She was just ready for bed when her papa came in and taking her in his arms folded her to his heart saying My own darling my good obedient little daughter
3334-171008-0087	train-other-500	Dear papa I love you so much she replied twining her arms around his neck I love you all the better for never letting me have my own way
none	none	 but always making me obey and keep to rules 
3334-171008-0088	train-other-500	I don t doubt it daughter he said
none	none	 for I have often noticed that spoiled petted children 
3334-171008-0089	train-other-500	usually have very little love for their parents or indeed for any one but themselves But I must put you in your bed or you will be in danger of taking cold
none	none	 He laid her down tucked the clothes snugly about her and pressing one more kiss on the round rosy cheek left her to her slumbers CHAPTER FOURTEENTH You play the spaniel And think with wagging of your tongue to win me SHAKESPEARE s Henry Eighth These delights if thou canst give Mirth with thee I mean to live MILTON s L Allegro The young party at Roselands had now grown so large several additions having been made to it on Monday afternoon and evening that a separate table was ordered to be spread for them in the nursery where they took their meals together missus Brown the housekeeper taking the head of the table for the double purpose of keeping them in order and seeing that their wants were well supplied Elsie came in to breakfast from a brisk walk with her papa looking fresh and rosy and bright as the morning quite different from some of the little guests who had been up far beyond their usual hours the night before and having just left their beds had come down pale and languid in looks and in some instances showing peevish and fretful tempers very trying to the patience of their attendants O Elsie exclaimed Carry Howard as the little girl took her place at the table we were all so sorry that you had to leave us so soon last night we had lots of fun after you left 
3440_171009_000005_000001	train-clean-100	I think your papa might have let you stay up a little longer but he has promised that tonight as we are to have the Christmas tree and ever so much will be going on you shall stay up till half past nine if you like 
3440_171009_000005_000002	train-clean-100	Aren t you glad 
3440_171009_000005_000003	train-clean-100	I m sure I am 
none	none	Yes papa is very kind and I know I feel much better for going to bed early last night said Elsie cheerfully Yes indeed remarked missus Brown late hours and rich food are very bad for little folks and I notice that Miss Elsie has grown a deal stronger and healthier looking since her papa came home he takes such good care of her Indeed he does said Elsie heartily thanking missus Brown with one of her sweetest smiles
3440_171009_000009_000000	train-clean-100	 What are we going to do to day Elsie asked Caroline 
3440_171009_000010_000000	train-clean-100	 Whatever you all prefer said Elsie 
none	none	If you like I will practice that duet with you the first hour after breakfast or do anything else you wish but the second hour I must spend with papa and after that I have nothing to do but entertain my company all day Do you do lessons in holidays asked Mary Leslie a merry fun loving child about Elsie s own age who considered lessons an intolerable bore and had some vague idea that they must have been invented for the sole purpose of tormenting children Her blue eyes opened wide with astonishment when Elsie quietly replied that her papa had kindly arranged to give her an hour every morning because he knew it would be so much pleasanter for her than spending the whole day in play Elsie did keenly enjoy that quiet hour spent in studying and reciting to her father sitting on a low stool at his feet or perhaps oftener on his knee with his arm around her waist 
3440_171009_000013_000000	train-clean-100	She had an eager and growing thirst for knowledge and was an apt scholar whom any one with the least love for the profession might have delighted in teaching and mister Dinsmore a thorough scholar himself and loving knowledge for its own sake loving also his little pupil with all a father s fond yearning affection delighted in his task 
3440_171009_000014_000000	train-clean-100	When Elsie left her father she found that the Carringtons had just arrived 
none	none	She and Lucy had not seen each other since the week the latter had spent at Roselands early in the summer and both felt pleased to meet missus Carrington gave Elsie a warm embrace remarking that she had grown and was looking extremely well better than she had ever seen her But no one was more delighted to meet Elsie than Herbert and she was very glad to learn that his health was gradually improving He was not however at all strong even yet and his mother thought it best for him to lie down and rest a little after his ride She promised to sit by him and the two little girls went in search of the rest of the young folks Several of the older boys had gone out walking or riding but the younger ones and all the little girls were gathered in a little back parlor where by Adelaide s care and forethought a variety of story books toys and games had been provided for their amusement Elsie s entrance was hailed with delight for she was a general favorite Oh Elsie can t you tell us what to play cried Mary Leslie I m so tired and she yawned wearily
3440_171009_000018_000000	train-clean-100	 Here are some dissected maps Mary replied Elsie opening a drawer would you not like them 
3440_171009_000019_000000	train-clean-100	 No indeed thank you they are too much like lessons 
3440_171009_000020_000000	train-clean-100	 Here are blocks will you build houses 
none	none	Oh 
3440_171009_000021_000001	train-clean-100	I am too big for that they are very nice for little children 
3440_171009_000022_000000	train-clean-100	 Will you play jack stones here are some smooth pebbles 
none	none	Yes if you and Carry and Lucy will play with me
3440_171009_000024_000000	train-clean-100	 Agreed said the others let s have a game 
3440_171009_000025_000000	train-clean-100	So Elsie having first set the little ones to building block houses supplied Harry Carrington an older brother of Lucy s with a book and two younger boys with dissected maps to arrange the four girls sat down in a circle on the carpet and began their game 
none	none	For a few moments all went on smoothly but soon angry and complaining words were heard coming from the corner where the house building was going on 
3440_171009_000026_000001	train-clean-100	Elsie left her game to try to make peace 
none	none	What is the matter Flora dear she asked soothingly of a little curly headed girl who was sobbing and wiping her eyes with the corner of her apron Enna took my blocks sobbed the child
3440_171009_000029_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh Enna won t you give them back said Elsie coaxingly you know Flora is a visitor and we must be very polite to her 
3440_171009_000030_000000	train-clean-100	 No I won t returned Enna flatly she s got enough now 
3440_171009_000031_000000	train-clean-100	 No I haven t I can t build a house with those Flora said with another sob 
3440_171009_000032_000000	train-clean-100	Elsie stood a moment looking much perplexed then with a brightening face exclaimed in her cheerful pleasant way Well never mind Flora dear I will get you my doll 
none	none	Will not that do quite as well Oh yes I d rather have the doll Elsie the little weeper answered eagerly smiling through her tears 
3440_171009_000033_000000	train-clean-100	Elsie ran out of the room and was back again almost in a moment with the doll in her arms 
none	none	There dear little Flora she said laying it gently on the child s lap please be careful of it for I have had it a long while and prize it very much because my guardian gave it to me when I was a very little girl and he is dead now
3440_171009_000035_000000	train-clean-100	 I won t break it Elsie indeed I won t replied Flora confidently and Elsie sat down to her game again 
none	none	A few moments afterward mister Horace Dinsmore passed through the room
3440_171009_000037_000000	train-clean-100	 Elsie he said as he caught sight of his little daughter go up to my dressing room 
none	none	There was evidently displeasure and reproof in his tone and entirely unconscious of wrongdoing Elsie looked up in surprise asking Why papa Because I bid you he replied and she silently obeyed wondering greatly what she had done to displease her father mister Dinsmore passed out of one door while Elsie left by the other The three little girls looked inquiringly into each other s faces What is the matter what has Elsie done asked Carry in a whisper
3440_171009_000043_000000	train-clean-100	 I don t know nothing I guess replied Lucy indignantly 
3440_171009_000043_000001	train-clean-100	 I do believe he s just the crossest man alive 
none	none	When I was here last summer he was all the time scolding and punishing poor Elsie for just nothing at all I think he must be very strict said Carry but Elsie seems to love him very much Strict I guess he is exclaimed Mary why only think girls he makes her do her lessons in the holidays I suspect she did not know her lesson and has to learn it over said Carry shaking her head wisely and that was the conclusion they all came to In the meantime Elsie sat down alone in her banishment and tried to think what she could have done to deserve it It was some time before she could form any idea of its cause but at length it suddenly came to her recollection that once several months before this her father had found her sitting on the carpet and had bade her get up immediately and sit on a chair or stool saying Never let me see you sitting on the floor Elsie when there are plenty of seats at hand 
3440_171009_000048_000001	train-clean-100	I consider it a very unladylike and slovenly trick 
none	none	She covered her face with her hands and sat thus for some moments feeling very sorry for her forgetfulness and disobedience very penitent on account of it and then kneeling down she asked forgiveness of God A full hour she had been there alone and the time had seemed very long when at last the door opened and her father came in Elsie rose and came forward to meet him with the air of one who had offended and knew she was in disgrace but putting one of her little hands in his she looked up pleadingly into his face asking in a slightly tremulous tone Dear papa are you angry with me I am always displeased when you disobey me Elsie he replied very gravely laying his other hand on her head I am very sorry I was naughty papa she said humbly and casting down her eyes but I had quite forgotten that you had told me not to sit on the floor and I could not think for a good while what it was that I had done wrong Is that an excuse for disobedience Elsie he asked in a tone of grave displeasure No sir I did not mean it so and I am very very sorry dear papa please forgive me and I will try never to forget again I think you disobeyed in another matter he said Yes sir I know it was very naughty to ask why but I think I will remember not to do it again Dear papa won t you forgive me He sat down and took her on his knee Yes daughter I will he said in his usual kind affectionate tone I am always ready to forgive my little girl when I see that she is sorry for a fault 
3440_171009_000060_000000	train-clean-100	She held up her face for a kiss which he gave 
none	none	I wish I could always be good papa she said but I am naughty so often
3440_171009_000062_000000	train-clean-100	 No said he I think you have been a very good girl for quite a long time 
none	none	If you were as naughty as Arthur and Enna I don t know what I should do with you whip you every day I suspect until I made a better girl of you Now you may go down to your mates but remember you are not to play jack stones again It was now lunch time and Elsie found the children in the nursery engaged in eating 
3440_171009_000064_000000	train-clean-100	Flora turned to her as she entered 
none	none	Please Elsie don t be cross she said coaxingly I am real sorry your doll s broken but it wasn t my fault Enna would try to snatch it and that made it fall and break its head Poor Elsie this was quite a trial and she could scarcely keep back the tears as following Flora s glance she saw her valued doll lying on the window seat with its head broken entirely off She said not a word but hastily crossing the room took it up and gazed mournfully at it 
3440_171009_000067_000000	train-clean-100	Kind missus Brown who had just finished helping her young charge all round followed her to the window Never mind dear she said in her pleasant cheery tone patting Elsie s cheek and smoothing her hair I ve got some excellent glue and I think I can stick it on again and make it almost as good as ever 
3440_171009_000067_000001	train-clean-100	So come sit down and eat your lunch and don t fret any more 
none	none	Thank you ma am you are very kind Elsie said trying to smile as the kind hearted old lady led her to the table and filled her plate with fruit and cakes These cakes are very simple not at all rich my dear but quite what your papa would approve of she said seeing the little girl look doubtfully at them
3440_171009_000070_000000	train-clean-100	 Doesn t your papa let you eat anything good Elsie asked Mary Leslie across the table 
3440_171009_000070_000001	train-clean-100	 He must be cross 
none	none	No indeed he is not Mary and he lets me eat everything that he thinks is good for me Elsie answered with some warmth She was seated between Caroline Howard and Lucy Carrington What did your papa send you away for Elsie whispered the latter
3440_171009_000074_000000	train-clean-100	 Please don t ask me Lucy replied the little girl blushing deeply Papa always has a good reason for what he does and he is just the dearest kindest and best father that ever anybody had 
none	none	Elsie spoke in an eager excited almost angry manner quite unusual with her while the hot tears came into her eyes for she knew very well what was Lucy s opinion of her father and more than half suspected that she had been making some unkind remark about him to the others and she was eager to remove any unfavorable impression they might have received I am sure he must love you very dearly Elsie remarked Caroline soothingly no one could help seeing that just by the way he looks at you Elsie answered her with a pleased and grateful look and then changed the subject by proposing that they should all take a walk as soon as they had finished eating as the day was fine and there would be plenty of time before dinner 
3440_171009_000078_000000	train-clean-100	The motion was carried without a dissenting voice and in a few moments they all set out a very merry party full of fun and frolic 
3440_171009_000078_000001	train-clean-100	They had a very pleasant time and returned barely in season to be dressed for dinner 
3440_171009_000079_000000	train-clean-100	They dined by themselves in the nursery but were afterward taken down to the drawing room 
none	none	Here Elsie found herself immediately seized upon by a young lady dressed in very gay and fashionable style whom she did not remember ever to have seen before but who insisted on seating the little girl on the sofa by her side and keeping her there a long while loading her with caresses and flattery My dear child she said what lovely hair you have so fine and soft and glossy such a beautiful color too and curls so splendidly Natural ringlets I m sure are they not Yes ma am Elsie answered simply wishing from the bottom of her heart that the lady would release her and talk to some one else But the lady had no such intention You are a very sweet little girl I am sure and I shall love you dearly she said kissing her several times Ah I would give anything if I had such a clear fair complexion and such rosy cheeks That makes you blush 
3440_171009_000083_000003	train-clean-100	Well I like to see it blushes are very becoming 
none	none	Oh you needn t pretend you don t know you re handsome you re a perfect little beauty Do tell me where did you get such splendid eyes But I needn t ask for I have only to look at your father to see where they came from 
3440_171009_000083_000007	train-clean-100	mister Dinsmore to Elsie s papa who just then came toward them you ought to be very proud of this child she is the very image of yourself and a perfect little beauty too 
none	none	Miss Stevens is pleased to flatter me he said bowing low but flattery is not good for either grown up children or younger ones and I must beg leave to decline the compliment as I cannot see that Elsie bears the slightest resemblance to me or any of my family She is very like her mother though he added with a half sigh and a tender loving glance at his little girl and that is just what I would have her But I am forgetting my errand Miss Stevens I came to ask if you will ride this afternoon as we are getting up a small party Yes thank you I should like it dearly it is such a lovely day But how soon do you start As soon as the ladies can be ready The horses will be at the door in a very few moments Ah then I must go and prepare she said rising and sailing out of the room mister Dinsmore took the seat she had vacated and passing his arm round his little girl said to her in an undertone My little daughter must not be so foolish as to believe that people mean all they say to her for some persons talk in a very thoughtless way and without perhaps intending to be exactly untruthful say a great deal that they really do not mean And I should be sorry indeed to see my little girl so spoiled by all this silly flattery as to grow up conceited and vain She looked at him with her own sweet innocent smile free from the slightest touch of vanity
3440_171009_000090_000000	train-clean-100	 No papa she said I do not mind when people say such things because I know the Bible says Favor is deceitful and beauty is vain and in another place He that flattereth his neighbor spreadeth a net for his feet So I will try to keep away from that lady shall I not papa 
none	none	Whenever you can do so without rudeness daughter and he moved away thinking to himself How strangely the teachings of that book seem to preserve my child from every evil influence A sigh escaped him 
3440_171009_000092_000001	train-clean-100	There was lurking within his breast a vague consciousness that her father needed such a safeguard but had it not 
3440_171009_000093_000000	train-clean-100	Lucy who was standing at the window turned quickly round 
3440_171009_000094_000000	train-clean-100	 Come girls she said let us run out and see them off they re bringing up the horses 
3440_171009_000094_000001	train-clean-100	And see there s Miss Adelaide in her riding dress and cap how pretty she looks 
none	none	And there s that Miss Stevens coming out now hateful thing I can t bear her Come Elsie and Carry And she ran out Caroline and Elsie following Elsie however went no further than the hall where she stood still at the foot of the stairs Come Elsie called the other two from the portico come out here No replied the little girl I cannot come without something round me Papa says it is too cold for me to be out in the wind to day with my neck and arms bare Pooh nonsense said Lucy tain t a bit cold do come now No Lucy I must obey my father Elsie answered in a very pleasant but no less decided tone Some one caught her round the waist and lifted her up Oh papa she exclaimed I did not know you were there I wish I was going too I don t like to have you go without me
3440_171009_000102_000000	train-clean-100	 I wish you were my pet I always love to have you with me but you know it wouldn t do you have your little guests to entertain 
3440_171009_000102_000001	train-clean-100	Good by darling 
none	none	Don t go out in the cold He kissed her as he always did now when leaving her even for an hour or two and set her down The little girls watched until the last of the party had disappeared down the avenue and then ran gayly up stairs to Elsie s room where they busied themselves until tea time in various little preparations for the evening such as dressing dolls and tying up bundles of confectionery et cetera to be hung upon the Christmas tree The children had all noticed that the doors of a parlor opening into the drawing room had been closed since morning to all but a favored few who passed in and out with an air of mystery and importance and generally laden with some odd looking bundle when going in which they invariably left behind on coming out again and many a whispered consultation had been held as to what was probably going on in there Elsie and Carry seemed to be in the secret but only smiled and shook their heads wisely when questioned 
3440_171009_000106_000000	train-clean-100	But at length tea being over and all both old and young assembled as if by common consent in the drawing room it began to be whispered about that their curiosity was now on the point of being gratified 
none	none	All were immediately on the qui vive and every face brightened with mirth and expectation and when a moment after the doors were thrown open there was a universal burst of applause 
3440_171009_000108_000000	train-clean-100	A large Christmas tree had been set up at the further end of the room and with its myriad of lighted tapers and its load of toys and bonbons interspersed with many a richer and more costly gift made quite a display 
3440_171009_000109_000000	train-clean-100	 Beautiful beautiful cried the children clapping their hands and dancing about with delight while their elders perhaps equally pleased expressed their admiration after a more staid and sober fashion 
none	none	When they thought their handiwork had been sufficiently admired missus Dinsmore and Adelaide approached the tree and began the pleasant task of distributing the gifts Everything was labelled and each as his or her name was called out stepped forward to receive the present No one had been forgotten each had something and almost every one had several pretty presents Mary Leslie and little Flora Arnott were made perfectly happy with wax dolls that could open and shut their eyes Caroline Howard received a gold chain from her mamma and a pretty pin from Elsie Lucy a set of coral ornaments besides several smaller presents and others were equally fortunate All was mirth and hilarity only one clouded face to be seen and that belonged to Enna who was pouting in a corner because Mary Leslie s doll was a little larger than hers Elsie had already received a pretty bracelet from her Aunt Adelaide a needle case from Lora and several little gifts from her young guests and was just beginning to wonder what had become of her papa s promised present when she heard her name again and Adelaide turning to her with a pleased look slipped a most beautiful diamond ring on her finger
3440_171009_000113_000000	train-clean-100	 From your papa she said 
3440_171009_000113_000001	train-clean-100	 Go and thank him it is well worth it 
none	none	Elsie sought him out where he stood alone in a corner an amused spectator of the merry scene See papa she said holding up her hand I think it very beautiful thank you dear papa thank you very much Does it please you my darling he asked stooping to press a kiss on the little upturned face so bright and happy Yes papa I think it is lovely the very prettiest ring I ever saw Yet I think there is something else you would have liked better is there not he asked looking searchingly into her face Dear papa I like it very much I would rather have it than anything else on the tree Still you have not answered my question he said with a smile as he sat down and drew her to his side adding in a playful tone Come I am not going to put up with any evasion tell me truly if you would have preferred something else and if so what it is Elsie blushed and looked down then raising her eyes and seeing with what a tender loving glance he was regarding her she took courage to say Yes papa there is one thing I would have liked better and that is your miniature To her surprise he looked highly pleased at her reply and giving her another kiss said Well darling some day you shall have it mister Horace Dinsmore called Adelaide taking some small glittering object from the tree Another present for me he asked as Walter came running with it He had already received several from his father and sisters but none had seemed to give him half the pleasure that this did when he saw that it was labelled From his little daughter 
3440_171009_000126_000000	train-clean-100	It was only a gold pencil 
none	none	The miniature with which the artist had succeeded so well that nothing could have been prettier except the original herself she had reserved to be given in another way Do you like it papa she asked her face glowing with delight to see how pleased he was Yes darling very much and I shall always think of my little girl when I use it
3440_171009_000129_000000	train-clean-100	 Keep it in your pocket and use it every day won t you papa 
3440_171009_000130_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes my pet I will but I thought you said you had no present for me 
none	none	Oh no no papa I said there was none for you amongst those bundles I had bought this but had given it to Aunt Adelaide to take care of for fear you might happen to see it Ah that was it eh and he laughed and stroked her hair Here Elsie here is your bundle of candy said Walter running up to them again Everybody has one and that is yours Adelaide says 
3440_171009_000134_000000	train-clean-100	He put it in her hand and ran away again 
3440_171009_000134_000001	train-clean-100	Elsie looked up in her father s face inquiringly 
none	none	No darling he said taking the paper from her hand and examining its contents not to night to morrow after breakfast you may eat the cream candy and the rock but none of the others they are colored and very unwholesome Won t you eat some papa she asked with winning sweetness
3440_171009_000137_000000	train-clean-100	 No dearest he said for though I too am fond of sweet things I will not eat them while I refuse them to you 
3440_171009_000138_000000	train-clean-100	 Do papa she urged it would give me pleasure to see you enjoying it 
none	none	No darling I will wait until to morrow too Then please keep it for me until to morrow papa will you Yes he said putting it in his pocket and then as the gifts had all been distributed and the little folks were in high glee a variety of sports were commenced by them in which some of their elders also took a part and thus the hours sped away so rapidly that Elsie was very much surprised when her father called her to go to bed
3440_171009_000142_000000	train-clean-100	 Is it half past nine already papa she asked 
3440_171009_000143_000000	train-clean-100	 It is ten my dear child and high time you were in bed he said smiling at her look of astonishment 
none	none	I hope you have enjoyed yourself Oh so much papa Good night and thank you for letting me stay up so long CHAPTER FIFTEENTH Ask me not why I should love her Look upon those soulful eyes Look while mirth or feeling move her And see there how sweetly rise Thoughts gay and gentle from a breast Which is of innocence the nest Which though each joy were from it shred By truth would still be tenanted HOFFMAN S Poems It was yet dark when Elsie awoke but hearing the clock strike five she knew it was morning She lay still a little while and then slipping softly out of bed put her feet into her slippers threw her warm dressing gown around her and feeling for a little package she had left on her toilet table she secured it and stole noiselessly from the room All was darkness and silence in the house but she had no thought of fear and gliding gently down the hall to her papa s door she turned the handle very cautiously when to her great delight she found it had been left unfastened and yielded readily to her touch She entered as quietly as a little mouse listened a moment until satisfied from his breathing that her father was still sound asleep then stepping softly across the room she laid her package down where he could not fail to see it as soon as daylight came and his eyes were opened This accomplished she stole back again as noiselessly as she had come Who dat demanded Chloe starting up in bed as Elsie reentered her own apartment It is only I did I frighten you mammy answered the little girl with a merry laugh Ki chile dat you what you doin runnin bout de house all in de dark cold night It isn t night mammy I heard it strike five some time ago Well den dis chile gwine get right up an make de fire But jes you creep back into de bed darlin fore you cotch your death ob cold I will mammy Elsie said doing as she was desired but please dress me as soon as the room is warm enough won t you Yes darlin kase ob course I knows you want to be up early o Christmas mornin Ki Miss Elsie dat s a beautiful shawl you gave your ole mammy I sha n t feel de cold at all dis winter I hope not mammy and were Aunt Phillis and Uncle Jack and all the rest pleased with their presents I reckon dey was darlin mos ready to go off de handle tirely Chloe had soon built up her fire and coaxed it into a bright blaze and in a few moments more she pronounced the room sufficiently warm for her nursling to get up and be dressed Elsie was impatient to go to her father but even after she had been carefully dressed and all her morning duties attended to it was still so early that Chloe advised her to wait a little longer assuring her that it was only a very short time since John had gone in to make his master s fire and supply him with hot water for shaving So the little girl sat down and tried to drown her impatience in the pages of a new book one of her Christmas presents But Chloe presently stole softly behind her chair and holding up high above her head some glittering object attached to a pretty gold chain let it gradually descend until it rested upon the open book Elsie started and jumped up with an exclamation of surprise Wonder if you knows dat general leman darlin laughed Chloe Oh it is papa cried the little girl catching it in her hand my own dear darling papa oh how good of him to give it to me and she danced about the room in her delight It is just himself so exactly like him Isn t it a good likeness mammy she asked drawing near the light to examine it more closely Dear dear darling papa and she kissed it again and again Then gently drawing her mother s miniature from her bosom she laid them side by side My papa and mamma are they not beautiful mammy both of them she asked raising her swimming eyes to the dusky face leaning over her and gazing with such mournful fondness at the sweet girlish countenance so life like and beautiful yet calling up thoughts of sorrow and bereavement My darling young missus murmured the old nurse my own precious chile dat dese arms hab carried so many years dis ole heart like to break when eber I tinks ob you an members how your bright young face done gone away foreber The big tears were rolling fast down the sable cheeks and dropping like rain on Elsie s curls while the broad bosom heaved with sobs But your ole mammy s been good to your little chile dat you lef behind darlin deed she has she went on Yes mammy indeed indeed you have Elsie said twining her arms lovingly around her But don t let us cry any more for we know that dear mamma is very happy in heaven and does not wish us to grieve for her now I shall not show you the picture any more if it makes you cry like that she added half playfully Not always chile Chloe said wiping away her tears but jes dis here mornin Christmas mornin when she was always so bright and merry It seems only yesterday she went dancin about jes like you Yes mammy dear but she is with the angels now my sweet pretty mamma Elsie whispered softly with another tender loving look at the picture ere she returned it to its accustomed resting place in her bosom And now I must go to papa she said more cheerfully for it is almost breakfast time Is my darling satisfied now he asked as she ran into his arms and was folded in a close embrace Yes papa indeed I am thank you a thousand times it is all I wanted And you have given me the most acceptable present you could have found It is a most excellent likeness and I am delighted with it I am so glad papa but it was Aunt Adelaide who thought of it Ah that was very kind of her But how does my little girl feel this morning after all her dissipation Oh very well thank you papa You will not want to say any lesson to day I suppose Oh yes if you please papa and it does not give you too much trouble she said It is the very pleasantest hour in the day except Well except what Ah yes I understand Well my pet it shall be as you wish but come to me directly after breakfast as I am going out early Elsie had had her hour with her father but though he had left her and gone out she still lingered in his dressing room looking over the next day s lesson At length however she closed the book and left the room intending to seek her young guests who were in the lower part of the house Miss Stevens door was open as she passed and that lady called to her Elsie dear you sweet little creature come here and see what I have for you Elsie obeyed though rather reluctantly and Miss Stevens bidding her sit down went to a drawer and took out a large paper of mixed candy all of the best and most expensive kinds which she put into the little girl s hands with one of her sweetest smiles It was a strong temptation to a child who had a great fondness for such things but Elsie had prayed from her heart that morning for strength to resist temptation and it was given her Thank you ma am you are very kind she said gratefully but I cannot take it because papa does not approve of my eating such things He gave me a little this morning but said I must not have any more for a long time Now that is quite too bad exclaimed Miss Stevens but at least take one or two child that much couldn t possibly hurt you and your papa need never know Elsie gave her a look of grieved surprise Oh could you think I would do that she said But God would know Miss Stevens and I should know it myself and how could I ever look my papa in the face again after deceiving him so Really my dear you are making a very serious matter of a mere trifle laughed the lady why I have deceived my father more than fifty times and never thought it any harm But here is something I am sure you can take and indeed you must for I bought both it and the candy expressly for you She replaced the candy in the drawer as she spoke and took from another a splendidly bound book which she laid in Elsie s lap saying with a triumphant air There my dear what do you think of that is it not handsome Elsie s eyes sparkled books were her greatest treasures but feeling an instinctive repugnance to taking a gift from one whom she could neither respect nor love she made an effort to decline it though at the same time thanking the lady warmly for her kind intentions But Miss Stevens would hear of no refusal and fairly forced it upon her acceptance declaring that as she had bought it expressly for her she should feel extremely hurt if she did not take it Then I will Miss Stevens said the little girl and I am sure you are very kind I love books and pictures too and these are lovely engravings she added turning over the leaves with undisguised pleasure Yes and the stories are right pretty too remarked Miss Stevens Yes ma am they look as if they were and I should like dearly to read them Well dear just sit down and read there s nothing to hinder I m sure your little friends can do without you for an hour or two Or if you prefer it take the book and enjoy it with them it is your own you know to use as you like Thank you ma am but though I can look at the pictures I must not read the stories until I have asked papa because he does not allow me to read anything now without first showing it to him Dear me how very strict he is exclaimed Miss Stevens I wonder she thought to herself if he would expect to domineer over his wife in that style Elsie was slowly turning over the leaves of the book enjoying the pictures very much studying them intently but resolutely refraining from even glancing over the printed pages But at length she closed it and looking out of the window said with a slight sigh Oh I wish papa would come but I m afraid he won t for a long while and I do so want to read these stories Suppose you let me read one to you suggested Miss Stevens that would not be your reading it you know Elsie looked shocked at the proposal Oh no ma am thank you I know you mean to be kind but I could not do it it would be so very wrong quite the same I am sure as if I read it with my own eyes she answered hurriedly and then fearing to be tempted further she excused herself and went in search of her young companions She found them in the drawing room Wasn t it too provoking Elsie that those people didn t send home my bracelet last night exclaimed Caroline Howard I have just been telling Lucy about it I think that it was such a shame for them to disappoint me for I wanted to have it on the tree I am sorry you were disappointed Carry but perhaps it will come to day Elsie answered in a sympathizing tone And then she showed the new book which she still held in her hand They spent some time in examining it talking about and admiring the pictures and then went out for a walk Has papa come in yet mammy was Elsie s first question on returning Yes darlin I tink he s in the drawin room dis berry minute Chloe answered as she took off the little girl s hat and carefully smoothed her hair There there mammy won t that do now I m in a little bit of a hurry Elsie said with a merry little laugh as she slipped playfully from under her nurse s hand and ran down stairs But she was doomed to disappointment for the present for her papa was seated on the sofa beside Miss Stevens talking to her and so she must wait a little longer At last however he rose went to the other side of the room and stood a moment looking out of the window Then Elsie hastened to take her book from a table where she had laid it and going up to him said Papa He turned round instantly asking in a pleasant tone Well daughter what is it She put the book into his hand saying eagerly It is a Christmas gift from Miss Stevens papa will you let me read it He did not answer immediately but turned over the leaves glancing rapidly over page after page but not too rapidly to be able to form a pretty correct idea of the contents No daughter he said handing it back to her you must content yourself with looking at the pictures they are by far the best part the stories are very unsuitable for a little girl of your age and would indeed be unprofitable reading for any one She looked a little disappointed I am glad I can trust my little daughter and feel certain that she will not disobey me he said smiling kindly on her and patting her cheek She answered him with a bright happy look full of confiding affection laid the book await without a murmur and left the room her father s eyes following her with a fond loving glance Miss Stevens who had watched them both closely during this little scene bit her lips with vexation at the result of her manoeuvre She had come to Roselands with the fixed determination to lay siege to mister Horace Dinsmore s heart and flattering and petting his little daughter was one of her modes of attack but his decided disapproval of her present she perceived did not augur well for the success of her schemes She was by no means in despair however for she had great confidence in the power of her own personal attractions being really tolerably pretty and considering herself a great beauty as well as very highly accomplished As Elsie ran out into the hall she found herself suddenly caught in mister Travilla s arms A merry Christmas and a happy New Year little Elsie he said kissing her on both cheeks Now I have caught you figuratively and literally my little lady so what are you going to give me eh Indeed sir I think you ve helped yourself to the only thing I have to give at present she answered with a merry silvery laugh Nay give me one little lady said he one such hug and kiss as I dare say your father gets half a dozen times in a day She gave it very heartily Ah I wish you were ten years older he said as he set her down If I had been you wouldn t have got the kiss she replied smiling archly Now it s my turn he said taking something from his pocket I expected you d catch me and so thought it best to come prepared He took her hand as he spoke and placed a beautiful little gold thimble on her finger There that s to encourage you in industry Thank you sir oh it s a little beauty I must run and show it to papa But I must not forget my politeness she added hastily throwing open the drawing room door Come in mister Travilla She waited quietly until the usual greetings were exchanged then went up to her father and showed her new gift He quite entered into her pleasure and remarked with a glance at Miss Stevens that her friends were very kind The lady s hopes rose He was then pleased with her attention to his child even though he did not altogether approve her choice of a gift There was a large party to dinner that day and the children came down to the dessert Miss Stevens who had contrived to be seated next to mister Dinsmore made an effort on the entrance of the juveniles to have Elsie placed on her other side but mister Travilla was too quick for her and had his young favorite on his knee before she could gain her attention The lady was disappointed and Elsie herself only half satisfied but the two gentlemen who thoroughly understood Miss Stevens and saw through all her manoeuvres exchanged glances of amusement and satisfaction After dinner mister Travilla invited Elsie Carry Lucy and Mary to take a ride in his carriage which invitation was joyfully accepted by all mister Dinsmore giving a ready consent to Elsie s request to be permitted to go They had a very merry time for mister Travilla quite laid himself out for their entertainment and no one knew better than he how to amuse ladies of their age It was nearly dark when they returned and Elsie went at once to her room to be dressed for the evening But she found it unoccupied Aunt Chloe as it afterward appeared having gone down to the quarter to carry some of the little girl s gifts to one or two who were too old and feeble to come up to the house to receive them Elsie rang the bell waited a little and then feeling impatient to be dressed ran down to the kitchen to see what had become of her nurse A very animated discussion was going on there just at that moment between the cook and two or three of her sable companions and the first words that reached the child s ears as she stood on the threshold were I tell you you ole darkie you dunno nuffin bout it Massa Horace gwine marry dat bit ob paint an finery no such ting Massa s got more sense The words were spoken in a most scornful tone and Elsie into whose childish mind the possibility of her father s marrying again had never entered stood spellbound with astonishment But the conversation went on the speakers quite unconscious of her vicinity It was Pompey s voice that replied Ef Marse Horace don t like her what for they been gwine ridin ebery afternoon will you tell me dat darkies an don t dis niggah see him sit beside her mornin noon an night laughin an talkin at de table an in de parlor an don t she keep a kissin little Miss Elsie an callin her pretty critter sweet critter an de like She ma to our sweet little Miss Elsie Bah I tell you Pomp Marse Horace got more sense returned the cook indignantly Aunt Chloe don t b lieve no such stuff put in another voice she says Marse Horace couldn t put such trash in her sweet young mistis s place Aunt Chloe s a berry fine woman no doubt observed Pomp disdainfully but I reckon Marse Horace ain t gwine to infide his matermonical intentions to her and I consider it quite consequential on Marster s being young and handsome that he will take another wife The next speaker said something about his having lived a good while without and though Miss Stevens was setting her cap maybe he wouldn t be caught But Elsie only gathered the sense of it hardly heard the words and bounding away like a frightened deer to her own room her little heart beating wildly with a confused sense of suffering she threw herself on the bed She shed no tears but there was oh such a weight on her heart such a terrible though vague sense of the instability of all earthly happiness There Chloe found her and wondered much what ailed her darling what made her so silent and yet so restless and caused such a deep flush on her cheek She feared she was feverish her little hand was so hot and dry but Elsie insisted that she was quite well and so Chloe tried to think it was only fatigue She would fain have persuaded the little girl to lie still upon her bed and rest and let her tea be brought to her there but Elsie answered that she would much rather be dressed and join her young companions in the nursery They too wondered what ailed her she was so very quiet and ate almost nothing at all They asked if she was sick She only shook her head Was she tired then Yes she believed she was and she leaned her head wearily on her hand But indeed most of the party seemed dull they had gone through such a round of pleasure and excitement for the last two or three days that now a reaction was beginning and they wanted rest especially the very little ones who all retired quite early when Elsie and her mates joined their parents in the drawing room Elsie looked eagerly around for her father the moment she entered the room He was beside Miss Stevens who was at the piano performing a very difficult piece of music He was leaning over her turning the leaves and apparently listening with a great deal of pleasure for she was really a fine musician Elsie felt sick at heart at the sight although a few hours before it would have given her no concern and found it very difficult to listen to and answer the remarks missus Carrington was making to her about her Christmas presents and the nice ride they had had that afternoon mister Travilla was watching her he had noticed as soon as she came in the sad and troubled look which had come over her face and following the glance of her eyes he guessed at the cause He knew there was no danger of the trial that she feared and would have been glad to tell her so but he felt that it was too delicate a subject for him to venture on it might seem too much like meddling in mister Dinsmore s affairs But he did the next best thing got the four little girls into a corner and tried to entertain them with stories and charades Elsie seemed interested for a time but every now and then her eyes would wander to the other side of the room where her father still stood listening to Miss Stevens music At length mister Travilla was called away to give his opinion about some tableaux the young ladies were arranging and Elsie knowing it was her usual time for retiring and not caring to avail herself of her father s permission to stay up until nine o clock stole quietly away to her room unobserved by any one and feeling as if Miss Stevens had already robbed her of her father She wiped away a few quiet tears as she went and was very silent and sad while her mammy was preparing her for bed She hardly knew how to do without her good night kiss but feeling as she did it had seemed quite impossible to ask for it while Miss Stevens was so near him When she knelt down to pray she became painfully conscious that a feeling of positive dislike to that lady had been creeping into her heart and she asked earnestly to be enabled to put it away But she prayed also that she might be spared the trial that she feared if God s will were so and she thought surely it was because she had found out that Miss Stevens was not good not truthful or sincere Perhaps dear papa will come to say good night before I am asleep she murmured to herself as calmed and soothed by thus casting her burden on the Lord she laid her head upon her pillow He however had become interested in the subject of the tableaux and did not miss his little girl until the sound of the clock striking ten reminded him of her and he looked around expecting to see her still in the room but not seeing her he asked Lucy Carrington where she was Oh said Lucy she s been gone these two hours I should think I guess she must have gone to bed Strange that she did not come to bid me goodnight he exclaimed in a low tone more as if thinking aloud than speaking to Lucy He hastily left the room mister Travilla followed Dinsmore said he mister Dinsmore stopped and Travilla drawing him to one side said in an undertone I think my little friend is in trouble to night Ah he exclaimed with a startled look what can it be I did not hear of any accident she has not been hurt is not sick tell me Travilla quickly if anything ails my child Nothing nothing Dinsmore only you know servants will talk and children have ears and eyes too sometimes and I saw her watching you to night with a very sad expression Nonsense exclaimed mister Dinsmore growing very red and looking extremely vexed I wouldn t have had such thoughts put into the child s head for any money Are you sure of it Travilla I am sure she was watching you very closely tonight and looking very miserable Poor darling murmured the father Thank you Travilla shaking his friend heartily by the hand Good night I shall not be down again if you will be so good as to excuse me to the others And he went up the stairs almost at a bound and the next moment was standing beside his sleeping child looking anxiously down at the little flushed cheeks and tear swollen eyes for disappointed that he did not come to bid her good night she had cried herself to sleep Poor darling he murmured again as he stooped over her and kissed away a tear that still trembled on her eyelash He longed to tell her that all her fears were groundless that none other could ever fill her place in his heart but he did not like to wake her and so pressing another light kiss on her cheek he left her to dream on unconscious of his visit End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Elsie Dinsmore by Martha Finley END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG
