Illustration KIT AND HIS FAVORITE HORSE APACHE TO colonel CERAN saint VRAIN OF NEW MEXICO DEAR SIR You were first among the brave mountaineers to discover and direct the manly energy extraordinary natural ability and unyielding courage which have attached to the subject of this volume and as among the first Americans who put foot on the Rocky Mountains you are perhaps best acquainted with the history of the men who for fifty years have lived there CHRISTOPHER CARSON after a long life now crowned with successful and honorable achievements still looks upon you sir as his earliest patron and places your name on the list of his warmest friends Through a life of unusual activity and duration which reflecting honor and renown upon your name has given you a distinguished position among your countrymen you have never been known to forget a duty to your fellow man For these considerations the dedication of this volume to you cannot but appear appropriate That he may continue to merit a place in your confidence and esteem is the earnest desire of THE AUTHOR FERNANDEZ DE TAOS NEW MEXICO SIR We the undersigned citizens of the Territory of New Mexico have been acquainted with mister CHRISTOPHER CARSON for a number of years indeed almost from the time of his first arrival in the country We have been his companions both in the mountains and as a private citizen We are also acquainted with the fact that for the past few months during his leisure hours he has been engaged dictating his life This is to our certain knowledge the only authentic biography of himself and his travels that has ever been written We heartily recommend THIS BOOK to the reading community for perusal as it presents a life out of the usual routine of business and is checkered with adventures which have tried this bold and daring man We are cognizant of most of the details of the book and vouch for their accuracy Very respectfully CERAN saint VRAIN LIEUT colonel N M VOLUNTEERS CHARLES BEAUBIEN LATE CIRCUIT JUDGE THE AUTHOR S PREFACE The pages here presented to the public form a book of facts They unfold for the student as does no other work yet extant the great interior wilderness of the territories belonging to the United States The scenic views though plainly colored and wrought by the hand of an unpretending artist inasmuch as they portray a part of the North American continent which is unsurpassed by any other country on the face of the earth will not fail to interest the American public In addition to this the reader is introduced to an intimate acquaintance with the Indian races of the countries which He east and west of the Rocky Mountains The savage warrior and hunter is presented stripped of all the decorations with which writers of fiction have dressed him He is seen in his ferocity and gentleness in his rascality and nobility in his boyhood manhood and old age and in his wisdom and ignorance The attentive reader will learn of his approximations to truth his bundle of superstitions his acts at home and on the war path his success while following the buffalo and engaging the wild Rocky Mountain bear that terror of the western wilderness He will also behold him carrying devastation to the homes of the New Mexican settlers and freely spilling their best blood to satiate a savage revenge He will see him attacking and massacring parties of the white men traveling across the prairies and trace him in his savage wars with the early settlers and frontiersmen In order to acquire these important data that they might be added to the pages of American history and form a reliable record it was necessary that some brave bold and determined man should become an actor on the scenes and among the races described Such an actor has been and yet is Christopher Carson the Nestor of the Rocky Mountains and it is the experience as well as the acts of his stirring life which the following pages present In olden times there existed in the Rocky Mountains a race familiarly known by the name of Trappers and Hunters They are now almost extinct Their history has not yet been written Pen paintings drawn from the imagination founded upon distant views of their exploits and adventures have occasionally served as do legends to adorn a tale The volume now offered to the public gives their history as related by one whose name as a trapper and hunter of the Far West stands second to none by a man who for fifteen years saw not the face of a white woman or slept under a roof who during those long years with his rifle alone killed over two thousand buffalo between four and five thousand deer antelope and elk besides wild game such as bears wild turkeys prairie chickens et cetera et cetera in numbers beyond calculation On account of their originality daring and interest the real facts concerning this race of trappers and hunters will be handed down to posterity as matters belonging to history As is the case with the Indian the race of the Simon Pure Trapper is nearly run The advance of civilization keeping up its untiring march to the westward is daily encroaching upon their wild haunts and bringing the day close at hand when warrior and trapper will depart forever to their Happy Hunting Grounds With the extinction of the great fur companies the trappers of Olden Time disbanded and separated The greatest number of these men to be found at the present day reside in the Territory of New Mexico which in the time of their prosperity was the country where they located their head quarters In this Territory Christopher Carson now resides His name in the Rocky Mountains has been familiarly known for more than a quarter of a century and from its association with the names of great explorers and military men is now spread throughout the civilized world It has been generally conceded and the concession has become strengthened by time that no small share of the benefits derived from these explorations and campaigns as well as the safety of the commands themselves was and is due to the sagacity skill experience advice and labor of Christopher Carson The exploring parties and expeditions here referred to are those which he accompanied in the capacity of chief guide and adviser His sober habits strict honor and great regard for truth have endeared him to all who can call him friend and among such may be enumerated names belonging to some of the most distinguished men whose deeds are recorded on the pages of American history His past life has been a mystery which this book will unveil Instead of Kit Carson as by imagination a bold braggart and reckless improvident hero of the rifle he will appear a retired man and one who is very reserved in his intercourse with others This fact alone will account for the difficulty which has hitherto attended presenting the public with an accurate history of his life A few years since the writer of this work first met Christopher Carson It needed neither a second introduction nor the assistance of a friendly panegyric to enable him to discover in Christopher Carson those traits of manhood which are esteemed by the great and good to be distinguishing ornaments of character This acquaintance ripened into a friendship of the purest stamp Since then the writer has been the intimate friend and companion of Christopher Carson at his home in the wild scenes of the chase on the war trail and upon the field of battle For a long period in common with hundreds and we might with truth add thousands the writer has desired to see Christopher Carson s wonderful career made public for the world of readers but while this idea was germinating in his brain he did not for an instant flatter himself that the pleasant task would ever be assigned to him Finally however at the urgent solicitation of many personal friends Christopher Carson dictated the facts upon which this book is written They were then placed in the writer s hands with instructions to add to them such information as had fallen under his observation during quite extensive travels over a large part of the wide expanse of country which has been Christopher Carson s theatre for action The book is a book of solid truth therefore the faults in the style arrangement and composition become affairs of minor consideration For this reason the writer makes no apologies to embarrass the critics Christopher Carson physically is small in stature but of compact frame work He has a large and finely developed head a twinkling grey eye and hair of a sandy color which he wears combed back a la Franklin mode His education having been much neglected in his youth he is deficient in theoretical learning By natural abilities however he has greatly compensated for this defect He speaks the French and Spanish languages fluently besides being a perfect master of several Indian dialects In Indian customs their manners habits and the groundwork of their conduct no man on the American continent is better skilled The writer while on a foreign tour once had the opportunity and pleasure of hearing Gordon Cumming and other hunters of less note discourse on their hunting exploits furthermore in our own country while seated around camp fires and in log houses he has listened to the adventures of ancient and modern Nimrods in the chase besides these facts he has both seen and read much of hunting exploits but no hunter ever filled his fancy so perfectly as does Christopher Carson a man who acts and never boasts Without further comment the reader is presented with the work while the writer cherishes the hope that the facts which for the first time are given to the world will prove to be both interesting and important as jottings of history The author begs leave to return to his friend C HATCH SMITH A M of Brooklyn New York his acknowledgment for valuable assistance in revising correcting and arranging his manuscript one hundred ninety six Twenty third street

Adventures on the Prairies Broaders is Wounded Carson s Nerve put to the Test Rude Amputation Safe Arrival at Santa Fe Goes to Taos and learns the Spanish Language Early Vicissitudes Disappointment and Attempt to return to Missouri Is employed as an Interpreter Teamster et cetera It is now a well established fact that no State in the American Union has given birth to so many distinguished pioneers and explorers of its boundless Territories as the commonwealth of Kentucky An Author whose task is to tell of a Hero his bravery endurance privations integrity self denial and deeds of daring carries the morale with which to gain at once for these characteristics the assent of the reader by the simple assertion My Hero was born a Kentuckian Indeed in America to be a native of the State of Kentucky is to inherit all the attributes of a brave man a safe counsellor and a true friend It is at least certain that this State whether the fact is due to its inland and salubrious climate or to its habits of physical training has added many a Hero unto humanity Christopher Carson by his countrymen familiarly called Kit Carson was born in the County of Madison State of Kentucky on the twenty fourth day of December eighteen oh nine The Carson family were among the first settlers of Kentucky and became owners of fine farms Besides being an industrious and skillful farmer the father of Kit Carson was a celebrated hunter When the Indians of Kentucky became quieted down putting an end to the calls upon his courage and skill as a woodsman he settled into a simple respectable farmer This monotonous life did not suit his disposition and as the tide of emigration into the wilds of Missouri was then commencing where both game and the red man still roamed he resolved to migrate in that direction It was only one year after the birth of his son Christopher that mister Carson sold his estate in Kentucky and established himself with his large family in that part of the State of Missouri now known as Howard County At this time Howard County Missouri was a wilderness on the remote American frontier At his new home the father was in his element His reputation of carrying an unerring rifle and always enacting the deeds of a brave man was not long in following him into this wilderness mister Carson s only assistant on his first arrival in Howard County was his eldest son Moses Carson who was afterwards settled in the State of California where he resided twenty five years before the great California gold discovery was made For two or three years after arriving at their new home the Carson family with a few neighbors lived in a picketed log fort and when they were engaged in agricultural pursuits working their farms and so forth it was necessary to plough sow and reap under guard men being stationed at the sides and extremities of their fields to prevent the working party from being surprised and massacred by wild and hostile savages who infested the country At this time the small pox that disease which has proved such a terrible scourge to the Indian had but seldom visited him one Footnote one This disease has probably been the worst enemy with which the red man of America has had to contend By terrible experience he has become familiarized with its ravages and has resorted to the most desperate remedies for its cure Among many tribes the afflicted are obliged to form camps by themselves and thus left alone they die by scores One of their favorite remedies when the scourge first makes its appearance is to plunge into the nearest river by which they think to purify themselves This course however in reality tends to shorten their existence When the small pox rages among the Aborigines a most unenviable position is held by their Medicine Man He is obliged to give a strict account of himself and if so unfortunate as to lose a chief or other great personage is sure to pay the penalty by parting with his own life The duties of the Medicine Man among the Indians are so mixed up with witchcraft and jugglery so filled with the pretence of savage quackery so completely rude and unfounded as to principle that it is impossible to define the practice for any useful end About five years since a young gentleman of scientific habits who was attached to an exploring party accidentally became separated from his companions In his wanderings he fell in with a band of hostile Sioux Indians who would quickly have dispatched him had he not succeeded immediately in convincing them of his wonderful powers It so happened that this gentleman was well informed in the theory of vaccination and it struck him that by impressing on the savages his skill he might extricate himself By the aid of signs a lancet and some virus he set himself to work and soon saw that he had gained a reputation which saved him his scalp He first vaccinated his own arm after which all of the Indians present solicited his magic touch to save them from the loathsome disease The result was that he found he had enlisted himself in an active practice After a few days the Indians were delighted with the results and began to look upon their prisoner as possessed of superhuman knowledge They feared to do him injury and finally resolved to let him go of which privilege it is almost unnecessary to say he was delighted to avail himself and was not long in finding his friends The incidents which enliven and add interest to the historic page have proved of spontaneous and vigorous growth in the new settlements of America Nearly every book which deals with the early planting and progress of the American colonists and pioneers contains full and frequently glowing descriptions of exploits in the forest strifes of the hunter fights with the savages fearful and terrible surprises of lurking warriors as they arouse the brave settler and his family from their midnight dreams by the wild death announcing war whoop hair breadth escapes from the larger kinds of game boldly bearded in their lair the manly courage which never yields but surmounts every obstacle presented by the unbroken and boundless forest all these are subjects and facts which have already so many counterparts in book thought accessible to the general reader that their details may be safely omitted during the boyhood days of young Carson It is better therefore to pass over the youthful period of his eventful life until he began to ripen into manhood Kit Carson at fifteen years of age was no ordinary person He had at this early age earned and well earned a reputation on the basis of which the prediction was ventured in his behalf that he would not fail to make and leave a mark upon the hearts of his countrymen Those who knew him at the age of fifteen hesitated not to say Kit Carson is the boy who will grow into a man of influence and renown The chief points of his character which elicited this prediction were thus early clearly marked Some of his traits were kindness and good qualities of heart determined perseverance indomitable will unflinching courage great quickness and shrewdness of perception and promptitude in execution The predictions uttered by the hardy rangers of the forest concerning a boy like Carson are seldom at fault and Kit was one who by many a youthful feat worthy the muscle of riper years had endeared himself to their honest love It was among such men and for such reason that Kit Carson thus early in life had won the influence and rewards of a general favorite His frame was slight below the medium stature closely knit together and endowed with extraordinary elasticity He had even then stood the test of much hard usage What the body lacked in strength was more than compensated for by his indomitable will consequently at this early age he was considered capable of performing a frontier man s work both in tilling the soil and handling the rifle It was at this period of his eventful life that his father acting partially under the advice of friends determined that his son Kit should learn a trade A few miles from Kit s forest home there lived a mister David Workman a saddler To him he was apprenticed With mister Workman young Carson remained two years enjoying both the confidence and respect of his employer but mourning over the awl the hide of new leather the buckle and strap for the glorious shade of the mighty forest the wild battle with buffalo and bear the crack of the unerring rifle pointed at the trembling deer Saddlery is an honorable employment but saddlery never made a greater mistake than when it strove to hitch to its traces the bold impulse the wild yearning the sinewy muscle of Kit Carson Harness making was so irksome to his ardent temperament and brave heart that he resolved to take advantage of the first favorable opportunity and quit it forever With him to resolve has ever been followed by action During the latter part of his stay with mister Workman many stories of adventures in the Rocky Mountains reached the ear of the youthful Kentuckian in his Missouri home The almost miraculous hyperbole which flavored the narratives were not long in awakening in his breast a strong desire to share in such stirring events The venturesome mind at last became inspired He determined to go and giving his restless spirit full sway in eighteen twenty six joined a party bound for his boyish fancy pictures of the Elysian Fields The leader of this expedition required no second request from young Carson before enrolling his name on the company list The hardy woodsman saw stamped upon the frank and open countenance of the boy who stood before him those sterling qualities which have since made his name a household word These formed a passport which on the spot awakened the respect and unlocked the hearts of those whose companionship he sought The work of preparation was now commenced by the different parties to the expedition All of the arrangements having been finally completed the bold and hardy band soon started upon their journey Their route lay over the vast and then unexplored territory bounded by the Rocky Mountains on the one side and the Missouri River on the other Before them lay stretched out in almost never ending space those great prairies the half of which are still unknown to the white man Crossing the plains in eighteen twenty six was an entirely different feat from what it is at this day Where then were the published guides Where were the charts indicating the eligible camping grounds with their springs of pure water These oases of the American Sahara were not yet acquainted with the white man s foot The herds of buffaloes the droves of wild horses knew not the crack of the white man s rifle They had fled only at the approach of the native Indian warrior and the yearly fires of the prairie It was a difficult task to find a man who had gazed on the lofty peaks of the mountain ranges which formed a serpentine division of the vast American Territories or who had drank the waters at the camping places on the prairies The traveller at that day was in every force of meaning which the word extends literally an explorer whose chosen object was the task of a hero The Indians themselves could give no information of the route beyond the confined limits of their hunting ranges The path which this pioneer party entered was existent only in the imagination of the book making geographer about as accurate and useful from its detail as the route of Baron Munchausen to the icelands of the North Pole on the back of his eagle The whole expanse of the rolling prairie to those brave hearts was one boundless uncertainty This language may possibly be pronounced redundant It may be in phrase it is not in fact The carpet knight the holiday ranger the book worm explorer knows but little of the herculean work which has furnished for the world a practical knowledge of the western half of the North American continent We shall see in the progress of this work whether the adventures of Kit Carson entitle him to a place in the heart of the American nation on the same shelf with his compeers In that day the fierce red man chief scoured the broad prairies a petty king in his tribe a ruler of his wild domain Bold haughty cautious wily unrelenting revengeful he led his impassioned warriors in the chase and to battle Even to day the lurking Indian foeman is no mean adversary to be laughed and brushed out of the way notwithstanding disease war assassination and necessary chastisement have united rapidly to decimate his race thereby gradually lessening its power Thirty years ago the rolling plains were alive with them and their numbers alone made them formidable It is not strange that the untutored savages of the prairie like those of their race who hailed with ungovernable curiosity the landing of the Pilgrims on Plymouth Rock should have been attracted by the wonderful inventions of the white man intruder A very short period of time served to turn this ungovernable curiosity into troublesome thieving Knowing no law but their wild traditionary rules they wrested from the adventurous pioneer his rifle knife axe wagon harness horse powder ball flint watch compass cooking utensils and so forth The result was sanguinary engagements ensued which led to bitter hostility between the two races Doubtless the opinion may be controverted but it nevertheless shall be hazarded that until the weaker party shall be exterminated by the stronger the wild war whoop with its keen edged knife and death dealing rifle accompaniments will continue from time to time to palsy the nerve and arouse the courage of the pioneer white man The Indian in his attack no longer showers cloth yard arrows upon his foe He has learned to kill his adversary with the voice of thunder and the unseen bullet The bold traveller whose pathway lies over those great highroads which lead to the Pacific must still watch for the red man s ambush by day and by night sleep under the protecting vigilance of the faithful quick sighted sentinel The savage never forgives his own or his ancestor s foe Every generation of them learns from tradition the trials and exploits of its tribe From earliest boyhood these form the burden of their education in history and on performing the feat of courage or strength which admits them to the councils of the braves their nation s wrongs are uppermost in their thoughts causing them to thirst for a revenge which sooner or later gives them a grave making themselves in turn an object of revenge It has already appeared that when Kit Carson entered upon his first expedition game was to be had in abundance His route lay across the western wilds to Santa Fe All this distance the bulk of provisions consisting of a small quantity of flour and bacon had to be transported by himself and his companions These articles were kept as a reserve and were looked upon as luxuries for that man was estimated to be a very poor shot who could not obtain with his rifle all the animal food he required for his individual sustenance These hunters however well understood the laws which govern and the advantages which follow division of labor Everything was so arranged both for this and subsequent expeditions by which a regular hunter was appointed and each man assigned some particular duty according to his capacity These appointments were usually made by the leader of the party whose supervision was acknowledged by general consent on account of his known experience and capability This plan was the more necessary in order to avoid confusion The caravan had hardly launched out on its long and tedious tramp when an accident occurred which came very near proving serious in its results For several days the men had been greatly annoyed by wolves who appeared more than usually ravenous and bold two Footnote two There are two species of these animals found on the western prairie One is small called the Jackal the other much larger The latter or larger species are found of various colors but more frequently grey The color however varies with the season and often from other causes Many of their habits are strikingly similar to those of the domestic dog with the simple difference that the wolf is unreclaimed from his wild state The connecting link between the prairie wolf and the domestic dog is the cur found among the Indians The Indian cur by a casual observer could be easily mistaken for a prairie wolf Near the Rocky Mountains and in them these animals are found of immense size but being cowardly they are not dangerous The first night a person sleeps on a prairie is ever afterwards vividly impressed upon his memory The serenade of the wolves with which he is honored is apt to be distinctly remembered It is far from agreeable and seldom fails to awaken unpleasant forebodings concerning the future and the idea that these fellows may be soon clearing his bones is not very genial to the fancy To the wolf the graveyard is anything but consecrated ground and if a person is very chary of his cadaver he had better not leave it on the Western Plains The wolf is quite choice in his viands whenever the opportunity offers and will at any time leave the carcass of an Indian for that of a white man Old frontiersmen speaking of the wolves usually style them as their dogs and after a night when these animals have kept up an incessant barking they will express wonder by asking what has been disturbing their hounds The flesh of the mountain wolf when cooked has something of the smell and taste of mutton but it is very rank In order to frighten the wolves the teamsters would occasionally shoot them One of the members of the expedition was obliged to take a fresh rifle from a wagon In taking the gun out the hammer of the lock caught against some projecting object which caused it to be partially set Having become freed however before it was fully set it came down and fired the gun The contents of the barrel were sent through the man s arm No member of the expedition was conversant with surgical knowledge Here was an occasion to shake the nerves of any feeling man and beneath the rough exterior of the western ranger there runs as deep a stream of true humanity as can be found anywhere on the American continent Every suggestion was offered and every effort was put forth which heart feeling chained to anxiety and the terrible necessity could offer Every remedy which promised a good result was duly weighed and if pronounced worthy of trial it was adopted The sufferer had kind though rough nurses but the absence of scientific skill under such emergency proved a sad want for the unfortunate man Notwithstanding their united efforts Broader s arm grew alarmingly worse It soon became manifest to all that he must part with his arm or lose his life perhaps both At this critical period a consultation was held in which the suffering patient joined Due deliberation was extended to all the symptoms The giving of advice in such a council by men who could only give judgment from an imaginary stand point must strike the heart of true sympathy as having been painful in no ordinary degree After every possible argument had been offered in favor of saving the arm the final decision of the council was that it must come off The next difficulty which presented itself was quite as formidable as the expression of a correct judgment Who should perform the office of surgeon was the knotty question Again the consultations became exciting and intensely painful The members of the council however took it upon themselves to designate the persons and chose Carson with two others These immediately set at work to execute their sad but necessary task The arrangements were all hastily but carefully made and the cutting begun The instruments used were a razor an old saw and to arrest the hemorrhage the king bolt taken from one of the wagons was heated and applied to serve as an actual cautery The operation rudely performed with rude instruments by unpractised hands excited to action only by the spur of absolute necessity proved nevertheless entirely successful Before the caravan arrived at Santa Fe the patient had so far recovered that he was able to take care of himself Besides this unfortunate affair nothing worthy of note transpired beyond the general record of their route during the remainder of their journey The latter would be too voluminous for the general reader and has already served its purpose as an assistant to other exploring parties both from published account and conversational directions The party entered Santa Fe in the month of November Very soon after Kit Carson left his companions and proceeded to Fernandez de Taos a Mexican town which lies about eighty miles to the northeast of the capital of New Mexico During the winter that followed his arrival in the territory of New Mexico Kit lived with an old mountaineer by the name of Kin Cade who very kindly offered him a home It was at this period of his life that he commenced studying the Spanish language His friend Kin Cade became his assistant in this task At the same time Kit neglected no opportunity to learn all he could about the Rocky Mountains He little thought then that these earth formed giants were to become his future home and so gloriously to herald his name throughout the entire civilized globe The pinching effects of want now attacked poor Kit He could obtain no employment His expectations in this respect as well as his earnest efforts received so little encouragement that he began finally to despond Extreme poverty is a wet damper on the fires of the best genius but as was the case with Kit it does not effectually put it out Kit saw with sorrow that he must retrace his steps To obtain means to carry out his ardent desires in the spring of eighteen twenty seven he started on a backward trip to Missouri Every step he took in this direction was accompanied with such displeasure that had it not been his best and surest policy he would have mastered any difficulties of another and better course had such offered Four hundred and fifty miles from Santa Fe being about one half the distance across the prairies had been accomplished by the party Kit had joined for this homeward trip The fording of the Arkansas River had been reached Here Kit s party met with some traders bound for New Mexico They offered him employment which he gladly accepted and in their company retraced his steps back to Santa Fe But when arrived at Santa Fe Kit found himself again without money He was afforded an opportunity to obtain a wardrobe but to the mountaineer such property would be entirely a superfluity He feels nearly independent on the score of clothing as he considers that he needs but little raiment and that little he is always proud to owe to his beloved rifle This brings to his hand buckskins in plenty and his own ingenuity is the fashion plate by which they are manufactured into wearable and comfortable vesture There is one article of clothing however for which the frontiersman feels an ardent predilection It is a woollen shirt This article Kit really needed and in equal pace with his necessity ran his anxiety that something should offer by which to obtain one The reader may smile at this and so does Kit at this day as he recounts the fact in his own inimitable style But Kit says that to obtain a woollen shirt then was to him no laughing matter At a moment when he almost despaired of gaining employment he received an offer to go as a teamster with an expedition bound to El Paso This opportunity was a chance for success not to be lost and he closed with the proposition After faithfully performing his engagement he however returned to Santa Fe where he made a short stay and then proceeded to Taos In this town Kit entered into the service of mister Ewing Young who was a trader and trapper The reader may prepare again for a smile as he will now learn that Kit became a cook mister Ewing Young has the satisfaction of boasting that the renowned Kit Carson once performed the responsible and arduous duties of a master cook in the culinary department of his establishment and that for these valuable services labor care and diligence he gave to Kit as a quid pro quo his board In this way Kit supported himself in his straitened circumstances until the following spring What was the bright thought which made the bold the ardent the energetic Kit Carson accept this menial office Surely the brain metal which was so brightly polished when he set out from Howard county Missouri must have been sadly rusted Not so The hope which buoyed up his spirits while he attempted to rival French pastry and English beef with American venison and Buffalo meat on the table of mister Ewing Young was that some trapper or hunter would come into Taos their favorite place of resort and by being ready for an emergency he would obtain an opportunity for gaining a permission to join them His intention was certainly good but it lacked the bright crown of good intention success In the spring of eighteen twenty eight much chagrined with his so far continued bad luck and no prospect of gaining his object appearing he again joined a homeward bound party and with it sorrowfully started for Missouri But as on the former trip homeward he met on the route a party bound for Santa Fe That indomitable ingredient in his composition an iron will caused him once more to turn his face westward He joined this party and returned to Santa Fe in order again to tempt fortune for an opportunity to reach the Rocky Mountains But during all these changes and counterchanges Kit had not been idle He had picked up considerable knowledge and to his other stock of accomplishments had added the ability to speak the Spanish language On arriving once more at Santa Fe he fell in with colonel Tramell who was at that time a well known trader colonel Tramell needed a Spanish interpreter Kit obtained the post and set out with him for Chihuahua one of the Mexican States Here again Kit made a change in his employment In Chihuahua he fell in with mister Robert McKnight To him he hired out as a teamster and in this capacity went to the copper mines which are found near to the Rio Gila Amid the weary necessities of this humble but honorable calling Kit s heart was constantly alive with ambition to become a hunter and trapper He knew that he was expert with the rifle which had been his boyish toy and felt confident that he could rely upon it as an assistant to gain an honest living His constant thought at this time was let him now be engaged in whatever calling chance offered and necessity caused him to accept the final pursuit of his life would be as a hunter and trapper Here then is presented a fair example of the strife both inward and outward through which a young man of courage and ambition must expect to pass before he can win position influence and the comforts of life whatever the scene of his action or whatever the choice of employment suitable to his talent and genius Kit Carson was determined no matter what might be the obstacles which presented themselves to be a hunter and trapper The reader will have made a sad mistake if he has concluded that during the time which has intervened since Kit started from Missouri he has been roaming in a country where there was less danger than when he was in the picketed fort with his father Such a supposition would be greatly at fault The towns in New Mexico at this early period were almost entirely at the mercy of the Indians The Mexicans were nearly destitute of means to defend themselves Very few of the Anglo Saxon race had entered this territory and those who had were in turn exposed to the vacillating wills of the proverbially treacherous Mexicans A man like Kit Carson however born and bred in danger cared but little about this state of affairs The dangers did not enter into his calculations of chance to overcome the difficulties which beset the pathway which the alluring hopes of his ambition had marked out Not long afterward he left the copper mines and once more bent his steps to Taos in company with a small party At Taos he found a band of trappers which had been sent out by mister Ewing Young While en route for the river Colorado of the west in pursuit of game they had been attacked by a band of Indians After fighting an entire day they had been compelled to retreat and returned to New Mexico CHAPTER II The news of the Defeat of mister Young s Trapping Party by the Indians reaches Taos Young raises a Party to chastise the Indians Kit Carson becomes a Conspicuous Member of the Expedition The Indians are found on Salt River The Fight Trapping Exploits A new Country Trials and Vicissitudes Sacramento Valley California and its Roman Catholic Missions in eighteen twenty nine Another Indian Fight Sale of Furs Indian Depredations Kit Carson and Twelve Trappers engage with the Indians in a Battle Return to the Camp with recovered Property The news of the attack and defeat of his men by the Indians was brought to mister Ewing Young at Taos by a member of the unfortunate expedition On learning the causes which brought this unpleasant termination to his enterprise mister Young raised a party of forty men consisting of Americans Canadians and Frenchmen and put himself at its head Kit Carson was received into the party and soon became one of its most prominent and efficient aids mister Young s object was two fold first to chastise the Indians and second to make all he could out of the expedition by employing the men in their calling as trappers Under the Mexican laws licenses were required from the government to all Mexicans who set out on trapping expeditions These were not granted to citizens of the United States This was not the mere will of governmental officials the Mexican statutory law prohibited the granting of licenses to citizens of the United States This law was however often made a dead letter by Americans for they frequently but stealthily evaded it In order therefore to hoodwink the Mexican authorities mister Young had to resort to various expedients His preparations were so carefully and secretly made that the real business he had in contemplation did not transpire or even a suspicion gain currency as to his intended whereabouts In April eighteen twenty nine the party set out eager to bring about results equal to their anticipations At first to avoid the curiosity and inquiring disposition of the Mexicans they traveled northward as if their destination was into the territory of the United States Hints had been sufficiently freely bestowed upon the Mexicans to lead them to believe that such was the destination of the party After journeying fifty miles in this direction and feeling themselves free from the scrutiny of the Mexican authorities they changed their course to the southwest and travelled through the country occupied by the Navajoes who are an interesting and dangerous race of Indians even to the trader of this day On their route the company passed through Zuni a Peublo town thence they traveled to the head of Salt River one of the tributaries of the Rio Gila Here they discovered the band of Indians who had attacked and defeated the former party As soon as the Indians discovered the party of trappers they became eager for the affray The usual preliminaries for such fights were therefore quickly made on both sides Young directed the greater part of his men to lie in ambush for he felt confident that the Indians did not know his strength The bands of savages who covered the hills round about mistook the halt necessary to complete the ambush for cowardice and fear on the part of the whites At this their courage arose to such a degree that they made a bold charge against as they supposed the small party of white men who were visible They were allowed to advance well into the trap until by the position of the trappers in ambush they came under a cross fire At the word of command a general volley was fired into the advance column Fifteen warriors fell dead and many others were wounded The Indians became panic stricken and the trappers immediately following up their advantage advanced from cover The warriors did not rally for a second attack but fled in every direction leaving Young with his party masters of the field Strange as it has ever seemed to the inquiring mind in those days and for many succeeding years companies of white men from fifty to sixty in number could wage successful war against whole tribes of Indians who could easily muster a thousand fighting men A reason often given for this is that the trappers of the western wilds are invariably dead shots with the rifle and well versed in Indian strategy On the other hand the red men were comparatively speaking poorly armed and could not travel together for any length of time in large parties because they depended for food chiefly upon hunting Had there existed no other cause the means of obtaining provision being limited must have compelled them to separate Very frequently whole tribes are reduced to depend upon daily hunts The bravery of the Indians is of a different stamp from that which is exhibited by the whites especially where the white man is a Simon pure western trapper The white man on the prairie or in the mountains knows but too well that if attacked by Indians he must conquer or die It was and is seldom that a company out on an expedition has any place of refuge to which it may retreat Here is the principal reason why the trapper is so seldom defeated He cannot afford to lose his life to a certainty and consequently will not allow a defeat After this fight Young s party trapped down the Salt River to San Francisco River and thence on up to the head of the latter stream The Indians failed not to hover on their pathway and to make nightly attacks upon their party Frequently they would crawl into camp and steal a trap or kill a mule or a horse and do whatever other damage they could secretly At the head of the San Francisco River the company was divided It was so arranged that one party was to proceed to the valley of the Sacramento in California Of this detachment Kit Carson was a member The other party had orders to return to New Mexico for the purpose of procuring traps to replace those stolen This latter party was also commissioned to take and dispose of the stock of beaver already on hand The party bound for California was eighteen in number Of this party mister Young took command Previous to setting out a few days were devoted to hunting They only succeeded however in killing three deer The meat of these animals they prepared to take with them as they were about to journey into a country never before explored The skins of the three deer were converted into tanks for carrying water They had learned from some friendly Indians that the country over which they had to pass en route was destitute of water The red men told them additionally that the valley meaning the Sacramento was beautiful and that the streams were full of beaver All of this information the trappers found was true For four days they travelled over a barren country where not one drop of water could be found At each night s camping place small allowances of water from the tanks was distributed by the commander to each man and animal A guard was then stationed over the remainder to prevent any accident from depriving the company of this now precious article of sustenance At the close of the fourth day however they again found water The instinct exhibited by the pack mules on this occasion was truly remarkable Long before any member of the party thought that water was so near the mules with unerring certainty had smelt it and each one according to his remaining strength had hurried on to partake of it The result was that when the first mule had reached the water the remainder were scattered along upon the trail for a great distance The company encamped here and remained two days to recruit The journey was renewed on the third day the route being still over a similar kind of country necessitating both man and beast to submit to similar privations as to water In four days more they came in sight of the great Canon of the Colorado which failed not to awaken a thrill of delight in every member of the party Just before reaching the Canon they met a party of Mohave Indians of whom they purchased an old mare She was killed and eaten by the party with great gusto The party remained three days on the banks of the Colorado recruiting their strength While remaining here another party of Mohave Indians visited them from whom they procured a small quantity of corn and beans Leaving the Colorado they recommenced their journey and travelled southwest In three days they arrived at a stream which rises in the coast range runs northeast and is lost in the sands of the Great Basin About two years previous to their arrival here three trappers by the names of Smith Sublett and Jackson with a large party of men had a desperate fight in this neighborhood with hostile Indians They also had learned from friendly Indians of the wonders of the Sacramento Valley and were en route to explore it when attacked Four only out of their entire company escaped with their lives These succeeded in making their way to the nearest Mexican settlements which they reached in a state of complete destitution after many hardships Young and his party followed the dry bed of this river for several days before they came to any visible water It may be interesting to some of our readers to know that there are many of these curious rivers in western America which for miles disappear from the surface of the earth and probably run through the quicksand beneath as they reappear again The outline of the river usually exists between the place of its disappearance and the place where the water again comes to the surface of the earth By digging a few feet into the sand within the outline the water is generally obtained It takes but a short time however for the hole thus made to fill up again On quitting this river the party journeyed to the westward and in four days came to the Mission of San Gabriel Here they found one Roman Catholic priest fifteen Mexican soldiers and about one thousand Indians Belonging to this little colony were eighty thousand head of cattle fine fields and vineyards Literally the work and life of the Jewish patriarchs were here being reenacted A shepherd on the mighty plain he watched his roving store To the half starved followers of mister Young this Mission appeared to be a Paradise of Earth They remained here however but one day Having nothing else to trade they parted with their butcher knives receiving for four of them one fat ox It would all appear a fabulous tale were we to incorporate into this narrative a history or even a slight description of the immensity of the herds of horses and cattle which once roamed over the plains and valleys of California and New Mexico It is but a few years since that some wealthy Mexicans owned herds in these parts of America which they numbered by tens of thousands They were however almost valueless for want of a market and until the tide of emigration poured in developing the resources of the country by its demand for provisions and labor horses and cattle were sold for a mere trifle In one day s march from San Gabriel Young and his party arrived at another Roman Catholic Mission called San Fernando This establishment was on a much smaller scale than the first Young and his hardy followers however stopping only for a few hours pushed on for the Sacramento River which proved to be distant only a few days march Their course from San Fernando was northeast The last part of their journey led through a delightful tract of country where water grass and game existed in abundance seemingly a foretaste of the success which awaited their further advance Selecting an eligible camping site Young here rested his party for some time When they were fully recruited the party started for the San Joaquin and commenced trapping down the river What gave the men great surprise they discovered unmistakable signs of another trapping party In a short time it appeared that they were close to a party belonging to the Hudson s Bay Company commanded by Peter Ogden Young s men however continued setting their traps on the San Joaquin and its tributaries The two parties were near each other for some time and as deer elk and antelope existed by thousands around them which it was no trouble to kill in any numbers desirable they fared well On again reaching the Sacramento River the two parties separated mister Ogden with his party set out for the Columbia River while mister Young s party encamped where they were for the remainder of the summer As the season for trapping had passed they employed their time in hunting and preparing meat for future necessity It was here that Kit Carson soon distinguished himself as a superior hunter which reputation he has maintained ever since no matter who have been his antagonists Not but that Kit may have had his equals but that it is next to an impossibility to find his superior At all events the world has given Kit Carson the title of Nestor of the Rocky Mountains for his reputation as a hunter alone and as his biographer we take pleasure in recording the facts by which the title has been earned and maintained Let the reader possess himself of the facts as they shall appear divested of any and every picture which fancy or partiality may accidentally cause us to paint and even then Kit Carson will not lose the title On the contrary it will become the more indelibly stamped upon his brow During the sojourn of the trappers on the Sacramento an event occurred which exhibited the readiness with which these men responded to calls upon them for aid in a just cause A few of the Indians belonging to the Mission of the San Rafael after committing some excesses deserted from those to whom they had pretended friendship The priest having charge of the Mission sent a strong force to search for the fugitives They were found secreted in an Indian village the inhabitants of which were not on friendly terms with the priest s party A demand was made that the deserters should be given up which being refused a fight ensued and the priest s party was defeated Assistance was now asked from the trappers The request was complied with by Carson and eleven of his companions who volunteered for the occasion Thus reinforced the vanquished party returned and resumed the fight but with a far different result The Indian village was captured and one third of its inhabitants killed The day following a second demand to deliver up the deserters was complied with Carson and his companions then left the priest s party and rejoined their camp A short time after this affair had happened mister Young carried the furs he had on hand to the Mission of San Rafael where he was so fortunate as to find a captain of a trading schooner to whom he succeeded in disposing of the entire stock With the money accruing from the sale he purchased horses and then rejoined his company A circumstance occurred a few days after mister Young s return which proved to be a good warning to the party for their future vigilance During one dark night some Indians eluding the watch of the sentinels succeeded in entering the camp and moving off sixty horses As soon as the robbery was discovered which had been the more easily accomplished because the trappers not apprehending danger had allowed the animals to take care of themselves mister Young directed Kit Carson to take twelve men with the remaining horses fourteen in number and pursue the thieves Carson in obedience to his orders immediately started for the Sierra Nevada Mountains following the trail of the Indians After travelling one hundred miles he came up with the robbers and discovered them in the act of feasting upon horse flesh six of their own animals having been killed to supply the viands Doubtless stolen fruit made the feast all the sweeter to the savages but Kit determined to mingle a little of the bitter as a condiment to the roasted flesh Gathering his men well together and approaching very close to the foe without being discovered he gave the order to charge His men needed no second command They fell upon the feasting savages like a thunderbolt scattering them right and left without mercy Eight of the warriors were killed in the short conflict which ensued The remainder were allowed to escape With some difficulty they next succeeded in recovering all their horses except the six which had been killed With their horses and three children taken prisoners they returned to camp It is unnecessary to add that to men thus isolated in the wilderness Kit and his party were hailed with joyful greetings when their complete success became known To them their horses were like the good ship to the hardy sailors on the mighty ocean The joyful reaction which followed such complete success was in ratio to the fears which the continuing suspense had excited Kit Carson though at that day a youth in years and experience when compared with the other members of the party of which he was then an associate had risen rapidly in the estimation of all and had excited the admiration and enlisted in his behalf the confidence of the entire band When called upon to add his counsel and advice to the general fund of knowledge offered by the trappers concerning any doubtful or difficult enterprise his masterly foresight and shrewdness as well as clearness in attending to details alone gave him willing auditors But it was the retired manner and modest deportment which he invariably wore that won for him the love of his associates Such characteristics failed not to surprise in no ordinary degree those who could boast a long lifetime of experience in Indian countries Kit Carson s powers of quickly conceiving thoughts on difficult emergencies which pointed out the safest and best plans of action just the things that ought to be done and his bravery which in his youth sometimes amounted to rashness were the component parts of his ability which thus caused his companions to follow his leadership His courage promptitude willingness self reliance caution sympathy and care for the wounded marked him at once as the master mind and safest counsellor His first trapping expedition gained him so much credit that from the time it was concluded he found no difficulty in joining any band of trappers no matter how select the party In this respect the mountaineers resemble sea faring men who invariably dislike new and untried hands because such are so apt to give more trouble than assistance Green hands therefore are treated with indifference when they apply to be admitted as members on a contemplated hunt The reader will here see one difficulty which had to be overcome by Carson and which kept him so long in want of employment From this time Kit carried a rifle and worked from an experience which commanded admiration respect and esteem wherever he went and with whatever party he became connected Like the great Napoleon when he joined the army for his first campaign he was a hero in spite of his youth among men grown grey with experience CHAPTER III The Return from California to New Mexico San Fernando and

8527_281131_000003_000003	train-clean-360	Former experience in a similar matter of official duty had taught those Mexicans that the American trappers were men of a peculiarly resolute nature 
8527_281131_000003_000004	train-clean-360	Fair and legitimate means were therefore laid aside and a foul policy adopted 
none	none	They commenced supplying them with firewater thus attacking them in a weak point When they should become fully inebriated they considered the matter of their arrest both easy and certain mister Young seeing the intentions of the authorities and their underhanded method of carrying them out determined to thwart them He directed Carson to take three men the loose animals and the camp equipage and move on with the instructions that if he did not soon join him to push on that if he did not eventually overtake him to report in New Mexico that the main party had been massacred Young succeeded in collecting his men as best he could for they were yet sufficiently sober to retain a little of their reason 
8527_281131_000004_000002	train-clean-360	The treacherous Mexicans however continued annoying the commander of the trappers by gratuitously offering the men all the liquor they desired 
none	none	One by one the trappers were allowing themselves to be easily conquered as the effects of the liquor began to be more active 
8527_281131_000004_000004	train-clean-360	They would soon have fallen a complete prey to their enemies had not a most singular circumstance put the Mexicans to flight 
8527_281131_000004_000005	train-clean-360	One of the trappers named James Higgins without any provocation and without any excuse except that he was intoxicated shot a man named James Lawrence inflicting a slight wound 
8527_281131_000004_000006	train-clean-360	Such conduct so terrified the Mexicans that they took sudden and precipitous leave 
none	none	This happened very fortunately before the party arrived at the mission of San Gabriel where they would all have been arrested and perhaps killed by the Mexicans aided by parties and reinforcements at the mission 
8527_281131_000005_000000	train-clean-360	About dark Young by urging his half drunken men into a forced march succeeded in overtaking Carson

8527_281131_000005_000002	train-clean-360	A night of sleep soon set the brains of Young s trappers once more to rights 
8527_281131_000005_000003	train-clean-360	The next day the party most of them sufficiently ashamed of their drunken debauch commenced with vigor the homeward march 
8527_281131_000005_000004	train-clean-360	They continued nine days almost upon their former track when outward bound 
8527_281131_000005_000005	train-clean-360	On the ninth day they once more stood on the banks of the Colorado River 
8527_281131_000006_000000	train-clean-360	While encamped on this stream a band of five hundred Indians made their appearance and entered the camp 
8527_281131_000006_000001	train-clean-360	The rascals professed the greatest friendship for the trappers but their actions not fully measuring their words the white men looked to Carson for advice 
8527_281131_000006_000002	train-clean-360	He had discovered that beneath their articles of dress their weapons were very carefully concealed and from this circumstance it became quite clearly apparent the Indians intended to massacre the entire party Here Carson s boldness proved as it had before and did many a time afterwards the safety of himself and friends or associates 
8527_281131_000006_000003	train-clean-360	At the time the Indians entered the camp Carson with only a few of the party occupied it the rest were out visiting their traps which it was their general custom to set whenever they arrived at a suitable stream 
none	none	Kit having thus become satisfied concerning the design of the savages and feeling that the salvation of the entire party rested upon his courage and wisdom made up his mind that boldness was the wisest policy he could adopt 
8527_281131_000006_000005	train-clean-360	He found present among the warriors one who could speak the Spanish language 
none	none	Through him he ordered the red men to leave the camp In the event of their not doing so immediately he and his friends would without further parley commence hostilities and would be sure each in killing his man although they might all in the end lose their own lives The Indians had been accustomed to act about as they chose with such small parties of Mexicans as they chanced to meet and consequently were taken completely by surprise at Kit s unusual boldness 
8527_281131_000007_000001	train-clean-360	Seeing that they would inevitably lose several of their braves if they made any hostile demonstration they chose the discreet part of best policy and departed 
8527_281131_000007_000002	train-clean-360	As a general rule no matter what the profit or urgent necessity which chance offers these Indians will not hazard a contest when to a certainty they must expect their own killed will equal the number of scalps which they can obtain 
8527_281131_000007_000003	train-clean-360	This rule and doubtless some fearfulness on the part of the Indians saved the lives of the entire band 
none	none	As has already appeared the trappers were on the banks of the Colorado at the time this affair happened They continued their work on it descending the south side until they reached tide water when they changed their camp on to the Gila and continued trapping up this river as far as the mouth of the San Pedro Near the outlet of this river they discovered a large herd of horses and mules on a closer examination they found that they were in the possession of a band of Indians who had formerly given them some of their gratuitous hostilities 
8527_281131_000008_000003	train-clean-360	Not having forgotten their former troubles with these people they determined to pay them off in their own coin by depriving them of the herd 
none	none	A short search sufficed to discover the Indian camp Without waiting an instant they put their horses to their speed and charged in among the huts The Indians were so completely taken by surprise that they became panic struck and fled in every direction They however rallied somewhat and a running fight commenced which lasted some time but which did not change matters in favor of the Indians 
8527_281131_000008_000006	train-clean-360	The entire herd fell into the possession of the trappers 
8527_281131_000009_000000	train-clean-360	On the same evening after the men had wrapped themselves up in their blankets and laid down for a sleep and while enjoying their slumbers a noise reached their ears which sounded very much like distant thunder but a close application of the sense of hearing showed plainly that an enemy was near at hand 
8527_281131_000009_000001	train-clean-360	Springing up with rifle in hand for generally in the mountains a man s gun rests in the same blanket with himself on all sleeping occasions they sallied forth to reconnoitre and discovered a few warriors driving along a band of at least two hundred horses 
8527_281131_000009_000002	train-clean-360	The trappers comprehended instantly that the warriors had been to the Mexican settlements in Sonora on a thieving expedition and that the horses had changed hands with only one party to the bargain 
8527_281131_000009_000003	train-clean-360	The opportunity to instill a lesson on the savage marauders was too good to be lost 
8527_281131_000010_000000	train-clean-360	They saluted the thieves with a volley from their rifles which with the bullet whizzing about their heads and bodies so astonished them that they seemed almost immediately to forget their stolen property and to think only of a precipitous flight 
8527_281131_000010_000001	train-clean-360	In a few moments the whites found themselves masters of the field and also of the property 
8527_281131_000010_000002	train-clean-360	To return the animals to their owners was an impossibility mister Young therefore selected as many of the best horses as he needed for himself and men and game being very scarce killed two and dried most of the meat for future use turning the remainder loose 
8527_281131_000010_000003	train-clean-360	Such either became wild mustangs or fell again into the clutches of the Indians 
8527_281131_000010_000004	train-clean-360	The company then renewed their trapping and continued it up the Gila to a point opposite the copper mines of New Mexico 
8527_281131_000010_000005	train-clean-360	Here they left the river and proceeded to the copper mines where they found mister Robert McKnight engaged in trading with the neighboring Indian tribes These mines were not then and ever since have not been worked 
8527_281131_000010_000006	train-clean-360	The holes which had many years before been made by the miners but who they were is unknown formed a safe hiding place for their skins 
8527_281131_000010_000007	train-clean-360	The stock of beaver was therefore placed under the care of mister McKnight Young and his men then renewed their march and in due time arrived safely at Santa Fe 
8527_281131_000010_000008	train-clean-360	Here they purchased licenses to trade with the Indians who live about the copper mines 
none	none	With these licenses as protection papers they returned to where the skins were concealed Having once more recovered their fur they returned with it to Santa Fe 
8527_281131_000010_000010	train-clean-360	The deserted mines of New Mexico show incontrovertible signs of having been successfully and extensively worked at some remote period for various kinds of metals 
8527_281131_000010_000011	train-clean-360	They have proved a knotty historical problem to many an investigating mind for their authentic history has fallen and probably will ever remain in oblivion 
none	none	It may have been that about a century ago the Spaniards with Indian assistants worked them and the savages becoming hostile to their employers in some sudden fit of frenzy may have massacred the Spaniards There is a legendary story circulating similar to the traditions of the Indians giving this explanation 
8527_281131_000010_000014	train-clean-360	The more probable hypothesis however is that the Indians themselves many centuries in the past were versed to some extent in the art of mining and carried on the business in these mines but from indolence or to them uselessness of the metals the work was abandoned and their descendants failed to obtain the knowledge which their ancestors possessed 
8527_281131_000010_000015	train-clean-360	These mines and those which exist nearer to the large towns will some day render New Mexico a profitable and rich field for the learned antiquary 
8527_281131_000011_000000	train-clean-360	The ruse which mister Young found absolutely necessary to employ in order to blind the Mexican authorities succeeded so well that when the fur arrived at Santa Fe every one considered the trappers had made a very good trade 
8527_281131_000011_000001	train-clean-360	The amount of beaver thus brought in amounted to two thousand pounds 
8527_281131_000011_000002	train-clean-360	The market price was twelve dollars the pound The proceeds therefore of the entire trip were nearly twenty four thousand dollars 
none	none	The division of this handsome sum gave to each man several hundred dollars 
8527_281131_000011_000004	train-clean-360	It was during the month of April eighteen thirty that mister Young s party again reached the town of Taos 
8527_281131_000011_000005	train-clean-360	Here they disbanded having completed their enterprise 
8527_281131_000011_000006	train-clean-360	Like as Jack when he returns from his battles with old ocean having a pocket well lined with hard earnings fails not to plunge into excess with the determination to make up for the pleasure lost by years of toil the brave mountaineers courted merrymaking 
8527_281131_000011_000007	train-clean-360	From their own accounts they passed a short time gloriously 
none	none	This similarity of disposition between trappers and sailors in regard to pleasure s syren cup and its consequent draft upon their treasures causing them to forget the risk of life and limb and the expense of their valuable time is most remarkable 
8527_281131_000011_000009	train-clean-360	These hardy trappers like reliable old salts proved to be as true to the bowl as they had been to their steel for most of the party in a very brief space of time were penniless and ready to be fitted out for another expedition 
8527_281131_000011_000010	train-clean-360	Young Kit at this period of his life imitated the example set by his elders for he wished to be considered by them as an equal and a friend 
8527_281131_000011_000011	train-clean-360	He however passed through this terrible ordeal which most frequently ruins its votary and eventually came out brighter clearer and more noble for the conscience polish which he received 
8527_281131_000011_000012	train-clean-360	He contracted no bad habits but learned the usefulness and happiness of resisting temptation and became so well schooled that he was able by the caution and advice of wisdom founded on experience to prevent many a promising and skillful hand from grasping ruin in the same vortex 
8527_281131_000012_000000	train-clean-360	The scenes of pleasure lasted until the fall of eighteen thirty 
8527_281131_000012_000001	train-clean-360	Kit then joined his second trapping expedition 
8527_281131_000012_000002	train-clean-360	This band had been formed for the purpose of trapping the principal streams of the Rocky Mountains 
8527_281131_000012_000003	train-clean-360	mister Fitzpatrick a trapper well known and respected by the mountaineers had charge of the party 
8527_281131_000012_000004	train-clean-360	He was at that time well acquainted by experience with the Rocky Mountains and has since then gained an enviable fame as an Indian Agent 
none	none	The new party travelled North and commenced operations on the Platte River which they followed down stream to one of its tributaries the Sweet Water River 
8527_281131_000012_000006	train-clean-360	From here they worked on until they reached the Green River 
8527_281131_000012_000007	train-clean-360	Hence they journeyed to Jackson s Hole which is a fork of the Great Columbia River 
8527_281131_000012_000008	train-clean-360	After making a short stay at this point they started for the Salmon River 
8527_281131_000012_000009	train-clean-360	Here they were joined by a band of their own party who had left Taos some days in advance of the main body and for whom they were then hunting 
8527_281131_000012_000010	train-clean-360	The whole party as now organized remained where they were throughout the winter of eighteen thirty and eighteen thirty one employed in killing only the amount of game necessary for their sustenance 
8527_281131_000012_000011	train-clean-360	An unfortunate affair here happened to them 
none	none	Four of their men while hunting buffalo were attacked and killed by a party of Blackfeet Indians No other incident occurred during the winter to change the everyday routine 
8527_281131_000012_000013	train-clean-360	In April of eighteen thirty one they recommenced trapping shaping their course for Bear River 
8527_281131_000012_000014	train-clean-360	This is the principal stream that empties into GREAT SALT LAKE 
none	none	Thence they returned to Green River where they found some Trappers under the command of mister Sinclair who left New Mexico soon after mister Fitzpatrick s party and had wintered on the Bear River Among many other facts they learned from this party that Captain Gaunt who was an old mountaineer well known to most of the whites present had passed the winter on the Laramie River and that he was then with his men in the New Park 
8527_281131_000012_000016	train-clean-360	Kit Carson and four of his companions determined to join him 
8527_281131_000012_000017	train-clean-360	For this purpose they started and after ten days of steady travel found his party 
8527_281131_000013_000000	train-clean-360	There are two of these natural Parks in the Rocky Mountains 
none	none	To distinguish them they are called the Old Park and the New Park 
8527_281131_000013_000002	train-clean-360	As their names imply they are fair natural examples of the manufactured parks of civilization 
8527_281131_000013_000003	train-clean-360	In some things nature has lavished upon them charms and beauties which no human skill can imitate 
none	none	These parks are favorite haunts of the deer antelope and elk while the streams which run through them are well stocked with otter and beaver 
8527_281131_000013_000005	train-clean-360	Kit and his companions were graciously received by Gaunt and with him they trapped the streams in the vicinity of the New Park and the plains of Laramie to the South fork of the Platte 
8527_281131_000013_000006	train-clean-360	Having finished here they left for the Arkansas remaining there while their captain went to Taos to dispose of their stock of furs and to make such purchases of necessaries as the men required 
8527_281131_000013_000007	train-clean-360	Gaunt returned after an absence of two months when trapping operations were resumed on the Arkansas River which they trapped until it froze over 
8527_281131_000013_000008	train-clean-360	The party then went into Winter Quarters 
8527_281131_000014_000000	train-clean-360	The business of trapping for beaver is no child s play 
8527_281131_000014_000001	train-clean-360	A person unaccustomed to it may possibly look upon it as no very difficult task 
8527_281131_000014_000002	train-clean-360	A single trial is usually sufficient to satisfy the uninitiated on this point for the beaver above all other wild animals of America is endowed with an extraordinary amount of instinct 
none	none	His handiwork and habits sufficiently attest this There are bands of Indians living in the Northwestern part of America who really believe that the beaver has almost as much intelligence as an Indian holding and maintaining that all the difference that exists between a beaver and an Indian is that the latter has been endowed by the Great Spirit with power and capabilities to catch the former Some of the stories which old mountaineers occasionally inflict upon an inquisitive traveller are somewhat startling nevertheless what this amphibious animal really performs is truly astounding and oftentimes the truth fails to gain credence 
8527_281131_000016_000000	train-clean-360	During the winter the trappers had many very pleasant times for they had little work beyond the task of making themselves comfortable The snow fell to a great depth which proved rather hard for their animals 
8527_281131_000016_000001	train-clean-360	By dint of cutting down cottonwood trees and gathering the bark and branches for fodder they managed to prevent them from dying of starvation 
8527_281131_000016_000002	train-clean-360	The buffalo existed about there in great abundance and early in the winter they had taken the precaution to kill and prepare a large supply of this kind of game while it was in good condition 
none	none	As the season advanced therefore the trappers found themselves living quite sumptuously 
8527_281132_000001_000000	train-clean-360	In the month of January the daily routine of their lives was rather unpleasantly disturbed 
8527_281132_000001_000001	train-clean-360	A party of fifty Crow Indians made an unfriendly visit to their camp on one very dark night 
8527_281132_000001_000002	train-clean-360	They succeeded in stealing nine of their loose animals with which they escaped unperceived 
none	none	Early the next morning the signs of the Indians were discovered 
8527_281132_000001_000004	train-clean-360	Kit Carson with twelve of his companions immediately saddled their horses and started in pursuit 
8527_281132_000001_000005	train-clean-360	It was very difficult to follow the trail of the Indians from the fact that many herds of buffalo had crossed and repeatedly recrossed it during the night making the tracks very indistinct 
8527_281132_000001_000006	train-clean-360	Having traveled forty miles their horses which were very poor in flesh became fatigued causing them to think of making a halt 
none	none	After due consultation it was agreed that they had best go into camp 
8527_281132_000001_000008	train-clean-360	With this object in view they traveled towards some timber which was near by 
8527_281132_000001_000009	train-clean-360	On arriving at the woods the advance of the party to their surprise and not less to their satisfaction discovered the smoke of their enemies fires 
none	none	The distance between the parties was inconsiderable but in order that their movements might be made unobserved the trappers retreated to a secluded spot where they awaited the night judging it best to take the party by surprise 
8527_281132_000001_000011	train-clean-360	Their first care was to secure and provide for their animals 
8527_281132_000001_000012	train-clean-360	The second was to prepare their arms 
8527_281132_000001_000013	train-clean-360	As soon as it would do for them to move they started eager for the strife 
none	none	It was judged best first to make a half circuit and then approach the Indians from the direction they themselves were travelling as from this source they wisely judged the red men would be less apprehensive of an attack 
8527_281132_000001_000015	train-clean-360	Their movements were made slowly and with great care in order not to alarm the savages 
8527_281132_000001_000016	train-clean-360	Having obtained a position close enough to observe the strength of their enemies they stopped to reconnoitre 
8527_281132_000001_000017	train-clean-360	The men then crept for a long distance on their hands and knees until finally they obtained a full view of the Indians which showed them that the savages had erected two rough forts and that they were now divided into two parties 
8527_281132_000001_000018	train-clean-360	A dance was in progress in honor of the robbery so recently perpetrated which proved conclusively that they were without even a suspicion of danger 
8527_281132_000001_000019	train-clean-360	Just outside one of the forts the nine stolen animals were securely tied 
8527_281132_000001_000020	train-clean-360	This sight did not tend to allay the wrath of the trappers 
8527_281132_000001_000021	train-clean-360	They resolved that come what might the attempt to regain their property and punish the Indians should be made notwithstanding their strength 
8527_281132_000001_000022	train-clean-360	To insure success in spite of their weakness they determined to conceal themselves and wait quietly until the Indians had lain down for sleep 
8527_281132_000001_000023	train-clean-360	During this time of suspense the trappers were subjected to great suffering for the weather was intensely cold and they possessed but a scanty allowance of clothing fit for such work 
8527_281132_000001_000024	train-clean-360	But as there is an end to all things there was an end to the dance and other festivities and the savages sought their rest 
8527_281132_000001_000025	train-clean-360	At last the time for action arrived 
8527_281132_000001_000026	train-clean-360	Kit Carson and five of his companions commenced crawling towards the stolen horses which on reaching were easily set free by cutting their halters 
8527_281132_000001_000027	train-clean-360	They then threw snow balls at them and by this means drove them away without disturbing the sleeping Indians 
none	none	The trappers who acted as a reserve party soon after joined Kit and his companions and after retreating some distance in order to be out of the hearing of the enemy they held a council to obtain the views of each member of the party as to their next step It appeared that a difference of opinion existed some of the men were in favor of returning having recovered their property and sustained no damage 
8527_281132_000001_000030	train-clean-360	The remainder those who had lost no animals wanted satisfaction for the trouble and hardship they had undergone while in pursuit of the thieves Kit Carson and two others composed this latter party and thus were determined to punish the thieves let the consequences of the attempt be ever so fatal 
8527_281132_000001_000031	train-clean-360	The more peaceful party seeing this earnestness could not do otherwise than lend their aid in the fight and cheerfully did so 
8527_281132_000002_000000	train-clean-360	There always existed such a feeling of brotherly love among the old trappers of the Rocky Mountains that the hour of peril was never the hour for separation or desertion 
8527_281132_000002_000001	train-clean-360	This instance affords a fair example how the minority could easily rule the majority when the minority held to the side of danger 
8527_281132_000002_000002	train-clean-360	The whole band were now unanimous in favor of the attack 
8527_281132_000003_000000	train-clean-360	Kit Carson who had from the first acted as captain ordered three men to take the recovered animals back to where they had secured their saddle horses 
8527_281132_000003_000001	train-clean-360	Then with his comrades he marched directly for the Indian camp 
none	none	A dog belonging to the enemy first gave the alarm of approaching danger to the Indians but not until Kit and his party were within a few paces of the first fort 
8527_281132_000003_000003	train-clean-360	As soon as the occupants of the fort heard the noise they sprang to their feet and thus became fair marks for the unerring rifles of the trappers 
8527_281132_000003_000004	train-clean-360	The whites did not throw away a single shot every ball struck a warrior in some vital spot 
8527_281132_000003_000005	train-clean-360	Those who survived retreated to the fort occupied by their friends and as soon as possible commenced returning the fire but without execution as the trappers on discharging their first volley had well concealed themselves behind trees from whence they were shooting only when sure of an object 
8527_281132_000003_000006	train-clean-360	It was now nearly daybreak and as the savages discovered the weakness of the attacking party they resolved to charge feeling sure of success 
none	none	They did so but the white men who were expert fighters in this kind of warfare quietly waited until the Indians were fully exposed They then fired and killed five warriors 
8527_281132_000003_000009	train-clean-360	The remainder immediately retreated into the fort 
8527_281132_000004_000000	train-clean-360	After considerable deliberation the Indians decided once more to make a sortie 
8527_281132_000004_000001	train-clean-360	On they came and this time with such determination that the trappers could not withstand the assault but were compelled to retreat 
8527_281132_000004_000002	train-clean-360	They disputed however every inch of ground over which they trod as they fell back from one tree to another continually making their bullets tell with terrible effect on their foes 
none	none	The three men who had been sent back with the horses had joined their comrades soon after they had commenced retreating 
8527_281132_000004_000004	train-clean-360	They had heard the incessant firing and had become convinced that the fight was hotly contested and that their services were required 
8527_281132_000004_000005	train-clean-360	On their joining the whole party resolved to make one more stand and as soon as the Indians saw this they wavered and finally drew off 
8527_281132_000004_000006	train-clean-360	Both sides had now seemingly had enough of fighting and hostilities soon after entirely ceased the savages marching back and leaving the whites masters of the field Several of the trappers were slightly but none dangerously wounded The Indians had paid dearly in numbers killed for their rascality Finding the coast clear Carson and his men set out and soon rejoined their comrades on the Arkansas River 
none	none	In the Spring after having cached their fur the whole band departed for Laramie River on another expedition 
8527_281132_000005_000000	train-clean-360	While on the south fork of the Platte two of the party deserted taking with them three of their best animals 
8527_281132_000005_000001	train-clean-360	Suspecting their design Gaunt sent Kit Carson and another man in pursuit of the fugitives who had one day the start 
8527_281132_000005_000002	train-clean-360	As was suspected the two deserters had gone to the camp where the beaver fur was concealed and buried 
8527_281132_000005_000003	train-clean-360	They had succeeded in digging it up and stealing about three hundred pounds of this valuable property belonging to the company in general share and share alike 
8527_281132_000005_000004	train-clean-360	Carson and his companion failed entirely in their efforts to find the two men 
none	none	Doubtless they never lived to enjoy their ill gotten wealth for notwithstanding careful search was made the men were never heard from afterwards 
8527_281132_000005_000006	train-clean-360	It is probable that they were killed by Indians a fate which they at least richly merited 
8527_281132_000006_000000	train-clean-360	This old camp the reader will please bear in mind was on the Arkansas River 
none	none	Kit Carson and his comrade after finding that the two deserters had thus succeeded in stealing the fur which had been buried by the company made every further effort which lay in their power to recover it 
8527_281132_000006_000002	train-clean-360	As has also been seen they were unsuccessful 
8527_281132_000006_000003	train-clean-360	It now remained for them to determine their future course 
8527_281132_000006_000004	train-clean-360	The country was so infested with hostile Indians that it made their position thus alone very precarious 
8527_281132_000006_000005	train-clean-360	To regain their commander s company was almost impracticable at least without a more important object to make the risk necessary it was a foolhardy attempt 
8527_281132_000006_000006	train-clean-360	Time in learning the loss was of no great importance either to their leader or their party Sooner or later this as a matter of course would be fully shown 
8527_281132_000006_000007	train-clean-360	Kit and his comrade therefore determined to remain where they were in the old camp and to this end immediately arranged everything so that they could make a successful defence in case they should be attacked by the savages 
8527_281132_000006_000008	train-clean-360	They did not dare to venture out far from their fortifications but this was no great trial to them as game existed in great plenty and came very near their fortifications 
8527_281132_000006_000009	train-clean-360	While one slept the other stood on guard 
8527_281132_000006_000010	train-clean-360	It was their intention to await the return of their party but at the expiration of one month they were quite happily relieved from their perilous position 
8527_281132_000006_000011	train-clean-360	mister Blackwell mister Gaunt s partner arrived from the United States 
8527_281132_000006_000012	train-clean-360	He was accompanied by fifteen men and brought with him a complete outfit for the entire band 
8527_281132_000006_000013	train-clean-360	Kit and his comrade had been expecting and were anxiously looking for this party 
8527_281132_000006_000014	train-clean-360	They were also made quite happy in obtaining the articles of outfit which would render their wild life more agreeable and easy 
8527_281132_000006_000015	train-clean-360	Shortly after this arrival four men from the trapping party came into camp and brought the news as to the whereabouts of Gaunt and his men 
none	none	They were overjoyed at finding Kit and his comrade as they said that they had hunted for them in all directions and finally had given up all hopes of ever seeing them again The whole party now began the march to join Gaunt at the Ballo Salado three Footnote three Salt Springs 
8527_281132_000008_000000	train-clean-360	These Springs form the head waters of the south fork of the River Platte 
8527_281132_000008_000001	train-clean-360	When four days journey had been accomplished and while they were partaking of their breakfast in camp an alarm of Indians was given by one of the men 
8527_281132_000008_000002	train-clean-360	He had accidentally discovered the red skin rascals as they were prowling about the camp 
8527_281132_000008_000003	train-clean-360	A rush was instantly made by the trappers with rifles in hand to save their horses Shots were fired and one Indian fell 
8527_281132_000008_000004	train-clean-360	The rest of the band made off as empty handed as they came with one exception 
8527_281132_000008_000005	train-clean-360	One brave had succeeded in capturing and mounting a horse before the white men could reach him 
none	none	Notwithstanding he had a dead brother lying on the ground he appeared to be altogether too polite to make the trappers a longer visit at least without a proper introduction 
8527_281132_000008_000007	train-clean-360	On the contrary he galloped off seemingly quite proud of his trophy 
none	none	Had it not been that the trappers had taken the precaution to hobble their horses before turning them out to graze they would have lost them all in this attempted stampede four
8527_281132_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 Footnote four These stampedes are a source of great profit to the Indians of the Plains 
none	none	It is by this means they deprive the caravans of their animals 
8527_281132_000009_000002	train-clean-360	The Camanches are particularly expert and daring in this kind of robbery 
none	none	They even train horses to run from one given point to another in expectancy of caravans 
8527_281132_000009_000004	train-clean-360	When a camp is made which is nearly in range they turn their trained animals loose who at once fly across the plain penetrating and passing through the camp of their victims 
8527_281132_000009_000005	train-clean-360	All of the picketed animals will endeavor to follow and usually succeed in following the trained horses 
8527_281132_000009_000006	train-clean-360	Such are invariably led into the haunts of the thieves who easily secure them Young horses and mules are easily frightened and in the havoc which generally ensues oftentimes great injury is done to the runaways themselves 
8527_281132_000009_000007	train-clean-360	The sight of a stampede on a grand scale requires steady nerves to witness without tremor and woe to the footman who cannot get out of the way when the frightened animals come along 
none	none	At times when the herd is very large the horses scatter over the open country and are irrecoverably lost and such as do not become wild fall a prey to the ravenous wolves 
8527_281132_000009_000009	train-clean-360	Such most frequently is the fate of stampeded horses which have been bred in the States not being trained by a prairie life experience to take care of themselves 
8527_281132_000009_000010	train-clean-360	Instead of bravely stopping and fighting off the wolves they run 
8527_281132_000009_000011	train-clean-360	The whole pack are sure to leave the bolder animals and make for the runaways which they seldom fail to overtake and dispatch 
none	none	Four years since one of these stampedes occurred on the Plains of a band of horses in which there were several hundred valuable animals It was attended with very heavy loss to the owners Through the courage and great exertions of those who had the animals in charge many were recovered but none without having sustained more or less injury A favorite policy of the Indian horse thieves is to creep into camp cut loose one animal and thoroughly frighten him 
8527_281132_000010_000001	train-clean-360	This animal seldom fails to frighten the remainder when away they all go with long ropes and picket pins dangling after them 
none	none	The latter sometimes act like harpoons being thrown with such impetus as to strike and instantly kill a valuable steed from among the brother runaways 
8527_281132_000010_000003	train-clean-360	At other times the limbs of the running horses get entangled in the ropes when they are suddenly thrown 
8527_281132_000010_000004	train-clean-360	Such seldom escape without broken legs or severe contusions which are often incurable 
none	none	The necessity of traveling on at any rate renders it an impossibility to undertake the cure when it might be practicable under other circumstances This day the party travelled fifty miles and thought themselves clear of Indians as there were no visible signs of their presence 
8527_281132_000011_000001	train-clean-360	The experience of the day however had admonished them to be on their guard against surprise 
8527_281132_000011_000002	train-clean-360	To make things sure as to their animals they fastened them to stakes driven in the earth sufficient rope being given them for grazing 
none	none	The place selected for their camp was a beautiful spot being on a small stream which empties into the Arkansas the water of which is sparkling and clear 
8527_281132_000011_000004	train-clean-360	There are many of these charming little brooks which emptying into form this river To the general traveler however they present one great drawback as eligible camping sites 
8527_281132_000011_000005	train-clean-360	Their banks are usually pretty thickly lined with rattlesnakes 
none	none	The mountaineer is quite well accustomed and reconciled to this venomous reptile as they abound in nearly every section of his hunting and trapping grounds 
8527_281132_000011_000007	train-clean-360	Not so however with the mere visitor of or casual traveller over the Western Territories 
8527_281132_000011_000008	train-clean-360	To them his rattlesnake ship is a formidable personage 
8527_281132_000012_000000	train-clean-360	The rattlesnake rarely moves after sunset 
8527_281132_000012_000001	train-clean-360	The night air is generally too chilling for him 
8527_281132_000012_000002	train-clean-360	In the day time they are a noble enemy always warning their antagonist of their hostile intentions by springing their rattles thus giving a person warning of his danger 
8527_281132_000012_000003	train-clean-360	By these two wise provisions of the Creator the power of this otherwise terrible reptile is so limited or restrained that the trapper rarely gives him a thought unless he comes in direct contact 
8527_281132_000012_000004	train-clean-360	Although they are so numerous it very seldom happens that either the Indian or the trapper is bitten by them 
8527_281132_000013_000000	train-clean-360	The party had not been long at rest before their suspicions were aroused that hostile Indians were near them 
8527_281132_000013_000001	train-clean-360	A faithful dog belonging to the camp kept up a furious barking much more lustily than when wolves annoyed him 
8527_281132_000013_000002	train-clean-360	An extra guard was therefore immediately posted when the remainder of the party lay down but not for sleep 
8527_281132_000013_000003	train-clean-360	They expected at every moment that their services would be needed to defend the camp 
8527_281132_000013_000004	train-clean-360	Everything however passed as usual during the night and with the morning all suspicion was laid aside 
8527_281132_000013_000005	train-clean-360	Kit Carson with three companions proposed a visit to a fork of a river close by to look for signs of beaver 
8527_281132_000013_000006	train-clean-360	They had been informed that these animals were numerous in this particular stream 
none	none	Carson and the three men had been absent about one hour when the signs of Indians proved to be realities in the shape of a bold and well sustained charge upon their camp 
8527_281132_000013_000008	train-clean-360	The rascals succeeded in running off all of their loose animals 
none	none	Four of the men immediately saddled the fleetest of the remaining horses and instantly gave chase After a quick run they came up with the savages and immediately gave them battle 
8527_281132_000014_000002	train-clean-360	A sharp skirmish ensued in which one of the warriors was killed when the remainder fled leaving the property once more in the hands of its rightful owners The men however did not come off entirely safe 
8527_281132_000014_000003	train-clean-360	One of them received a very severe wound which eventually gave him considerable difficulty but from the effects of which he finally recovered 
8527_281132_000015_000000	train-clean-360	Kit and his companions in the mean time in order to reach their destination found it necessary unless they should take a long and circuitous route to cross one of those lofty peaks for which the Rocky Mountains are so famous 
8527_281132_000015_000001	train-clean-360	The ascent was however commenced and successfully accomplished but not without labor and an occasional resting place being sought for breathing their animals 
8527_281132_000015_000002	train-clean-360	In due time they reached the desired stream but the beaver signs did not appear Finding their errand had proved entirely useless they started to return into camp 
8527_281132_000015_000003	train-clean-360	Experience had taught them that the longest way round was in this case the quickest way home 
8527_281132_000015_000004	train-clean-360	Taking therefore a circuitous route they avoided recrossing the lofty mountain peak already alluded to 
8527_281132_000015_000005	train-clean-360	As they were riding carelessly homeward beguiling the time with anecdote and remark upon their future prospects the scenery around them with an occasional sight at some kind of game what should appear ahead of them but four Indian warriors remarkably well mounted painted and decked with feathers showing conclusively that they were out upon the war path 
none	none	As soon as Kit and his companions saw the warriors and without one word as to their proper and best action being interchanged they simultaneously put spurs to their horses and dashed at the Indians in order quickly to bring them within range of their rifles The pace became a hot one but as suddenly as the charge had been commenced so suddenly the trappers found that they had this time caught a Tartar for as they dashed on sixty warriors fully armed and splendidly mounted came into view from beneath a hill where they were awaiting in ambush There was but one course for the trappers to take and that was to run the gauntlet which they did in gallant style although twenty yards would have frequently measured the distance between them and the hostile savages 
8527_281132_000016_000001	train-clean-360	The bullets from the rifles of the Indians flew about their ears thick and fast for a heavy fire was opened upon them as they passed and incessantly kept up until they were out of their reach 
8527_281132_000016_000002	train-clean-360	The trappers did not return a shot 
8527_281132_000016_000003	train-clean-360	It would not have been according to their custom 
none	none	There is no one thing Simon pure trappers consider to be a greater folly than firing their rifles on such an occasion as is here described 
8527_281132_000016_000005	train-clean-360	There is nothing they so much dread as being left on foot with an empty gun and no time to load when perhaps a single shot might change defeat into victory sure captivity into freedom or a dead companion into a laughing jolly and lovable help mate ready for setting a trap or to engage in the next bloody skirmish 
8527_281132_000016_000006	train-clean-360	This must inevitably happen if after the rider has fired among the score or so of passing bullets one of them perchance took a peculiar fancy for a vital organ of his horse 
none	none	The mortally wounded animal would make no account of dismounting his master and leaving him to the tender mercies of the refined savages In every close and unequal contest such as above detailed they only think of the surest and speediest method of escape leaving revenge to be obtained on some more fitting and favorable occasion 
8527_281132_000016_000009	train-clean-360	For some unaccountable reason the savages did not give chase 
8527_281132_000017_000000	train-clean-360	As soon as Carson and his comrades had got out of the reach of the Indians they began to recall the suspicions concerning signs of Indians which their faithful dog had aroused 
8527_281132_000017_000001	train-clean-360	Fears for the safety of their companions arose accordingly 
8527_281132_000017_000002	train-clean-360	Therefore giving spurs to their horses they pushed on with vigor to know the worst 
none	none	The facts that awaited them at camp concerning the attack by the Indians stealing and rescue of the horses gave them therefore but little surprise 
8527_281132_000017_000004	train-clean-360	They had already surmised the reason why the Indians had thus set a trap for them 
8527_281132_000017_000005	train-clean-360	Having been watching the camp during the night and finding the white men fully on the alert and carefully guarding against any surprise they had quietly waited until suspicion of their proximity had been entirely laid aside 
8527_281132_000017_000006	train-clean-360	The departure of Carson and his companions from camp was doubtless seen by the savages and afforded them a clear proof that the white men had forgotten their fears 
8527_281132_000017_000007	train-clean-360	As Kit s departure with the men weakened the camp party the Indians had gathered together sufficient courage to make a bold charge for the coveted plunder 
none	none	The final result however which led to their losing the stolen property and the life of one of their braves had caused them to think of an attack upon Kit s party thus obtaining by its massacre revenge for their dead companion and the horses which Kit and his comrades rode would have been a consolation for their failure to retain the horses obtained at the camp 
8527_281132_000017_000009	train-clean-360	The attack was skillfully planned and would undoubtedly have succeeded but for the unexpected daring and promptitude displayed by Kit and his comrades 
none	none	The Indians had not looked for the bold charge upon their advance party but on the contrary they had been prepared for a chase and fight in the opposite direction 
8527_281132_000017_000011	train-clean-360	Had such a skirmish taken place nothing beyond an absolute miracle or change of the laws of nature could have saved the little band 
8527_281132_000017_000012	train-clean-360	Kit and his friends had reason therefore to be very thankful for their safety 
8527_281132_000017_000013	train-clean-360	They all felt that they had retained their scalps by a very close shave 
none	none	To use the expressive language of Carson employed in narrating the event The red skins made a good attempt but thank God failed Two of the trappers had received in this affray wounds which proved to be of a serious nature much more so than they or their companions thought on the first examination given them 
8527_281132_000018_000001	train-clean-360	In consequence the whole party was obliged to halt and again go into camp having accomplished but a very short remove from their savage foes 
none	none	It became necessary to maintain a strong and careful guard during the succeeding night notwithstanding the labors of the past day and night had been more than usually arduous 
8527_281132_000018_000003	train-clean-360	However they succeeded in passing the night without further molestation 
none	none	The next morning it was found necessary to make a litter for one of the wounded men whose condition had grown to be much worse The method which the mountaineers adopt for making a litter they have taken from the Indians and is as follows Take two strong poles six feet of which at either extremity is allowed for shafts or handles while the patient lies in the intermediate space on a buffalo robe or strong sacking which ever is most convenient Two mules or horses of the same size are then selected and to saddles upon each of the animals the poles at their extremities are fastened Another and simpler plan but one not so comfortable to the patient is to take the two poles as before and attach them strongly to a saddle on but one animal while the two ends are allowed to drag upon the ground Directly in the rear of the horse the patient s bed is affixed 
8527_281132_000019_000004	train-clean-360	If the poles are long they will act as springs especially when the wood used is of a kind which has considerable elasticity 
none	none	Having arranged everything to the satisfaction and comfort of the wounded men the party commenced their march and in four days reached Gaunt s camp where they rested until the wounded men had nearly recovered This simple fact shows the careful and sympathizing care which the mountaineers of the west ever exhibit towards each other in distress 
8527_281132_000020_000002	train-clean-360	It speaks more than would volumes of mere praise concerning their character for true manhood 
8527_281132_000021_000000	train-clean-360	When the wounded men had so far recovered that they could safely proceed the whole party now quite strong in its numerical power as well as skill and mountaineer experience departed for and in due time arrived at the Old Park 
none	none	The coveted beaver however were scarce there for other trappers had preceded them and to employ trapping phrase had caught all the fur in those streams that could be taken that season This was an unpleasant condition for their business prospects but as the old adage hath it what could not be cured was quietly endured Catching beaver is not always a matter of choice The beaver themselves have considerable to say on the subject CHAPTER IV Kit Carson and two Companions plan a Hunt for themselves The Great Success met with Return to Taos Sale of the Beaver Fur Kit Carson joins Captain Lee and goes on a Trading Expedition Winter Quarters Kit Carson is sent in Pursuit of a Thief Overtakes and is obliged to shoot the Runaway Property recovered The Return to Camp The Sale of Goods Kit Carson joins Fitzpatrick and Party Kit Carson organizes a Hunting Party His Encounter with two Grizzly Bears The Summer Rendezvous Kit Carson joins fifty Trappers and goes to the Country of the Blackfeet Indians Annoyances received from these Indians Winter Quarters in eighteen thirty two Horses Stolen Kit Carson and eleven Men in Pursuit A Parley A Fight Kit Carson severely wounded His great Sufferings and Fortitude His Convalescence The Retreat A New Expedition Braggadocio Kit Carson Fights a Duel and Wounds his man Duels in the Rocky Mountains in Olden Times The fortunes of Gaunt s party in not finding game continued to grow darker and darker as they traveled from stream to stream The men began to grow disheartened at this succession of failures Kit Carson finally became so tired of going empty handed that he resolved to try a hunt upon his own account On stating his intentions to the party two of his old companions offered to join him These were gladly accepted by Kit and had they not been deterred by the consideration that their dangers would be greatly augmented if they worked with so small a party others would most willingly have joined his company With the good wishes therefore of Gaunt and his entire band Kit and his two brave comrades boldly and confidently commenced their march The plan Kit adopted was to confine his operations exclusively to the mountain streams and not to venture out upon the Prairie By taking this course he hoped to avoid much of the danger to be apprehended from Indians five Footnote five The mountain Indians during the Summer season generally come down from their secure retreats and are engaged either in hunting buffalo or marching on the war path When they are at peace with the Indians of the Plains which is rarely the case they join them and together with their united strength and skill they make piratical excursions into the Settlements of the Mexicans While out on this business they leave their families in some secluded spot for abundant caution placing them under the guardianship of the old men assisted by some of the younger members of the tribe For several months they followed the business of trapping without being in any way annoyed by the Indians Their success was abundant At the end of the season they had gathered together a splendid stock of beaver fur and began to think of a homeward trip Having made everything ready they finally started for Taos True their party was small and the risks they ran of attacks from hostile and covetous Indians were imminent but fortune or Providence favored them and there was finally a satisfactory end to their anxieties for after a quick march over the plains they arrived safely at Taos Beaver fur was at the time of their arrival in great demand and prices ruled correspondingly high Kit and his comrades obtained the benefit of this state of the market and disposed of their fine stock to great advantage The money realized so far as Kit s two comrades were concerned was soon expended in fleeting pleasures and a new outfit for the next trapping expedition which might offer Kit s former experience had been sufficient on this score and he had become impressed with the highly important fact that there existed a much wiser course to be pursued With his characteristic consistency Kit acted upon this conviction and wisely saved his hard earnings While remaining at Taos Kit Carson met with Captain Lee formerly of the United States Army but at this time a partner of Bent and saint Vrain two names as familiarly known to the mountaineers as the household words of their boyhood days Captain Lee was purchasing goods for the purpose of trading with and supplying the trappers He desired Kit Carson to join in his enterprise and made him an offer which was accepted In the latter part of October eighteen thirty two with their goods well packed and properly fitted for the rough transportation which they must necessarily be subjected to they set out to find the trappers They traveled for some distance on a route well known as the Old Spanish Trail This is nothing more than a mule path which leads from New Mexico to California Having arrived safely at White River they continued their march down stream following the windings of the river until they came to Green River Green River they forded and then struck across the country for the Winty River which is a branch of the Green River Here they found mister Robidoux who had a party of twenty men in his employ and who was engaged both in trapping and trading according as opportunity presented itself Soon after these parties met snow began to fall indicating the approach of the cold season A mutual understanding having been arrived at the two parties joined together and began to establish Winter Quarters suitable for the whole They selected a site for their permanent camp on the Winty River at its mouth where the men made themselves as comfortable as possible under such circumstances They were provided with skin lodges so common among the Indians of America and which according to Kit s mountaineer experience are very comfortable substitutes for houses During the winter mister Robidoux lost six of his most valuable and high priced horses in the following manner Attached to the camp there was a California Indian who was employed by mister Robidoux a keen and shrewd savage and one whose acquaintance with the trappers had enabled him to gain the confidence of mister Robidoux He was also an expert with the rifle and possessed undoubted courage with great bodily strength and activity These qualifications made him a troublesome customer in a skirmish This Indian s education on the score of property rights had not been as well attended to as the methods of attack and defence in the chase and on the war path By some not strange personal argument he concluded to appropriate the six valuable horses above mentioned in the law wordy vocabulary of civilization to his own use benefit and behoof without asking the consent good will approbation permission and personal directions of the said owner to wit mister Robidoux As these horses were worth even at that remote spot on the great American Continent the just and full sum of two hundred dollars each making a round sum total of twelve hundred dollars mister Robidoux was not content to pocket the loss or much less to allow the rascal to enjoy ill gotten wealth on the principle that stolen fruit is sweet He determined if possible to show him that some stolen fruit is bitter Knowing Kit Carson s reputation for skill and his fearless disposition as soon as he had discovered his loss he came and requested him to pursue the Indian Kit Carson is a man who never works without orders except when he is leader He therefore informed Captain Lee of mister Robidoux s request and asked permission to serve his friend This as a matter of course was readily granted by Captain Lee when Kit instantly made his preparations for the adventure He was very soon on horseback well armed and well prepared for hard and close work There chanced near by to the camp to be an Indian village belonging to the Utah Tribe The whites were on friendly terms with the inhabitants of this village which determined Carson to seek out from among their warriors one active and intelligent brave and get him to join in the chase This was the more easily accomplished as Carson s reputation for skill courage and experience was already well known in this tribe He himself had made a large circle of acquaintance among the braves and many of them had become strongly attached to him Some of these attachments have existed for years and are still maintained for a fact well known the American Indian warrior as a general rule is true and unchangeable in his friendships With this object in view Carson putting his horse to his speed started for the Utah village On making his errand known to such of the braves as enjoyed his confidence he found no difficulty in engaging a well known warrior and one on whom he knew he could rely to accompany him The wily savage was soon ready for the march when Kit gave the word to start Both men were splendidly mounted Their pace was that of no sluggard The high conditioned animals which they rode seemed to catch the eager spirit of their masters and entering into it bent themselves to their work with determination accordingly To discover the trail of the deserter and to study its various characteristics a science of no mean or useless order in the matter of a woodman s education required the two men to slacken their pace for a short time The tracks made by the stolen animals however were well marked and to such practised eyes afforded a certain indication as to their route Again putting their horses to their speed with compressed lips and eyes directed to the trail before them Carson and the Indian warrior dashed on feeling confident that if the rascal escaped with his ill gotten booty the sin would not be laid upon their shoulders The trail led down the Green River This fact made Carson conclude that California was the destination aimed at in the deserter s calculations Kit and his Indian brave had accomplished about one hundred miles having not once lost sight of the trail when most unfortunately for Kit the horse of the Indian was suddenly taken sick and his strength gave out completely The Indian could go no further except on foot and this mode of travel he was unwilling to adopt refusing absolutely Carson s request made to him to do so This was an unpleasant predicament especially as the rascal who formed the chase was a dangerous antagonist even to an experienced fighter and in an honest cause Goaded on by the fear of punishment for theft Carson well knew that he would require all of his own address to purchase success for the rascal would not fail to make a most desperate resistance But Kit Carson s courage arose as the difficulties of the adventure seemed to multiply With a farewell word to his Indian companion he put spurs to his horse and entered boldly upon the trail alone being determined to run every hazard which the unhappy accident to the Indian s horse seemed to require at his hands The spectacle here presented to the reader is one which exhibits Kit Carson in his true character both as a faithful and earnest friend and a determined and dangerous adversary Such is his character A life of most singular events has never yet found him false to his friend or his manhood While he is not rash in judgment he is consummately skillful quick and brave Onward he dashed never for an instant taking his eagle eye from the tracks which formed his compass Think not that such tracks are easily traced None but a practised and ready eye can follow them to any advantageous end To trace them even at a snail s pace for an unpractised eye is like the child putting pen and ink to paper through his first copy book of penmanship Many and many an awful blot and horribly crooked line will doubtless carry the simile fully and strikingly to the mind But the result which crowned Kit s effort showed conclusively that notwithstanding he had followed the trail for over one hundred and thirty miles he had made no blots or crooked lines At the distance of thirty miles from the place where he parted with his Indian companion Kit discovered the chase His pace now became tremendous The wily savage had descried him almost at the same instant that he was discovered by Kit and instantly prepared for a desperate encounter With this object in view the savage turned to seek a cover from whence he could fire upon his adversary and reload long before he should himself become exposed to a shot The rascal s plan was good enough but he was too slow in its execution to overcome Kit s activity Kit had unslung his rifle as soon as he saw his enemy Anticipating the object of the savage he instantly covered him with his rifle His horse was now at full speed and he was rapidly nearing the Indian At the moment he discovered that the Indian had reached his cover and before he could take advantage of it without relaxing his horse s speed he fired The ball from Carson s rifle was so well directed that the Indian as it struck him gave one bound and then fell dead in his tracks At the same instant the rascal s rifle went off with a sharp report sending a bullet whizzing at some distance from the line of Carson s approach The fact of the Indian s rifle being fired at all is a sufficient explanation of what was his intent had his career not been so suddenly cut short thereby preventing its fulfillment The words of an old trapper are here very much to the point The author was on a fitting occasion questioning him in regard to Kit Carson s capabilities with the rifle Said he If a man has a serious quarrel with Kit Carson he had better not let him get the first sight over his rifle for if he succeeds in this his adversary is as good as dead An intimate acquaintance and tried friendship with Kit Carson has since then repeatedly furnished occasions which have confirmed this trapper s statement although in the first instance a person will find it no easy task to render an altercation necessary for Kit Carson holds his passions fully under control and besides they are of a very conciliatory type No man will sooner shun a difficulty when justice honor and necessity do not warrant strife The work of collecting the horses was soon accomplished when Carson immediately commenced his journey back to the camp This he reached in safety after overcoming a few minor difficulties caused by his charge and had the satisfaction of returning the six horses to mister Robidoux in as good condition as they were the night on which they were stolen and also of informing him that there was one rascal less in the world to prey upon honest people This event served to interrupt the monotony and routine of winter camp duty affording a basis for many a long yarn during the evening hours around the camp fires These trappers especially whenever a green eyed bundle of curiosity chances to seek their company can spin yarns most wondrous The habits of the beaver and their remarkable instinct form a fit subject for their active imagination It would doubtless add very much to the interest of these pages if we could set down a few of these anecdotes and tales for the general reader but the task would be hopeless as to its accomplishment To give them life and reality they require all the surroundings of time place and occasion there should be the dark night the wild whistling wind the shaking tent with its covering of skins the roasted venison bear s meat or horse flesh the rifles standing in the corners the lamp of bear s grease in fine all the similitude of camp life Then the wild stories of bear fightings beaver intelligence Indian deviltry and hairbreadth escapes become intensely real The auditor hangs upon each word which falls from the lips of the supposed sage orator with eager earnestness while curiosity never becomes satisfied Ah Jones that is a whopper Sure as I live but the beaver slept every night with the trapper and in the day time if he left the tent the beaver would fall to work and make a dam across the floor of the tent using the chist skins arms and everything Oh Jones But I tell you it is true Tame a beaver once and you ll find I se tellin a plain statement as true as ever a Padre made Padre who d believe a Mexican priest mister Jones that tame beaver of your n must have been born in the States where he hadn t trees and mud to build dams with and had to resort to furnitur That beaver responded Jones was as near like a human bein as any man present How do you make that out mister Jones Why one day his master died Well they tried all they could to console the beaver but it twant no use He wouldn t be consoled All he did was to git an ole shoe belonging to his master an if he didn t haul that ere shoe around day after day wherever he went Well the beaver gan to grow thin and one night they found he was a dyin jest from starvin himself to death and a huggin the ole shoe Oh Jones said the greenhorn you don t expect I ll swallow all that yarn But mister Jones and all of the other trappers present preserved an imperturbable dignity of mien as if the very reference to the animal mentioned demanded from them all due reverence Well but that was not doing as a human being would do I never seen a man carry an old shoe around till he died from starvin That is neither here nor there continued mister Jones It was when the trapper first made the beaver s acquaintance that he showed he knew as much as a human critter At that time he had one wife and lived with her all alone in a hole side o the dam They had two sons and a darter The darter the old beaver had married to a fine lookin young beaver who lived t other side the dam The whistle which the neophyte here gave seemed to give great dissatisfaction to all of the trappers present One of them quietly asked him Is that the way youngster you se bin eddicated in perliteniss of manners If it is I know a beaver who kin larn you sumthin In the fust place if a young beaver ever kums inter the presence of the ole uns especially if she s that is the ole uns a female beaver the young un mediately fetches his right fore paw up to his forehead jest hind the right eyebrow an makes a reverintial bow of cerimony in salute I se seen that ar oftener than you ve put one leg ahead of t other yit young un The trappers present all confirmed the truth of this statement by a solemn nod of assent to the query Ain t that true gentlemen which at least served to prevent unceremonious whistling It is thus that we might go on and fill page after page with this picture talk of the trappers Some of their yarns are pretty tightly strained but most of them contain a capital hit and are usually founded on the facts It is a well authenticated fact that the beaver has but one mate and that they live together a loving couple as if husband and wife As to their liaisons coquetry flirting and so forth doubtless the society in some parts of the human family will bear a faithful resemblance in these respects also As an example of industry the world will look in vain for a better one than is afforded by the little beaver of the Western Rivers Look at them patiently felling the tallest trees and so nicely adjusting their fall and calculating their height that they strike the opposite bank of their stream gaining a fixed and permanent lodgment It is thus that these wonderful little creatures will often erect dams across wide rivers and effectually stop the rushing torrents As has appeared after collecting the six horses Kit Carson returned with them safely into camp A few days subsequent to this occurrence a band of trappers belonging to another party en route entered the camp These men reported that Fitzpatrick and Bridger were encamped on Snake River distant about fifteen days journey This was too good news for Captain Lee and Kit to warrant their remaining any longer idle They doubted not but that they should be able to dispose of their goods to these parties With this object in view they prepared for the march and started Their journey although perilous and laborious was successfully accomplished Messrs Fitzpatrick and Bridger received and entertained them very hospitably and purchased their entire stock paying therefor in beaver fur Kit Carson then joined Fitzpatrick s band but remained with it only one month His reason for separating from it was that there were too many men congregated together either to accomplish much or to make the general result profitable in the distribution He accordingly arranged an enterprise upon his own account and from his well established reputation found more men than he wanted ready to join him From those who applied he selected but three These were men of the best material and no man could judge a trapper s qualifications better than Kit Carson With his three men he immediately set out for the Laramie River On this stream and its tributaries he spent the summer Perhaps our readers will look for a full description of the course which the American trapper pursues in order to catch beaver It is very simple in its detail but difficult and tedious in its application The trap is the common steel trap made in the usual form if there is any difference it is larger and more powerful It is set in the haunts of the beaver with a particular kind of bait six known chiefly among trappers It is a singular fact that frequently old beavers will be discovered springing the traps by the aid of a stick If discovered at his work he seems to enjoy hugely the vexation of the trappers which they sometimes exhibit An old trapper however especially if he be a Frenchman or Mexican feels so much pride in the matter that he will cover up his vexation under assumed politeness as if the beaver could understand and appreciate his language Footnote six Animalium patris testiculum But to escape from these pleasing digressions Kit Carson and his men concluded their summer s work with unusual success Their exertions had been crowned with rewards which surpassed their fondest anticipations As the wintry months were again fast coming on Kit and his men determined to rejoin Bridger s command The return trip was therefore commenced and duly prosecuted Late one afternoon just after the little party had gone into camp Kit having lingered somewhat behind suddenly rode into the camp ground and leaped from his horse giving it in care of one of the men With his rifle he then started in pursuit of game for supper He walked on about one mile from the camp and there came upon the fresh tracks of some elk Following up the trail he discovered the game grazing on the side of a hill In the neighborhood of the animals there were some low and craggy pine trees Moving along with great care he finally gained the cover of the trees which brought him in close proximity to the elk and within certain range of his rifle This care was the more necessary as his party had been without meat diet for some time and began to be greatly in need thereof These ever wary animals saw or scented him or at any rate became conscious of approaching danger from some cause before he could reach the spot from which he desired to take his aim They had commenced moving and in another instant would have bounded away out of all reach of his rifle His eye and piece however were too quick for them for bringing his piece into position and without dwelling upon his aim he sped a bullet after the largest and the fattest of the noble game before him He had wisely allowed for the first leap for his shot caught the nimble animal in mid air and brought him to the earth writhing in his death agony with a fearful wound through the heart and lungs from which there was no escape One quiver ran through the frame of the beautiful animal when he breathed his last The echoing sound of the rifle shot had hardly died away to which the true hunter ever listens with unfeigned pleasure as the sweetest of music on his ear whenever he has seen that his game is surely within his grasp the last faint melody was broken in upon and completely lost in a terrific roar from the woods directly behind him Instantly turning his head to note the source of this sound the meaning and cause of which he well knew by his experienced woodman s ear educated until its nicety was truly wonderful he saw two huge and terribly angry grizzly bears As his eye first rested upon these unwelcome guests they were bounding towards him their eyes flashing fiery passion their pearly teeth glittering with eagerness to mangle his flesh and their monstrous fore arms hung with sharp bony claws ready and anxious to hug his body in a close and most loving embrace There was not much time for Kit to scratch his head and cogitate In fact one instant spent in thought then would have proved his death warrant without hope of a reprieve Messrs Bruin evidently considered their domain most unjustly intruded upon The gentle elk and deer mayhap were their dancing boys and girls and like many a petty king in savage land they may have dined late and were now enjoying a scenic treat of their ballet troupe At all events Kit required no second thought to perceive that the monarchs of the American forest were unappeasably angry and were fast nearing him with mighty stride Dropping his rifle the little leaden bullet of which would now have been worth to him its weight in gold if it could by some magic wand have been transferred from the heart of the elk back into its breech he bounded from his position in close imitation of the elk but with better success The trees he hoped and prayed as he fairly flew over the ground with the bears hot in chase for one quick grasp at a sturdy sapling By good fortune or special Providence his hope or prayer was answered Grasping a lower limb he swung his body up into the first tier of branches just as passing Bruin brushed against one of his legs Bears climb trees and Kit Carson was not ignorant of the fact Instantly drawing his keen edged hunting knife he cut away for dear life at a thick short branch The knife and his energy conquered the cutting just as Messrs Bruin had gathered themselves up for an ascent a proceeding on their part to which mister Carson would not give assent mister Carson was well acquainted with the Messrs Bruin s pride in and extreme consideration for their noses A few sharp raps made with the severed branch upon the noses of the ascending bears while they fairly made them to howl with pain and rage caused them hastily to beat a retreat This scene of ascending getting their noses tickled and again descending howling with pain and rage now kept mister Carson and Messrs Bruin actively busy for some time The huge monsters and monarchs of the mountains were determined not to give it up so Such a full and fair chase and to be beaten by a simple white man on their own domain This evidently galled their sensitive natures It is true the roaring of the bears in his rear had stimulated mister Carson in the race so much so that he undoubtedly ran at the top of his speed and being naturally as well as by long practice very fleet of foot he had managed to outstrip his pursuers in the race It is true he had made short work of climbing the tree and here again had very innocently beaten the bears at their own game and one in which they took great pride It is more than probable that the bears were in too good condition to run well Had it been early spring time they would doubtless have been much lower in flesh That was their own fault too they should have known that racing time cannot be made on high condition After leaving their hibernating quarters they should have been less given to a sumptuous habit at the table Illustration Two huge and terribly angry grizzly bears were bounding towards him their eyes flashing fiery passion their pearly teeth glittering with eagerness to mangle his flesh and their monstrous forearms hung with sharp bony claws ready and anxious to hug his body in a close and most loving embrace PAGE eighty three Affairs were however by no manner of means settled They had the daring trespasser on their domain treed and almost within their reach and indeed to keep out of the way of their uncomely claws Kit was obliged to gather himself up in the smallest possible space and cling to the topmost boughs The bears now allowed themselves a short respite for breathing during which they gave vent to their wrath by many shrill screeches Then they renewed their endeavors to force the hunter from his resting place Mounted on their hind paws they would reach for him but the blows with the stick applied freely to their noses would make them desist In vain did they exhaust every means to force the man to descend he was not to be driven or coaxed The hard knocks they had sustained upon their noses had now aroused them almost to madness Together they made one desperate effort to tear Kit from the tree As in all their previous attempts they were foiled and their ardor dampened and cooled by the drumming operations upon their noses which this time was so freely and strongly applied upon one of them as to make him lachrymate and cry out with pain One at a time they departed but it was not until they had been out of sight and hearing for some time that Kit considered it safe to venture down from the tree when he hastened to regain and immediately to reload his rifle Thus ended an adventure in which Kit Carson considers that he failed to lose life and limb by the narrowest miss that ever occurred to him Although he has killed much more than his quantum of this kind of game and has gained what is a practical advantage to every western hunter to wit a knowledge of all their abilities with which they enforce sway Kit Carson regards this adventure in the light of a warning It is a warning too which he never allows himself to forget consequently whenever he has hunted since he watches as closely for signs of mister Bruin as he does for the game he seeks it would therefore be a difficult matter for the bears again to surprise him Some of the most desperate battles on record between hunters and wild animals are narrated of encounters with the bear tribe Several years ago a Mexican by the name of Armador Sanchez still well known in the Rocky Mountains as a brave and skillful hunter had a fight with a bear which lasted several hours This terrible battle ended by both the combatants being laid prostrate upon the ground so completely exhausted as to be utterly unable to reach each other from the want of physical strength In this condition they spent one night and on the following morning when the brave Mexican hunter had recovered sufficiently to be able to creep to his antagonist he found him dead This close conflict grew out of the hunter s noble daring in endeavoring to save the life of a Mexican boy whom at the instant the hunter attacked the beast the bear was about to tear into pieces At one time the bear had the youth in his terrible clutches in such a manner that it was impossible for him to plant a shot in any vital organ But nothing daunted with his rifle and revolver he lodged several bullets in other parts of the fierce monster Still the savage animal clung to the unfortunate boy endeavoring to tear him to pieces and horribly mangling him in every part of his body The noble hunter could resist no longer and dropping his pistols and rifle he drew his sheath knife and slung shot and after winding his blanket around his left arm to protects it rushed in and compelled the animal to turn upon him Wounds were freely given and returned but the wary Mexican fought with such dexterity and determination that the bear finally became so mad with pain and rage that by a tremendous effort with one blow of his powerful paw he knocked the brave hunter headlong upon the ground where he lay some time before recovering his breath Instead of following up this advantage the brute doubtless being deceived because the man did not move commenced examining and licking his own bleeding wounds But the brave hunter had now got his spirit so completely up that he determined to conquer his antagonist or die Early in the fight by a blow from his slung shot he had succeeded in breaking the bear s lower jaw This had greatly disabled the animal and undoubtedly was the successful wound which eventually gave Sanchez the victory When he felt himself sufficiently rested he renewed the fight and by adopting various manoeuvres in which he was greatly assisted by some adjacent trees succeeded in putting in several telling blows with his knife Again the animal became aroused to madness unendurable and gathering himself up for a final effort succeeded in planting a terrible blow on the hunter s head which once more brought him to the ground From this blow and the previous loss of blood the brave man fainted entirely away How long he remained in this state he could not tell but on becoming again conscious he found that the victory was on his side for the bear had already breathed his last The poor boy notwithstanding his wounds as soon as the battle was decided and as he supposed at the cost of his friend s life started for a neighboring fort and reaching it the following morning reported the affair A party of men well armed immediately marched to the rescue They found the brave hunter in a most pitiful condition with his flesh terribly mangled his clothes torn into ribbons and his back and shoulders one mass of lacerated wounds His reason had already become unseated In his native language he would call out to his now visionary foe If you are a brave man come on Although the most delicate care and assistance was rendered to Sanchez it was many weeks before he was able to resume his occupation and even then he owed his life to the wonderful recuperative powers of his healthy and iron constitution Had the fact been otherwise he could not have survived his injuries One more brave heart must have yielded its last drop of heroic blood in defence of youthful weakness This picture because it does not exaggerate the facts we leave with regret for it is a pleasure to contemplate such nobility of character whatever be the name which declares the governmental allegiance of the hero It is not going beyond the bounds of truth to assert that the grizzly bear of the Rocky Mountains is as formidable an enemy as the hunter is called upon to meet wherever the hunting ground and whatever the animal which opponents to our assertion may set up When caught out on the open prairie where he can be attacked on horseback and lassoed the chances are against the bear but in a broken country woe to his assailants unless life is saved by some trick or happy fortune a lucky shot a telling blow like Sanchez s with his slung shot or the fanciful drumming such as was Kit s on the noses of his antagonists or some other equally singular and unlooked for expedient The weight of one of these monsters often runs as high as fifteen hundred pounds and their fore paws which they can manage with the greatest dexterity frequently measure fourteen inches The courage sagacity and skill invariably evinced by this species of bear when engaged in a fight is not equaled by any other wild animal on the face of the globe not excepting the lion We take pleasure in here giving further publicity to the careful research and plain truths which have emanated from the pen of that distinguished and successful traveler doctor Livingston The new ideas which appear in his pages in regard to the courage of the King of Beasts have served in a measure to correct the general impression and to bring down from its high stilted hyperbole the courage sagacity and terrible power of the lion which he states are overrated We do not desire to contradict published statements any farther than our own personal knowledge extends hence we give our authority for our statements in regard to the lion very well satisfied ourself with doctor Livingstone s love of truth and earnest candor So much for the lion Our statements in regard to the Rocky Mountain grizzly bear rest upon our own knowledge and investigation gathered in his own haunts and on his own wild domain and as such are given upon our own responsibility Because brave American woodsmen can readily conquer the monarch of the American forest and because the chicken hearted Afric son or dweller trembles before the steady glare of the Afric King of Beasts ergo his bearship must in popular opinion play subordinate to his lionship For the sake of truth we should like to see the Spanish arena once open for a fighting encounter between a Rocky Mountain bear and an African lion full and native grown specimens of each The bull fights all good men abhor but such a battle would serve to set at rest a fast growing doubt among naturalists and so far would prove available to science and the cause of truth We would readily stake a purse on the bear With the Indians of the West who live mostly by hunting among whom nine out of ten would single handed readily face a score of native lion spearsmen and we verily believe put them to flight a man is considered a great brave who alone will undertake to kill a grizzly bear If he succeeds which is very rarely the case his fortune in his tribe is made once and for all The reputation he gains will cling to and follow him into his grave and form one of the chief burdens of the tradition which bears his name to posterity The Indians usually hunt and attack him in large parties and when the contest becomes really earnest it requires a most immoderate amount of yelling and fierce cry for the onset to keep their bravery up in fighting trim The victory is seldom gained without the sacrifice of several lives The mounted hunter almost invariably finds it a difficult task to bring his charger even within shooting range of this kind of game On an untrained or young horse the accomplishment of this feat is next to an impossibility for instinct seems to teach them the true character of the game even though they approach it for the first time seven Footnote seven The author once saw thirty brave and determined men in pursuit of an old grizzly bear and her two cubs near the head waters of the Arkansas River In vain they urged their horses to the chase Not a single steed in the entire band could be induced to run for the game The old bear was quite thin and her young nearly half grown and were very fleet of foot The chase lasted for about three miles but not a man present was able to obtain a shot because their riding animals were so completely frightened as to be almost unmanageable consequently the bears made good their escape The last that was seen of them was their dim outlines as they traveled leisurely up a deep ravine Darkness closed in about Kit Carson before he could reach his camp and indeed the sky was so cloudy that it was with great difficulty he found his way to it The idea of sending out a pack animal for the elk was out of the question therefore the whole party went supperless to bed In the morning they breakfasted upon a beaver found in one of their traps for they well knew that long before daylight the prowling wolves had feasted upon the elk hence they resigned it without a visit The flavor of the meat of the beaver is not very palatable and the trappers rarely use it never when they can do better Not so with its tail To this they are very partial and when properly boiled it is indeed a great delicacy Believing that Bridger would visit this place Kit ordered his men to make a permanent camp Kit s sagacity was not at fault in this hypothesis for in fifteen days this famous old mountaineer made his appearance accompanied by his whole band The two parties once more consolidated and started for the summer rendezvous which was appointed to be held on the Green River Upon their arrival at this place they found congregated all the principal trappers of the Rocky Mountains They were divided into two camps and numbered about two hundred men The objects which brought them thus together were the disposal of their fur and the purchase of supplies When all the parties had reported their arrival the trading commenced and was conducted upon a basis which gave general satisfaction The most exorbitant and fabulous prices ruled for such articles as the mountaineers required Sugar and coffee brought two dollars the pint powder the same and ordinary blankets were sold at fifteen and twenty five dollars each Coffee sugar and even flour were luxuries not every day indulged in by the hardy mountaineers They seldom partook of such dainties not more frequently than two or three times in the year and then merely as rare treats Their standard food was game and wild vegetables when in their season This meeting of the trappers continued in progress during two months It was then dissolved and once more the bold mountaineers formed into bands of a size convenient for trapping and started out to engage in the fall hunt Kit Carson joined a party of fifty men which was bound for the country occupied by the Blackfeet Indians and which lies on and adjacent to the head waters of the Missouri River The party met with very poor success in catching beaver but had their fill of annoyances from the tribe of savages already referred to Finally the state of affairs between the trappers and the Indians became so desperate that a white man could not leave his camp and go a distance of a single mile alone without being fired upon so completely and untiringly was their camp surrounded and watched by this wily and dangerous tribe of Indians This state of affairs led them to the determination to quit the country as the trapping season was far advanced With this line of policy they began the march and in the month of November eighteen thirty two arrived on the banks of the Big Snake River where they established winter quarters and remained until the subsequent February During these winter months the quiet monotony of their life was unexpectedly broken in upon by a band of their old enemies the Blackfeet Indians Taking advantage of an unusually dark night they entered the camp and succeeded in running off eighteen of their horses In consideration of their leniency displayed towards them when they were engaged trapping in their own country then merely acting on the defensive this act on the part of the savages appeared to the trappers to be more than they ought peaceably to bear Such appeared to be the general opinion and it was determined that a party should be sent out to recover the property and inflict a chastisement upon the hostile savages which they would not soon forget Kit Carson with eleven men to accompany him was selected for this delicate but highly important service Having prepared everything for the route the party started and after fifty miles of sharp riding through the snow came up with the savages The progress of the Indians had been fortunately considerably retarded by the necessity of breaking a path through the deep snow which had but very recently fallen The trappers instantly made an attempt to recover their animals which were found grazing on the side of a hill the Indians having previously come to a halt In doing this shots were exchanged by both parties without effect The savages had on snow shoes which gave them considerable advantage over the trappers After some manoeuvering the Indians asked for a parley which was granted On these occasions it is customary for one man from each party to advance to a spot about halfway between the contending parties and there have a talk The rascals through their representative informed the trappers through their representative that they had supposed that they had been committing a robbery upon the Snake Indians and that they did not desire to steal from the white men The trappers believing these tales to be false considered this a mere ruse on the part of the Indians to make them unwary of passing events However they put the very natural query to them why if they were so friendly disposed they did not follow out their usual custom and on seeing them approach lay down their arms and advance to meet their white brothers so that they might have a smoke together and talk over their difficulties and thus amicably settle matters Their replies to this query contained nothing but evasions Finally however it having been mutually agreed upon both parties disarmed and marched to the place where their representatives were talking The Calumet was then prepared lighted and handed around to each person present it being puffed once or twice by every one of the savages and every one of the whites The council then commenced The head men among the savages led off by making several lengthy and unmeaning speeches In their replies the trappers came directly to the point and said they could hear no overtures for peace until their property was restored to them The Indians upon hearing this demand several times repeated began to presume upon their strength assuming an overbearing demeanor After considerable talk among themselves they sent out and brought in five of the poorest horses declaring that it was the only number they could return The trappers upon hearing this ran for their arms when the Indians instantly started for theirs The fight was now renewed by both parties Kit Carson in the rush made for the rifles and one of his companions named Markhead succeeded in getting hold of their weapons first and consequently they formed the advance in the return to the contest They selected for their antagonists two Indians who were close together but who were partially concealed behind separate trees As Kit was on the point of raising his rifle to fire he saw by a quick side glance at Markhead that he was working at the lock of his gun without paying attention to his adversary who was aiming at him with almost a certainty of killing him Kit instantly changed the direction of his rifle and fired sending a bullet through the heart of Markhead s adversary but in thus saving the life of his friend he was obliged for the instant to neglect his own adversary A quick glance showed him the fellow sighting over his rifle and that the mouth of the Indian s gun covered his breast Upon the instant he endeavored to dodge the bullet but he was unsuccessful in doing so completely It struck him in such a way that first cutting the skin of his neck and glancing it passed through his left shoulder The head of the bone of the arm in the shoulder was shattered but fortunately the main artery of the arm escaped injury Notwithstanding his wound Kit immediately endeavored to reload his rifle In this effort he was unsuccessful for his left arm hung powerless by his side He was obliged therefore to remain a mere spectator during the remainder of the fight when being overcome by the loss of blood and the consequent fast increasing weakness he threw himself upon the ground The fight continued to be hotly contested by both the trappers and Indians until gradually the firing ceased when the trappers drew off and went into camp They did not dare to light any fires as they would inevitably bring the Indians upon them With nothing but their saddle blankets to protect them from the bitter cold even the safe and sound members of the party suffered severely Kit s condition failed not to arouse the heartfelt sympathy of his friends for there was not one among them who would not have readily risked life and limb to save Kit s But his condition was most critical at the least he was in a most unenviable condition His wounds bled profusely and the blood as it oozed out froze to the rude dressings This undoubtedly in the final result was beneficial to him as the cold acted as a partial check upon the hemorrhage It was however none the less painful to endure He bore his agonizing sufferings without a single murmur exhibiting in patient fortitude and resignation the same brave spirit and dauntless courage which distinguished him in every action Not once did a single complaint escape from his lips Had he received this wound within the pales of civilization with its concomitant constitution he might never have recovered the use of his arm In the pure air and with a constitution in the best possible trim after all danger from hemorrhage had passed his chances to recover were favorable and finally resulted in giving him once more the full use of his arm That night the trappers held a council It was decided that although the result of the fight had been that they had given the Indians a sound thrashing there having been several braves killed while they had suffered only in one wounded they were nevertheless not then strong enough to pursue the savages farther They adopted therefore the policy of returning to the camp and reporting their progress On their arrival a council was immediately called and their adventures duly rehearsed The result was that a second party was immediately organized comprising thirty men Under the command of Bridger this party followed the trail for some days but returned to camp without finding the savages They after their late engagement had made their way as fast as possible into distant parts A short time after this the weather moderated and it was time for the spring hunt This was now commenced and continued quite active for several weeks on the Green and Snake Rivers The success of the trappers was far beyond their most sanguine expectations Beaver fur seemed absolutely to rain down upon them The season having passed they went into summer rendezvous on the banks of the Green River This was brought about by the arrival of the traders with their supplies The whole force of trappers therefore again rested until the first week of September when they again broke up their camp for the fall hunt Some time previous to this last named event Kit Carson having recovered from the effects of his wounds was very reluctantly drawn into an affair of honor The circumstances of this occurrence we give in detail for two reasons It was an event in Carson s life and therefore is required at our hands but it serves to exhibit the manner of the duello among these western mountaineers which throws around the circumstance the importance of an example in their manners and customs By itself so far as Kit Carson was concerned it was of very little importance serving but little in his opinion to adorn the story of his life Among the men congregated at the rendezvous there was a Captain Shunan a powerful Frenchman The Captain was exceedingly overbearing in his intercourse with all around him Upon the slightest pretext he was sure to endeavor to involve some of the trappers in a quarrel The result was that he was heartily despised by all although for the sake of peace he was allowed to go unmolested One day his conduct was particularly offensive to the entire command for after having had two fist fights with a couple of weak and inoffensive men he commenced boasting that he could easily flog all the Frenchmen present and as to the Americans he said that he could cut a stick and switch them Such actions and manners at last attracted Kit Carson s notice and caused him to be greatly annoyed He thought the matter over and concluded that if Captain Shunan was allowed to gather many more such detestable laurels he would soon become even more bold and troublesome As no other member of the company seemed disposed to put a check upon such unmanly behavior he quietly determined to make the affair his own An opportunity soon presented itself A number of the company had congregated together and were engaged in conversation when Captain Shunan began anew his bullying language this time a little more boisterous than usual Kit Carson advancing into the centre of the company and placing himself in front of the Captain thus addressed him Shunan before you stands the humblest specimen of an American in this band of trappers among whom there are to my certain knowledge men who could easily chastise you but being peaceably disposed they keep aloof from you At any rate I assume the responsibility of ordering you to cease your threats or I will be under the necessity of killing you To this Captain Shunan did not reply but immediately after Kit Carson had closed his remarks he turned upon his heel and walked directly for his lodge Kit Carson was too well versed in trapper rules not to read the meaning of this action He therefore walked off also but in the direction of his own lodge In a brief space of time both men appeared before the camp each mounted on their respective horses The affair had drawn together the whole band and they were now quietly so many witnesses of the facts here recorded Captain Shunan was armed with his rifle Kit Carson had taken merely a single barrel dragoon pistol which happened to be the first weapon that had fallen in his way because of his hurry to be on the ground The two men now rode rapidly towards one another until their horses heads almost touched when both horsemen reined up and Kit Carson addressed Captain Shunan as follows Am I the person you are looking for Captain Shunan replied No It was apparent that this reply of Captain Shunan was a falsehood for while giving it utterance he raised his rifle in the act of shooting bringing it to his shoulder and covering his antagonist Before however Captain Shunan could discharge his gun the ball from Kit Carson s pistol shattered his forearm causing the rifle to tilt upwards which changed the direction of its contents in such a way that Kit Carson received a wound in his scalp while the powder severely burnt his face Illustration Before however Captain Shunan could discharge his gun the ball from Kit Carson s pistol shattered his forearm PAGE one hundred It was the universal opinion of the spectators of this unhappy scene that both parties fired nearly at the same instant The facts of the case show very plainly first that Captain Shunan s intent was to kill his antagonist Why did he aim at Kit Carson s breast Second that Kit Carson s shot was delivered perhaps a second or two in advance of Captain Shunan s third that Kit Carson did not desire to kill his antagonist but merely to save his own life by disabling his adversary The fact that his shot struck first and hit Captain Shunan s right arm is sufficient proof of this When Kit Carson s well known and indisputable skill with all kinds of fire arms is taken into the account and that notwithstanding this skill he hit his adversary in one of only two places his right or left arms which would have rendered his aim with the rifle uncertain the statement that Kit Carson did not intend to kill his adversary becomes an incontrovertible fact Last had Kit Carson not gained a second in advance in the firing he would have lost his own life inevitably and the emphatic No the lie of his antagonist would have been crowned with success Such plain deception seldom is allowed to triumph by an all wise Providence In judging Kit Carson in this matter the reader will commit an ungenerous error if he fails to allow to be placed in the balance of judgment the stirring deeds and daily hair breadth risks Kit Carson during so many years of his eventful life was constantly called upon to take a part in and undergo We take leave of this unfortunate scene in his life feeling confident a just public opinion will see in it no cause to pluck from the brow of Kit Carson any of the laurels which it has been called upon to place there As a man of truth honor virtue and reverence for the laws of his country Kit Carson has few equals and no superior among Americans It needed not this incident to establish his courage that had long been proven to be undoubted Nor did the result elate his feelings in the least He met his companions without a smile and invariably expressed his regrets that he felt it to be his duty for the good order and peace of the camp to interfere in the matter On the other hand when he espoused the cause of the majority in maintaining the right he was not a man to be easily thwarted When the affair was ended Kit was congratulated and received the thanks of nearly every individual present for each felt that a load of most vexatious and troublesome responsibility had been taken from his shoulders The good fellowship immediately introduced into the camp was also a circumstance of mark The wounded man was carried to his quarters and every attention shown him in the power of his companions His punishment had the effect completely to subdue him These duels among the old trappers of the Rocky Mountains were not very unfrequent occurrences Men situated as they were beyond the reach of the mighty arm of the law find it absolutely necessary to legislate for themselves It is not within our province to advocate either the right or wrong of duelling for with the best of reasoning there will always exist a difference of opinion on the subject In the case of these mountaineers when any serious offence was given the man receiving the injury to body or fame held the right of demanding satisfaction The interests of the entire band required an immediate settlement of difficulties so that their future plans could be carried out in concert In their dealings with each other they were strictly honorable and when by any mischance a rogue crept into their ranks if detected in any rascality he was summarily and severely dealt with Their duels were serious events for oftentimes both men were killed In fact the case could hardly be otherwise They were men of unflinching courage and their weapons were generally rifles which from long practice they held with a certain and deadly aim We cannot better close this passage in the life of Kit Carson than to quote the language held in eighteen forty six by the Biographer eight of the great explorer JOHN CHARLES FREMONT He Christopher Carson is a remarkably peaceable and quiet man temperate in his habits and strictly moral in his deportment In a letter written from California in eighteen forty seven introducing Carson as the bearer of dispatches to the government colonel Fremont says with me Carson and truth mean the same thing He is always the same gallant and disinterested He is kind hearted and averse to all quarrelsome and turbulent scenes and has never been engaged in any mere personal broils or encounters except on one single occasion which he sometimes modestly describes to his friends The narrative is fully confirmed by an eye witness of whose presence at the time he was not aware and whose account he has probably never seen or heard of I shall tell the story as it is gathered from them both nine Footnote eight Charles Wentworth Upham Footnote nine The reader will easily correct the few discrepancies of facts contained in this statement by the narrative which is from Carson himself and given with a view to publication In the year eighteen thirty five the reverend Samuel Parker made an exploring and missionary tour under the auspices of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions beyond the Rocky Mountains and as far as the settlements on the Columbia River In his printed journal he gives an account of the incident to which I am referring it occurred on the twelfth of August at a point on the borders of Green River beyond the South Pass on the occasion of a rendezvous that is on a spot selected for Indians trappers and hunters to bring to market their peltries and obtain supplies from the agents of the Fur Companies There was a large concourse of savage tribes and all the various denizens of the wilderness There were Frenchmen Spaniards Dutchmen Canadians and Western backwoodsmen The reverend mister Parker happened to be there to witness the strange gathering Of course there were some rude characters and not a little irregularity and disorder Conflicts were liable to arise between quarrelsome persons growing out of the feuds among the tribes and animosities between the representatives of different nations all actuated by pride of race or country A hunter named Shunan a Frenchman who was well known by the title of the big bully of the mountains mounted his horse with a loaded rifle and dashing defiantly around challenged any person of any nationality to meet him in single combat He boasted of his exploits and used the most insulting and irritating language and was particularly insolent and abusive towards Americans whom he described as only worth being whipped with switches Kit Carson was in the crowd and his patriotic spirit kindled at the taunt He at once stepped forward and said I am an American the most trifling one among them but if you wish to die I will accept your challenge Shunan defied him Carson at once leaped upon his horse with a loaded pistol and both dashed into close conflict They fired almost at the same moment but Carson an instant the quickest Their horses heads touched Shunan s ball just grazed Carson s cheek near the left eye and cut off some locks of his hair Carson s ball entered Shunan s hand came out at the wrist and passed through his arm above the elbow The bully begged his life and it was spared This put an effectual stop to all such insolent proceedings and Americans were insulted no longer Carson is still living being yet indeed in his prime His faithful commander has recorded his name on the geography of the continent by calling after him a river and a lake in the great basin they explored together CHAPTER V The Fall Hunt McCoy of the Hudson s Bay Company organizes a Trapping Party which Kit Carson joins The Hunt Scarcity of Beaver

and a favorite Missionary Kit Carson goes an a Trading Expedition to the Navajoe Indians The Return He accepts the post of Hunter of the Trading Post at Brown s Hole Arrangements for the fall hunt were now in active progress among the trappers Though the reader may find some similarity of fact and idea as we progress in this part of the Life of Kit Carson the interest which hangs about it nevertheless will not or should not be dampened because this pen painting of his long and active experience is a better and more faithful exhibit of those qualifications knowledge and skill which afterwards made him first the guide and then the bosom friend of the illustrious Fremont than any assertions whether authenticated by published record whether rested upon statement on knowledge information and belief of acquaintances and friends or whether facts taken from the thousand allusions to his exploits which have from time to time flooded the press of the United States The company of trappers which had been so fortunate as to secure the services of Kit Carson for facts seem now to warrant us in employing this language of just praise set out for the Yellow Stone River which stream they safely reached and on which they set their traps Dame Fortune here seemed to be in unpleasant mood Crossing the country from the Yellow Stone to the Big Horn River they again courted the old lady s smile with stoical patience but with no better results They next extended their efforts to the three forks of the Missouri River also to the Big Snake River The fickle old lady proved scornful on all these streams and finally on the latter stream and its tributaries they wintered In this section of the country they fell in with mister Thomas McCoy a trader who was in the employ of the Hudson s Bay Company In his trading operations mister McCoy had been unsuccessful and had concluded to organize a trapping expedition The inducements which he held out led Kit Carson and five of his companions to become members of his party With him they traveled to Mary s River ten from whence reports had circulated that beaver existed in great abundance The party struck upon this stream high up and slowly followed it down to where it is lost in the Great Basin Their success here was not satisfactory consequently the party returned to the Big Snake River By McCoy s direction the party tarried upon this river for some time when it was divided McCoy and a small escort started for Fort Walla Walla Kit Carson and the majority of the men took up their line of march for Fort Hall While en route the latter division was subjected to the greatest privations imaginable Among the worst of these was hunger as their trail led through a barren region of country For a short time they managed to subsist upon a small supply of nutritious roots which had been provided in advance This source finally gave out when their affairs assumed a most desperate attitude To keep from starving they bled their mules and drank the warm red blood with avidity so acutely had the days of fasting sharpened their appetites This operation however could not be repeated without endangering the lives of their animals These also were on a short allowance of food for the grass was very poor and scanty The whole party had become frightfully reduced in strength and began to think it necessary to kill some of their animals which at this time they could but ill spare In this terrible condition they met with a band of Indians who proved to be of a friendly disposition The party was then only about four days journey from Fort Hall Most unhappily the Indians themselves possessed but a scanty supply of provisions and no more than their immediate wants required It was not without considerable manoeuvering and talk during which all the skill and Indian experience possessed by Kit Carson were brought into active requisition that the savages were prevailed upon to trade with the trappers By the trade the half famished men obtained a fat horse which was immediately killed and on which they regaled with as much relish as the epicure in the settlements enjoys his joint of roast beef Footnote ten We give the name which was applied to this river at the date of the facts related in the text It is now called the Humboldt River To a man not accustomed to this kind of meat mule flesh and horse flesh would not be likely to prove over tempting or appropriate viands Let him feel the pangs of hunger very sharply and his ideas of lusciousness and propriety in respect to food will rapidly change The civilized world has condemned the practice as belonging to barbarians A mountaineer not being quite so fastidious scouts these ideas considering them foolish prejudices of people who have never been forced by necessity to test the wisdom of their condemnation Let the epicurean sages have their choice eat horse flesh or starve and they confidently maintain horse flesh would gradually grow to be considered a dainty the rarer over beef in proportion to its greater cost The trappers of the western prairies who wander thousands of miles over barren as well as fertile lands where game cannot exist from stern necessity are compelled to submit to all kinds of vicissitudes but with buoyant spirits they conquer results which a faint heart and yielding courage would behold almost in their grasp but fail to reach An emergency calls forth skill and great energies and in an unexplored country where as in the case here recorded everything living suddenly disappears it is then that the wits of a trapper save his life when an ordinary traveler would lie down and die Kit Carson and his men at last succeeded in reaching Fort Hall They were kindly received and amply provided for by the whites who then occupied it as a trading post Here they rapidly recruited their strength and in the course of a few days felt able to start out upon a buffalo hunt Reports had come in that large numbers of buffalo existed in close proximity to the Fort Kit Carson and his men were not the kind who live upon the bounty of others when game can be had in return for the necessary effort to find They were also not the men to hoard their stock of provisions whenever they met parties in distress The first query which different bands of trappers offer to each other on meeting in the wilderness is Does game exist in plenty or is game plenty in such and such sections of country This takes precedence over the commonplace question What s the news Oftentimes when venturing into distant and unexplored districts of territory they were obliged to take their chances of finding sustenance but they hardly ever neglected an opportunity to inform themselves on the subject on the contrary they often sacrificed both time and profits in order to secure correct details Any other course would have been fool hardy rashness just fit for parties of over bold inexperience to take the consequences of Hunting the buffalo is a manly and interesting sport and as Kit Carson on this occasion engaged in it with successful results it might be interesting to the general reader and in this place the unity of the narrative seems to require a complete and practical description of the manner of taking the buffalo We have however deferred this part of our duty to an occasion when Kit Carson had his friend John C Fremont upon his first buffalo hunt We shall then permit the bold Explorer to tell the story of a buffalo hunt in our behalf eleven Footnote eleven See page one hundred sixty one During their sojourn at Fort Hall the hardy trappers were not idle Besides the calls upon them by the hunt they set to work with great industry repairing their saddles clothing and moccasins With the aid of a few buck skins usually procured from Indians and a few rude tools they soon accomplished wonders To give the reader an appropriate view of the genius to conquer obstacles displayed by the mountaineers he must picture one of them just starting upon a long journey over the prairies and through the mountains His wagon and harness trappings if he chances to be possessed of worldly effects sufficient to warrant him in purchasing a first class outfit present a neat and trim appearance Follow him to the point of his destination and there the reader will discover perhaps a hundredth part of the original vehicle and trappings While en route the bold and self reliant man has met with a hundred accidents He has been repeatedly called upon to mend and patch both wagon and harness besides his own clothing Though he now presents a dilapidated appearance he is none the less a man and if his name is known as a regular trapper and mountaineer he is immediately a welcomed and honored guest If the broadcloth of a prince covered his back spotless scientifically shaped and foreign woven his reception would not be more heartfelt and sincerely cordial It is amusing to see the raw hide patches of harness wagon and clothing now become dry and hard as oak To have dispensed with the use of buckskin on his route would have been like cutting off the right arm of the gallant pioneer Buckskin and the western wilds of America are almost synonymous terms at least the one suggests the other and therefore they are of the same brotherhood The traveler in these regions of this day fails not to learn and appreciate its value It has not only furnished material for clothing but has been used to repair almost every article in daily use Even the camp and tea kettle as well as the frying milk and saucepan bedstead and hammock chair and table all have had their buckskin appendage as fast as any of them have become injured or broken Everything being in readiness Carson set out with his followers for their hunting grounds Their pace was one of so much rapidity that after one day s march they discovered signs of the buffalo On the following morning immense herds were in sight A suitable place for a camp was soon selected and everything which could impede their work well stowed away The best marksmen were selected for hunters and the remainder of the party detailed to take care of the meat as fast as the hunters should bring it in Poles were planted on the open prairies and from one to the other ropes of hide were stretched Upon these ropes strips of the buffalo meat were hung for curing which consists of merely drying it in the sun s rays After it is sufficiently dried it is taken down and bound up in bundles During the time of hunting and curing the trappers feasted upon the delicacies of the game which consist of the tongue liver and peculiar fat which is found along the back of the buffalo Their past sufferings from hunger had made them so determined in the work of procuring game that in a few days they possessed meat sufficient to load down all their pack animals They now thought about returning to Fort Hall Their pace however rendered so by their weighty game was very slow Their old enemies the Blackfeet Indians had discovered them while engaged in this hunt They followed them on the march to the Fort the trappers being wholly unaware of their presence in fact the idea of hostile Indians had not troubled their thoughts Two or three nights after they arrived at the Fort taking advantage of a dark evening the Indians deprived them of all their animals This was the result of carelessness on the part of one of the men which under the circumstances was excusable The party had encamped just without the pickets of the Fort but had taken the precaution to secure their horses and mules while they slept by placing them in the corral twelve belonging to the station A sentinel was put upon duty over the corral in order to make everything doubly secure In the latter part of the night nearly at daybreak the sentinel saw two persons advance and deliberately let down the bars leading into the yard and drive out the animals He mistook these men for two of his companions who were authorized to take the herd out to graze Concluding therefore without going to them that he was relieved he sought his resting place and was soon fast asleep In the morning anxious inquiries were made for the horses and mules when a very short investigation revealed the truth of matters It was undoubtedly very fortunate for the sentinel that he fell into the error alluded to It was very apparent that the two advanced Indians who let down the bars were backed up by a strong party The signs of Indians discovered afterwards proved this beyond a doubt Their reserve party were posted where the least resistance on the part of the sentinel would have been followed by his quick and certain death This successful theft was no doubt considered by the Indians a cause for great rejoicing It may have formed the basis of promoting the brave who planned and directed it as the animals had been obtained without the loss of a man or even the receiving of a wound The parties living at the Fort were equally as poorly off for horses and mules as were now the trappers The same Indians had recently performed the same trick upon them The loss was most severely felt by the trappers inasmuch as they had not a single animal left upon which to give chase Nothing remained for them to enact except a stoical indifference over their loss and await the return of McCoy who had agreed after finishing his business at Fort Walla Walla to rejoin them at Fort Hall Footnote twelve Corral a barnyard This tribe of Indians the Blackfeet whose meddlesome dispositions have so frequently brought them in contact with Kit Carson in such and dissimilar affairs occupy the country on the Yellow Stone River and about the head waters of the Missouri There are other tribes in close proximity the most important of which is the tribe called the Crows When Kit Carson first entered upon his wild career the Blackfeet Indians numbered nearly thirty thousand souls They were greatly reduced in numbers within the next six or seven years between eighteen thirty two and eighteen thirty nine In the last named year in consequence of the ravages of the small pox heretofore alluded to and which prevailed the year previous they had lost at least fifty per cent The Indian computations of eighteen fifty according to Brownell give their numbers at only about thirteen thousand They are one of the finest races of the American Aborigines Powerful in frame and development well trained in horsemanship although in this they are surpassed by the Camanches capable of great endurance and usually well fitted as to arms dress horse trappings et caetera they generally prove knotty customers as enemies We ought not to pass by this notice of the Blackfeet Indians without calling the attention of the inquisitive reader to a remarkable proof which is afforded by the whole intercourse of these western trappers with the Blackfeet Indians as thus detailed by Kit Carson of an assertion hazarded some years ago by Charles De Wolf Brownell in his admirable work upon the Indian races of North and South America On pages four hundred sixty five six mister Brownell comes to the defence of the Crow tribe of Indians which up to that time had been characterized as a lawless thieving horde of savages But says mister Brownell those best acquainted with their character and disposition speak of them as honest and trustworthy The adventures of Kit Carson among both the Crow and the Blackfeet Indians we think demonstrate pretty conclusively which of these contiguous tribes are the horse stealers The Crows it will be remembered are more particularly inhabitants of the mountainous regions The Blackfeet have ever been their sworn and implacable foes Their burials of the hatchet have been few and far between and never in deep soil It is not therefore to be wondered at that the Blackfeet reputation should extend to the Crows but although circumstances exist which condemn the latter they are few in number compared with the sins laid by the traders and trappers at the tent doors of the former After the lapse of one month McCoy made his appearance and most opportunely brought an extra supply of animals The camp was soon struck and the whole band started for the rendezvous which had been appointed to convene at the mouth of Horse Creek on the Green River They reached this place after several days of hard travel As usual trading operations did not commence until all the regular bands of trappers had arrived and reported They were then commenced and continued through a period of twenty days Here Kit Carson left the company under McCoy and joined a company under the management of a mister Fontenelle which numbered one hundred men This party went to and trapped on the Yellow Stone River On commencing operations the party was divided into fifty trappers and fifty keepers The duties of the former were to take the beaver and provide game for food The latter to guard their property and cook The trappers were now in the midst of their sworn foes the Blackfeet Indians They felt themselves sufficiently strong and were desirous to pay off old scores They therefore trapped where they pleased being determined to dispute the right of possession to the country if attacked They were not however molested A good reason appeared for this soon after brought by some friendly Indians belonging to the Crow Tribe They informed the whites that the small pox was making terrible havoc with the Blackfeet Indians Thousands were dying and fears were entertained that the whole tribe would be cut off In order to attend to their sick they had secluded themselves The trapping season being nearly over as the streams began to freeze the party commenced looking out for a camping site In conjunction with the main body of the Crow nation they proceeded to a well protected valley and erected their lodges making themselves as comfortable as possible under the circumstances As the season advanced the cold became more severe until at last it was more intense than ever before experienced by the trappers or Indians Fuel however was abundant and excepting the inconvenience of keeping unusually large fires they suffered but little Not so with their animals It was with the greatest difficulty that they preserved them from starvation By the most unwearied exertions however they succeeded in obtaining food enough barely to keep them alive until the weather became more mild and auspicious At one time the crisis was so imminent that the trappers were compelled to resort to cottonwood trees thawing the bark and small branches after gathering them by their fires This bark was torn from the trees in shreds sufficiently small for the animals to masticate The Indians of the Rocky Mountains when suffering from hunger are often driven to the extremity of eating this material For miles not unfrequently the traveler discovers these trees denuded of their bark after a party has passed through on their way to find the buffalo The rough outside cuticle is discarded and the tender texture next to the body of the tree is the part selected for food It will act in staying the appetite but cannot for any great length of time support life It is dangerous to allow starving animals to eat freely of it the trappers therefore feed it to them but sparingly The intense cold operated to bring upon them another serious annoyance in the shape of immense herds of starving buffalo which goaded on by the pangs of hunger would watch for an opportunity to gore the animals and steal their scanty allowance of provender It was only by building large fires in the valleys and constantly standing guard that the trappers succeeded in keeping them off During the winter to beguile the time the whites vied with their Indian allies in many of their sports As game existed in superabundance always ready for a loaded rifle both parties were contented and happy Time flew away rapidly and soon brought again the sunshine of spring with the buds and blossoms gay wild flowers green herbage and forest verdure For the purpose of procuring supplies the trappers dispatched two messengers to Fort Laramie They did not return and were never again heard from The conclusion which gained belief was that they had been murdered by the Sioux Indians The party waited as long as they possibly could for the return of their two companions but finally were compelled to commence the spring hunt without them They trapped a short time on the Yellow Stone River and then went to the Twenty Five Yard River From thence they proceeded to the head waters of the Missouri and on the most northern of its forks remained some time meeting with considerable success Here they obtained news of the Blackfeet Indians which showed that the ravages of the small pox had been greatly over estimated They were still nearly as strong and in character had not at all become subdued Upon drawing near to the source of this river they discovered that the main village of these savages their old foes was in close proximity This was pleasing intelligence to the trappers They had suffered too many unprovoked insults at their hands not to desire the avenging of their wrongs and to punish them by way of retaliation During the whole winter and in fact from the time the party was first organized they had anxiously abided their opportunity to meet and punish the rascally Blackfeet warriors The old scores or sores had been festering too long and here was a chance to probe them satisfactorily The party cautiously followed upon the trail which led to the Indian encampment until within one day s journey of it Here they came to a halt Kit Carson with five men was sent in advance to reconnoitre Upon approaching the Indians the reconnoitering party discovered them busily engaged driving in their animals to saddle and pack and making such other preparations necessary to the effecting of a hurried decampment Kit and his companions hastened back and reported the results of their observations A council was immediately held which decided to send out forty three picked men to give battle and for the commander of this party Kit Carson was unanimously elected The fifty five men left behind under mister Fontenelle had the onerous duty of guarding the animals and equipage It was a part of the programme also that the latter force should move on slowly and act as a reserve in case of need Kit Carson and his command were in fine spirits and lost no time in overhauling the village In the first charge they killed ten of the bravest warriors The savages quickly recovered from this blow and commenced retreating in good order For three consecutive hours they heroically received a series of these furious and deadly assaults without offering much resistance At the end of this time the firing of the mountaineers began to slacken as their ammunition was running low These experienced and brave though rascally Indians soon surmised the cause of this sudden change of affairs Rallying their forces they turned upon their assailants in right good earnest and a desperate hand to hand engagement ensued The white men now had an opportunity to use their small arms which told with such terrible effect upon their foes that they were soon driven back again They however rallied once more and charged so manfully that the trappers were forced to retreat In this latter engagement a horse belonging to a mountaineer by the name of Cotton fell throwing his rider and holding him on the ground by his weight This happened as he was passing a point of rocks Six of the warriors seeing the accident instantly hurried forward to take Cotton s scalp But Kit Carson s eagle eye was watching every part of the battle field and discovered in time to be of service the danger to which his friend was exposed Although some distance off Kit sprang from his saddle and with the leap of an antelope and the rallying cry for his men was on the ground ready to make a certain shot His aim and the crack of his rifle almost belonged to the same instant of time It was none the less sure The foremost warrior a powerful savage whose fingers evidently itched for the scalp of the mountaineer fell shot through the heart By this time others had followed the bold example of their leader when the five remaining warriors seeing the imminent danger which threatened them turned to run back into their band But two of them however reached a place of safety The remainder caught in their fleet career by the unerring and death dealing bullets of the mountaineers measured their lengths upon the battle ground stricken with wounds which demanded and received from them their last wild war whoop Illustration Kit Carson s eagle eye was watching every part of the battle field and discovered in time to be of service the danger to which his friend was exposed Although some distance off Kit sprang from his saddle and with the leap of an antelope and the rallying cry for his men was on the ground ready to make a certain shot PAGE one hundred twenty When Kit Carson fired his horse being under no restraint became frightened and dashed away leaving his brave rider on foot Kit however instantly comprehended his position The fallen horseman had succeeded in extricating himself but not without difficulty for the ground was very uneven He had received a few pretty severe contusions but was notwithstanding these worth a dozen Indians yet and failed not to show the fact Seeing Cotton thus all right Kit Carson made his way to one of his companions and as the fighting had apparently by mutual consent ceased for a few moments mounted up behind him and thus rejoined the main body of his men The runaway horse after quite a chase was soon captured by a trapper and returned to his captain A period of inactivity now reigned over the battle field each party apparently waiting for the other to again open the ball During this resting spell the reserve division of the trappers came in sight having been anxiously expected for some time The Indians showed no fear at this addition to the number of their adversaries On the contrary being no doubt carried away by their recent success in making a stand they commenced posting themselves among the rocks about one hundred and fifty yards distant from the position taken up by the trappers The arrival of the reserve was a great relief to the advance because they were tired of fighting without ammunition Having well filled their ammunition pouches they once more became eager for the affray Everything being in readiness with a cheer they started on foot to attack and dislodge the enemy In a few moments was commenced the severest skirmish of the day It became so exciting that frequently a trapper would occupy one side and a stalwart warrior the other of some large rock each intent upon the life of his adversary In such cases it required the closest watchfulness and the utmost dexterity to kill or dislodge the bold savage The power of powder in the hands of skillful men soon began to assert its superiority in the battle and when once the Indians commenced to waver it was all over with them Their first wavering soon broke into a complete rout when they ran for their lives As they scattered in every direction the pursuit which followed was short In this battle the trappers considered that they had thoroughly settled all outstanding accounts with the Blackfeet Indians for they had killed a large number of their warriors and wounded many more On their side three men only were killed and a few severely wounded Fontenelle and his men camped for a few days in the vicinity of the scene of their late engagement burying their dead and repairing damages They then resumed the business of trapping traversing the Blackfeet country whenever they chose without fear of molestation The success in their late engagement seemed to follow them in their business for their stock of fur accumulated rapidly While they were encamped upon Green River an express rider sent by the traders came into camp and informed the party that the rendezvous would be held on Mud River With a large stock of beaver the party started for that place arriving in eight days Besides the usual traders and trappers the party met at this rendezvous some missionaries and a distinguished English nobleman Sir William Stuart Of this latter gentleman Kit Carson says For the goodness of his heart and numerous rare qualities of mind he will always be remembered by those of the mountaineers who had the honor of his acquaintance Among the missionaries was Old Father De Smidt as he afterwards came to be familiarly called This gentleman is at present well known as being a leading literary and religious man at saint Louis Missouri Perhaps there never was a person in the wilds of America who became so universally beloved both by the white and red man While in the mountains he acted with untiring zeal for the good of all with whom he came into contact Wherever duty called him there he was sure to be found no matter what the obstacles or dangers spread upon the path He worked during a long series of years in these dangerous localities and accomplished much good When at last he returned to civilization he left an indelible name behind him In twenty days after the camp at the rendezvous was formed it broke up again into small parties Kit Carson with seven companions went to Brown s Hole This was a trading post Here they found two traders who were contemplating getting up a business expedition to the Navajoe Indians This tribe exhibits more traces of white blood than any other of the wild races in North America They are brave and fond of owning large possessions These consist chiefly of immense herds of fine horses and sheep In this respect they are not unlike the ancient inhabitants of the earth who watched their roving store on Syrian soil and the contiguous countries The parties who desired to trade with them usually carried a stock of trinkets and articles of use for which they received horses mules blankets and lariets thirteen Footnote thirteen A lariet is a beautifully made rope manufactured from hides and used for picketing horses out upon the prairies They are worth in New Mexico about two dollars each Navajoe blankets are very celebrated in the far west of America and especially in old Mexico where they are in great demand and command high prices Many of these articles are really beautiful and from their fine texture together with the great amount of labor spent in their manufacture are expensive even when purchased of the Indians The art of weaving these blankets has been long known to the Navajoe Indians and all the female children belonging to the nation are taught the art during their earliest years It is only after much practice however that they become expert Kit Carson joined the two traders whose names were Thompson and Sinclair and made the trip with them which they had planned They realized very handsomely from it bringing back a large drove of very fine mules The animals were driven to the Fort on the South Fork of the Platte where they were disposed of at fair prices Having received his share of the profits Kit returned again to Brown s Hole The season was too far gone for him to think of joining another trapping expedition that fall He therefore began to look about for some suitable employment for the winter As soon as it became known that his services were open for an engagement several offers were made him all of which he rejected The reader will doubtless see a contrast between the Kit Carson renowned as a trapper and hunter and the Kit Carson who at Taos only a few years before was glad to hire out as a cook in order to gain his daily sustenance For some time strong inducements of high wages had been held out to him by the occupants of the Fort in order to prevail upon him to accept the responsible and arduous office of Hunter to the Fort The task of supplying by the aid of the rifle all the flesh twenty men would naturally consume during an entire winter formed the duty required and expected from this officer The inducements were so tempting the task so congenial with his feelings and withal the urgent persuasions of the men so pressing that Kit Carson finally accepted the offer and entered upon his duties He soon showed the company that he knew his business and could perform it with an ease and certainty which failed not to elicit universal esteem and commendation When the time arrived for him to resign the office in the Spring he left behind him golden opinions of his skill as a marksman CHAPTER VI Bridger and Carson trapping on the Black Hills The Main Camp The Rendezvous Winter Quarters on the Yellow Stone Carson with forty men in a desperate fight with the Blackfeet

Trappers give up their Vocation The Journey to Bent s Fort Mitchell the Mountaineer His Eccentricities In the spring Kit Carson joined Bridger With four companions they went to the Black Hills to hunt In the streams adjacent to that country the beaver existed in large numbers and their success in trapping was excellent Soon after arriving however the party broke up Kit Carson and a trapper named Owens made a hunt by themselves and were very fortunate in obtaining a large stock of the fur After which they joined the main camp of the trappers on Green River When the summer was pretty well advanced the camp was broken up and all of its occupants started for the Rendezvous this year held on the Popoayhi a branch of the Wind River In the fall most of the trappers went to the country which lies in the immediate neighborhood of the Yellow Stone River Having trapped all the streams there they went into winter quarters on that stream Nothing was heard of their sworn enemies the Blackfeet Indians until about the middle of the winter A party who were out hunting suddenly came upon some signs which looking suspicious attracted their attention To these signs they gave a close investigation and fully made up their minds that they were close to the stronghold of their foes Without waiting to follow up the signs they immediately retraced their steps and informed their party in camp of their conviction that trouble was brewing A command of forty men was instantly detailed to seek out the Indians and give them battle Kit Carson was once more called upon to lead the brave trappers in this expedition and everything was left to his direction and good judgment Soon after commencing their march the company fell in with a scouting party of the enemy in the vicinity of the spot where the fresh signs had been discovered To this party the trappers gave chase wisely concluding they would run for their main body The result satisfied their anticipations In a short time they found themselves opposed to a strong band of the Indians when a regular fight was instantly commenced After quite a spirited contest the Indians gave way and retreated but in good order to an island in the Yellow Stone River where they had previously erected strong barricades Night put a stop to the scenes of the day and further action was deferred until the next morning As soon as the light would again warrant it the trappers plunged into the stream and made for the island being determined to dislodge the Indians To their great dismay the brave savages had already retreated having quietly given them the slip during the night The result of the battle the day before was now made apparent It was evident that not much powder had been wasted in the action The snow within the fortification was red with fresh blood and from the place a bloody trail led to a hole in the ice of the stream where a large number of lifeless bodies had been sunk There was nothing now to be done except to return to camp Upon their arrival a council was convened to devise measures and plans for their future conduct It was quite evident to all that the campaign had but just commenced It was the general impression that the main village of the Blackfeet tribe had been located within a few miles When therefore the news of their recent severe loss should be carried there by the survivors in the battle active measures would be set on foot to seek revenge It was the decision of the council that the trappers should act chiefly on the defensive Measures were immediately set on foot to guard against surprise To make everything doubly secure none but the most trusty and well tried men were detailed to perform sentinel duty Near their camp there was a very lofty hill which commanded a fine view of the surrounding country Upon this eminence they posted a sentinel throughout the day time Their arrangements having been all determined upon and plans laid the execution of them to men so well skilled in frontier life occupied but little time Notwithstanding this celerity in their movements they had been none too quick Soon after their preparations were fully made the sentinel on the hill gave his signal indicating the approach of the Indians showing that their precaution in this respect had been a wise one The order was immediately given to erect strong breastworks This task was so successfully accomplished that in a few hours they had prepared a little fortress which covered with their unerring rifles was impregnable against any force the Indians could bring against it The advance party of the savages soon appeared in sight but when they discovered the strength of the trappers they halted and awaited distant about half a mile from the breastwork the arrival of the rest of the band It was three days before the whole force of the Indians had arrived They mustered about one thousand warriors It was a sight which few white men of the American nation have looked upon Arrayed in their fantastic war costume and bedaubed with paint armed with lances bows and arrows rifles tomahawks knives et cetera some mounted and some on foot they presented a wild and fearful scene of barbaric strength and fancy Soon after their last company had reported the frightful war dance peculiar to the American savages was enacted in sight of the trappers position The battle songs and shouts which accompanied the dance reached the ears of the whites with fearful distinctness Any other than hearts of oak with courage of steel would have quailed before this terrible display of savage enmity and ferocity This dance to men so well skilled in the ways of the Indian warrior was a sure signal that the next day would be certain to have a fearful history for one party or the other and doubtless for both The odds most assuredly were apparently greatly in favor of the savage host and against the little band of hardy mountaineers The following day the expectations of the trappers were realized The Indians at the first dawn of day approached the breastwork eager for the battle They were evidently very much astonished at beholding the invincibility of the trappers position It was what they had not calculated upon and seemed to cast a perfect damper upon their courage After firing a few shots which did no harm and seeing that nothing could be accomplished except by a charge they commenced a retreat The trappers though only sixty strong were filled with disappointment and chagrin at the course taken by their wary foes They began to shout to their enemies in derisive terms hoping the taunts would exasperate and draw them into an attack Nothing however would tempt them to face the danger for they withdrew to a spot about one mile from the little fort and sat down in council The speeches appeared to be generally opposed to risking an assault for after the council was dissolved the Indians divided into two nearly equal parties and immediately marched off One band took the direction of the Crow country and the other shaped their course in the direction from whence they came The trappers remained at their little fort during the winter and were not again disturbed by the Indians Early in the following spring they set their traps on one of the tributaries of the Missouri River and finished the hunt on the head of Lewis Fork They then departed for the rendezvous which was held on Green River near the mouth of Horse Creek remaining there until the month of August and until the meeting was dissolved Kit Carson on the breaking up of the camp at the rendezvous accompanied by five other trappers went to Fort Hall and joined a party attached to the Northwest Fur Company With this band he trapped to the head of Salmon River Thence they went to Malade River trapping down it to where it empties into the Big Snake River They continued on up this latter river and then after trapping on Goose Creek and Raft River returned to Fort Hall Their stock of fur was quite extensive on their arrival here and an opportunity offering to dispose of it they sold out at a fair valuation After recruiting their strength at the Fort for one month Kit Carson accompanied by most of the trappers set out to join Bridger who was still in the country of the Blackfeet Indians Upon striking the Missouri River signs of trappers were discovered indicating that whoever the party or parties might be they were now above the place where Kit and his party then were With fourteen companions Kit started in advance of the main party to overtake and report who these men were Towards evening of the same day the advance party came up with the trappers and found that they were under the charge of Joseph Gale and in the employ of Captain Wyatt Gale informed Carson that his command had recently been engaged in a closely contested fight with the Blackfeet Indians that several of his party had been wounded and one by the name of Richard Owens was at first thought to be mortally so but eventually he had begun to recover and now was doing well Kit and his men remained one night with Gale On the following day his party commenced setting their traps intending to proceed up the river at a slow pace in order to allow the main party to overtake them The men sent out to set their traps had not gone from the camp over two miles before they were fired upon by a party of Blackfeet Indians and compelled to retreat They did so succeeding in joining their comrades without the loss of a single man The pursuit had been close and well sustained by the savages hence it became necessary to take instant measures in order to insure the safety of the advance Kit Carson who was the commander of the party after quietly surveying the scene gave orders for the men with their animals to conceal themselves as best they could in the brush His orders had been issued but just in time for the concealment was barely attained when the Indians were upon them They were received with a well directed volley from the rifles of the little party which brought down several of the fierce assailants They recoiled and retreated for a moment The moment was golden to the few white men Like men who were fighting for their lives but who were cool in danger they made no mistakes in reloading their rifles They were but just ready however for the second charge This time the savages came on with unearthly yells and desperate courage seemingly well satisfied that before them stood the men whose faithful rifle talk they had heard before Kit warned his men to keep cool and fire as if shooting game a warning which was entirely unnecessary for the result was that the savages were again driven back with a brave bleeding or dying for nearly every shot fired It was very fortunate that Kit had chosen this position for the engagement lasted nearly the entire day The loss on the part of the Indians was very severe They did everything in their power to force Kit and his party from their cover but without avail Every time they attempted to charge into the thicket the same deadly volley was poured in with never failing aim which invariably caused the savages to beat a hasty retreat Before the next attack the trappers were ready for them with reloaded rifles At last as if driven to desperation the Indians set the thicket on fire hoping to burn out their foes Most providentially in this also they were foiled After consuming the outer shrubbery the fire died out This was the last act attempted by the savages Seeing the ill success of their effort to dislodge the trappers by fire they departed They may have been hurried in this leave taking somewhat by news brought in by their spies of the near approach of the main body of the trappers which had arrived at a point about six miles distant from the battle ground They had been prevented from hearing the reports of fire arms by adverse winds and knew nothing of the fight until informed by the trappers engaged in it When sufficient time had elapsed for the Indians to be well out of sight Kit Carson and his companions left their cover and soon found their way into the camp of their friends Gale was so continually annoyed by these Indians that he joined the other trappers and together they concluded to leave their country Their combined forces though able to cope with them so far as defensive measures were necessary was utterly powerless to overawe them This made it next to an impossibility for them to continue in their country with a hope of success in business For the purpose of getting rid of them they moved off some distance to a small creek where beaver were plenty Trouble followed them however The first day of their arrival one of the party was killed by the Blackfeet Indians within a short distance only of the camp During the remainder of the stay made by the party on this stream the rascals hovered around and worried them to such a degree that a trapper could not leave the camp without falling into an ambuscade and being forced to fight his way back again It became evident to all interested that so long as such a state of affairs existed they could not employ their time with just hope of advantage After a short council it was decided to abandon this region of the country and go to the North Fork of the Missouri They soon accomplished their journey and began the business of trapping Proceeding up the river on the fourth day they came suddenly upon a large village of Flathead and Pondrai Indians who were encamped upon its banks These Indians were friendly to the whites A chief of the Flatheads and several of his people joined the trappers and went with them to the Big Snake River where they established their winter quarters The winter passed away so quietly that not a single incident occurred beyond the usual routine which the imagination of the reader can easily supply It was quite cold that season and the snow fell to a great depth Everything however was arranged as best conduced to comfort and the trappers found a pleasant and congenial exercise in hunting to supply their daily wants The winter seasons in the Rocky Mountains are usually fearful and severe There snow storms form mountains for themselves filling up the passes for weeks even those which are low being impracticable either for man or beast As a set off to all this the scenery is most grand provided the beholder is well housed If the case is otherwise and he be doomed to combat these terrible storms his situation is most critical During the summer months the lofty peaks of this mighty chain of mountains like those of the Alps are covered with white caps of snow As time the bright sun and the south wind wear out these old lady head gearings no matter what be the part of the year whether the cold days of January or the hot days of August the snow storms are faithful in replenishing them It affords a contrast of the elements of the grandest conception to stand in the shade of some wavy verdure of the valley wiping off the unbidden perspiration from the brow and at the same instant look upon a darkly threatening storm cloud powdering the heads of the hoary monster mountains from its freight of flaky snow So far these American giant mountains are unsurpassed by their Alpine neighbors of Europe Not so in the glaciers Throughout the great range there are none of those beautiful glaciers to be found that can compare with those possessed by their compeers in Europe To the traveler whose taste has led him to wander along the Great back bones or vertebrae of the two hemispheres preparing the mind to draw truthful contrast his pleasantest reveries will find him drawing comparisons between them He is never tired for the subject he cannot exhaust When supposing that his conclusions are at last made and that the Alps have won the highest place in favor some forgotten scene from America will assume the form and shape of a vivid recollection rife with scenic grandeur and sublimity restoring the Rocky chain to its counterpoise then an hour of peril and fearful toil will come to memory and until the same mental process shall bring them again to an equilibrium the far famed Alps will descend in the balance Each have their attractions each their grandeur each their sublimity each their wonderful awful silence each their long and glorious landscape views while to each the general contour is the same In the point of altitude the Rocky chain as is well known to science has the advantage but in historical science and lore the famous Alps stand preeminent True it is from ignorance that we are led to concede this because no man can give to the world the reminiscences of the Rocky Mountains Their history since the first red man entered them must forever rest in oblivion In scenery these mountains of the Western Continent again carry off the palm for they strike the observer as being more bold wild and picturesque than their formidable rivals To the foot worn traveler who has journeyed thirty or forty days upon the level prairies seeing nothing to break the monotony of a sea of earth the dark outlines of the Rocky Mountains gradually coming into the view never fail to prove a refreshing sight both to the physical and mental eye They appear as if descending from the heavens to the surface of the earth perpendicularly as though intended to present a perfect barrier over which no living thing should pass This view never fails to engross the earnest attention of the traveler and hours of gazing only serve to enwrap the mind in deeper and more fixed contemplation Is there not here presented a field such as no other part of this globe can furnish in which the explorer the geologist the botanist may sow and reap a rich harvest for his enterprise As yet scientific research on questions concerning the Rocky Mountains is comparatively speaking dumb But science will soon press forward in her heavenly ordained mission borne upon the shoulders of some youthful hero and once more the wise book men of the gown and slipper who surrounded with their tomes on tomes of learned digests are fast approaching the hour when they had better prepare their last wills and testaments will again be distanced in the race and doomed to argue technicalities To the hunter the real lover of and dependent upon the chase there can be no comparison between the mighty Alps and the huge Rocky Mountain Barrier of the American Prairies The one is destitute of animal life while the other bears a teeming population of the choicest game known to the swift leaden messenger of the white man s rifle He who wishes to behold in the same gaze beautiful valleys highly cultivated by a romantic and interesting race in rich contrast with wonderfully moulded masses of earth and stone covered with a medley of green foliage and white snow let him go to the Alps In the following spring Kit Carson accompanied by only one trapper started out to hunt the streams in the vicinity of Big Snake River The Utah nation of Indians inhabit this country and with them Kit Carson stood on a friendly footing The business of trapping was therefore carried on without fear of molestation The labors of the two were crowned with great success Loaded with a full cargo of fur they soon after set out for Robidoux s Fort which they reached in safety selling out their stock to good advantage Kit Carson made only a short stop at this Fort As soon as his fur was disposed of he immediately organized a small party consisting of five trappers and made a journey to Grand River After thoroughly trapping this river he established himself at Brown s Hole on Green River for the winter Early in the spring he returned with the same party to the country of the Utahs and hunted there for some time He then went to the New Park where they finished their trapping operations and returned to Robidoux s Fort Here Kit again found a purchaser for his furs but the prices at which he was obliged to sell them did not at all please him Within a few years the value of beaver fur had greatly deteriorated This was caused by the slow demand which had gradually ruled at the great emporiums of Europe and America The skill of the manufacturer had substituted a material for the making of hats which while it was cheaper pleased the great race of hat wearers The beaver itself was becoming scarce owing to their being so diligently hunted It was evident to Kit Carson and many of his mountaineer companions that their occupation was gradually becoming less profitable and that it would soon drive them into other employments Acting upon this impression Kit Carson accompanied by Old Bill Williams fourteen William New Mitchell and Fredericks a Frenchman started for Bent s Fort which was then located on the Arkansas River near a large forest of cotton wood trees and which is even at this day known as the Big Timbers The party struck the river at a point about one hundred miles above the Fort where in later years was built a settlement called saint Charles fifteen Footnote fourteen William Williams was a most celebrated character in the Rocky Mountains where he lived for many years At one time he was a Methodist preacher in the State of Missouri which he frequently boasted of in after life Whenever relating this part of his eventful career he used to say that he was so well known in his circuit that the chickens recognized him as he came riding past the farmhouses The old chanticleers would crow Here comes Parson Williams One of us must be made ready for dinner Upon quitting the States he traveled extensively among the various tribes of wild Indians throughout the far West and adopted their manners and customs Whenever he grew weary of one nation he would go to another To the Missionaries he was often very useful He possessed the faculty of easily acquiring languages and could readily translate most of the Bible into several Indian dialects His own conduct however was frequently in strange contrast with the precepts of that Holy Book He next turns up as a hunter and trapper when in this capacity he became more celebrated for his wild and daring adventures than before he had been for his mild precepts By many of his companions he was looked upon as a man who was partially insane Williams proved to be a perfect enigma and terror to the Mexicans who thought him possessed of an evil spirit He once settled for a short time in their midst and became a trader Soon after he had established himself he had a quarrel with some of his customers about his charges He appeared to be instantly disgusted with the Mexicans for he threw his small stock of goods into the street of the town where he lived seized his rifle and started again for the mountains His knowledge of the country over which he had wandered was very extensive but when Colonel Fremont put it to the test he came very near sacrificing his life to his guidance This was probably owing to the failing of Williams intellect for when he joined the Great Explorer he was past the meridian of life After bequeathing his name to several mountains rivers and passes which were undoubtedly discovered by him he was slain by the red men while trading with them Footnote fifteen Five years ago this settlement contained about thirty inhabitants mostly Mexicans It was frequently subjected to various kinds of annoyances from Indians On one occasion it was attacked by the hostile Utahs and Apaches who killed and carried off as prisoners a total of sixteen settlers Among the slain was a Canadian who fought so skillfully and desperately before he was dispatched that he killed three of his assailants When his body was found it was literally pierced through and through with lance and arrow wounds while the hand with which he had caught hold of some of these weapons was nearly cut to pieces Around his corpse there were a dozen horses tails which had been cut from the horses which were owned by the dead warriors and left there as a sign of mourning by the Indians On reaching the river two of the party Mitchell and New concluded to tarry awhile in order to gratify their humor for hunting But Kit Carson with the remainder of the mountaineers continued on their course and in three days time were safely lodged within the walls of the Fort One week subsequently Mitchell and New followed their companions to the Fort but in a sad plight They had not suspected danger and consequently had failed to guard against it They had been surrounded by Indians and deprived of everything they possessed except their naked bodies In this denuded state they arrived at the Fort They were kindly received and provided for by its noble hearted proprietors and for some time enjoyed a respite from all their troubles This mountaineer Mitchell full of eccentricities of character has seen the ups and downs of a frontiersman during a long and eventful life He once joined the Camanche nation and became one of their braves sixteen Footnote sixteen White men have frequently enrolled themselves as warriors among the American Indians but they have rarely gained the full confidence of the Indians who naturally very proud of their birthright view with a jealous eye all intruders In this capacity he won great renown by the efficient and active part he took in several engagements between the tribe of his adoption and their enemies His real object in turning Indian was to discover the locality of a gold mine which was said to have an existence in some of the mountains of northern Texas Having convinced himself that the story of the gold mine like many of the tales and traditions which gain currency in Indian countries was entirely without foundation Mitchell with some plausible excuse bid his red friends good bye and sought out his old comrades the trappers to whom he ever afterwards proved faithful About two years since Mitchell paid a trading visit to the States On his route it became necessary that he should pass over the Kansas Territory just at a time when political difficulties there were exciting the people to the highest pitch of anxiety The consequence was that his views upon the all absorbing questions at issue were frequently asked for by members of both parties To all these queries he invariably replied professing his ignorance of everything that appertained thereto This caused him to be regarded as a dangerous man and one not to be trusted He was accordingly treated with indifference and silent reserve This to a mountaineer who during a long period of years had met every pale face as a brother was insupportable usage In all haste he finished his business relinquished his contemplated journey through the States and started to return to his home in New Mexico While upon the road he accidentally fell in with a friend and in reply to the question where have you been said After a lapse of many years I thought I should like to see the whites again so I was going to the States But the sample I ve seen in Kansas is enough to disgust a man with their character They do nothing but get up war parties against one another and I would much rather be in an Indian country than in civilized Kansas Mitchell is full of dry humor and commands the faculty of telling a good story which makes him a pleasant traveling companion Since the time when Kit Carson first joined a trapping expedition up to the time of his arrival at Bent s Fort a period of eight long years he had known no rest from arduous toil Not even when to the reader he was apparently idle buried in the deep snows of the Rocky Mountains and awaiting the return of Spring has he rested from toil Even then his daily life has been given up to bodily fatigue and danger frequently in scenes which although of thrilling interest are too lengthy for this narrative It has been our purpose thus far to present Kit Carson undergoing his novitiate We regard and we think a world will eventually regard this extraordinary man as one raised up by Providence to fulfill a destiny of His all wise decree It is premature for us at this stage of our work to advance the argument upon which this conclusion so irresistibly to our mind is deduced We have yet before us an array of historical fact and incident to relate without parallel in the history of nations and in which Kit Carson plays no insignificant part For these eight years of stirring practical life Kit Carson relying upon his beloved rifle for his sustenance and protection had penetrated every part of the interior of the North American Continent setting his traps upon every river of note which rises within this interior and tracing them from the little springs which originate them to the wide mouths from which they pour their surcharged waters into the mighty viaducts or drains of the vast prairies and the mighty leviathan ranges of the Rocky Mountains In this time he had wandered over a wild territory equal in its dimensions to nearly all of the empires kingdoms and principalities of Europe combined His journeys as it has already appeared were made sometimes on foot and sometimes on horseback By themselves his travels will be called no trivial undertakings Each fresh adventure led him into regions where but seldom and more frequently never had a white man trod the soil He was therefore now an explorer in every sense of that distinguishing word with the single exception that he had not produced the results which the early culture and advantages of a scientific and classical education might have brought about But the history of the world furnishes few examples if indeed any where the physical training practical skill and knowledge of a country as possessed by Kit Carson have been united with scholastic lore At all events in the wisdom of that special Providence which was intending the gold mines of California to be consecrated to the advancement of American civilization with its religious freedom personal liberties and sacred literature the novitiate of Kit Carson was decreed to be wholly of a practical nature But while Kit Carson with his rifle was thus reared up in character courage and experience the same All wise hand was directing the pathway of a mind equal to accomplish His call through all the labyrinths of Science History and the Arts endowing that mind with a keenness of intellectual grasp in strange contrast with the practical skill of its future guide Those who see no God in nature no God in events may batter away at this proposition The record of Kit Carson s future tasks will prove it to be an invincible stronghold of theory Kit Carson s mind had now become well stored with facts and localities which were destined to be made known to the world through his connections with others It is not detracting from the merits of any one to assert that without frontiers men like Kit Carson the numerous scientific expeditions which have been sent out by the United States Government to explore the far West would have returned but sorry and meagre records for their employers After reading some of the many printed accounts which parties of a more recent date have gathered from their experience while making their way overland to the Pacific and also the sad fate of some brave men with noble hearts who have fallen a sacrifice upon the altar of science under the fatal blows of hostile savages attributable no doubt in some measure to bad advice we can thus more easily form a correct judgment of the hardships which Kit Carson has been called upon to endure and the wisdom or skill which he has displayed in surmounting every obstacle on his wild and solitary pathway The hardships which fell to the lot of the trappers of olden time also stand out in bolder relief Out of the whole catalogue of labors from which man to gain an honest livelihood has selected there is not one profession which presents so many formidable obstacles as that under consideration yet it was with difficulty that the mountaineers could wean themselves from their calling even when forced by stern necessity CHAPTER VII Kit Carson is employed as Hunter to Bent s Fort His Career for Eight Years Messrs Bent and saint Vrain The commencement of his Acquaintance with John C Fremont on a Steamboat Is employed as a Guide by the Great Explorer The Journey Arrival at Fort Laramie Indian Difficulties The business of the Expedition completed Return to Fort Laramie Kit Carson goes to Taos and is married He is employed as Hunter to a Train of Wagons bound for the States Meeting with Captain Cook and four companies of U S Dragoons on Walnut Creek Mexicans in Trouble Kit Carson carries a Letter for them to Santa Fe Indians on the Route His safe Arrival Amijos advance Guard massacred by the Texians The one Survivor The Retreat Kit Carson returns to Bent s Fort His Adventures with the Utahs and narrow escape from Death The Texians disarmed The Express Ride performed It has already appeared that Kit Carson was now at Bent s Fort Also that his occupation as a trapper of beaver had become unprofitable His services were however immediately put into requisition by Messrs Bent and saint Vrain the proprietors of what was called Bent s Fort which was a trading post kept by those gentlemen The position which he accepted was that of Hunter to the Fort This office he filled from that time with the most undeviating fidelity and promptitude for eight consecutive years During all of this long period not a single word of disagreement passed between him and his employers which fact shows better than mere words that his duty was faithfully and satisfactorily performed It is but seldom that such a fact can be stated of any employee no matter what the service Here however was an example in which the nature of the employment would of itself at times present cause for discord such as scarcity of game bad luck and men hungry in consequence But Kit Carson was too skillful in his profession to allow such reasons to mar his fortunes With the effort the game always was at hand for it was not his custom to return from his hunts empty handed Of course Kit Carson s duties were to supply the traders and their men with all the animal food they wanted an easy task when game was plenty but it would often happen that bands of Indians which were always loitering about the trading post would precede him in the chase thereby rendering his labors oftentimes very difficult From sunrise to sunset and not unfrequently during the night he wandered over the prairies and mountains within his range in search of food for the maintenance sometimes of forty men who composed the garrison of the Fort and who were dependent on the skill of their hunter but rarely did he fail them He knew for hundreds of miles about him the most eligible places to seek for game During the eight years referred to thousands of buffalo elk antelope and deer fell at the crack of Kit Carson s rifle Each day so added to his reputation that it is not to be wondered at considering the practice of his previous life that he became unrivalled as a hunter His name spread rapidly over the Western Continent until with the rifle he was the acknowledged Monarch of the Prairies The wild Indians accustomed to measure a man s greatness by the deeds which he is capable of performing with powder and lead were completely carried away in their admiration of the man Among the Arrapahoes Cheyennes Kiowas and Camanches Kit Carson was always an honored guest whenever he chose to visit their lodges and many a night while seated at their watch fires he has narrated to them the exciting scenes of the day s adventures to which they have listened with eager attention and unrestrained delight When arrayed in his rough hunting costume and mounted upon his favorite charger Apache a splendid animal Kit Carson was a picture to behold The buffalo were his favorite game and well were they worthy of such a noble adversary In the eyes of a sportsman the buffalo is a glorious prey To hunt them is oftentimes attended with great danger and while thus engaged many a skillful man has yielded up his life for his temerity The American bison or buffalo seems to demand at our hands a short episode from the narrative of Kit Carson s life This animal has several traits of character peculiarly his own If alarmed he starts off almost instantly and always runs against the wind his sense of smell appearing to be better than his eyesight What is a most remarkable fact a herd of buffalo when grazing always post and maintain a line of sentinels to warn the main body of the approach of danger When a strange object comes within sight or smelling distance these sentinels immediately give the alarm by tossing up their heads and tails and bellowing furiously The whole herd instantly heed the warning and are soon in motion Buffalo run with forelegs stiff which fact together with their ugly looking humps and the lowness of their heads gives a rocking swing to their gait If a herd when in full motion have to cross a road on which wagons are traveling they change their course but little and it sometimes happens that large bands will pass within a stone s throw of a caravan At night they are quite systematic in forming their camps In the centre are placed the cows and calves while to guard against the wolves large numbers of which always follow them they station on their outposts the old bulls The age to which a buffalo may attain is not known but it is certain that they are generally long lived when not prematurely cut off When their powers of life begin to fade they fall an easy prey to the small carnivorous animals of the plains The attempt has been made to domesticate and render them useful for agricultural purposes Hitherto such efforts have invariably failed When restrained of their freedom they are reduced to mere objects of curiosity In hunting buffalo the most important matter for the attention of the hunter is to provide himself with a suitable horse The best that can be selected is a trained Mexican or Indian pony Their familiarity with the game and the prairies over which the hunter must ride at full speed renders these horses quite safe On the other hand a green horse is sure to be terribly frightened when called upon to face these ugly looking animals and the rider will find he has his hands full to manage him without thinking of his game One great danger to be apprehended is the being led into a prairie dog town Here a horse needs experience to carry his rider through with safety Upon reaching the herd the hunter dashes in at the cows which are easily recognized by the fineness of their robes and their smaller forms The white man hunter of all weapons prefers a revolver but the red man uses the lance and bow and arrows which he handles with remarkable dexterity The place of election to make the deadly wound is just behind the fore shoulder where the long shaggy mane of the hump is intersected by the short hair of the body The death wound being given the blood gushes out in torrents and the victim after a few bounds falls on her knees with her head bunting into the ground If by chance a vital organ is not reached the pain of the wound makes the stricken animal desperately courageous She turns upon her pursuer with terrible earnestness ready to destroy him It is now that the horse is to be depended upon If well trained he will instantly wheel and place himself and rider out of harm s way but woe to both horse and hunter if this is not done The lives of both are in imminent danger In case the buffalo is killed the hunter rides up dismounts and makes his lariet fast to the horns of his game He next proceeds to cut up the meat and prepare it for his pack animals which he should have near by By their aid he easily carries it into camp It would doubtless afford many a page of exciting interest could we carry the reader through all the varied scenes of the chase in which Kit Carson has been the principal actor To transmit to our narrative a choice fight with the fierce old grizzly bear or perchance a fine old buffalo bull turning on his destroyer with savage ferocity or a wounded panther with its inevitable accompaniment in the shape of a hand to hand encounter for dear life each of such could not fail in giving interest to the general reader We are forced against our own conviction of the duty we owe the public as Kit Carson s chosen Biographer to pass by all such acts of his personal daring and triumph because of his own unwillingness to relate them for publication Notwithstanding our urgent requests backed up by the advice and interference of friends Kit Carson is inflexibly opposed to relating such acts of himself He is even more willing to speak of his failures though such are few rather than of his victories in the chase While the description of these adventures could not fail to furnish useful and interesting data most unfortunately Kit Carson considers that they are uninteresting minutiae which have pertained to the every day business of his life and no persuasion can induce him to enter upon their relation Not so when he is entertaining some of the brave chiefs of the Indian nations whose friendship he has won by his brave deeds If they are his guests or he himself theirs then their delight to hear kindles a pride in his breast to relate He knows that he will not by them be called a boaster Before quitting the mountains Kit Carson married an Indian girl to whom he was most devotedly attached By this wife he had one child a daughter Soon after the birth of this child his wife died His daughter he watched over with the greatest solicitude When she reached a suitable age he sent her to saint Louis for the purpose of giving her the advantages of a liberal education Indeed most of Kit Carson s hard earnings gained while he was a hunter on the Arkansas were devoted to the advancement of his child On arriving at maturity she married and with her husband settled in California The libertine custom of indulging in a plurality of wives as adopted by many of the mountaineers never received the sanction in thought word or action of Kit Carson His moral character may well be held up as an example to men whose pretensions to virtuous life are greater Although he was continually surrounded by licentiousness he proved true to her who had first gained his affections For this honoring of virtue he is indebted in a measure to the present sway which he holds over the western Indian races While their chiefs are seldom men of virtuous act or intent they are high in their appreciation of and just in their rewards to those whose lives are patterns of honor and chastity The Indian woman concerning whom no truthful tale of dereliction can be told when she arrives at the requisite age is invested with great power in her tribe One of their ancient customs well authenticated was to honor the virtuous women of their tribe with sacred titles investing them in their blind belief with power to call down the favor in behalf of the people of their Manitou or Great Spirit But every woman who aspired to this honor was required upon a certain day in the year to run the gauntlet of braves This was sometimes a terrible scene All the warriors of the tribe arrayed in their fiercest war costume and armed at every point with lance bow and arrow knife tomahawk et cetera were drawn up under command of the principal chief in single line At the head of this line was placed a kind of chaplet or crown the possession of which by any woman was supposed to confer the power of necromancy or magic rendering her able to heal diseases and to foretell events The line having been formed all of the young maidens of the tribe were drawn up in a body at the further extremity and any of them who aspired to the possession of the chaplet was at liberty having first uncovered her back and breast as far as her waist to march before the line of warriors within ten paces of their front and if she lived to reach it take possession of the crown On the other hand it was the duty of any warrior who knew aught by word or deed against the virtue of the advancing maiden to kill her upon the spot If one arrow was shot at her the whole band instantly poured a flight of arrows into her bare and defenceless bosom until life was extinct Again it was the belief of the untutored savage that whatever warrior failed to make his knowledge apparent if he possessed any by sending his arrow at the aspirant would always be an object of revenge by the Great Spirit both here and hereafter and that he would always live in the hereafter in sight of the Happy Hunting Grounds but never be allowed to enter them This latter belief made it a rare thing for young girls to brave the attempt but sometimes the candidates were numerous and the horrible butchery of the young girls which took place formed a terrible expose of their lewdness To kill an innocent girl was equally a matter which would be forever avenged by the Great Spirit The warm friendship which sprang up between Kit Carson and the proprietors of Bent s Fort under whom he held his situation as Hunter is a sufficient index of the gentlemanly conduct and amiability of heart evinced towards him on their part The names of Bent and saint Vrain were known and respected far and near in the mountains for in generosity hospitality and native worth they were men of perfect model mister Bent was appointed by the proper authority the first Civil Governor of New Mexico after that large and valuable country was ceded to and came under the jurisdiction of the United States Government He held this distinguished position however only a short time for in the year eighteen forty seven he was most foully and treacherously murdered by the Pueblo Indians and Mexicans A revolution had broken out among this turbulent people and in his endeavors to stem it Governor Bent was frustrated At last being driven to his own house he barricaded the doors and windows The rascally rioters after a severe contest succeeded in breaking open his doors and having gained access to their victim murdered him in cold blood in the midst of his family The only crime imputed by the mob against this benevolent and just man was that he was an American His untimely death which was mourned by all the Americans who knew him cast a settled gloom over the community in which he resided The Mexicans were afterwards very penitent for the share they took in the committal of this black crime Although several of the guilty party are still living they have left the country for the mountaineers have not forgotten the friend whom they esteemed and respected and will avenge his death if ever the opportunity offers Cerin saint Vrain the surviving partner of this celebrated trading firm was equally noted Upon the declaration of war between the United States and Mexico saint Vrain took an active part on the side of his country and from his extensive knowledge of the Mexican character was enabled to render important services At the close of the war he became extensively engaged in mercantile pursuits within the New Territory and by his untiring industry amassed a large fortune He was the first man who discovered and recognized the superior skill of Kit Carson as a hunter and for his subsequent success in life Kit Carson is much indebted to him saint Vrain is one of the oldest mountaineers now living and as such he is viewed by his old and new associates in the light of a father As the reader can now easily compute sixteen years had elapsed since Kit Carson commenced his exploits in the Rocky Mountains During this long period as frequently as once every year he had sat down to a meal consisting of bread vegetables meat coffee tea and sugar When dining thus sumptuously he considered himself as greatly favored with luxuries of the rarest grade Few men can say with Kit Carson During sixteen years my rifle furnished nearly every particle of food upon which I lived Fewer can say with equal truth that For many consecutive years I never slept under the roof of a house or gazed upon the face of a white woman It was after such an experience as we have endeavored to paint by the simple tale of his life thus far that Kit Carson longed once more to look upon and mingle with civilized people For some time before he determined to visit the United States this desire had taken possession of his mind and had been growing stronger The traders of the Fort were accustomed yearly to send into the States a train of wagons for the purpose of transporting their goods The opportunity therefore presented for Kit Carson to gratify his wish In the spring of eighteen forty two one of these caravans started with which Kit Carson traveled as a supernumerary When it arrived within the boundary lines of the State of Missouri he parted from his compagnons de voyage and went in quest of his relatives and friends whom now he had not seen for over sixteen years The scenes of his boyhood days he found to be magically changed New faces met him on all sides The old log cabin where his father and mother had resided was deserted and its dilapidated walls were crumbling with decay The once happy inmates were scattered over the face of the earth while many of their voices were hushed in death Kit Carson felt himself a stranger in a strange land the strong man wept His soul could not brook either the change or the ways of the people While he failed not to receive kindness and hospitality to which his name alone was a sufficient passport among the noble hearted Missourians nevertheless he had fully allayed his curiosity and as soon as possible bid adieu to these unpleasant recollections He bent his steps towards saint Louis In this city he remained ten days and as it was the first time since he had reached manhood that he had viewed a town of any magnitude he was greatly interested But ten days of sight seeing wearied him He resolved to return to his mountain home where he could breathe the pure air of heaven and where manners and customs conformed to his wild life and were more congenial to his tastes He engaged passage upon the first steamboat which was bound up the Missouri River We cannot resist the impulse which here struggles for utterance Look upon that little steamboat as it ascends the mighty Missouri bearing in its bosom the man who was destined to point out the hidden paths of the mighty West to mount and record the height of the loftiest peak of the American monster mountain chain to unfold the riches of the interior of a great and glorious empire to its possessors and finally to conquer with his good sword preparing the way for its annexation to his country the richest soil and fairest land on earth thus adding one more glorious star to the original thirteen of seventeen seventy six a star too of the very first magnitude whose refulgent brightness shines clear sparkling and pure for the Truth of Sacred Writ and American Liberty On the deck of that little steamboat the two men the one the master mind the giant intellect the man of research and scholastic strength the scientific engineer the other than whom his superior as an American mountaineer was not living stood uninterested spectators of each other and each unconscious why they had been permitted to enter the same cabin The Christian student of American history cannot pass by this simple circumstance without seeing Heaven s wisdom in such a coincidence namely Kit Carson for the first time in sixteen years bending his steps to his boyhood home just as his sixteen years of mountaineer skill and experience were required by one of the master workmen of American Engineering about to enter upon the exploration of inland North America Kit Carson wandered over the boat studying its mechanism admiring the machinery which so like a thing of life subserved the interests of human life watched with quiet reserve the faces and general appearance of his fellow passengers occasionally modestly addressed an acquaintance for some present were known to him and finally singled out from among the strangers a man on whose face he thought he discovered the marks of true courage manhood and nobility of character The impression which Kit Carson had thus received was nothing fleeting The eagle eye the forehead the form the movements the general features the smile the quiet dignity of the man each and all of these attributes of his manhood had been carefully noted by the wary and hardy mountaineer and had not failed to awaken in his breast a feeling of admiration and respect While on this boat Kit Carson learned the fact that the man whom he had thus studied was Lieutenant John C Fremont of the U S corps of topographical engineers also that Lieutenant Fremont had been earnestly seeking Captain Drips an experienced mountaineer but that he had been disappointed in finding him Upon learning this Kit Carson fell into a deep reverie which lasted some little time when having brought it to a conclusion he approached Lieutenant Fremont and modestly introducing himself said Sir I have been some time in the mountains and think I can guide you to any point there you wish to reach Lieutenant Fremont s answer indicated his satisfaction in making the acquaintance which Kit Carson had offered him and that he would make inquiries concerning his capabilities of performing the duty for which he offered himself The inquiries which the then lieutenant instituted or at least may be supposed to have instituted must have been favorable for soon afterwards Kit Carson was engaged by Colonel Fremont to act as guide to his first exploring expedition at a salary of one hundred dollars per month Upon arriving in Kansas the party prepared for a long and dangerous journey which lay before them The objects of this expedition was to survey the South Pass and take the altitude of the highest peaks of the Rocky Mountains besides gathering all the collateral information which they could The party had been chiefly collected in saint Louis It consisted of twenty two Creole and Canadian voyageurs mister Charles Preuss a native of Germany whose education rendered him a master in the art of topographical sketching and towards whom Colonel Fremont has always extended high and just encomium Henry Brant a son of Colonel J H Brant of saint Louis nineteen years of age young Randolph Benton a son of Colonel Benton twelve years of age mister L Maxwell a mountaineer engaged as the hunter of the party and finally Kit Carson as guide making including the commander of the Expedition twenty eight souls On the tenth day of June eighteen forty two the party commenced their march The daily routine usually observed on the march was as follows At daybreak the camp was aroused the animals led out and turned loose to graze breakfast about six o clock immediately after which the line of march was resumed at noon there was a halt of one or two hours the march was then again resumed and kept up until within an hour or so of sunset when the order was usually given to encamp the tents were then pitched horses hobbled and turned loose to graze and the cooks prepared supper At night all the animals were brought in and picketed carts set for defence and guard mounted Illustration BUFFALO HUNT PAGE one hundred sixty one The party had only accomplished a few miles of the march when they fell in with the buffalo Before we pursue the narrative of Kit Carson s life we must redeem our promise and allow colonel Fremont to describe his own impressions in his first Buffalo Hunt in which Kit Carson and mister L Maxwell were his companions and guides colonel Fremont says A few miles brought us into the midst of the buffalo swarming in immense numbers over the plains where they had left scarcely a blade of grass standing mister Preuss who was sketching at a little distance in the rear had at first noted them as large groves of timber In the sight of such a mass of life the traveler feels a strange emotion of grandeur We had heard from a distance a dull and confused murmuring and when we came in view of their dark masses there was not one among us who did not feel his heart beat quicker It was the early part of the day when the herds are feeding and everywhere they were in motion Here and there a huge old bull was rolling in the grass and clouds of dust rose in the air from various parts of the bands each the scene of some obstinate fight Indians and buffalo make the poetry and life of the prairie and our camp was full of their exhilaration In place of the quiet monotony of the march relieved only by the cracking of the whip and an avance donc enfant de garce shouts and songs resounded from every part of the line and our evening camp was always the commencement of a feast which terminated only with our departure on the following morning At any time of the night might be seen pieces of the most delicate and choicest meat roasting en appolas on sticks around the fire and the guard were never without company With pleasant weather and no enemy to fear and abundance of the most excellent meat and no scarcity of bread or tobacco they were enjoying the oasis of a voyageur s life Three cows were killed today Kit Carson had shot one and was continuing the chase in the midst of another herd when his horse fell headlong but sprang up and joined the flying band Though considerably hurt he had the good fortune to break no bones and Maxwell who was mounted on a fleet hunter captured the runaway after a hard chase He was on the point of shooting him to avoid the loss of his bridle a handsomely mounted Spanish one when he found that his horse was able to come up with him Animals are frequently lost in this way and it is necessary to keep close watch over them in the vicinity of the buffalo in the midst of which they scour off to the plains and are rarely retaken One of our mules took a sudden freak into his head and joined a neighboring band to day As we are not in a condition to lose horses I sent several men in pursuit and remained in camp in the hope of recovering him but lost the afternoon to no purpose as we did not see him again Astronomical observations placed us in longitude one hundred deg five forty seven latitude forty deg forty nine fifty five July one As we were riding quietly along the bank a grand herd of buffalo some seven or eight hundred in number came crowding up from the river where they had been to drink and commenced crossing the plain slowly eating as they went The wind was favorable the coolness of the morning invited to exercise the ground was apparently good and the distance across the prairie two or three miles gave us a fine opportunity to charge them before they could get among the river hills It was too fine a prospect for a chase to be lost and halting for a few moments the hunters were brought up and saddled and Kit Carson Maxwell and I started together They were now somewhat less than half a mile distant and we rode easily along until within about three hundred yards when a sudden agitation a wavering in the band and a galloping to and fro of some which were scattered along the skirts gave us the intimation that we were discovered We started together at a hand gallop riding steadily abreast of each other and here the interest of the chase became so engrossingly intense that we were sensible to nothing else We were now closing upon them rapidly and the front of the mass was already in rapid motion for the hills and in a few seconds the movement had communicated itself to the whole herd A crowd of bulls as usual brought up the rear and every now and then some of them faced about and then dashed on after the band a short distance and turned and looked again as if more than half inclined to stand and fight In a few moments however during which we had been quickening our pace the rout was universal and we were going over the ground like a hurricane When at about thirty yards we gave the usual shout the hunter s battle cry and broke into the herd We entered on the side the mass giving way in every direction in their heedless course Many of the bulls less active and less fleet than the cows paying no attention to the ground and occupied solely with the hunter were precipitated to the earth with great force rolling over and over with the violence of the shock and hardly distinguishable in the dust We separated on entering each singling out his game My horse was a trained hunter famous in the west under the name of Proveau and with his eyes flashing and the foam flying from his mouth sprang on after the cow like a tiger In a few moments he brought me alongside of her and rising in the stirrups I fired at the distance of a yard the ball entering at the termination of the long hair and passing near the heart She fell headlong at the report of the gun and checking my horse I looked around for my companions At a little distance Kit was on the ground engaged in tying his horse to the horns of a cow which he was preparing to cut up Among the scattered bands at some distance below I caught a glimpse of Maxwell and while I was looking a light wreath of white smoke curled away from his gun from which I was too far to hear the report Nearer and between me and the hills towards which they were directing their course was the body of the herd and giving my horse the rein we dashed after them A thick cloud of dust hung upon their rear which filled my mouth and eyes and nearly smothered me In the midst of this I could see nothing and the buffalo were not distinguishable until within thirty feet They crowded together more densely still as I came upon them and rushed along in such a compact body that I could not obtain an entrance the horse almost leaping upon them In a few moments the mass divided to the right and left the horns clattering with a noise heard above everything else and my horse darted into the opening Five or six bulls charged on us as we dashed along the line but were left far behind and singling out a cow I gave her my fire but struck too high She gave a tremendous leap and scoured on swifter than before I reined up my horse and the band swept on like a torrent and left the place quiet and clear Our chase had led us into dangerous ground A prairie dog village so thickly settled that there were three or four holes in every twenty yards square occupied the whole bottom for nearly two miles in length Looking around I saw only one of the hunters nearly out of sight and the long dark line of our caravan crawling along three or four miles distant The trail which the party left behind them now forms the emigrant road to California via Fort Laramie Salt Lake et cetera On reaching Fort Laramie Fremont found a fearful state of affairs existing among the Sioux Indians through whose country his route lay An encounter had recently taken place between a war party belonging to the Sioux nation and a party of trappers and Snake Indians In the fight the Indians had been worsted and several of their braves killed To revenge themselves the Sioux chieftains had collected their warriors and while the nation was encamped to the number of one thousand lodges they had gone forth to seek and punish their enemies At Fort Laramie the exploring party met several trappers and friendly Indians who used their utmost endeavors to dissuade Colonel Fremont from venturing into such inevitable danger There was but one opinion expressed viz that as sure as he entered upon the journey the entire party would be massacred To all these admonitions and warnings Colonel Fremont had but one reply His government had directed him to perform a certain duty The obstacles which stood in his way it was his duty to use every means at his command to surmount therefore in obedience to his instructions he was determined to continue his march Finally he said that he would accomplish the object or die in the attempt being quite sure that if the expedition failed by being cut to pieces a terrible retribution would be in store for the perpetrators of the act Kit Carson his guide openly avowed that the future looked dark and gloomy but he was delighted to hear this expression from his commander He now felt that he had a man after his own heart to depend on and should danger or inevitable death be in store for them he was ready and willing to face either with him In order to be prepared for the worst Kit Carson felt it his duty considering the dangers apprehended to make his will thereby showing that if he had to fight he was ready to count it his last battle Colonel Fremont resumed his journey and very opportunely arrived at the South Pass of the Rocky Mountains without in any way being annoyed with Indians not even meeting any on the route He had now reached the field where his chief labors were to commence Without loss of time he set earnestly about his work making and recording such observations as he deemed to be essential and examining and exploring the country Having finished this part of his labors the ascent of the highest peak of the mountains was commenced The length of the journey had jaded the animals It was very difficult to procure game The men had undergone such severe hardships that their spirits had become almost worn out The daily fare now was dried buffalo meat This was about the consistency of a pine stick and in taste resembled a piece of dried bark Besides these rather uncomfortable prospects the expedition stood in constant fear of an attack by the Indians It was now in the country of the Blackfeet and only a short distance from the encampment at the foot of the mountain there was one of their forts In the face of all these obstacles sufficiently formidable to have deterred most commanders the mountain party was detailed being fourteen in number including Fremont A man named Bernier was left in command of the camp which had been made by felling forest trees in a space about forty feet in diameter using the trunks to form a breastwork The camp was thus concealed by the trees and their foliage It was well calculated for defence and a few determined men could have maintained it against almost any Indian force On the twelfth day of August the mountain party left the camp It was fifteen in number On the fourteenth of August some of the party reached an elevation at which the barometer stood nineteen point four hundred one On the fifteenth some of the party were sent back Kit Carson had command of this party The remainder consisted of Colonel Fremont mister Preuss Basil Lajeunesse Clement Lambert Janesse and Descoteaux The day previous Kit Carson had alone climbed one of the highest peaks of the main ridge from which he had a full view of the highest peak which rose about eight or ten hundred feet above him The arduous labors of the fourteenth August had determined the commander to ascend no higher Instead of carrying out this intention after Kit Carson with his party had set out Fremont made one more effort to climb the highest peak and succeeded His own words in describing this ascent are as follows At intervals we reached places where a number of springs gushed from the rocks and about eighteen hundred feet above the lakes came to the snow line From this point our progress was uninterrupted climbing Hitherto I had worn a pair of thick moccasins with soles of parfleche but here I put on a light thin pair which I had brought for the purpose as now the use of our toes became necessary to a further advance I availed myself of a sort of comb of the mountain which stood against the wall like a buttress and which the wind and the solar radiation joined to the steepness of the smooth rock had kept almost entirely free from snow Up this I made my way rapidly Our cautious method of advancing in the outset had spared my strength and with the exception of a slight disposition to headache I felt no remains of yesterday s illness In a few minutes we reached a point where the buttress was overhanging and there was no other way of surmounting the difficulty than by passing around one side of it which was the face of a vertical precipice of several hundred feet Parfleche is the name given to buffalo hide The Indian women prepare it by scraping and drying It is exceedingly tough and hard and receives its name from the circumstance that it cannot be pierced by arrows or spears The entire dress of Fremont and his party on their ascent to the top of America consisted of a blue flannel shirt free and open at the neck the collar turning down over a black silk handkerchief tied loosely blue cloth pantaloons a slouched broad brimmed hat and moccasins as above described It was well adapted to climbing quite light and at the same time warm and every way comfortable Putting hands and feet in the crevices between the blocks I succeeded in getting over it and when I reached the top found my companions in a small valley below Descending to them we continued climbing and in a short time reached the crest I sprang upon the summit and another step would have precipitated me into an immense snow field five hundred feet below To the edge of this field was a sheer icy precipice and then with a gradual fall the field sloped off for about a mile until it struck the foot of another lower ridge I stood on a narrow crest about three feet in width with an inclination of about twenty deg N fifty one deg E As soon as I had gratified the first feelings of curiosity I descended and each man ascended in his turn for I would only allow one at a time to mount the unstable and precarious slab which it seemed a breath would hurl into the abyss below We mounted the barometer in the snow of the summit and fixing a ramrod in a crevice unfurled the national flag to wave in the breeze where never flag waved before During our morning s ascent we met no sign of animal life except a small bird having the appearance of a sparrow A stillness the most profound and a terrible solitude forced themselves constantly on the mind as the great features of the place Here on the summit where the stillness was absolute unbroken by any sound and the solitude complete we thought ourselves beyond the region of animated life but while we were sitting on the rock a solitary bee bombus terrestris the humble bee came winging his flight from the eastern valley and lit on the knee of one of the men Around us the whole scene had one main striking feature which was that of terrible convulsion Parallel to its length the ridge was split into chasms and fissures between which rose the thin lofty walls terminated with slender minarets and columns which are correctly represented in the view from the camp on Island Lake According to the barometer the little crest of the wall on which we stood was three thousand five hundred and seventy feet above that place and two thousand seven hundred and eighty above the little lakes at the bottom immediately at our feet Our camp at the Two Hills an astronomical station bore south three deg east which with a bearing afterward obtained from a fixed position enabled us to locate the peak The bearing of the Trois Tetons was north fifty deg west and the direction of the central ridge of the Wind River Mountains south thirty nine deg east The summit rock was gneiss succeeded by sienitic gneiss Sienite and feldspar succeeded in our descent to the snow line where we found a feldspathic granite I had remarked that the noise produced by the explosion of our pistols had the usual degree of loudness but was not in the least prolonged expiring almost instantaneously Having now made what observations our means afforded we proceeded to descend We had accomplished an object of laudable ambition and beyond the strict order of our instructions We had climbed the loftiest peak of the Rocky Mountains and looked down upon the snow a thousand feet below and standing where never human foot had stood before felt the exultation of first explorers It was about two o clock when we left the summit and when we reached the bottom the sun had already sunk behind the wall and the day was drawing to a close It would have been pleasant to have lingered here and on the summit longer but we hurried away as rapidly as the ground would permit for it was an object to regain our party as soon as possible not knowing what accident the next hour might bring forth This peak was found by barometrical observation to be thirteen thousand five hundred and seventy feet above the waters of the Gulf of Mexico It bears the name of the Great Explorer being called Fremont s Peak The return trip was now commenced all of the objects of the expedition having been successfully accomplished The party again reached Fort Laramie in the month of September eighteen forty two Kit Carson had served in the double capacity as a hunter and guide It is sufficient to say of the manner in which he performed his duties that he won the friendship of John C Fremont and has ever occupied since then a prominent and permanent place in his esteem At Laramie Kit Carson s labors were done There he bid his commander good bye and set out for New Mexico Fremont returned to the United States in safety Thus terminated the first of his great explorations Kit Carson s Indian wife had long since been dead In the month of February eighteen forty three he married a Mexican lady by the name of Senora Josepha Jarimilla Of this lady it is sufficient to say that for her many virtues and personal beauty she is justly esteemed by a large circle of acquaintance By this wife Kit Carson has three children to whom he is devotedly attached In the following April Kit Carson was employed as hunter to accompany Bent and saint Vrain s train of wagons while on their journey to the United States On arriving at Walnut Creek which is about two thirds of the distance across the Plains from Santa Fe Kit and his companions came upon the encampment of Captain Cook belonging to the United States Army who was in command of four companies of United States Dragoons Captain Cook informed Carson s party that in his rear was traveling a train of wagons belonging to General Armijo a wealthy Mexican For the purpose of insuring protection to this richly freighted caravan while passing through an Indian country the Mexican wagon master in charge had hired one hundred men There were rumors currently reported at that time and believed that a large body of Texians were waiting on the road to plunder and murder this wagon party and thus retaliate the treatment Armijo had been guilty of in the case of the famous Muir Prisoners but in order that this should not happen in Territory belonging to the United States the War Department had ordered Captain Cook and the dragoons to guard the property as far as the fording of the Arkansas River which was then the boundary line between the two countries The Mexicans had become alarmed for fear they might be attacked on parting with the United States soldiers so on meeting with Kit Carson who was well known to them they offered three hundred dollars if he would carry a letter to Armijo who was then Governor of New Mexico and lived at Santa Fe This letter apprised the General of the danger to which his men and property were exposed and asked for assistance to be immediately sent to them Carson accepted the offer and in company with Owens another mountaineer he set out on his express ride In the course of a few days he reached Bent s Fort where his companion concluded not to go on with him At the Fort Kit Carson was informed that the Utah Indians then hostile were scattered along his intended route He was not however turned from his duty by this danger but he resumed his journey immediately At this last named place his friend mister Bent kindly furnished him with a fleet and magnificent horse which he led so that should he find himself in peril he might mount this fresh animal and make his escape By watching for signs and being continually on the alert Kit Carson discovered the Indians and their village without exposing his own person to view He immediately secreted himself in an out of the way place and remained until the coming on of darkness when he passed safely by the camp of the savages In the course of a few days he reached Taos and handed his dispatch to the Alcalde of the town to be forwarded to Santa Fe As had been previously agreed upon he waited here for an answer with which he was to return At Taos Carson was informed that Armijo had already sent out one hundred Mexican soldiers to seek his caravan and that the General himself in command of six hundred more was soon to follow after It was afterwards learned that this unfortunate band of one hundred men went as far as the Arkansas River but could not find any traces of the train of wagons it not having completed that much of its journey therefore they commenced to retrace their steps but had proceeded only a few miles when they were suddenly attacked by the Texians who succeeded in massacring all but one man This survivor had succeeded in catching in the heat of the battle a fully equipped Texan horse which was loose Mounting him he made off in the direction of Santa Fe and at Cold Springs came upon the camp of Armijo to whom he reported proceedings The narration of this sad story so dampened the courage of the General and his men as to cause them to make a precipitous retreat The spot where this slaughter took place has since gone by the name of the battle ground and many are the bleached human bones that are still to be found there It was during Carson s stay of four days in Taos that Armijo and his small army had started out in quest of the enemy but before his departure he had received the letter and directed an answer to be sent thinking perhaps that Kit Carson might reach the train even if he himself did not On the answer coming into Carson s hands he selected a Mexican boy to accompany him and was quickly on the road again They had left Taos two days journey behind them and had reached the River Trinchera for they were traveling via the Sangero de Christo Pass and Bent s Fort when they unexpectedly met four Indian warriors Eat Carson immediately recognized them as hostile Utahs As yet the red men were some distance off and while Kit and his companion stood meditating what was best to be done the latter spoke and said to the former I am a boy and perhaps the Indians will spare my life At any rate yours is much more valuable than mine therefore mount the horse you are leading without delay and make your escape Carson at first thought this advice to be good and was about acting on it when it struck his equally generous heart how cowardly such a course would be to desert a youth who had in the hour of peril so manfully borne himself Turning to the boy he thanked him and added that he could not and would not desert him He said we must stand our ground together and if we have to die let us take with us each his warrior While this colloquy was going on the foremost of the Indians came up He approached Carson with the air of a man sure of an easy victory and with a bland smile proffered one hand in friendship while with the other he grasped Kit s rifle A powerful blow from the fist of the latter released his hold and instantly laid him sprawling upon the ground The other Indians seeing the fate of their companion hastened to his rescue When they reached talking distance Kit standing with his rifle brought to his shoulder informed them that upon the first hostile demonstration they made he and his companion would fire The Indians commenced shaking their priming into the pans of their flint lock guns and while doing so talked loud and threatened to perform a great many things This was a mere ruse to intimidate Kit and his companion and throw them off their guard It was however well understood and operated to make them only the more vigilant This endeavor to draw off Kit s attention was continued in various ways but finally seeing the determined posture of their opponent they grew weary of the game and at last departed The journey was now resumed After five days of hard traveling Kit and his companion entered Bent s Fort without further molestation Here Kit Carson learned that the Texians had been caught by Captain Cook and his dragoons in United States Territory and had been disarmed This had immediately relieved the conductors of the train from all anxiety They had consequently continued their route not thinking a stop at Bent s Fort necessary as had been anticipated general Armijo s letter of instruction was accordingly left by Carson with mister Bent who promised to forward it to Santa Fe by the first favorable opportunity To pursue and overtake the wagons would be nothing but labor thrown away All danger had disappeared CHAPTER VIII Kit Carson visits Fremont s Camp Goes on the Second Exploring Expedition The Necessary Arrangements Trip to Salt Lake Explorations there Carson is

The Route on the Return Trip Mexicans come into their Camp asking Aid and Protection Indian Depredations Carson and Godey start on a Daring Adventure The Pursuit The Thieves overtaken These Two White Men attack Thirty Indians The Victory Horses retaken The Return to Camp One of their Companions killed The Journey continued Arrival at Bent s Fort The Fourth of July Dinner A few days before Kit Carson s arrival at Bent s Fort colonel Fremont had passed by and had informed the Traders there that he was bound on another Exploring Expedition Having finished up his business with the Mexicans Kit thought he would like to see his old commander once again Accordingly he started on his trail and after seventy miles of travel came up with him The meeting proved to be mutually agreeable Although Kit Carson had made this visit solely from his desire to see again his old commander and not with a view of joining his second expedition colonel Fremont insisted so strongly upon having Kit accompany him that he acquiesced in doing so For colonel Fremont Kit Carson has the greatest admiration He knows as well as any man living his bravery his talents and the many splendid qualities of his mind and heart The question will naturally arise does Kit Carson indorse the political creed upon which colonel Fremont accepted the nomination for the Presidency of the United States The best answer and the one which is true will be Kit Carson considers it one of the highest honors and greatest blessings to be a citizen of the United States He is willing to incur any danger for his country s good even if the sacrifice of his life is the alternative He has spent all his life in the wilds of America where news is always as scarce an article as luxuries of the table and fire side and where the political strifes of factions and parties are not known The inference will therefore be plainly apparent that his curiosity does not lead him to examine very attentively the minute workings of political machinery He is not a man to be swayed by friendship from performing any act which the interests of his country seem to require at his hands His political bias will therefore remain a matter of conjecture until such time if his life is spared to see it when New Mexico shall be admitted into the Union as a State So far he has never lived where he could exercise the right of franchise The time must come which shall entitle him to a Presidential vote before he decides what political party shall count him as its supporter Soon after Kit Carson was again enrolled under the command of colonel Fremont he received orders to return to Bent s Fort and purchase some mules of which the party stood in need Mules are valuable animals in new and mountainous countries They are often the only beasts of burden which can be successfully used in crossing the wild mountains Being more sure footed and more able to endure great fatigue than the horse in such expeditions they become absolutely necessary While he was absent on this duty the expedition journeyed first to Soda Springs and thence on to saint Vrain s Fort which was located on the South Fork of the Platte At this point the expedition was joined by Major Fitzpatrick with a command of forty men which he had enrolled under orders to assist in the exploration When Kit Carson had rejoined the party the arrangements for the arduous task in view were nearly complete Colonel Fremont divided his forces sending one division with most of the camp equipage on the more direct route This division was placed under the command of Major Fitzpatrick The other division under the command of Colonel Fremont consisting of a squad of fifteen men and his guide Kit Carson struck out up Thompson s Fork The object of this expedition had in view by the government was to have Colonel Fremont connect his explorations of the preceding year with the coast surveys of Commander Wilkes on the Pacific This would give the data for making a correct map of the interior of the wild lands of the continent From Thompson s Fork Colonel Fremont s division marched to the Cache la Poudre River and thence to the plains of Laramie until they came to the North Fork of the Platte This river they crossed below the New Park and bent their way to the sweet water reaching it at a point about fifteen miles below the Devil s Gate From this point they traveled almost the same road which is now used by emigrants and which leads to Soda Springs on Beaver River It had been decided by Fremont to go to the Great Salt Lake and accomplish its exploration He therefore started for that direction but before doing so ordered Kit Carson to proceed to Fort Hall and obtain such supplies as were required After procuring these necessities Kit Carson with one companion and his pack animals set out on the return from Fort Hall and eventually found Fremont on the upper end of Salt Lake From here the party journeyed around to the east side of the lake a distance of about twenty miles At this spot they obtained a good view of the lake and its adjacent scenery Before him and in bold relief stood out everything which the explorer desired to examine even to one of the several islands which are located in the midst of this wonderful collection of saline waters To this isolated land Fremont was resolved to go Among the rest of the forethought supplies there was an India rubber boat This was ordered to be made ready for a trip to the island early the following day No doubt our readers will be pleased to enjoy Colonel Fremont s account of this lake its scenery and characteristics We insert therefore as much thereof as our space will admit It was the twenty first day of August eighteen forty three that the little party reached Bear River which as has already appeared in another part of this work was the principal tributary of the Great Salt Lake At this point of Colonel Fremont s narrative he says We were now entering a region which for us possessed a strange and extraordinary interest We were upon the waters of the famous lake which forms a salient point among the remarkable geographical features of the country and around which the vague and superstitious accounts of the trappers had thrown a delightful obscurity which we anticipated pleasure in dispelling but which in the meantime left a crowded field for the exercise of our imagination In our occasional conversations with the few old hunters who had visited the region it had been a subject of frequent speculation and the wonders which they related were not the less agreeable because they were highly exaggerated and impossible Hitherto this lake had been seen only by trappers who were wandering through the country in search of new beaver streams caring very little for geography its islands had never been visited and none were to be found who had entirely made the circuit of its shores and no instrumental observations or geographical survey of any description had ever been made anywhere in the neighboring region It was generally supposed that it had no visible outlet but among the trappers including those in my own camp were many who believed that somewhere on its surface was a terrible whirlpool through which its waters found their way to the ocean by some subterranean communication All these things had made a frequent subject of discussion in our desultory conversations around the fires at night and my own mind had become tolerably well filled with their indefinite pictures and insensibly colored with their romantic descriptions which in the pleasure of excitement I was well disposed to believe and half expected to realize In about six miles travel from our encampment we reached one of the points in our journey to which we had always looked forward with great interest the famous Beer Springs which on account of the effervescing gas and acid taste had received their name from the voyageurs and trappers of the country who in the midst of their rude and hard lives are fond of finding some fancied resemblance to the luxuries they rarely have the good fortune to enjoy Although somewhat disappointed in the expectations which various descriptions had led me to form of unusual beauty of situation and scenery I found it altogether a place of very great interest and a traveler for the first time in a volcanic region remains in a constant excitement and at every step is arrested by something remarkable and new There is a confusion of interesting objects gathered together in a small space Around the place of encampment the Beer Springs were numerous but as far as we could ascertain were entirely confined to that locality in the bottom In the bed of the river in front for a space of several hundred yards they were very abundant the effervescing gas rising up and agitating the water in countless bubbling columns In the vicinity round about were numerous springs of an entirely different and equally marked mineral character In a rather picturesque spot about thirteen hundred yards below our encampment and immediately on the river bank is the most remarkable spring of the place In an opening on the rock a white column of scattered water is thrown up in form like a jet d eau to a variable height of about three feet and though it is maintained in a constant supply its greatest height is attained only at regular intervals according to the action of the force below It is accompanied by a subterranean noise which together with the motion of the water makes very much the impression of a steamboat in motion and without knowing that it had been already previously so called we gave to it the name of the Steamboat Spring The rock through which it is forced is slightly raised in a convex manner and gathered at the opening into an urn mouthed form and is evidently formed by continued deposition from the water and colored bright red by oxide of iron It is a hot spring and the water has a pungent and disagreeable metallic taste leaving a burning effect on the tongue Within perhaps two yards of the jet d eau is a small hole of about an inch in diameter through which at regular intervals escapes a blast of hot air with a light wreath of smoke accompanied by a regular noise As they approached the lake they passed over a country of bold and striking scenery and through several gates as they called certain narrow valleys The standing rock is a huge column occupying the centre of one of these passes It fell from a height of perhaps three thousand feet and happened to remain in its present upright position At last on the sixth of September the object for which their eyes had long been straining was brought to view Sept six This time we reached the butte without any difficulty and ascending to the summit immediately at our feet beheld the object of our anxious search the waters of the Inland Sea stretching in still and solitary grandeur far beyond the limit of our vision It was one of the great points of the exploration and as we looked eagerly over the lake in the first emotions of excited pleasure I am doubtful if the followers of Balboa felt more enthusiasms when from the heights of the Andes they saw for the first time the great Western Ocean It was certainly a magnificent object and a noble terminus to this part of our expedition and to travelers so long shut up among mountain ranges a sudden view over the expanse of silent waters had in it something sublime Several large islands raised their high rocky heads out of the waves but whether or not they were timbered was still left to our imagination as the distance was too great to determine if the dark hues upon them were woodland or naked rock During the day the clouds had been gathering black over the mountains to the westward and while we were looking a storm burst down with sudden fury upon the lake and entirely hid the islands from our view On the edge of the stream a favorable spot was selected in a grove and felling the timber we made a strong corral or horse pen for the animals and a little fort for the people who were to remain We were now probably in the country of the Utah Indians though none reside upon the lake The India rubber boat was repaired with prepared cloth and gum and filled with air in readiness for the next day The provisions which Carson had brought with him being now exhausted and our stock reduced to a small quantity of roots I determined to retain with me only a sufficient number of men for the execution of our design and accordingly seven were sent back to Fort Hall under the guidance of Francois Lajeunesse who having been for many years a trapper in the country was an experienced mountaineer We formed now but a small family With mister Preuss and myself Carson Bernier and Basil Lajeunesse had been selected for the boat expedition the first ever attempted on this interior sea and Badeau with Derosier and Jacob the colored man were to be left in charge of the camp We were favored with most delightful weather To night there was a brilliant sunset of golden orange and green which left the western sky clear and beautifully pure but clouds in the east made me lose an occultation The summer frogs were singing around us and the evening was very pleasant with a temperature of sixty deg a night of a more southern autumn For our supper we had yampah the most agreeably flavored of the roots seasoned by a small fat duck which had come in the way of Jacob s rifle Around our fire to night were many speculations on what to morrow would bring forth and in our busy conjectures we fancied that we should find every one of the large islands a tangled wilderness of trees and shrubbery teeming with game of every description that the neighboring region afforded and which the foot of a white man or Indian had never violated Frequently during the day clouds had rested on the summits of their lofty mountains and we believed that we should find clear streams and springs of fresh water and we indulged in anticipations of the luxurious repasts with which we were to indemnify ourselves for past privations Neither in our discussions were the whirlpool and other mysterious dangers forgotten which Indian and hunters stories attributed to this unexplored lake The men had discovered that instead of being strongly sewed like that of the preceding year which had so triumphantly rode the canons of the Upper Great Platte our present boat was only pasted together in a very insecure manner the maker having been allowed so little time in the construction that he was obliged to crowd the labor of two months into several days The insecurity of the boat was sensibly felt by us and mingled with the enthusiasm and excitement that we all felt at the prospect of an undertaking which had never before been accomplished was a certain impression of danger sufficient to give a serious character to our conversation The momentary view which had been had of the lake the day before its great extent and rugged islands dimly seen amidst the dark waters in the obscurity of the sudden storm were well calculated to heighten the idea of undefined danger with which the lake was generally associated Sept eight A calm clear day with a sunrise temperature of forty one deg In view of our present enterprise a part of the equipment of the boat had been made to consist of three air tight bags about three feet long and capable each of containing five gallons These had been filled with water the night before and were now placed in the boat with our blankets and instruments consisting of a sextant telescope spy glass thermometer and barometer In the course of the morning we discovered that two of the cylinders leaked so much as to require one man constantly at the bellows to keep them sufficiently full of air to support the boat Although we had made a very early start we loitered so much on the way stopping every now and then and floating silently along to get a shot at a goose or a duck that it was late in the day when we reached the outlet The river here divided into several branches filled with fluvials and so very shallow that it was with difficulty we could get the boat along being obliged to get out and wade We encamped on a low point among rushes and young willows where there was a quantity of driftwood which served for our fires The evening was mild and clear we made a pleasant bed of the young willows and geese and ducks enough had been killed for an abundant supper at night and for breakfast next morning The stillness of the night was enlivened by millions of water fowl Sept nine The day was clear and calm the thermometer at sunrise at forty nine deg As is usual with the trappers on the eve of any enterprise our people had made dreams and theirs happened to be a bad one one which always preceded evil and consequently they looked very gloomy this morning but we hurried through our breakfast in order to make an early start and have all the day before us for our adventure The channel in a short distance became so shallow that our navigation was at an end being merely a sheet of soft mud with a few inches of water and sometimes none at all forming the low water shore of the lake All this place was absolutely covered with flocks of screaming plover We took off our clothes and getting over board commenced dragging the boat making by this operation a very curious trail and a very disagreeable smell in stirring up the mud as we sank above the knee at every step The water here was still fresh with only an insipid and disagreeable taste probably derived from the bed of fetid mud After proceeding in this way about a mile we came to a small black ridge on the bottom beyond which the water became suddenly salt beginning gradually to deepen and the bottom was sandy and firm It was a remarkable division separating the fresh water of the rivers from the briny water of the lake which was entirely saturated with common salt Pushing our little vessel across the narrow boundary we sprang on board and at length were afloat on the waters of the unknown sea We did not steer for the mountainous islands but directed our course towards a lower one which it had been decided we should first visit the summit of which was formed like the crater at the upper end of Bear River valley So long as we could touch the bottom with our paddles we were very gay but gradually as the water deepened we became more still in our frail batteau of gum cloth distended with air and with pasted seams Although the day was very calm there was a considerable swell on the lake and there were white patches of foam on the surface which were slowly moving to the southward indicating the set of a current in that direction and recalling the recollection of the whirlpool stories The water continued to deepen as we advanced the lake becoming almost transparently clear of an extremely beautiful bright green color and the spray which was thrown into the boat and over our clothes was directly converted into a crust of common salt which covered also our hands and arms Captain said Carson who for some time had been looking suspiciously at some whitening appearances outside the nearest islands what are those yonder won t you just take a look with the glass We ceased paddling for a moment and found them to be the caps of the waves that were beginning to break under the force of a strong breeze that was coming up the lake The form of the boat seemed to be an admirable one and it rode on the waves like a water bird but at the same time it was extremely slow in its progress When we were a little more than half way across the reach two of the divisions between the cylinders gave way and it required the constant use of the bellows to keep in a sufficient quantity of air For a long time we scarcely seemed to approach our island but gradually we worked across the rougher sea of the open channel into the smoother water under the lee of the island and began to discover that what we took for a long row of pelicans ranged on the beach were only low cliffs whitened with salt by the spray of the waves and about noon we reached the shore the transparency of the water enabling us to see the bottom at a considerable depth The cliffs and masses of rock along the shore were whitened by an incrustation of salt where the waves dashed up against them and the evaporating water which had been left in holes and hollows on the surface of the rocks was covered with a crust of salt about one eighth of an inch in thickness Carrying with us the barometer and other instruments in the afternoon we ascended to the highest point of the island a bare rocky peak eight hundred feet above the lake Standing on the summit we enjoyed an extended view of the lake inclosed in a basin of rugged mountains which sometimes left marshy flats and extensive bottoms between them and the shore and in other places came directly down into the water with bold and precipitous bluffs As we looked over the vast expanse of water spread out beneath us and strained our eyes along the silent shores over which hung so much doubt and uncertainty and which were so full of interest to us I could hardly repress the almost irresistible desire to continue our exploration but the lengthening snow on the mountains was a plain indication of the advancing season and our frail linen boat appeared so insecure that I was unwilling to trust our lives to the uncertainties of the lake I therefore unwillingly resolved to terminate our survey here and remain satisfied for the present with what we had been able to add to the unknown geography of the region We felt pleasure also in remembering that we were the first who in the traditionary annals of the country had visited the islands and broken with the cheerful sound of human voices the long solitude of the place I accidentally left on the summit the brass cover to the object end of my spy glass and as it will probably remain there undisturbed by Indians it will furnish matter of speculation to some future traveler In our excursions about the island we did not meet with any kind of animal a magpie and another larger bird probably attracted by the smoke of our fire paid us a visit from the shore and were the only living things seen during our stay The rock constituting the cliffs along the shore where we were encamped is a talcous rock or steatite with brown spar At sunset the temperature was seventy deg We had arrived just in time to obtain a meridian altitude of the sun and other observations were obtained this evening which place our camp in latitude forty one deg ten forty two and longitude one hundred twelve deg twenty one five from Greenwich From a discussion of the barometrical observations made during our stay on the shores of the lake we have adopted four thousand two hundred feet for its elevation above the Gulf of Mexico In the first disappointment we felt from the dissipation of our dream of the fertile islands I called this Disappointment Island Out of the driftwood we made ourselves pleasant little lodges open to the water and after having kindled large fires to excite the wonder of any straggling savage on the lake shores lay down for the first time in a long journey in perfect security no one thinking about his arms The evening was extremely bright and pleasant but the wind rose during the night and the waves began to break heavily on the shore making our island tremble I had not expected in our inland journey to hear the roar of an ocean surf and the strangeness of our situation and the excitement we felt in the associated interests of the place made this one of the most interesting nights I remember during our long expedition In the morning the surf was breaking heavily on the shore and we were up early The lake was dark and agitated and we hurried through our scanty breakfast and embarked having first filled one of the buckets with water from the lake of which it was intended to make salt The sun had risen by the time we were ready to start and it was blowing a strong gale of wind almost directly off the shore and raising a considerable sea in which our boat strained very much It roughened as we got away from the island and it required all the efforts of the men to make any head against the wind and sea the gale rising with the sun and there was danger of being blown into one of the open reaches beyond the island At the distance of half a mile from the beach the depth of water was sixteen feet with a clay bottom but as the working of the boat was very severe labor and during the operation of sounding it was necessary to cease paddling during which the boat lost considerable way I was unwilling to discourage the men and reluctantly gave up my intention of ascertaining the depth and the character of the bed There was a general shout in the boat when we found ourselves in one fathom and we soon after landed We now resume Kit Carson s narrative When the Indian rubber boat was put in order Colonel Fremont started taking Carson and three others as companions Their names have already appeared The distance from the main land to the island is computed to be about three leagues hence the pull at the oars for landsmen unaccustomed to such kind of work was no small task However a landing upon the island was safely accomplished the boat made fast and the investigations commenced After examining most of the island without finding even a spring of water on it it was determined to ascend the great hill which was the highest elevation on it The party was not long in reaching the summit where they found a shelving rock on which they cut a cross their names and the date as signs to after visitors should any such follow in their footsteps that they had been the first persons who had ever within the knowledge of man been on that island The day having been far spent in their labors orders were given to camp on the island for the night On the morrow they departed for the main land When they had accomplished about one league being one third of the distance the clouds suddenly gathered and threatened a storm Just as this danger impended the air which acted in giving buoyancy to the boat by some accident began to escape A man was immediately stationed at the bellows and it required his constant aid to supply the portion which steadily escaped Colonel Fremont then ordered the men to pull for their lives and try thus to escape the danger of the impending storm In this instance as indeed in every hour of peril an all seeing Providence guided them in safety to the shore Soon after they arrived the storm came on with such fury that it caused the water of the lake according to the natural water mark to rise ten feet in one hour The party soon after recommenced their march and proceeded some distance up the Bear River Crossing it they went to the Malade and thence on until they reached Fort Hall Here they met with the division under Fitzpatrick and made a short stay Once more Colonel Fremont started with his small party in advance of his main body He marched about eight days journey ahead Fitzpatrick following up his trail with the larger division At this time the expedition was journeying in the direction of the mouth of the Columbia River In due time they arrived safely at the river Dalles Here they made another brief halt Colonel Fremont left Kit Carson in command of this camp while he with a small party proceeded to Vancouver s Island and purchased some provisions On his return he found that the whole party had become consolidated The command now journeyed to Tlamath Lake in Oregon Territory The descriptions of all these journeys have already been given to the public in several forms all however based upon Colonel Fremont s reports made to the U S Government It would be superfluous therefore for us to fill up the pages of the life of Kit Carson with matter already published beyond the occurrences appertaining to him Having finished the observations upon Tlamath Lake the expedition started for California The route led through a barren and desolate country rendering game scarce As the command drew near to the Sierra Nevada Mountains they were found to be entirely covered with deep snow throughout the entire range of vision At this time the provisions had commenced giving out Game was so scarce that it could not be depended on The propositions which presented themselves at this crisis were to cross the mountains or take the fearful chance of starving to death Crossing the mountains terrible though the alternative was the choice of all It was better than inactivity and certain death On arriving at the mountains the snow was found to be about six feet deep on a level The first task was to manufacture snow shoes for the entire party By the aid of these foot appendages an advance party was sent on to explore the route and to determine how far a path would have to be broken for the animals This party reached a spot from whence they could see their way clear and found that the path for the animals would be three leagues in length The advance party also saw in the distance the green valley of the Sacramento and the coast range of mountains Kit Carson was the first man to recognize these to the snow bound travelers desirable localities although it was now seventeen years since he had last gazed upon them The advance party then returned to their friends in the rear and reported their proceedings All were delighted on learning that they had one man among them who knew where they were The business of making the road was very laborious The snow had to be beaten compact with mallets It was fifteen days before the party succeeded in reaching with a few of their animals a place where the heavy work of the route was ended During this time many of their mules had starved to death and the few remaining were driven to such an extreme by want of food that they devoured one another s tails the leather on the pack saddles and in fact they would try to eat everything they could get into their mouths The sufferings of the men had been as severe as had ever fallen to the lot of any mountaineer present Their provisions were all used and they were driven to subsist upon the mules as they died from hunger But commander and all bore these terrible trials in an exemplary manner An incident is related by Colonel Fremont in which Kit Carson enjoyed a cold bath which occurred during this terrible march February Twenty third This was our most difficult day we were forced off the ridges by the quantity of snow among the timber and obliged to take to the mountain sides where occasionally rocks and a southern exposure afforded us a chance to scramble along But these were steep and slippery with snow and ice and the tough evergreens of the mountain impeded our way tore our skins and exhausted our patience Some of us had the misfortune to wear moccasins with parfleche soles so slippery that we could not keep our feet and generally crawled across the snow beds Axes and mauls were necessary to day to make a road through the snow Going ahead with Carson to reconnoitre the road we reached in the afternoon the river which made the outlet of the lake Carson sprang over clear across a place where the stream was compressed among the rocks but the parfleche sole of my moccasin glanced from the icy rock and precipitated me into the river It was some few seconds before I could recover myself in the current and Carson thinking me hurt jumped in after me and we both had an icy bath We tried to search awhile for my gun which had been lost in the fall but the cold drove us out and making a large fire on the bank after we had partially dried ourselves we went back to meet the camp We afterwards found that the gun had been slung under the ice which lined the banks of the creek It was while undergoing such experience as we have endeavored to narrate that the characters of men show forth in their true light and can be fully analyzed John C Fremont never was found wanting in times such as tried men s hearts He was worthy of the trust reposed in him His was no ordinary command The men he had to deal with in their line had no superiors on the American Continent yet he proved a match for any one of them and gained from them the name of being a good mountaineer an encomium they are not prone to bestow lightly The party now commenced descending the mountains On reaching the valley beneath Fremont taking Kit Carson and six of the men pushed on in advance in order to reach Sutter s Fort where he would be able to purchase provisions Fitzpatrick was left in charge of the main party with orders to make easy marches The second day after this division was made mister Preuss Fremont s assistant accidentally got lost His friends began making search for him This failing they traveled on slowly fired guns and used every means in their power to let their whereabouts be known to him After wandering about for four days to the surprise and joy of his companions he came into camp During his absence he had subsisted on acorns and roots and as a matter of course was nearly exhausted both in body and mind Three days after mister Preuss was restored to them Fremont with the advance party reached Sutter s Fort He and his party were very hospitably received They were entertained with the best the post could furnish by its kind hearted proprietor Never did men more deserve such treatment The condition of all was about as miserable as it could well be imagined for men who retained their hold on life It was at Sutter s Fort as most of our readers will remember that the great gold mines of California first received their kindling spark the discovery of that precious metal having been made there While some men were digging a mill race the alluring deposit first appeared This event has made the Fort world renowned At the time we describe Fremont on his second expedition nothing whatever was known of the immense fields of treasure over which he and his men daily walked although for many years previous to the discovery being made the mountaineers had trapped all the rivers in that vicinity and on their banks had herded their animals for months together They had drank thousands of times from the pure water as it flowed in the river s channel and no doubt frequently their eyes had penetrated through it until they saw the sand beneath in which perchance the sparkling specs may have occasionally allured them sufficiently to recall the proverb that all is not gold that glitters The writer once made inquiry of one of these mountaineers who had spent two summers in the manner narrated above near and at Sutter s Fort some twenty years since He was asked whether he ever saw there anything in the shape of gold which in any way aroused his suspicions His reply was Never And had I it would have been only for a brief space of time as finally I should have been certain that I was deluded and mistaken without there had been the Eagle of our country stamped upon it Provisions were immediately obtained at the Fort and carried to Fitzpatrick and his party Great difficulty had now to be encountered to prevent the men from losing their lives by the sudden change from want to comparative luxury Notwithstanding the utmost care was taken some of the party lost their reason The hardships of the journey had proved too much for them Fitzpatrick and the main body arrived at the Fort in a few days where they were likewise welcomed by its hospitable and generous proprietor Captain Sutter His name in California has ever been but another term for kindness and sympathy for the unfortunate This expedition in one respect only can be called unfortunate When the terrible sufferings of the commander and his men have been named the catalogue of misfortune is ended Its results grand and glorious have immortalized the name of every man who assisted in any way to accomplish it I belonged to the several Exploring Expeditions of John C Fremont is the key note to the respect and homage of the American nation the truth would be equally real if we add to the whole civilized world Every heart which beats with admiration for the heroic or which is capable of appreciating the rich contributions to the sciences direct resultants from their terrible sufferings has thrilled with delight when possessed of the history which records the brilliant achievements of these Exploring Parties The band started from the little town of Kansas on the twenty ninth day of May eighteen forty three It returned to the United States in August eighteen forty four After traveling seventeen hundred miles it reached September sixth Salt Lake On the fourth day of November it reached Fort Vancouver on the Columbia River On the sixth day of March eighteen forty four it reached Sutter s Fort in the destitute condition already explained The distance from Fort Hall by the route taken is about two thousand miles The party remained at Sutter s Fort until the twenty fourth day of March or as Kit Carson expresses the time from his memory the expedition remained at this place about one month At the expiration of this time the party was sufficiently recruited to be ready for their return journey which they commenced in April eighteen forty four Just previous to their taking leave of mister Sutter two of the company became deranged owing to the privations and fasting to which they had been obliged to submit before being ushered into a land of plenty They had indulged appetite too freely and brought on one of those strange revolutions in the brain s action which never fails to excite the pity of friend and foe The first warning which the party had that one of the men was laboring under a disordered intellect occurred in the following manner Early in the morning the man suddenly started from his sleep and began to ask his companions where his riding animal was gone During this time it was by him but he did not know it Unknown to the rest of the party he started off soon after in search of his imaginary animal As soon as his absence became known to Fremont he surmised the truth and sent persons in all directions to hunt for him They searched the neighboring country for many miles and made inquiries of all the friendly Indians they chanced upon but failed to discover him Several days of delay was caused by this most unhappy circumstance Finally it becoming necessary for the party to depart without him word was left with mister Sutter to continue the hunt He did so most faithfully and by his exertions some time after the party had set out on the return trip the maniac was found and kept at the Fort until he had entirely recovered He was then on the first opportunity provided with a passage to the United States Before we follow the party on their homeward bound tramp it is proper that the reader should be favored with the estimate and views which the American historian statesman and scholar Colonel Benton has recorded concerning the perils undergone and results accomplished by this expedition His pen is so graphic and life like that the reader will doubtless thank us for the extract Besides presenting a view of the expedition it will unfold a fact which shows where the origin of the expedition had its conception We give all he says concerning the expedition seventeen Footnote seventeen Thirty Years View vol ii chap one hundred thirty four The government deserves credit for the zeal with which it has pursued geographical discovery Such is the remark which a leading paper made upon the discoveries of Fremont on his return from his second expedition to the great West and such is the remark which all writers will make upon all his discoveries who write history from public documents and outside views With all such writers the expeditions of Fremont will be credited to the zeal of the government for the promotion of science as if the government under which he acted had conceived and planned these expeditions as mister Jefferson did that of Lewis and Clark and then selected this young officer to carry into effect the instructions delivered to him How far such history would be true in relation to the first expedition which terminated in the Rocky Mountains has been seen in the account which has been given of the origin of that undertaking and which leaves the government innocent of its conception and therefore not entitled to the credit of its authorship but only to the merit of permitting it In the second and greater expedition from which great political as well as scientific results have flowed their merit is still less for while equally innocent of its conception they were not equally passive to its performance countermanding the expedition after it had begun and lavishing censure upon the adventurous young explorer for his manner of undertaking it The fact was that his first expedition barely finished mister Fremont sought and obtained orders for a second one and was on the frontier of Missouri with his command when orders arrived at saint Louis to stop him on the ground that he had made a military equipment which the peaceful nature of his geographical pursuit did not require as if Indians did not kill and rob scientific men as well as others if not in a condition to defend themselves The particular point of complaint was that he had taken a small mountain howitzer in addition to his rifles and which he was informed was charged to him although it had been furnished upon a regular requisition on the commandant of the arsenal at saint Louis approved by the commander of the military department Colonel afterward General Kearney mister Fremont had left saint Louis and was at the frontier missus Fremont being requested to examine the letters that came after him and forward those which he ought to receive She read the countermanding orders and detained them and Fremont knew nothing of their existence until after he had returned from one of the most marvellous and eventful expeditions of modern times one to which the United States are indebted among other things for the present ownership of California instead of seeing it a British possession The writer of this View who was then in saint Louis approved of the course which his daughter had taken for she had stopped the orders before he knew it and he wrote a letter to the department condemning the recall repulsing the reprimand which had been lavished upon Fremont and demanding a court martial for him when he should return The Secretary of War was then mister James Madison Porter of Pennsylvania the chief of the topographical corps the same as now Colonel Abert himself an office man surrounded by West Point officers to whose pursuit of easy service Fremont s adventurous expeditions was a reproach and in conformity to whose opinions the secretary seemed to have acted On Fremont s return upwards of a year afterwards mister William Wilkins of Pennsylvania was Secretary of War and received the young explorer with all honor and friendship and obtained for him the brevet of captain from President Tyler And such is the inside view of this piece of history very different from what documentary evidence would make it To complete his survey across the continent on the line of travel between the State of Missouri and the tide water region of the Columbia was Fremont s object in this expedition and it was all that he had obtained orders for doing but only a small part and to his mind an insignificant part of what he proposed doing People had been to the mouth of the Columbia before and his ambition was not limited to making tracks where others had made them before him There was a vast region beyond the Rocky Mountains the whole western slope of our continent of which but little was known and of that little nothing with the accuracy of science All that vast region more than seven hundred miles square equal to a great kingdom in Europe was an unknown land a sealed book which he longed to open and to read Leaving the frontier of Missouri in May eighteen forty three and often diverging from his route for the sake of expanding his field of observation he had arrived in the tide water region of Columbia in the month of November and had then completed the whole service which his orders embraced He might then have returned upon his tracks or been brought home by sea or hunted the most pleasant path for getting back and if he had been a routine officer satisfied with fulfilling an order he would have done so Not so the young explorer who held his diploma from nature and not from the United States Military Academy He was at Fort Vancouver guest of the hospitable doctor McLaughlin Governor of the British Hudson Bay Fur Company and obtained from him all possible information upon his intended line of return faithfully given but which proved to be disastrously erroneous in its leading and governing feature A southeast route to cross the great unknown region diagonally through its heart making a line from the Lower Columbia to the Upper Colorado of the Gulf of California was his line of return twenty five men the same who had come with him from the United States and a hundred horses were his equipment and the commencement of winter the time of starting all without a guide relying upon their guns for support and in the last resort upon their horses such as should give out for one that could carry a man or a pack could not be spared for food All the maps up to that time had shown this region traversed from east to west from the base of the Rocky Mountains to the Bay of San Francisco by a great river called the Buena Ventura which may be translated the Good Chance Governor McLaughlin believed in the existence of this river and made out a conjectural manuscript map to show its place and course Fremont believed in it and his plan was to reach it before the dead of winter and then hybernate upon it As a great river he knew that it must have some rich bottoms covered with wood and grass where the wild animals would collect and shelter when the snows and freezing winds drove them from the plains and with these animals to live on and grass for the horses and wood for fires he expected to avoid suffering if not to enjoy comfort during his solitary sojourn in that remote and profound wilderness He proceeded soon encountered deep snows which impeded progress upon the highlands descended into a low country to the left afterwards known to be the Great Basin from which no water issues to any sea skirted an enormous chain of mountain on the right luminous with glittering white snow saw strange Indians who mostly fled found a desert no Buena Ventura and death from cold and famine staring him in the face The failure to find the river or tidings of it and the possibility of its existence seeming to be forbid by the structure of the country and hybernation in the inhospitable desert being impossible and the question being that of life and death some new plan of conduct became indispensable His celestial observations told him that he was in the latitude of the Bay of San Francisco and only seventy miles from it But what miles up and down that snowy mountain which the Indians told him no men could cross in the winter which would have snow upon it as deep as the trees and places where people would slip off and fall half a mile at a time a fate which actually befell a mule packed with the precious burden of botanical specimens collected along a travel of two thousand miles No reward could induce an Indian to become a guide in the perilous adventure of crossing this mountain All recoiled and fled from the adventure It was attempted without a guide in the dead of winter accomplished in forty days the men and surviving horses a woeful procession crawling along one by one skeleton men leading skeleton horses and arriving at Sutter s Settlement in the beautiful valley of the Sacramento and where a genial warmth and budding flowers and trees in foliage and grassy ground and flowing streams and comfortable food made a fairy contrast with the famine and freezing they had encountered and the lofty Sierra Nevada which they had climbed Here he rested and recruited and from this point and by way of Monterey the first tidings were heard of the party since leaving Fort Vancouver Another long progress to the south skirting the western base of the Sierra Nevada made him acquainted with the noble valley of the San Joaquin counterpart to that of the Sacramento when crossing through a gap and turning to the left he skirted the Great Basin and by many deviations from the right line home levied incessant contributions to science from expanded lands not described before In this eventful exploration all the great features of the western slope of our continent were brought to light the Great Salt Lake the Utah Lake the Little Salt Lake at all which places then deserts the Mormons now are the Sierra Nevada then solitary in the snow now crowded with Americans digging gold from its flanks the beautiful valleys of the Sacramento and San Joaquin then alive with wild horses elk deer and wild fowls now smiling with American cultivation the Great Basin itself and its contents the Three Parks the approximation of the great rivers which rising together in the central region of the Rocky Mountains go off east and west towards the rising and the setting sun all these and other strange features of a new region more Asiatic than American were brought to light and revealed to public view in the results of this exploration Eleven months he was never out of sight of snow and sometimes freezing with cold would look down upon a sunny valley warm with genial heat sometimes panting with the summer s heat would look up at the eternal snows which crowned the neighboring mountain But it was not then that California was secured to the Union to the greatest power of the New World to which it of right belonged but it was the first step towards the acquisition and the one that led to it The second expedition led to a third just in time to snatch the golden California from the hands of the British ready to clutch it But of this hereafter Fremont s second expedition was now over He had left the United States a fugitive from his government and returned with a name that went over Europe and America and with discoveries bearing fruit which the civilized world is now enjoying On their homeward bound journey the party followed up the valley of the San Joaquin crossing over the Sierra Nevada and coast range of mountains at a point where they join and form a beautiful low pass They continued on from here close under the coast range until they struck the Spanish Trail This they followed to the Mohave River That stream it will be recollected was an old friend of Kit Carson s The reader will recall the many times he had caught beaver out of its waters They followed the trail up the course of the river to where it leaves it At this point an event occurred which somewhat retarded their progress relieving the monotony of the route and somewhat changing their plans Soon after the camp had been formed they were visited by a Mexican man and boy the one named Andreas Fuentes the other Pablo Hernandez They informed Fremont that they belonged to a party of Mexican traders which had come from New Mexico They said that six of them including in this number two women who acted as cooks had been left by their friends in charge of a band of horses The rest of the party were absent trafficking The party of six thus left to watch the horses consisted of Santiago Giacome Andreas Fuentes and wife and Pablo Hernandez together with his father and mother They were endeavoring to find better grazing for their animals For this purpose they had penetrated the country as far as they dared and at about eighty miles from the camp of Fremont had resolved to wait for their friends Fuentes and the boy Pablo were on guard over the animals when their camp was attacked by hostile savages The attacking band was about thirty in number Their principal object was to seize the horses To effect this the more easily they saluted the little band with a flight of arrows as they advanced Fuentes and Pablo now heard Giacome warning them to start the horses and run for it Both were mounted They obeyed the directions of Giacome and with the entire band of horses charged boldly into the midst of the Indians regardless of their weapons The charge succeeded in breaking their line through which Fuentes and Pablo boldly dashed after their animals The Indians deferred the chase to attend to a more bloody purpose Having put sixty miles between them and the site of the attack they left their horses and started in search of their main body This search led them into Fremont s camp Fuentes feared that the worst had overtaken his wife Pablo already looked upon himself as an orphan boy He doubted not that the bloody savages had murdered both his father and mother It was a sad picture to witness their grief But Kit Carson could not do so unmoved The heart of such grief has ever awakened his earnest sympathy His sympathy too has never been of a wordy nature He volunteered to go with Fuentes and make an attempt to deliver the captives if such they should prove or to avenge their death if that became the sad alternative Fuentes had left the horses at a spring of water well known to Carson There he had found signs of white men which had led him into Fremont s camp There was no difficulty for Carson to find the spring The whole company therefore traveled to the spring which they reached early the next morning distant about thirty miles from their last camp The horses were not to be seen A short examination of signs soon revealed to Carson and Godey that the two Mexicans had been followed by the Indians and that they had come upon the horses shortly after they had left them Of course therefore they had captured and driven them off Carson and Godey were determined to make one effort to punish the rascals They started taking Fuentes with them upon the trail of the Indians The chase was a severe one as in the judgment of the mountaineers the Indians would not make a short trail after acquiring so much booty The horse which Fuentes rode most unfortunately gave out after a short ride There was no time to be lost and no means at hand to supply this important deficiency To turn back to camp would supply it but that course would also lose them their game Fuentes therefore was requested to return to Fremont s camp and there await the return of Kit Carson and Godey These two had been the only men in the entire command who had volunteered in this chase The loss of Fuentes therefore made their task literally a Don Quixotic adventure Two men against thirty But Kit Carson was not the man to turn his back upon an adventure as soon as the difficulties began to present themselves He well knew that he had one man on whom he could rely Richard Godey was his tried and trusty friend his kindred spirit and a noble hearted man Leaving the Mexican to find his way back to camp a distance of about twenty miles they gave him their word that they would finish the business The following night was very dark and in order to keep on the right scent Carson and Godey were obliged to lead their horses and frequently to follow the trail by the sense of feeling It was seldom however that they lost the path and never for more than a few moments at a time Gradually the signs grew fresher as they advanced which gave them the assurance that they were rapidly gaining on the pursuit Finally they concluded that only a few hours separated them from the savages Having accomplished a considerable part of their journey during the night and finding that both themselves and their horses required rest they concluded to halt Having unsaddled their animals and turned them out to graze they wrapped themselves up in their wet blankets and laid down to sleep The weather however was too cold to permit sleeping in comfort without a fire That they dare not make fearing it would prove a warning signal to the savages Having worried through the remainder of this cold and cheerless night they arose early in the morning and went to the bottom of a deep ravine where they kindled a small fire and succeeded in warming themselves At daybreak they re saddled their jaded horses and once more started upon the trail Just as the sun was rising they discovered the Indians When first seen they were encamped two miles in advance and were enjoying a breakfast on horse steaks having already killed five of the stolen animals Kit Carson and his friend dismounted and concealing their horses near by held a council of war They decided to crawl in among the herd of stolen animals which were grazing without guard at a short distance from the camp of the savages Upon reaching the horses they agreed to be guided by circumstances First divesting themselves of all useless apparel they commenced their task After much cautious labor they gained their point and stood among the animals As soon however as they arrived one of the young horses of the band became frightened at the grotesque figures cut by the two creeping men and exhibited his fear by snorting and kicking up his heels This alarmed the remainder of the horses and caused quite a commotion among them which had the effect to alarm the savages who sprang for their arms With a yell Carson and Godey instantly turned towards the savages As soon as they were all fairly in view the two white men saw that they had thirty warriors before them to deal with When they had advanced within rifle range Kit Carson halted and aiming his rifle at the stoutest looking brave fired The fierce savage fell with a cry of anguish Godey had also halted and fired but he missed his aim Instantly reloading he made the second attempt and this time brought down a warrior While these events were taking place the red men were running about in great confusion Occasionally they returned a few arrows but they all proved but harmless missiles The fact was the Indians were puzzled what to think of the audacity of the two men Evidently they considered them to be an advance party of some strong force acting with a view of decoying them into a close fight Acting upon this they began to fly in every direction except that from which danger impended Kit and Godey as they had calculated were thus quite unceremoniously left masters of the enemy s camp Besides the recaptured horses they had two trophies lying upon the ground in the shape of a brace of stalwart warriors In order to show their companions on their return that they were not given to boasting they followed the example and practice of the savages and scalped the two Indians The common expression now in use is that they proceeded to take the hair of their victims The performance of this act was a matter of choice and fell to the lot of Godey while Kit Carson with the two rifles ascended an eminence near at hand for the double purpose of standing guard over his companion and also to reconnoitre Godey commenced his operations on the savage which he himself had shot Having finished with him he started for the other Indian hit by Kit Carson But this fellow after he had fallen had crawled quite out of view among some rocks Being only wounded he raised up and sent an arrow at Godey as he approached which pierced his shirt collar The Indian had already lost a large amount of blood His last act so exhausted him that he sank back upon the ground and expired They next proceeded to collect the horses Upon counting them they found the number stated by the Mexican to be correct with the exception of five killed by the Indians for their feast The animals were now driven to the spot where their own horses had been left Here they held another council and determined to seek out the fate of the remainder of the Mexican party They therefore bent their steps towards the late camp of the Mexicans There they found the bodies of the two men terribly mangled The savage ferocity of the rascally savages had here had full play as soon as they found that the two who were on guard had broken through their line and escaped with the horses Their bodies were naked and full of arrows The women were not to be found The remains were decently interred by Carson and Godey and then they set about looking for the women After a long search they could discover nothing of them and concluded that they had been reserved for a worse fate The remains of these two poor captives were afterwards found by some of Fremont s men The Indians not satisfied with killing them had staked their bodies to the ground Kit Carson and Godey having now accomplished on this errand of mercy all that lay in the power of man to do set out to return and soon rejoined their friends whom they found anxiously waiting for them colonel Fremont concludes his account of this affair in the following words Their object accomplished our men gathered up all the surviving horses fifteen in number returned upon their trail and rejoined us at our camp in the afternoon of the same day They had rode about one hundred miles in the pursuit and return and all in thirty hours The time place object and numbers considered this expedition of Carson and Godey may be considered among the boldest and most disinterested which the annals of western adventure so full of daring deeds can present Two men in a savage desert pursue day and night an unknown body of Indians into the defiles of an unknown mountain attack them on sight without counting numbers and defeat them in an instant and for what To punish the robbers of the desert and to avenge the wrongs of Mexicans whom they did not know I repeat it was Carson and Godey who did this the former an American born in Kentucky the latter a Frenchman by descent born in saint Louis and both trained to western enterprise from early life The stolen property was restored to the Mexicans without one cent being demanded or received by either Carson or Godey It was not for the love of Indian fighting as many may suppose that Kit Carson was moved to take part in such expeditions but when the life of a fellow creature is exposed to Indian barbarities no living man is more willing or more capable of rendering a lasting service than Christopher Carson A name that wherever it is known is ranked among the bravest of the brave Soon after the two volunteers came in Fremont resumed his journey and continued it without anything transpiring to disturb the equanimity of the party until they reached a point on the Virgin River where the Spanish Trail leaves it It became necessary to change camps here in order that the animals might take advantage of better grass As the party were enjoying a day s rest one of the men a Canadian by birth missed his riding mule from the herd Without informing any of his friends of his intentions he started out in quest of the animal His absence at first was not noticed but soon inquiries were made for him and when an unusual length of time had passed without his return Fremont became anxious for his safety He directed Kit Carson to take three men and go in search of him On arriving at their last camp Kit found a spot where undoubtedly the man had fallen from his horse wounded as about the place there were pools of coagulated blood It was now believed that their companion was dead Kit immediately ordered the party to search for his body but they could not find it They then followed the trail of the Canadian s horse which it was very evident he had caught and mounted before being shot It led to where the animal had crossed the river There all signs disappeared After a faithful search for the trail Kit returned to camp and informed his commander of the result of his day s work The next morning the search was renewed by all of the company They discovered Indian signs yet could not trace them to where the body was After looking in every conceivable hiding place in the neighborhood of the signs they gave up the hunt Kit Carson was much affected by the loss of this man He had been his friend They had been associated in many trapping expeditions and knew each other most intimately He felt assured that if the Canadian had not been surprised by any enemy in ambuscade he would have killed one or two Indians before he himself fell for besides being a very brave man he was well versed in Indian mode of warfare and was considered a fine marksman The party now proceeded on their journey returning to and keeping on the Spanish Trail which was not left until they reached the Vega of Santa Clara There they struck out across the country to the Utah lake which after crossing they left and went to the Wintry River and thence to Green River Brown s Hole Little Snake River and so on to the mouth of saint Vrain s Fork It was here that they traversed the mountains and came upon Laramie River below the New Park They journeyed through this into the Old Park and thence traveled to the head waters of the south fork of the Platte On quitting it they bent their way to the Arkansas River coming on to it at a point just below the place where it leaves the Rocky Mountains and by keeping on down it they arrived at Bent s Fort on the twod of July eighteen forty four On the following fourth of July mister Bent gave a dinner in commemoration of the occasion to Fremont and his party Although hundreds of miles separated from their countrymen yet they sat down to as sumptuous a repast as could be furnished in many towns of the States The exploring party considered their labors finished at this post as in accordance with the tastes of many of the party they were near enough to civilization The command was dissolved and Colonel Fremont proceeded on his route to Washington Kit Carson about the same time started for Taos where he had been for a long time anxiously expected by his family and friends The description which Colonel Fremont has given of the country through which this expedition traveled seems to be an appropriate and almost a necessary addition to this work On the twenty fourth day of May the party on their return reached the Utah Lake Early the next day says Fremont we came in sight of the lake and as we descended to the broad bottoms of the Spanish Fork three horsemen were seen galloping towards us who proved to be Utah Indians scouts from a village which was encamped near the mouth of the river They were armed with rifles and their horses were in good condition We encamped near them on the Spanish Fork which is one of the principal tributaries to the lake Finding the Indians troublesome and desirous to remain here a day we removed the next morning further down the lake and encamped on a fertile bottom near the foot of the same mountainous ridge which borders the Great Salt Lake and along which we had journeyed the previous September We had now accomplished an object we had in view when leaving the Dalles of the Columbia in November last we had reached the Utah Lake but by a route very different from what we had intended and without sufficient time remaining to make the examinations which were desired It is a lake of note in this country under the dominion of the Utahs who resort to it for fish Its greatest breadth is about fifteen miles stretching far to the north narrowing as it goes and connecting with the Great Salt Lake In arriving at the Utah Lake we had completed an immense circuit of twelve degrees diameter north and south and ten degrees east and west and found ourselves in May eighteen forty four on the same sheet of water which we had left in September eighteen forty three The Utah is the southern limb of the Great Salt Lake and thus we had seen that remarkable sheet of water both at its northern and southern extremity and were able to fix its position at these two points The circuit which we had made and which had cost us eight months of time and three thousand five hundred miles of traveling had given us a view of Oregon and of North California from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean and of the two principal streams which form bays or harbors on the coast of that sea Having completed this circuit and being now about to turn the back upon the Pacific slope of our continent and to recross the Rocky Mountains it is natural to look back upon our footsteps and take some brief view of the leading features and general structure of the country we have traversed These are peculiar and striking and differ essentially from the Atlantic side of our country The mountains all are higher more numerous and more distinctly defined in their ranges and directions and what is so contrary to the natural order of such formations one of these ranges which is near the coast the Sierra Nevada and the Coast Range presents higher elevations and peaks than any which are to be found in the Rocky Mountains themselves In our eight months circuit we were never out of sight of snow and the Sierra Nevada where we crossed it was near two thousand feet higher than the South Pass in the Rocky Mountains In height these mountains greatly exceed those of the Atlantic side constantly presenting peaks which enter the region of eternal snow and some of them volcanic and in a frequent state of activity They are seen at great distances and guide the traveler in his courses The course and elevation of these ranges give direction to the rivers and character to the coast No great river does or can take its rise below the Cascade and Sierra Nevada Range the distance to the sea is too short to admit of it The rivers of the San Francisco Bay which are the largest after the Columbia are local to that bay and lateral to the coast having their sources about on a line with the Dalles of the Columbia and running each in a valley of its own between the Coast Range and the Cascade and Sierra Nevada Range The Columbia is the only river which traverses the whole breadth of the country breaking through all the ranges and entering the sea Drawing its waters from a section of ten degrees of latitude in the Rocky Mountains which are collected into one stream by three main forks Lewis s Clark s and the North Fork near the centre of the Oregon valley this great river thence proceeds by a single channel to the sea while its three forks lead each to a pass in the mountains which opens the way into the interior of the continent This fact in relation to the rivers of this region gives an immense value to the Columbia Its mouth is the only inlet and outlet to and from the sea its three forks lead to the passes in the mountains it is therefore the only line of communication between the Pacific and the interior of North America and all operations of war or commerce of national or social intercourse must be conducted upon it This gives it a value beyond estimation and would involve irreparable injury if lost In this unity and concentration of its waters the Pacific side of our continent differs entirely from the Atlantic side where the waters of the Alleghany Mountains are dispersed into many rivers having their different entrances into the sea and opening many lines of communication with the interior The Pacific coast is equally different from that of the Atlantic The coast of the Atlantic is low and open indented with numerous bays sounds and river estuaries accessible everywhere and opening by many channels into the heart of the country The Pacific coast on the contrary is high and compact with few bays and but one that opens into the heart of the country The immediate coast is what the seamen call iron bound A little within it is skirted by two successive ranges of mountains standing as ramparts between the sea and the interior country and to get through which there is but one gate and that narrow and easily defended This structure of the coast backed by these two ranges of mountains with its concentration and unity of waters gives to the country an immense military strength and will probably render Oregon the most impregnable country in the world Differing so much from the Atlantic side of our continent in coast mountains and rivers the Pacific side differs from it in another most rare and singular feature that of the Great interior Basin of which I have so often spoken and the whole form and character of which I was so anxious to ascertain Its existence is vouched for by such of the American traders and hunters as have some knowledge of that region the structure of the Sierra Nevada range of mountains requires it to be there and my own observations confirm it mister Joseph Walker who is so well acquainted in those parts informed that from the Great Salt Lake west there was a succession of lakes and rivers which have no outlet to the sea nor any connection with the Columbia or with the Colorado of the Gulf of California He described some of these lakes as being large with numerous streams and even considerable rivers falling into them In fact all concur in the general report of these interior rivers and lakes and for want of understanding the force and power of evaporation which so soon establishes an equilibrium between the loss and supply of waters the fable of whirlpools and subterraneous outlets has gained belief as the only imaginable way of carrying off the waters which have no visible discharge The structure of the country would require this formation of interior lakes for the waters which would collect between the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Nevada not being able to cross this formidable barrier nor to get to the Columbia or the Colorado must naturally collect into reservoirs each of which would have its little system of streams and rivers to supply it This would be the natural effect and what I saw went to confirm it The Great Salt Lake is a formation of this kind and quite a large one and having many streams and one considerable river four or five hundred miles long falling into it This lake and river I saw and examined myself and also saw the Wahsatch and Bear River Mountains which inclose the waters of the lake on the east and constitute in that quarter the rim of the Great Basin Afterwards along the eastern base of the Sierra Nevada where we traveled for forty two days I saw the line of lakes and rivers which lie at the foot of that Sierra and which Sierra is the western rim of the Basin In going down Lewis s Fork and the main Columbia I crossed only inferior streams coming in from the left such as could draw their water from a short distance only and I often saw the mountains at their heads white with snow which all accounts said divided the waters of the desert from those of the Columbia and which could be no other than the range of mountains which form the rim of the Basin on its northern side And in returning from California along the Spanish trail as far as the head of the Santa Clara Fork of the Rio Virgen I crossed only small streams making their way south to the Colorado or lost in sand as the Mo hah ve while to the left lofty mountains their summits white with snow were often visible and which must have turned water to the north as well as to the south and thus constituted on this part the southern rim of the Basin At the head of the Santa Clara Fork and in the Vegas de Santa Clara we crossed the ridge which parted the two systems of waters We entered the Basin at that point and have traveled in it ever since having its southeastern rim the Wahsatch Mountain on the right and crossing the streams which flow down into it The existence of the Basin is therefore an established fact in my mind its extent and contents are yet to be better ascertained It cannot be less than four or five hundred miles each way and must lie principally in the Alta California the demarcation latitude of forty two deg probably cutting a segment from the north part of the rim Of its interior but little is known It is called a desert and from what I saw of it sterility may be its prominent characteristic but where there is so much water there must be some oasis The great river and the great lake reported may not be equal to the report but where there is so much snow there must be streams and where there is no outlet there must be lakes to hold the accumulated waters or sands to swallow them up In this eastern part of the basin containing Sevier Utah and the Great Salt lakes and the rivers and creeks falling into them we know there is good soil and good grass adapted to civilized settlements In the western part on Salmon trout River and some other streams the same remark may be made The contents of this Great Basin are yet to be examined That it is peopled we know but miserably and sparsely From all that I heard and saw I should say that humanity here appeared in its lowest form and in its most elementary state Dispersed in single families without fire arms eating seeds and insects digging roots and hence their name such is the condition of the greater part Others are a degree higher and live in communities upon some lake or river that supplies fish and from which they repulse the miserable digger The rabbit is the largest animal known in this desert its flesh affords a little meat and their bag like covering is made of its skins The wild sage is their only wood and here it is of extraordinary size sometimes a foot in diameter and six or eight feet high It serves for fuel for building material for shelter to the rabbits and for some sort of covering for the feet and legs in cold weather Such are the accounts of the inhabitants and productions of the Great Basin and which though imperfect must have some foundation and excite our desire to know the whole The whole idea of such a desert and such a people is a novelty in our country and excites Asiatic not American ideas Interior basins with their own systems of lakes and rivers and often sterile are common enough in Asia people in the elementary state of families living in deserts with no other occupation than the mere animal search for food may still be seen in that ancient quarter of the globe but in America such things are new and strange unknown and unsuspected and discredited when related But I flatter myself that what is discovered though not enough to satisfy curiosity is sufficient to excite it and that subsequent explorations will complete what has been commenced This account of the Great Basin it will be remembered belongs to the Alta California and has no application to Oregon whose capabilities may justify a separate remark Referring to my journal for particular descriptions and for sectional boundaries between good and bad districts I can only say in general and comparative terms that in that branch of agriculture which implies the cultivation of grains and staple crops it would be inferior to the Atlantic States though many parts are superior for wheat while in the rearing of flocks and herds it would claim a high place Its grazing capabilities are great and even in the indigenous grass now there an element of individual and national wealth may be found In fact the valuable grasses begin within one hundred and fifty miles of the Missouri frontier and extend to the Pacific Ocean East of the Rocky Mountains it is the short curly grass on which the buffalo delight to feed whence its name of buffalo and which is still good when dry and apparently dead West of those mountains it is a larger growth in clusters and hence called bunch grass and which has a second or fall growth Plains and mountains both exhibit them and I have seen good pasturage at an elevation of ten thousand feet In this spontaneous product the trading or traveling caravans can find subsistence for their animals and in military operations any number of cavalry may be moved and any number of cattle may be driven and thus men and horses be supported on long expeditions and even in winter in the sheltered situations Commercially the value of the Oregon country must be great washed as it is by the North Pacific Ocean fronting Asia producing many of the elements of commerce mild and healthy in its climate and becoming as it naturally will a thoroughfare for the East India and China trade colonel Fremont in this beautiful and instructive passage of descriptive writing refers to the grass on which the buffalo delight to feed It is eminently proper that we should add a few words for general information concerning the grasses of the prairies as also concerning the timber flowers game face of the country et cetera et cetera in which the whole life of Kit Carson has been spent On the west side of the Arkansas River and between that stream and the Rocky Mountains there are three distinct species of grass found The first is the short curly variety on which the buffalo are said to feed from which fact it takes its name The second kind is the Grama grass which is I believe indigenous to only this section of America Its stalk grows to the height of about one foot Near its top it gives off at right angles another stem which is usually from one and a half to three inches in length From this last mentioned stem hang clusters of seeds which are well protected by a suitable covering It is said and my own observation confirms the fact that horses will leave grain such as corn and oats to feed on this grass and its wonderful nutritious properties cannot be denied Wild oats are often seen in the mountain valleys Along the low swampy lands which skirt the rivers of the plains there is yet another species of grass which grows oftentimes several feet high and has a broad blade similar almost to that of the flag plant On approaching the mountains the blue grass is found which is nearly the same as that usually met with in many of our western States The bunch grass as spoken of by Fremont is not confined to the mountains in New Mexico it is sometimes met with in the valleys where it grows to an immense height but in the low lands it is useless being too tough for animals to masticate Strangers when journeying in these parts often make the mistake of selecting camps in this tall grass being deceived by its thrifty appearance but one night thus spent will clearly prove its utter worthlessness On the plains there are but few wild flowers but as the traveler approaches the mountains they greet his eyes in extensive beds and of variegated colors As a grazing country the Rocky Mountains and their immediate vicinity cannot be surpassed The timber found there is poor in quality It comprises pine cedar and cotton wood with here and there patches of small and crooked oak bushes The rivers in the mountains are formed from melting snows and springs They come tumbling down through rough gorges and rocky canons until they are free in the valleys where they form bold and beautiful rivers The brook trout are the fish which mostly inhabit them and a singular fact in many of these streams this kind of fish treat the presence of a man with perfect indifference which has led me to believe that in their primitive state the shy trout fear neither man nor beast The Indians catch them and it may be that this fish is first frightened by them In the Rocky Mountains south of the head waters of the Arkansas comparatively speaking there are but few small birds and squirrels The raven the crow the hawk the owl and occasionally the eagle are seen Wild geese ducks and cranes are common Pigeons including the wild dove are not often seen The magpie is found in abundance Turkeys and grouse are also in abundance Wild rabbits and a species of hare are also common Indeed a man can travel for days in the Rocky Mountains and never hear the musical notes of a bird In these mountains rattle snakes are only found in the valleys where it is warm In the summer the deer and elk live in the mountains but when cold weather sets in they are driven out of them by the deep snows The antelope of the plains seek the mountain valleys during the winter The buffalo migrate south as the season becomes too severe for them Sometimes they are caught by the storms and are obliged to winter also in the mountain valleys The pine trees of the Rocky Mountains bear a small nut which is called by the Mexicans pinon which when cooked are quite pleasant to the taste There are many small salt lakes in the mountains and many marshes where the ground is covered white by the salt deposit The mineral wealth of the Rocky Mountains is very great and there is no doubt but some day rich veins of gold silver and iron ore will be discovered there The geological formation of the country is such as to warrant this belief Nearly every stream carries down in its floods that precious metal gold but in such small quantities as not to attract the attention of miners I have found there on the surface of the earth small pieces of material resembling stone coal which have probably been thrown up by some volcanic action Hot and mineral springs are not unfrequently met with They are places of frequent resort by the Indians who use them for medicinal purposes CHAPTER IX Kit Carson concludes to become a Farmer He is joined in the Enterprise by a Friend They build a Ranche on the Cimeron River Descriptions of Mexican Customs and Country Fremont once more at Bent s Fort Express sent for Kit Carson to join the Expedition as Guide The Ranche Sold and the Departure The Third Expedition and its Explorations Difficulties with the Mexican Californians General Castro s Orders to leave the Country Determination to Fight Fremont goes to Lawson s Fort Fremont and his Men encounter a Thousand Indians The Battle and the Victory The news that War had been declared between the United States and Mexico reaches Fremont Lieutenant Gillespie rescued from the Indians Three of the party killed in the Night by Indians The Savages repulsed The Burial of Comrades In the early spring of eighteen forty five Kit Carson after weighing the various occupations which presented decided to become a farmer One of his mountaineer friends mister Richard Owens came to the same conclusion Together they talked over their plans and concluded that it would be to them at least newness of life to be domiciled in their own houses The two hunters carefully marked out their plans and then set to work with a will for success to carry them into execution A very short time enabled them to choose a farming site because their knowledge of the country enabled them to see all of its desirable localities as it were at a glance They decided to purchase a tract of wild land situated on the little Cimeron River and improve it Their arrangements were soon made tools and implements stock and animals provisions and necessaries all procured With the services of some laborers hired by them they were soon engaged actively preparing their land for the reception of seed The spot which they selected was forty five miles east of Taos They commenced the enterprise by building some small huts These afforded both themselves and their Mexican laborers a comfortable lodgment They sowed a considerable quantity of grain and prepared timber almost sufficient to build good substantial houses Their vigorously prosecuted labors began to show evident results and in the prospect it was clearly apparent that another year would serve to give them profitable reward for their enterprise It seems appropriate at this point that we should enable the reader to look upon and judge of the farming country and habits of New Mexico their markets and some of the manners and customs of the people who dwell in cities The town of Taos affords a fair sample of the markets and as Kit Carson has many times been exhibited to the reader at that place it is very proper that we should describe it The town of Taos is located in a valley called by the same name The town consists of a series of villages which are scattered and are known to the Mexicans by various names The main village is called Fernandez de Taos and is located near the centre of the valley on a high plateau of ground The buildings here as indeed in all the towns of New Mexico are constructed of adobes and are one story high with what is usually known as flat roofs These houses are huddled together without much regard being paid to streets The main attraction of the town is the plaza where all the business such as marketing et cetera is carried on It is here that the stores are located and on a fete day or in business hours it is thronged with Mexicans Americans and Indians Among these there is a large per centage of idlers The houses are mostly covered with a white material which is either chalk or lime The church is the largest building in the town and is a rough specimen of architecture which is rudely finished within It has a flat sounding bell propped up in a sort of a belfry To make a noise on this a piece of iron or several stones are used and when an attempt at chiming is made it is very laughable The figures representing saints and even the altar are a strange compound of imitation On the respective days set apart by the Catholic church for worship marriages and fete services are carried on with a great attempt at pomp but under the circumstances they leave no lasting impression of grandeur save on the inhabitants who have beheld nothing beyond their own country The dignitary most respected in these towns is the Padre or Priest who is looked upon as sacred and when so inclined this class of men have the power of accomplishing much good but oftentimes they pervert this power setting bad examples in their mode of life and offering wicked counsel However under the management of the present bishop who is a very exemplary man these things are being changed The old Priests of New Mexico were formerly educated in Old Mexico Their information was very imperfect and their minds were contracted down to extreme narrowness from want of observation hence they were the means of retarding the natural progress of the people It cannot be denied but that the Catholic religion has been the pioneer system in the far West and that in the hands of good and pure men it has done much praiseworthy work and has set an example which other creeds might and ought to follow The valley of Taos is bounded on all sides by lofty mountains which are but continuations of the Rocky chain The boundaries of this valley are very irregular both in the course they take and in their altitudes The valley is about thirty miles wide and some fifteen miles long The ground has the appearance at first sight of being a plain but on closer observation it is found to contain many ravines and to bear the appearance of being undulating To the west side of it rolls the Rio Grande which cuts for most of the way through a deep and impassable for fording purposes channel In the valley there are but few if any trees which fact gives the villages a barren look The mountains about are covered with timber which is not generally of the first quality for building purposes The number of people included within the limits of this valley it is difficult to estimate but about ten thousand would include every living soul The occupation of the people is farming Raising horses cattle and sheep is carried on to a certain extent but most of the large herds of these animals owned in this town are kept at ranches situated at more distant points where grass is to be had in abundance and those retained about the villages are only kept for immediate use The reason for this is found in the fact that most of this valley is not under cultivation but is covered with sage bushes It is around the skirts of the mountains that the only valuable grass is found The people as a general thing are quite poor but as they find a ready market through the military posts for their produce they manage to realize some money and thus live quite comfortably in contrast with their former destitute condition under the government of Old Mexico Some of the inhabitants might be said to be rich though but few of this class own ten thousand dollars worth of property It is with great labor that the people of Taos bring their crops to perfection as it is necessary to irrigate the soil unless the season which is rarely the fact is favorable in furnishing rains to them There are no fences to divide one man s possessions from another s but by common law they furnish shepherds to guard their flocks and cattle and keep them from trespassing The climate is very severe during the winter season but in the summer it is delightful The health of this community is wonderfully good Indeed the only severe diseases they have to contend against are brought on by vices Excluding small pox and the lesser complaints among young children no epidemics are known The country is so elevated and inland that the air is dry and salubrious and the dew point is rarely reached so as to amount to anything It may be well to add here that for the consumptive patient in the early stages of the disease there is no such climate in the world to visit as that of New Mexico but as a matter of course he must vary his location with the changes of temperature being governed by the seasons The winter in Taos is too severe for him then he must go South towards or even to El Paso where it is congenial to his disease I prophesy that some day our internal continent will be the Mecca for pilgrims with this disease The dress of the New Mexican is the same as in Old Mexico The peasant wears his sombrero and his everlasting blanket which serves him as a coat and a covering by night He rarely has but one suit of clothes which are put on new and worn until they are of no further use By amalgamating with the Americans they are gradually changing their style of dress The buckskin pants which were characteristically cut and ornamented are giving way to the ordinary cloth ones of his white companion It is so with the blanket which is being shed for the coat and again this is true with the moccasin which is being replaced by the leathern shoe The dress of the female has undergone the same alteration From almost a state of nudity they have been raised to a position from which they look upon silk and satin with a connoisseur s eye When New Mexico was part and parcel of the domain of Old Mexico Taos was the seat of much smuggling from the United States and many an apparent pack of grain drawn into the town has been nothing less than packages of domestic goods the duties upon which when introduced in the legal way were enormous hence the white men engaged in this business when successful met with ample rewards for their labors The frontiers were like the olden sea coasts The Mexicans kept out scores of custom house officers to guard their frontiers but the shrewd foreigners many times were able to escape them at others they were so fortunate as to find that a bribe would answer as well An old trick was to have a double bottom to a wagon and in the vacant space thus formed were stowed valuable shawls and such light articles as would meet a sure and remunerative sale Sometimes the goods were brought near the frontiers and there hidden in the ground until a favorable opportunity offered to steal them into the country When there was great danger that these secreted goods would be discovered the smugglers would so arrange a keg of powder with a loaded pistol pointing at it with strings running to the shrubbery near by so as to cause it to explode and kill the searchers should the bushes about be disturbed One old smuggler once fixed things in this manner but performed his task too well for on going to remove his property he came very near blowing himself up as the mine was sprung and he was thrown in the air but miraculously escaped Many of the adventures of these men would be interesting but they are too voluminous to be embodied in our work The valley of Taos is well watered by mountain streams which flow into the Rio Grande On one of these creeks and near the mountains to the east of Fernandez de Taos is located an Indian Pueblo which is very interesting to the traveler Its houses are built one on top of another until a sort of pyramid is formed The people enter their respective domicils through the roofs which form a kind of steps At the foot of this queer building there is a church and around the scenery is very picturesque as the whole is bounded on one side by a gap in the mountains while on the other is the open valley This band of Indians at first offered great resistance and fought with much bravery against the United States but now they are counted among its most faithful allies and are great in their admiration of Kit Carson The farming utensils of the New Mexicans are rude in the extreme but the agricultural implements of the Anglo Saxon are slowly replacing these articles The old plough as frequently used at the present time by the New Mexicans is indeed a curiosity as it probably was invented in the earliest times It consists of one piece of timber which is crooked the proper shape by nature the end of this is sharpened and on it is fastened a single piece of iron which has an attempt at a sharp point The force to propel this farming implement is attached in the usual way with but few modifications Oxen are always employed in this labor and their yoke is fastened after the Egyptian fashion to their horns instead of by bows In breaking up the hard prairies this plough had a difficult task to perform and was often broken but by the assistance of men employed in clearing obstacles such as sage bushes et cetera the task was imperfectly gone through with The Mexican axe is another curious tool which resembles as much the common pick of our laborers as it does the axe used by American woodsmen The sickle is used in harvesting to this day in these parts performing the duties of the scythe the cradle et cetera The most remarkable sight of all is the Mexican cart the noise of which when moving can be heard on a still day at a great distance The wheels of this vehicle are at least one foot thick and consist of pieces of solid wood which are pegged together and made to approach a circle by the best judgment of the eye without the aid of measuring These wheels are very heavy and when rolling they go by jerks owing to their want of proportion et cetera The body of the cart as are all of its parts is made of soft wood and seems to be constructed for weight and strength instead of beauty The whole affair when complete is almost a load by itself hence it is capable of carrying but a small cargo The grain that Mexicans of New Mexico grow is corn and wheat and it is on these crops that they depend for their support In converting this grain into flour they either use the old water mill which is very primitive in its construction or else when these are not near by they make use of two stones and grind it by hand Their common diet is a sort of thick gruel made of corn meal wheat bread eggs peas beans pumpkins which latter articles they roast and then break holes into them and with a spoon dip out the contents as they are required and to finish the catalogue sometimes meat game and milk The fruits found in New Mexico are not various and are mostly confined to apples peaches plums and grapes These latter are truly superior and are raised in the greatest abundance in the south of the Territory where also they manufacture a very pleasant red wine which goes by the name of El Paso Wine We take the manners and customs of the people of Taos as a good type to judge of the manners and customs of the New Mexicans for the town is second only in size in this Territory to Santa Fe The inhabitants of New Mexico notwithstanding their poverty and neglect owing to their remote locality are perhaps as happy and contented as any community in the world They are not over celebrated for their chastity or virtue and to the disgrace of the white man they have not been assisted by him in these cardinal principles but time will work wonders on this score and teach the immorality of such proceedings Their great source of enjoyment consists in dancing and hence the fandango is always looked for as a time when dull care will be dispelled A grand fandango is the event of a New Mexican s life These affairs are gotten up sometimes for charitable purposes when the money gathered in the sale of refreshments is distributed to the poor or else they are started by individuals to make a little money out of In a town the size of Taos during the winter season hardly a night passes by without a dance Written invitations in Spanish are freely circulated about the town in order to entrap the strangers while the inhabitants are invited by other means The music consists of a high strung violin and a species of guitar This is perambulated about the town The players perform light dancing tunes and accompany the music with their voices making up the words as they go along This music is learned entirely by ear and is transmitted from one generation to another through the means of these fandangos The vocal music is anything but harmonious to the ear but some of the airs when played on the instruments are rather pleasing and one on hearing them finds himself often humming them afterwards The powers of music are nowhere better illustrated than among these people Their ready ear quickly catches a new tune and it is not uncommon to hear in a Mexican town a senorita giving vent to a negro melody or a favorite polka which she has heard some American sing or whistle At Santa Fe there are several noted players on the violin and harp who cannot read a word of music yet they can play on their respective instruments with taste and skill A New Mexican female in preparing herself for these balls is very particular in making by the aid of cosmetics her complexion as light as possible She first uses a red berry which stains her face almost to the color of brick and renders her excessively ugly this she leaves on several hours when it is washed off and chalk is applied so freely as to render it easily perceptible In her toilet she is also very particular as far as the exterior is concerned and in the fandango the stranger s eyes are taken by storm by the gaudy colors he sees rather than the neatness of the dress The floor of the dancing room is usually the mother earth which is frequently sprinkled with water to keep down the dust The men are in their everyday habiliments with the addition of any clean thing they may chance to possess but usually they are a motley crowd a glance at whom at first leaves the impression that they are far from being refined Except when dancing they cling to their blankets and at the least pause in the proceedings they at once draw forth the materials and make their cigarettos Both men and women indulge in these articles and oftentimes when the dance is in full blast the air of the room is densely charged with the smell of the burning punchi a species of tobacco making it anything but agreeable The women are seated on benches along the walls of the building by themselves while the men congregate in knots together On the commencement of a figure the Mexican selects his partner and notifies her that she is his choice by making a signal to her with his hand when she takes her position in the dance The eyes and the latent smile on the face of the dark eyed senorita shows she is enjoying herself The men exhibit their pleasure in a more boisterous manner that is by occasionally whooping and cracking jokes Gambling eighteen is carried on under the same roof and in this both men and women join as long as their money lasts Then they make room for others who are anxious to try their fortunes This vice is truly of a national character and so given to it are these people that they will part with anything to support their appetite To their credit it can be said that the New Mexican women indulge but sparingly in alcoholic liquor but the men are prone to the intoxicating cup They often anticipate the evil effects of drink and it is not unfrequent to see a New Mexican assuming the airs of a drunken man after two or three mouthfuls of aqua diente The spirit of the ball is carried on well into the short hours of night when all parties depart for their homes Intoxication that curse to all men is playing havoc with this innocent amusement of the people and causing these scenes to terminate in riot and often bloodshed especially when the jealousy of the white blood is raised at some imagined insult and then as is always the case the two races come in fierce contact It is hoped that by the aid of schools and education these things may be ameliorated but they cannot be cured The mischief is too deeply rooted Footnote eighteen The game most frequently played is monte We have thus endeavored to give the reader a view of the people among whom Kit Carson had determined to become a farmer But he was not destined to finish and perfect his plans Near the conclusion of the second exploring expedition and at the time when Kit Carson took his departure from the party colonel Fremont had received a promise from him to the effect that he would join as guide any party of discovery for the further exploration of the Rocky Mountains which he colonel Fremont should command During the active duties of a farmer s life and just as Kit Carson had brought his new enterprise into working order an expressman from colonel Fremont arrived at his ranche bearing dispatches to Carson The purport of these dispatches was to remind Kit Carson of his promise to inform him of the organization of a third expedition and to appoint a place where Kit Carson might find his old commander The express found Carson in the midst of so many cares and anxieties concerning his new project that it became a very difficult matter for him to keep his word But the sacrifice of pecuniary interest was but a slight consideration with Kit when weighed in the balance against his promise He knew that his promise had not been either lightly given or received colonel Fremont by it had the first right to his time and energies and had formed his expectations accordingly and Kit lost therefore no time in making preparations to satisfy these expectations by reporting himself at the appointed place of meeting ready for the march But to effect this was attended with no slight difficulties Kit Carson had a large sum invested in his improvements by way of payments for labor as well as purchases of stock provision farming tools utensils teams wagons seed and stock in general The erection of his house barns et cetera was under an advance which reached far towards completion But with Kit Carson his word was worth more than prospective losses which its fulfillment would entail In company with mister Owens he set himself actively at work to effect a complete sell out After a good deal of anxious inquiry he found a man who was willing to pay one half of the real valuation attached to his property Notwithstanding this sacrifice the bargain was closed and the business details completed In company with mister Owens Kit Carson once more bade his family and friends an affectionate farewell They took the route for Bent s Fort and arrived there in the course of a few days The meeting between Fremont and Carson was mutually satisfactory With his friend mister Owens he joined the Third expedition of colonel Fremont which was the last one which he undertook by authority of the United States government A long tramp was before them The arrangements preparatory were therefore made with corresponding care and diligence The route led up the Arkansas River to the point where that stream leaves the mountains thence they made a circuit by the Ballo Salado or Soda Springs coming back again upon the Arkansas striking the stream above its great canon Thence they journeyed on to the head waters of the river Here they left the Arkansas River and took a direct route for the Piney River down which latter stream they traveled to a spot within twenty five miles of its mouth From this place they continued their explorations of the country to the head of White River Following down it they soon reached the mountains Crossing them they proceeded to Prevost s Fork At this spot a desperate fight once occurred between a party of trappers and a band of hostile Indians The trappers were commanded by a man whose name has ever since been applied to the stream Prevost although he had a strong party and fought a most desperate battle nevertheless was outnumbered outgeneralled and most completely overpowered The Indians succeeded in killing the entire party including himself with but four exceptions These four escaped only with the greatest difficulty and prudence Through them the particulars of the affair became known to the mountaineers colonel Fremont we should before this have mentioned that Fremont had been promoted in the corps of Topographical Engineers from the post of Lieutenant to the rank of Captain by brevet now examined the country as far as the south side of the Great Salt Lake passing on his route a smaller body of water which for many years has been known as Little Utah Lake The command halted at Great Salt Lake a few days to recruit preparatory to undertaking the further exploration of the lake together with one of its largest islands which would be reached by this southern route The Indians met with on the journey informed them that on this island there was plenty of fresh water and game in abundance On arriving at a suitable place colonel Fremont pitched his tents for the main camp On the following morning taking Kit Carson and a few chosen men colonel Fremont started to explore the island The reports of the Indians were proven to be true In addition to plenty of fresh water and game they discovered very good timber growing there The game which proved to be antelope was so abundant that they decided to kill from the herds a quantity sufficient for future use The island was about fifteen miles in length by about five in breadth From the main land to the island they were able to ride their horses as the water was not deep Upon the banks of the lake they found the salt deposit to vary from the thickness of a wafer to the depth of twelve inches Having made their observations the small party returned to the main camp On the following day the journey was resumed the route leading around the south side of the lake until they reached the last fresh water to be found in that direction Before them lay a wide and unknown desert over which no white man had ever passed Kit Carson had been at this spot several times in previous years and had often heard the oldest trappers speak of the impossibility of crossing it for man or beast They had always shrunk from a path apparently endless which offered appearances of neither grass nor water Colonel Fremont had determined to try the formidable desert and if possible unfold its hidden secrets His men were equally ambitious with himself and were ready to second his efforts without fearing the trials or sufferings which the desert route might exact Colonel Fremont arranged all of his plans commensurate with the hardships in expectancy Early the subsequent morning he dispatched Kit Carson Maxwell and two others as an advance party to break the road and look for a camping site With his telescope he then ascended a neighboring mountain to watch the little party of pioneers In the event that water and grass should be found Kit Carson s orders were to build a fire the smoke of which would serve as a signal to Fremont who would immediately follow up their trail with the whole command For sixty miles Kit Carson with his little party traveled over this level barren and sandy desert without coming to a drop of water or a blade of grass At the end of this distance they reached the mountains on the west side of the lake and found both in abundance The signal of smoke was now made according to agreement Even at this long distance Fremont discovered it and immediately set his party in motion Kit Carson sent back one of the men to meet the main body and guide it across the dreary waste Before the party had accomplished more than half the distance to Kit Carson s advance night set in forcing the whole band to encamp without water grass or fuel The camp became more necessary because the darkness was so great that they could not follow the trail in a night march Early the following day the march was resumed and a few hours served once more to reunite the command They had the misfortune however to lose a few of their animals The place which Kit Carson had selected for the camp was to the weary travelers in every respect equal to an oasis on the Great Sahara There is no one thing which a traveler on the plains dreads more than being forced to camp without water and grass At this resting place Colonel Fremont in order to accomplish as much as possible divided his forces into two commands One of them he gave into the charge of mister Talbot his assistant and appointed for his guide a mountaineer named Walker To this party Colonel Fremont gave instructions to shape their course for Mary s River on striking which they were to follow down the stream to where it is lost in the Great Basin Colonel Fremont retained with him fifteen men besides his guide The route which he pursued lay in the country south of Mary s River forming a large tract of land which it was very desirable that he should explore After finishing this he was to join Talbot on the lake which is formed by the widening of the Carson River The country through which Colonel Fremont traveled he found to be well furnished with grass water and wood It is highly picturesque but as its characteristics are so vividly painted in his reports it is superfluous to add our attempt to the same task Having arrived at the lake already mentioned he there awaited the arrival of Talbot It was three days before the command was again united They however remained together only one night Early the following morning they separated once more This time Talbot s instructions were to find a certain pass which would bring him out in the vicinity of the Sierra Nevada Mountains which he was to cross and then keep on his course for the waters of the San Joaquin Fremont with his division journeyed up the Carson River and after traversing the Sierra Nevada Mountains he arrived safe at Sutter s Fort without meeting with any incidents that were not to be expected on such a trip Captain Sutter with his usual urbanity of manner kindly received them and supplied their wants Of him Fremont purchased forty head of cattle and a few horses with which he set out to look for mister Talbot In doing so he traveled up the valley of the San Joaquin and forded that river at about where it is ushered forth from the mountains mister Talbot was not to be found in this direction so the party went to Kings River and journeyed up it to its head waters It now happened that the cattle belonging to the party began to grow foot sore and weary from travel over rocky trails and through deep snows It became evident that the looked for men were not in that quarter therefore Fremont returned to the prairies near by in the hopes of saving his cattle but when he arrived there he was destitute of these animals for they had all given out and died The party had previous to this misfortune killed some of the best of the oxen and prepared the meat to carry along with them but in no great quantities as their riding animals were not strong enough to bear heavy burdens The command had hardly left the mountains and succeeded in reaching the prairies before they were obliged to submit to further trials and losses After going into camp one night the men tired and worn out by much labor had lain down to rest As a guard had been posted they gave themselves but little concern about danger Their sentinels were not on the look out as sharply as they might have been The consequence was that some hostile Indians crept within their lines and killed two mules which depredation was not discovered until the next morning Fremont had no animals remaining in condition to give chase and therefore had quietly to submit to his loss He now resolved to give up for the time being his search for Talbot s party and return to Sutter s Fort where he could reorganize While on their road to the Fort the men came suddenly upon a band of the same Indians who had recently annoyed them These fellows seemed to invite an engagement and were gratified by colonel Fremont In the skirmish that ensued they lost five warriors killed The rest fled The party after undergoing many hardships finally reached their point of destination During the latter part of this tramp game had become so scarce that the men had to shoot whatever came in their way This time it chanced to be wild horses When they arrived at the Fort they were on foot their saddle and pack animals having all given out and broken down By the kind assistance of mister Sutter they were furnished anew After recruiting a little their own worn out bodies they started on their second trip in quest of their companions They traversed the coast range and went to San Jose to see if they could hear anything through the Mexicans and Indians who resided there concerning the whereabouts of the missing men as perchance some of the hunters or traders among these people might in their travels have met or heard something of them On making inquiries at San Jose they were informed that the party was encamped at a well known place on the San Joaquin This piece of intelligence immediately decided Fremont to dispatch Carson and two companions to that section of country while he and the remainder of the men would remain where they were and await his return Kit Carson performed his mission with his usual promptness and soon returned with his charge when the expedition was once more united under one leader Owing to the great trials and privations recently met with and the inability to procure at Sutter s Fort all that was wanted in the matter of an outfit therefore it was determined upon that the party should proceed next to Monterey where they knew they could purchase the articles that were actually required While en route and when within thirty miles of this last named town an impertinent order was received from general Castro the Mexican commander of the territory The purport of this order was that Fremont and his party must immediately vacate the country without further notice or else the gallant general would be obliged to drive them out It was late in the afternoon when the messenger with this document arrived in Fremont s camp yet he found time the same day to pack up and fall back to a place where he could fortify his position as he felt confident that this was but an empty excuse which the Mexican general had invented to prevent him from penetrating further into the country The Americans had hardly got things in proper trim before the Mexican general at the head of several hundred troops arrived and established his camp and head quarters within sight of the former being deluded with the belief that he would easily intimidate the exploring party The general commenced firing his cannon and making a great uproar He had all branches of the service with him including artillery infantry and cavalry In the intention of intimidation however he was greatly mistaken though the difference in numbers between the two parties was in itself almost decisive should they come to a conflict Yet the Mexicans had but poorly estimated the mettle contained in the American commander and his forty men They were ready one and all to sell their lives dearly in a cause good as that before them Unshaken in their purpose the little band of intrepid men remained in their camp for the period of three days The Americans who were then living at Monterey sent several expressmen to their countrymen warning them of their danger as they felt that the Mexicans could without a doubt completely annihilate them Fremont s reply was perfectly characteristic of the man he said he had done nothing to raise the wrath of the Mexicans who were now treating him disgracefully He had come to perform a duty and could not leave without executing it In fact neither himself nor his men would submit to be driven out of the country At the end of three days Fremont saw that there was no prospect of general Castro s consummating his threat and considering that he had sufficiently shown his willingness to fight if driven to it he therefore concluded to strike his camp and withdraw to the Sacramento River The party were not disturbed in their movements and on reaching this stream they followed it up until they came to Peter Lawson s Trading Post where Fremont intended since he could not go to Monterey without being too rash to purchase the outfit for the homeward bound trip The party remained at this post some ten days during which time some American settlers in the neighborhood came in with the information that one thousand Indian warriors were collecting for the avowed purpose of destroying their ranches probably at the instigation of the Mexicans The exploring party and also five white men from the Post proffered their services to go to the aid of their countrymen and shortly afterwards the whole command under Fremont moved forward to meet and measure their strength with the savages The village of the Indians was in due time found when the whites commenced the fight by making an attack on it The battle was for a little while stoutly contested but finally the red men were completely routed The number of the killed it was difficult to ascertain but Carson is of the opinion that this fight had the tendency of fixing on the minds of this tribe the truth of their inability to cope with white men the convincing evidence of which was that the battle ground was strewn with their dead Having more than accomplished his chastisement of the Indians Fremont with his party returned to Lawson s On finishing his purchases at this post whose occupants had done their utmost to supply his wants and make his stay agreeable the explorer once more set his command in motion en route for the Columbia River He traveled up the Sacramento and passed near the Shasta Buttes nineteen and thence on to the Tlamath Lake While encamped on the head of this collection of water news came to the party that war had been declared between the United States and Mexico This intelligence had been sent to Fremont through Lieutenant Gillespie of the United States marines who had with him six men as an escort After traveling three hundred miles over bad trails at a rapid pace his animals began to succumb to fatigue The lieutenant saw he would fail to accomplish his ends with the whole party together therefore he selected two of his most reliable men mounted them on his fleetest horses and sent them on ahead to bear the dispatches while he himself would jog on slowly The expressmen overhauled the exploring party after several days of hard travel and handed to Fremont the communications As soon as he had read his letters Fremont made inquiries in regard to Gillespie and found that he was in rather a precarious position for should the Tlamath Indians take the notion they would murder him and his men just by the way of pastime Fremont at once determined to return with all haste and succor Gillespie from the imminent peril that surrounded him With this purpose in view he selected ten picked men leaving orders for the rest of the party to follow on his trail and set out He had traveled about sixty miles when he met the officer he was in search of coming on The meeting was very gratifying to both but especially so to Fremont who was fully alive to the dangers through which Gillespie had passed for the lieutenant was not sufficiently aware how black hearted in their villainy and treachery this tribe through whose country he was passing were as he had heretofore never dealt with them A camp was selected near by and all hands were not long in being snugly seated in it around a good fire listening to the important news fresh from the civilized world Footnote nineteen Blunt projecting mountains Fremont sat up until about one o clock reading his letters from the United States Kit Carson and Owens wrapped in their saddle blankets had picked out their beds near the fire as the night was cold On concluding the reading of his correspondence Fremont turned in and was soon sound asleep All was quiet for awhile when Kit Carson heard a noise that awaked him the sound was like the stroke of an axe Rising to his feet he discovered Indians in the camp While in the act of reaching for his rifle he gave the alarm to his slumbering companions but two of them were already sleeping their last sleep for the fatal tomahawk had been buried in their brains One of these victims was the brave Lajeunesse while the other was a full blooded Delaware Indian As Kit Carson left the fire where he was too conspicuous an object he saw several warriors approaching towards it There lay near to it four other Delawares who on hearing the alarm sprang to their feet One of them by the name of Crane seized hold of a rifle which unfortunately was not his own and was not loaded The poor fellow was not aware of this important fact He kept trying to fire it while he stood erect and manfully received five arrows all of which penetrated his left breast and either one of which was sufficient to cause his death At last he fell On grasping his gun Kit Carson remembered that the evening before he had discharged it for the purpose of cleaning it and while doing so had accidentally broken its cap tube and consequently he had not reloaded it As this flashed across his mind he threw the rifle down and drew from his belt a single barrelled pistol with which he made at the warrior who was so safely throwing his arrows into his companion When sufficiently near Kit Carson fired but as the fellow kept dodging about he only succeeded in cutting the string that held the tomahawk to its red owner s arm Maxwell now shot at this same brave and hit him in the fleshy part of one leg and as he was turning to run which was the case with most of the Indians by this time a bullet from the rifle of a mountaineer passed through his heart and arrested his progress The whites were now fully awakened to their danger and about ready to commence the fight but the enemy had scattered If all the savages had shown the same quickness and coolness as did their foremost warrior the probability is that the most if not the whole of the party would have been massacred As it was the attack was well planned but poorly carried out The result of the affair was that Fremont lost three brave men and had one other wounded slightly It now became evident that the party had fallen into a snare which was intended for Lieutenant Gillespie and his small force but the coming up of Fremont had caused the assassins to find they had caught a Tartar Fremont and his party apprehended no danger that night consequently they did not post a guard and as the men were very tired they slept very soundly Before lying down several of them had fired off their rifles and after cleaning them they had neglected to reload them This was the first and last time they were guilty of such a mistake while in an Indian country Of the three men killed the one by the name of Lajeunesse was the most regretted for he had been with Fremont on his previous expeditions and had won the admiration and confidence of his commander and companions In a small company of men such as these expeditions were composed of where every member becomes intimately known and admired by his companions the loss of one would be greatly felt but when three such were thus suddenly taken it caused a gloom to be cast over the remainder not easily to be dispelled The only consolation left to the living was that they had been instrumental in saving Lieutenant Gillespie and his four companions therefore in sacrificing their comrades they had saved more lives than had been lost There were no more thoughts of sleep in this camp for that eventful night but instead the men selected positions behind neighboring trees and fallen logs and were ready to receive the enemy should they see fit to visit them again The Indians however as Kit Carson predicted had come to the wise conclusion not to attempt so unsatisfactory a business as another attack for the grey light of the following day came without their reappearance Before the sun had fairly risen Fremont had broken up this camp which had become odious to the men from its unpleasant associations With their packs and with the bodies of their dead companions the party started to find their rear guard They had proceeded about ten miles on their journey when by unanimous consent they resolved to halt and inter the remains which they had wished to carry until they united their forces so that all could participate in the funeral rites but the woods through which they were traveling were very thick and already the bodies had become greatly disfigured on account of their frequently striking against the trees as they were fastened on the backs of three animals Slowly and sadly in that dense forest hundreds of miles from their nearest countrymen was this funeral procession formed A spot was selected on one side of the main trail at a distance of about one half mile where a rude grave was dug and wrapped in their blankets in the same common house were deposited all that remained of these three brave men An observer of these obsequies would have seen the lips of daring men now and then giving spasmodic twitchings eyes swimming in tears and a silence and solemnity that bespoke the truest kind of grief Among that party such a one would have been sure to have marked out the countenance of Kit Carson for engraven on it were the throes which were troubling his kind heart on being thus obliged to separate from old friends Not a man left that grave but who resolved secretly and silently to make these dastardly Indians suffer for the lives they had thus wantonly taken In fact they felt it an imperative duty they yet owed to their departed comrades who if they but stood in their places would have sworn to be avenged hence the reader must not judge them harshly if they nourished these feelings That very day the two parties met and went into camp together Plans were concocted to chastise the red men soundly The next day on quitting this last resting place a squad of fifteen men was left concealed in the neighborhood in order to watch and act against any Indians who by chance might be following them from one camp to another in hopes of finding something The main command then moved on slowly and had advanced but a few miles when they were overtaken by their friends who came up with two scalps These were the sum total of their morning s work The two warriors to whom they had belonged were caught following the trail as scouts of their main body The unerring rifles of the party in ambush had performed their fearful duty CHAPTER X Fremont en route for California His men are anxious to punish the Tlamath Indians Kit Carson in command of ten Men is sent on ahead to reconnoitre He discovers the main Village of these Indians The Attack and the Victory Beautiful Lodges The Trophies mostly destroyed Fremont saves Kit Carson s Life The Journey resumed The Sacramento Valley An Indian Ambuscade One Savage defies the Party Kit Carson shoots him The Tlamath Indians still on the War Path Another Lesson given to them A Thief is shot Arrival at Lawson s Trading Post A period of Inactivity A Detachment sent to capture Sonoma Prisoners taken The Mexicans come to punish the Americans Their Courage deserts them The Retreat The Pursuit Fremont goes to Sutter s Fort and establishes a Military Post Monterey is taken by the American Squadron Fremont marches there Further Operations The taking of Los Angelos The news of war having been declared between the United States and Mexico determined Fremont to return to California and in doing so he decided to enter that country by a new route of his own selection He commenced his journey by traveling around Lake Tlamath and had not proceeded far in that direction before he found himself encamped on a small stream which empties into the lake nearly opposite to the place where his three men were killed The distance of each day s progress had been carefully reckoned and noted by the party Upon their minds there was still resting a sadness which their leader saw was only to be effaced by a satisfactory revenge and that they were eager to obtain it before quitting the country Perhaps also their commanding officer thought it best while the opportunity offered for the benefit of his countrymen whom he felt sure would some day possess this territory to impress these savages with the power and bravery of the white men Whatever was the object to be gained it matters not in relating the particulars The next morning he sent Kit Carson on ahead with ten chosen men giving him orders to the effect that if he discovered a large village of Indians which was the general surmise without being himself seen he was to send back word when he Fremont would hasten on with reinforcements in order to make the assault If it should happen that the Indians were the first to be apprised of his near approach then without delay Carson was to engage them as he thought best Acting under these instructions Kit Carson with his detail of men set out and fortunately soon found a fresh trail that led directly to where the savages had established their village This Indian village numbered fifty lodges and to each wigwam the mountaineers estimated three braves as this is the complement of men who live in one of these huts on the prairies and in the Rocky Mountains thus making the force of the Indians to be in the neighborhood of one hundred and fifty From the commotion noticed in the village it was evident to all present that the tribe had become aware of danger and that there was no time to be lost in sending back the desired information Kit Carson notwithstanding the strength of his enemies determined to hazard an attack and after a brief consultation with his companions he decided to take advantage of the confusion that was existing among the red men by charging right in among them If ever there is a time when Indians will stand their ground it is when defending their families therefore on this occasion the white men were warmly received but they fought with such a degree of desperation as they themselves had never done before The result was that the savages became panic stricken and soon afterwards fled leaving everything they possessed behind them The victors after pursuing the Indians for some distance and adding a few more to the list of killed returned to the village which they found to be rich in booty The lodges here taken Kit Carson describes as being the most tasty pieces of handiwork that Indian skill could devise and surpassed anything of the kind that he had previously looked upon They were made of the broad leaves of the swamp flag which were beautifully and intricately woven together Within the wigwams the party found a very large amount of fish in different stages of preservation for future use Wishing to do these people as much harm as possible and thus be even with them for their recent savage cruelties on their own party Kit Carson gave the order to collect everything in the lodges and arrange the articles in such manner that fire would either destroy or completely damage them Having accomplished this work the lighted tinder was applied when the flames leaped high up in the air forming a fit funeral pyre for their slain companions Fremont saw the reflection of the fire and also the smoke and at once knew that Kit Carson was engaged with the Indians consequently he pushed on at a very rapid pace to assist him He arrived too late for what the men called the sport but instead heard the report of his lieutenant and guide Kit Carson whose words to use his Fremont s own language are synonymous with truth The gloom which had prevailed over the party while the men recounted to their friends the details of the fight was temporarily dispelled and while thus engaged the command moved on about two miles from the Indian village Having here selected a site they went into camp After comfortably stowing themselves away in this resting place another war talk was called and what was best to be done was canvassed over After the adjournment of the council Fremont decided to send back twenty men under Richard Owens to the neighborhood of the ruins of the village there to conceal themselves and await the return of the Indians who it was thought might come back to look after their dead He did so and Owens had not been secreted a great while before about fifty savages returned and by the moon s light were quite visible As had been previously agreed upon word was sent by a trusty messenger to Fremont who with six companions Kit Carson being of the number hastened on horseback to join his outpost For fear of being discovered Fremont chose a different route from the one taken by Owens which was quite direct while that of the former was circuitous On approaching the smouldering remains of the village Kit Carson discovered only one Indian wandering about on the ground As soon almost as he was seen by the party they made a dash at him Kit Carson was in the advance and on arriving within about ten feet of the warrior he drew up his horse and brought his rifle to his shoulder to fire but the gun only snapped and left its owner in a very precarious situation as the red man had already drawn the string of his bow to plant an arrow in the body of his adversary A moment more and in all probability Kit Carson would have been breathing his last Fremont saw the danger his friend was in although Kit had tried to avoid the arrow by throwing himself on one side of his horse With much forethought as well as personal exposure he plunged the rowels of his spurs deep into his riding animal The noble horse obeying the impetus thus given by his rider made a few extra strides until he reached knocked down and passed over the Indian thereby causing his arrow to fly in a different direction from the one intended Before the savage could regain his feet a ball from one of the rifles belonging to the party had sent him to his last resting place Fremont now learned from Owens that while the messenger was absent the rest of the Indians had decamped and as he had received orders from him to await his coming in case he found the enemy therefore he was obliged to let the rascals quietly depart without firing into them which was much to his own and his men s displeasure Illustration A moment more and in all probability Kit Carson would have been breathing his last Fremont saw the danger his friend was in although Kit had tried to avoid the arrow by throwing himself on one side of his horse PAGE two hundred sixty five It was now necessary to return without delay to their own camp and thus anticipate the movements of the Indians as they might conclude to make an attack in that quarter but on arriving there they found everything safe nor were they during that night in any way disturbed Kit Carson was and is still very grateful to Fremont for thus interposing between him and almost certain death for it would have been the work of an instant for the Indian warrior at ten feet distance to have sent an arrow into some vital organ It was such noble generosity bravery and disinterested exposure in the hour of peril in order to serve his men that strongly cemented Fremont to them Indeed in all of his expeditions he had such command over his employees that little or no trouble ever occurred among them while on their marches although they had privations and dangers to undergo that would often try men of the most even temper On the day following the one on which his party had encountered and chastised the Tlamath Indians Fremont started for the Valley of the Sacramento The expedition was progressing well and was four days out from this last camp when as two of the men whose names were Maxwell and Archambeau were out hunting at a distance of about three miles on one side of their friends they were surprised at seeing one Indian on foot approaching towards them The hunters in order to do away with all suspicion at once halted and laid down their arms to show the warrior that they were friendly disposed They thought it was best to have a talk with him and question him in regard to the country they were then in As he showed no symptoms of fear but kept coming on they supposed that he had understood their actions therefore they paid but little attention to him until they saw him stop Their curiosity was now excited to know his intentions and as they watched his movements they saw him take some young crows from his quiver and after untying the string that held them he concealed them to his satisfaction in the grass and again moved forward but while doing so he was busy arranging his weapons for immediate use The white men were not astonished at this for they concluded that he was only preparing himself against danger The Indian slowly advanced to a spot that was within fifteen yards of the hunters when he again stopped and commenced shooting his arrows at them At first they dodged about and made signs for him to desist as they were friends but to their admonitions he paid not the least attention Several of the missiles had come near causing them bodily injury After a time forbearance ceased to be a virtue Raising his rifle one of the men fired when to use mountaineer parlance the Indian went under What could have been the foolhardy ideas of this warrior that compelled him to take such a course as he did not one of the party when they were informed of the adventure could conjecture but a fact it is that he lost his life and his scalp by his indiscretion In due time the command reached the Sacramento River and were proceeding on the trail down that stream when they came to a point not far from a deep canon the sides of which were almost perpendicular and composed of cragged rocks Fremont decided not to pass through this deep gorge but instead to travel around it and he did so by crossing the river It proved afterwards to be a very fortunate change for their old enemies the Tlamath Indians had concealed themselves there thinking as a matter of course that the white men would keep the trail Seeing that the white men were not coming into the ambuscade laid for them the Indians became so disappointed that they boldly ventured forth from their hiding places A few more daring than the rest advanced into open ground when Carson Godey and another member of the party made a dash at them They all ran except one warrior and as the charging party were mounted on mules they made but poor progress in overtaking them The one Indian who apparently had resolved to make war on his own account concealed himself behind a rock strung his bow putting several arrows in his mouth and thus awaited the advance of his foes Kit Carson and Godey soon came within shooting distance when he began to let fly his arrows and kept it up so briskly that the men dodged about without being able to do anything else for some moments At last wearying of this dangerous sport Kit Carson dismounted and crept around until he obtained a good sight at the Indian when he drew up his rifle fired and sent a bullet through his heart From this dead brave Kit Carson took a beautifully wrought bow and quiver which still contained a large number of arrows and which he presented on rejoining the party to Lieutenant Gillespie It is a pity that such a brave man as this savage was should have met with such an inglorious death but it was his own seeking for he had attacked the wrong persons Another twenty four hours now passed by without any further annoyance from the Indians who notwithstanding the late forcible instruction they had received still continued to hover around and follow after the exploring party On encamping the next evening after Kit Carson had killed the Indian as above described the party found themselves entirely destitute of anything to eat although they were very hungry Game had all at once become very scarce as the hunters whose turn it was to be out that day had returned unsuccessful Two more men were then sent out in hopes that by perseverance they might find something They had not proceeded far before they discovered an Indian watching their camp as if awaiting a favorable opportunity to make a descent on the animals Step one of these hunters crept unperceived by the red man until he was within range of his rifle when he fired and killed the would be thief No other game could be found so the hunters returned and the whole party retired to rest supperless and arose the next morning to fast again That day however they found and killed some game and for the time being their appetites were once more appeased Fremont was now on his way to Peter Lawson s Fort where he arrived safely after several days of hard traveling At this place the party rested for about one week but the desire to have an active share in the approaching hostilities caused Fremont to delay no longer than was absolutely necessary hence he started and went to a point lower down on the Sacramento known to the mountaineers under the name of the Buttes Here a camp was made and here Fremont had decided to wait positive orders concerning the war and until these instructions should arrive he employed his men in hunting After several days spent in this way he began to weary of inactivity He thought that in all probability war had commenced and finally he decided to take the responsibility of sending a part of his force to surprise Sonoma a Mexican military post that had but a weak garrison This the party accomplished to the entire satisfaction of their commander They captured and made prisoners of war at this fort one general and two captains besides taking several cannon and quite a quantity of small arms It was about this time that news reached Fremont which convinced him that hostilities had already commenced and that both countries were taking active measures to carry the war on with vigor He set out immediately on the receipt of this information and joined his detail of men at Sonoma During his stay at this fort General Castro sent one of his captains with a large force of Mexicans from San Francisco with orders to drive the Americans out of the country This command came and accidentally fell upon and butchered two men whom Fremont had sent out as messengers to inform all American settlers that Sonoma had been taken by him and that thither they could fly for safety The gallant Mexican captain on seeing and hearing that Fremont s forces were anxious to meet him becoming disheartened began to retreat and was pursued by the exploring party For six days they thus followed the retreating enemy whose courage had evidently deserted them though they had triple the force of their pursuers So hot was the chase that the Mexicans deserted many of their animals which as a matter of course fell into the hands of the Americans Fremont on finding that he could not overtake the enemy returned to Sonoma The captain with his Mexican command as was afterwards learned did not remain at San Francisco No doubt he did not like to trust himself within reach of Fremont for he continued his march until he reached the Pueblo of Los Angelos where he was rejoined by General Castro who reorganized the forces and assumed the command himself The exploring party had now become a military expedition and around this nucleus the Americans then in California flocked to pour out their vengeance against their country s foes Having quite a little army at his disposal Fremont left a strong detachment at Sonoma and departed with the rest of his command for Sutter s Fort On arriving there he placed the fort under military rule and left his prisoners General Vallejos and the two captains who had been captured at Sonoma Also an American by the name of Lace who was a brother in law to General Vallejos and whose predilections appeared to lean in favor of the Mexican side With all his mountain men including Kit Carson Fremont then took up his line of march towards Monterey for the purpose of attacking and taking possession of the town but this movement had been anticipated by Commodore Sloat and the American squadron Soon after Fremont s arrival at Monterey where he was very kindly received by the commodore and his officers Commodore Sloat left the country and the command devolved upon Commodore Stockton A consultation having been held among the officers it was the prevailing opinion that it would be impossible to overtake and engage the Mexicans by following them up on land therefore Fremont asked for a ship to take his force to San Diego where he could obtain animals and march on to Los Angelos The United States vessel Cyane under the command of captain Dupont was furnished him for this undertaking by Commodore Stockton In four days time the party arrived at San Diego where they landed They there parted with the ship and the gallant captain with many pleasant reminiscences of their short voyage At San Diego Fremont found himself at the head of about one hundred and fifty men which was not a very strong force to be in an enemy s country with especially so far from their homes as they were However nearly every man was a veteran in war and the whole body felt themselves invincible which was a source of great consolation to their leader From San Diego parties of the command were sent to scour the neighboring country in order to bring in a sufficient number of horses to mount the men This being accomplished Fremont set out for Los Angelos where the Governor and general Castro had a force of seven hundred men at their disposal These officials with their soldiers on learning the near approach of the Americans broke up and fled most of them taking the road to Sonora while the balance scattered not apparently caring where they went as long as they did not come in contact with the Americans Fremont marched within about one league of the town and encamped to await as had been previously agreed upon the arrival of Commodore Stockton who soon joined him at this place with a party of sailors and marines As fine a body of men says Kit Carson as ever I looked upon When the two commands had been consolidated they marched direct for Los Angelos which they easily captured as its would be defenders had some days before deserted it In this town the command was quartered for some time but as it is our intention to follow the career of Kit Carson who shortly after their arrival had been detailed for important duty which placed him in new scenes hence we are necessitated to take leave of affairs as they transpired there and hereafter revert to them casually as they connect with our narrative CHAPTER XI Kit Carson is sent Overland as Bearer of Dispatches to Washington The Preparation and the Start The Journey Privations and Sufferings Meeting with General Kearney The General takes Carson as his Guide and sends on the Dispatches by Fitzpatrick The March Arrival at Warner s Ranche Mexicans on the Road Preparations for a Battle The Battle Disastrous Consequences Kit Carson and Lieutenant Beale offer to run the lines of the Mexican Sentinels and carry Information to San Diego of Kearney s critical position The Daring Undertaking The Sufferings they encountered Their Arrival Reinforcements sent out Lieutenant Beale is Delirious from the Privations he has undergone general Kearney and his Command finally reach and join the other American Forces in California On the fifteenth day of September eighteen forty six Kit Carson was placed in the command of fifteen men with orders to make an overland journey to Washington as bearer of very important dispatches At the time of which we write there was no steam communication as now via the two great oceans consequently the intercourse between our brave countrymen in California and the government at Washington was attended with extreme difficulty Fortunately Fremont had in Kit Carson just the man to make such a journey through an enemy s country Kit Carson was instructed to use his utmost endeavors to make the journey in sixty days which was no small undertaking when we consider the great distance to be traveled over and the obstacles that lay in his path he undertook it however with a determination not to be easily frustrated By judicious management and watchfulness Kit was making good progress and had reached a point within two days travel of the Copper Mines in New Mexico without being in any way annoyed Here he came into full view of a village of Apache Indians who were then as they nearly ever since have been at war with the Americans He had been discovered by these Indians and there was but one true way to act which was not to show the white feather by attempting to evade them Fremont s dispatch bearer had not the least idea of that he was too well schooled in Indian stratagem to be out manoeuvered so he rode on as if nothing had happened until he came to some timber that lay within one hundred yards of their village when he halted At first the Indians were disconcerted at the boldness of the whites and were showing it by hurrying to and fro either for the purpose of leaving or to be better prepared to offer fight On arriving near enough so to do Kit Carson called to the savages and informed them that his party were friends and wished a parley To this an assent was given when Kit made them understand that he and his men were simply travelers en route for New Mexico that they carried the olive branch of peace with them and had come among them bearing it in the hopes of being able to exchange their fatigued animals for others that were fresh With this the Indians were satisfied therefore Carson chose a camping ground for himself and men and selected the site so that they could best contend against the treachery of the red men should they attempt any When the camp was arranged the Indians were allowed to come in and soon after the trading commenced which proved to be very successful for the men obtained very good riding animals in place of their old ones Their intercourse with this band of Apaches closed early the next day when both parties bid each other good bye on the most friendly terms A few days more of travel brought Kit Carson and his men to the first Mexican settlement which then stood in their road Their arrival in the town happened very opportunely having for the past few days been suffering severely from hunger They had started from California with but a small stock of dried meat and corn not being able conveniently to carry more without impeding their progress therefore they were left to depend on their rifles Game they found to be scarce and in a short time their meat was expended Being reduced to the corn they were as a matter of necessity very sparing of it The maize was parched and for several days they derived their entire subsistence from it though on account of the short allowance they but poorly satiated their appetites About the time succor appeared to them in the shape of this Mexican town even the maize was nearly used up They were delighted to reach a place where they would be able to replenish their provisions It was well known to their commander that as a dernier resort he could kill and live upon his riding animals but in so doing he would cripple his means so much that the business he was on might prove a failure While so much depended on it he felt that he ought not to leave any other means untried before resorting to such a procedure It was true the Mexicans at that time were at war but there were scattered over New Mexico in almost every town former friends of Kit Carson who would he felt confident serve him in the hour of trial At the first ranche they came to they halted and made a rest of two or three days while Kit employed himself in purchasing supplies in which he succeeded beyond even his expectations It was while obeying instructions in traveling as fast as possible that one day the sixth of October eighteen forty six the party discerned something which at first looked like a mere speck moving on the prairies Watching it with intense anxiety the little speck increased in size until they saw it emerge as it were from the apparent junction of the heavens with the earth and form a visible line as the front of this column came nearer to view they discovered that it was a strong detachment of United States troops The truth was now evident to them all that this was an expedition sent out by government to operate in California Spurring on their animals Kit and his men soon met the advance guard of the soldiers and learned that their commander was general Kearney who was further back in the lines On coming to the general Kit Carson reported himself informed him of the business he was on and also furnished him with all the intelligence in his power in reference to the disposal of the American forces in California besides detailing to him what had already been accomplished in that quarter After due deliberation general Kearney determined to send mister Fitzpatrick on to Washington with the dispatches and to order Kit Carson to join him as guide In fulfilling this duty he well knew that Kit would be invaluable to him Acting on this decision he sent for Kit Carson and informed him of what he wished him to do Kit Carson replied As the general thinks best The fact was that Kit well knew he could be of great service to the command and he was too honest not to confess it though he was now nearly in reach of his happy home and its loved inmates from whom he had been so long separated and whom he fondly wished to see In facing about Kit took upon his shoulders the prospect of encountering fearful dangers but he undertook his new duties without allowing a murmur to escape his lips and without even asking additional pay though had he but mentioned it the general could not have well refused the demand A noble motive engrossed Kit Carson s mind He has ever labored to win and wear the confidence and respect of his countrymen being ambitious to leave a name behind him that shall be an honor to his friends and family On the eighteenth day of October eighteen forty six General Kearney and his command left the Rio Del Norte in New Mexico The services of Kit Carson in directing the route proved the wisdom of General Kearney in making the change in the bearers of dispatches So true was Kit Carson s guidance that the command traveled with so much dispatch as to reach Warner s Ranche in California on the third day of December following From this place it took up a line of march for San Diego While on their march news was brought in by their spies that a strong command of Mexican Californians had taken up a position on their route evidently awaiting their advance with the view of attacking them This occurred on the sixth day of the same month General Kearney made no change in his route but advanced to within fifteen miles of the enemy s encampment Here he commanded a halt A reconnoitering party consisting of fifteen dragoons commanded by Lieutenant Hammond was sent on in advance to note the position and force of the enemy He proceeded upon the duty but was discovered by the Mexicans Nevertheless he fortunately succeeded in making his observations previous to being seen His report to General Kearney among other facts stated that these Mexican soldiers had strongly established themselves in an Indian village General Kearney determined without delay to attack them Orders were given to resume the march and by one o clock the next morning the American soldiers had fastened all their packs on their mules and were themselves mounted and ready for the command to move The order came without delay and the little army was immediately in motion Fourteen miles of the space which separated the two parties were passed without interruption When within one mile of the Mexican position the advance guard of the Americans suddenly came upon a small advance guard of the Mexicans who were evidently posted to watch their approach and guard the road As soon as they were discovered the trumpets of the dragoons sounded in quick succession the orders to trot and to gallop The Americans were so prompt in making their charge that they came upon the Mexicans when a sharp skirmish ensued in which several of the enemy were killed The remainder of the outpost were driven in bearing the news of the attack to their friends Captain Johnson Kit Carson and fifteen American soldiers formed the attacking party in this affair They had been ordered to secure the loose animals belonging to the enemy In this they failed the animals being too strongly guarded and because upon the first alarm they were driven out of harm s way This attack however proved to be the commencement of a serious fight Seeing that his orders could not be obeyed in regard to the animals of the enemy Captain Johnson and his party joined a party under Captain Moore The force of the latter consisted of twenty five American volunteers from California who had attached themselves to General Kearney s command since its arrival in the country Moore s command also comprised parts of two companies of United States dragoons Captain Moore had been ordered to make an attack on the centre of the enemy in order to cut their forces in two and thereby cause confusion in their ranks As has been stated Captain Johnson with his little force joined Captain Moore in making this attack While the charge was in progress and when within one hundred yards of the Mexican camp Kit Carson s horse occupying a leading position in the column of attack accidentally fell and threw his rider with such force as to break the wood part or stock of his rifle into several pieces rendering it useless His position for a short time was precarious Being foremost in the charge when the accident happened the whole troop of horse came galloping over him as he lay upon the ground His escape was almost a miracle When the last horseman had passed Kit arose and was quite happy to find that he had received only slight contusions which did not in the least impair his movements or strength of body Casting a hasty glance over the field he discovered a dead dragoon not far distant from the spot where he himself had fallen Instantly running up to the poor fellow he relieved him of his gun and cartridge box Being once more armed he rushed forward at the top of his speed and plunged into the thickest of the fight which was then severely contested Captain Johnson and several of the more advanced soldiers had been killed by the bullets of the enemy almost at the same instant that Kit Carson s horse had fallen It is not at all unlikely therefore that the accidental falling of his horse had been the means of saving Kit Carson s life After a desperate and deadly conflict Moore and his men dislodged the enemy causing them to retreat They were followed by the Americans but unfortunately for their complete success the large majority of the latter were mounted on mules These when the firing commenced became almost unmanageable But forty of the entire command of General Kearney were mounted on horses and these were none the best for cavalry purposes having been but recently broken to the saddle They had been captured since the arrival of the American forces in the country from a party of Mexicans who were en route to Sonora by Lieutenant Davidson and twenty five dragoons assisted by Kit Carson By the uncontrollable actions of the stubborn mules Moore s men became greatly separated and could not act in concert This rendered the pursuit so far as the enemy was concerned nearly harmless The Mexicans quickly perceiving the condition of their assailants and comprehending the chances which the apparent difficulty gave them at once rallied and turned on their pursuers The fight was renewed with most determined courage The Mexicans fought with a bravery and success which turned the hitherto comparatively speaking bloodless victory of the Americans into a terrible slaughter Every moment saw some brave dragoon yield up his life to the deadly bullets or blows of the exasperated Mexicans Out of the forty dragoons who were mounted on horses thirty six were either killed or severely wounded Among the names to be added to the sad list already killed was Captain Moore as brave a man says Kit Carson as ever drew breath in any service As fast as the scattered American soldiers could reach the scene of carnage they joined in the battle but the Mexicans elated by their success fought like demons and seemed to sweep everything before them General Kearney seeing his officers thus shot down drawing his sword placed himself at the head of his remaining forces and though severely wounded he made a desperate attempt to cause the enemy once more to retreat At this crisis of affairs Lieutenant Davidson arrived on the ground with two mountain howitzers Before he could get his guns unlimbered and ready to commence firing nearly every man he had to work them was shot down being either killed or badly wounded Following up their success the Mexicans charged right up to the guns and with the lasso unerring in their hands captured the horses attached to and on the instant made off with one of the guns On reaching a distance of three hundred yards they halted and prepared to turn the fire of the howitzer upon the Americans From some unaccountable reason it would not go off Lieutenant Davidson did his utmost to prevent the loss of this gun and after several narrow escapes from dangerous lance wounds as his clothing and saddle sufficiently attested he was finally stricken down and nearly gave his life a sacrifice to his heroism After being thus badly cut up and with not more than one or two officers left who had not been either killed or wounded while the men had been handled with equal severity the Americans were obliged to take refuge at a point of rocks which chanced to be near where their advance had been defeated A rally was made at this place The Mexicans however did not venture to attack them Both sides were apparently weary of fighting for that day The firing ceased and soon after night closed over the scene of the battle field These California Mexicans previous to the war with the United States were considered by the mountaineers as the bravest Spanish blood in the Mexican provinces During the war they proved that they had not been over estimated as they met their foes at the commencement of hostilities with a determination to win or sell their lives dearly The reason of this difference of courage in their favor over their countrymen who inhabited the internal States is supposed to be owing to their opportunities for intercourse with the bold mariners from different countries who visited them in ships for the purpose of trade This commerce consisted in the transporting into the country of such articles as arms ammunition groceries and dry goods for which were bartered hides tallow and furs The currency of California at that time was hides which were estimated as so many dollars The raising of cattle and horses was the leading employment of the people and occupied most of their time On the discovery of gold these affairs underwent a change and the rapid strides of civilization has left this people far in the minority The horses of California were celebrated as being larger than the ponies of New Mexico and also for being much fleeter of foot The California rider at that time was looked upon as being unrivaled by those who had witnessed his performances However the intercourse between the two countries was very limited among the Mexicans and it was difficult to find a New Mexican who had seen the Pacific Their dialects were also slightly different as much so as happens in the dependencies of any other country It was fear of the Indians that put a damper on the travel between these adjoining districts The society of the man who had had the boldness to make a journey to California from New Mexico was courted he being considered a renowned traveler His amusing stories of large ships and the men who managed them and also of the great expanse of the ocean amazed his auditors and made them deeply interested in his conversation and information It has become a strange sight to look upon whole communities of men who have only heard of steamboats telegraphs railroads and other great improvements and inventions of the age yet there are thousands of men living in the great interior of the North American continent who have only vague ideas of these things and many there are who cannot realize them but believe that they are fabulous stories and will meet the narrator of them with equal wonders which they manufacture to suit the occasion To give a specimen we remember one night to have tried to explain these advancements to an old Mexican of some eighty winters while we were the guest of his house He listened attentively but evidently could comprehend but little that we said We changed the subject and began to describe to him the great beasts of the forest such as the lion the tiger and the elephant and soon found that we had struck the theme which pleased him In reply he told us that in his younger days he himself was a famous hunter and that on one occasion while on the chase he met Adam who he informed us was the greatest hunter of his age We were somewhat surprised to hear this old man thus annihilate time and space but not more so than when we heard him relate the conversation that passed between himself and Adam It was both short and sweet The Mexican demanded of Adam what was the particular game he was seeking in these parts and the reply was deer He said that he wished to kill a few choice bucks in order to get their skins to clothe Eve with and hence he had come to the Rocky Mountains The flavor of this yarn was so good I attempted to try the old man on another adventure by asking him if he ever by chance in his travels met the Evil One Immediately he informed me that at one time that gentleman lived in a salt marsh which is to be found in the valley of San Louis The object of his staying there was to watch a very fine band of horses which he was raising near by The Indians and Mexicans one day determined to deprive Satan of his stock and arranged things accordingly but on coming upon the horses they were surprised to find that they could not overtake them and that the horses ran directly into the swamp and vanished by easily sinking out of sight While looking for a path that led into this marsh they were all at once scared nearly out of their senses by seeing the devil raise himself up in the midst of the bog The sequel was that the Mexicans and their Indian friends retreated as fast as possible and never stopped until they had reached a place of safety My companions became vexed to think any man could perpetrate such a story on travelers who considered they knew a thing or two and commenced quizzing the old gentleman by asking him what the Indians knew of Satan but the old Mexican evaded the answer by taking down the little wooden cross which hung on the wall of the room and expressed the desire to confirm the truth of his story by swearing to it this of course was said to be entirely unnecessary From it we had learned the lesson never to try to impress on the minds of the ignorant too weighty matters This is true with the Indian also for he is incredulous of anything beyond the grasp of his own mind which fact is illustrated by the following incident An American had some business to transact with a certain band of Indians who were celebrated as being very treacherous Being a bold man he thought he would beard the lions in their den and accordingly traveled alone to where the band was located but instead of being received with open arms as he expected he was made a prisoner and so held until it could be decided what was to be done with him At last a council was formed before which he was to be tried The first question asked by the head chief was How do your white people get gunpowder The reply was instantaneous We sow it in a peculiar soil and it grows up like wheat This was responded to by a grunt from the examiner A pause ensued when the chief looked the captive full in the eyes and thus addressed him Know you young man that the Great Spirit came into our camp this morning and after resting a short time he took yonder large hill and placed it on the top of its fellow and after leaving it there two hours he returned it to its former site He then bid his Indian children good bye Young man your tongue is split one fork is for telling lies and the other is for telling truths This was enough to convince the white man that he had made a mistake and that if he had attempted to presume on too much knowledge his scalp might soon be dangling on some lodge pole The Indians admired the brave and manly course he had pursued in coming to them single handed and this with the importance of the business he came on saved his life The California Mexicans were so remote from their capital that although they acknowledged their allegiance to the general government yet they were accustomed in many things to act with great independence Whenever a governor was sent to them who would not conform to their rules and regulations or made himself in the least obnoxious he was immediately placed on board ship with orders to take himself out of the country as fast as possible which he never failed to obey in order to save his life Attempts were made by the home department to make them suffer for these disobediences of the general laws but in all of these contests the Californians came out victorious and hence they believed they were beyond the power of being vanquished They were taught differently by the Americans These few cursory remarks will serve to show the reader that General Kearney had no despicable foe to overcome and subdue His care now was to attend to the wounded There was no rest for his command that night as during the hours of darkness his men were busy interring their dead and looking after the wants of the sufferers A sharp look out also was kept on the movements of the enemy who were continually receiving reinforcements A council of war was held in the American camp when general Kearney after taking the advice of his remaining officers decided to move on early in the morning with the hope of meeting reinforcements He had dispatched three men as bearers of dispatches to Commodore Stockton at San Diego before the battle but whether they had been successful or not in reaching the commodore the general did not know Just before the late fight they had returned to within sight of their friends when they were taken prisoners by the Mexicans The order of the march on the following day was as follows Kit Carson with a command of twenty five men proceeded in the advance while the remainder of the now very much crippled band of soldiers followed after on the trail made by their guide Steadily and compactly these brave men moved forward being continually in expectancy of a charge from the enemy who would show themselves from time to time on the neighboring hills and then again for a time disappear During the previous day a Mexican lieutenant had his horse shot from under him and he himself had been taken prisoner On a favorable opportunity occurring General Kearney ordered the halt to be sounded when through a flag of truce he asked a parley It being granted he succeeded in making an exchange of the lieutenant for one of his expressmen He gained nothing by this for the man stated that he and his companions had found it impossible to reach their point of destination and hence they had turned back The manoeuvering on the part of the Mexicans which we have alluded to as consisting of making temporary stands on the hills and then changing their positions as the Americans drew near to them continued for the greater part of the day Finally as general Kearney and his men were approaching the water where they intended to camp and were not over five hundred yards from it down came the Mexicans divided into two separate commands for the purpose of making a charge They were at first warmly received by the Americans who after a time were obliged to give way to superior numbers but in doing so they retreated in good order to a hill about two hundred yards to their left Here they halted and determined to decide the battle but the wary Mexicans on seeing the strength of the position taken by their foes declined to attack them and drew off to a neighboring height from which they commenced and maintained a deadly fire on the Americans Captains Emery and Turner with all the available dragoons were sent to dislodge them This they did in splendid style after a sharp encounter and when their companions saw them take possession of this position General Kearney with all his wounded and luggage trains joined them there Here a permanent resting place for the time being was made In fact the men had no other choice as they were now pretty effectually used up from fighting severe loss and fatigue The Americans found on this hill water barely sufficient for their own use and were obliged to exclude the idea of sharing it with their animals Although within sight of abundance of this much needed article yet they did not dare to drive the latter to it for they were too weak to defend them from the assaults of the enemy The situation of general Kearney s force was now critical in the extreme as besides the dangers that surrounded him the men were reduced to living on their mules That afternoon another council of war was called at which desperate efforts to be made for immediate relief were discussed When every spark of hope had almost died within them and when they were in a dilemma as to what still remained for them to do Kit Carson was found to act as the reader has previously seen him act to parties almost similarly situated the right man in the right place Rising to his feet he addressed a few simple words to those present saying that he was willing to make the attempt of creeping through the Mexican lines Should he succeed he pledged his word that he could carry information to Commodore Stockton at San Diego and thus bring them succor No sooner had he made this proposition than he was seconded by Lieutenant Beale then of the United States Navy who equally as brave and daring as Kit Carson volunteered his services in the undertaking This gentleman since the time he first turned landsman up to the present date has been adding fresh laurels to his fame His recent career in exploring new routes across the great western girdle of prairies and mountains is so well known through his valuable and interesting reports as not to require recapitulation at our hands His life has been one series of rare adventures while to the scientific world he has proved a valuable acquisition To the United States Government his services are inestimable and as an explorer he has but few equals General Kearney at once accepted the noble and generous offers of these two men knowing that if he waited until the following day and then attempted to leave the hill the consequences would be most disastrous for in so doing a sanguinary battle must certainly ensue with the chances greatly against him Having made the few preparations necessary Kit Carson and Lieutenant Beale waited the setting in of night under the cover of which they had both resolved to succeed in the performance of their mission or die in the attempt Having got well under way and while stealthily crawling over the rocks and brush they found their shoes would often even with the greatest preventive care being taken strike against the various impediments to their progress and make sounds which might lead to their detection To avoid this they took them off and pushed them under their belts Slowly but surely they evaded the vigilant guard of the Mexican sentinels who they found to be mounted and three rows deep evidently being determined not to be eluded So near would they often come to these Mexican sentinels that but a few yards would measure the distance between them and their enemies yet with brave hearts they crept along over the ground foot by foot they were almost safe beyond these barriers when all their hopes came near being dashed to pieces This alarm was caused by one of the sentinels riding up near to where they were dismounting from his horse and lighting by his flint and steel his cigarretto On seeing this Kit Carson who was just ahead of Lieutenant Beale pushed back his foot and kicked softly his companion as a signal for him to lie flat on the ground as he Carson was doing The Mexican was some time being apparently very much at his leisure in lighting his cigarretto and during these moments of suspense so quietly did Kit Carson and his companion lie on the ground that Carson said and still affirms that he could distinctly hear Lieutenant Beale s heart pulsate Who can describe the agony of mind to which these brave hearts were subjected during this severe trial Everything the lives of their friends as well as their own so hung on chance that they shuddered not at the thought of dying but for fear they would fail in accomplishing what was dearer to them than life the rescue of the brave men whose lives hung on their success After quite a long time the Mexican as if guided by the hand of Providence mounted his horse and made off in a contrary direction from the one where these bold adventurers were biding their time to accept either good if possible or evil if necessary from the wheel of fortune For a distance of about two miles Kit Carson and Lieutenant Beale thus worked along on their hands and knees Continually during this time Kit Carson s eagle eye was penetrating through the darkness ever on the alert to discover whatever obstacle that might present itself on which was stamped the least appearance of danger Having passed the last visible image in the shape of a sentinel and left the lines behind them at a suitable distance both men regained their feet and once more breathed freely Their first thought was to look for their shoes but alas they were gone In the excitement of the journey they had not given them a thought since depositing them beneath their belts Hardly a word had hitherto passed between these two companions in danger but now they spoke hurriedly and congratulated each other on the success that so far had attended them and thanked God in their hearts that He had so mercifully aided them There was no time for delay as they were by no means yet free from danger though they thought that the worst was over Kit Carson was familiar with the country and well knew the necessity of avoiding for fear of being discovered all the well trodden trails and roads which led to San Diego every one of which was closely watched by the enemy He chose a circuitous route over rocks hills and wild lands The soil was lined with the prickly pear the thorns of which were penetrating at almost every step deep into their bare feet which owing to the darkness and the thickness of the plants they could not avoid The town of San Diego was located many miles in a straight line from the point from whence they had started but by the round about route they were obliged to travel this distance was much lengthened All the following day they continued their tramp and made as much progress as possible Their mental excitement kept them in good spirits though from previous fatigue the want of food during this time and by the rapid pace at which they were traveling they were putting their physical powers to their full test Another night closed in around them yet ONWARD was their watchword for they thought not of rest while those behind them were in such imminent peril Kit Carson s only compass was his eye which served him so well that soon the dark outlines of the houses of San Diego could just be discerned Both men were ready to leap with joy They were challenged by the American sentinels about the town and answered in pure English Friends which same English was unmistakable proof to the guard from whence they came On stating their important business they were conducted into the presence of Commodore Stockton to whom they related what we have tried to describe Commodore Stockton with his usual promptitude immediately detailed a command of about one hundred and seventy men to make forced marches in order to reach and relieve their besieged countrymen With as much dispatch as possible this force set out taking with them a piece of heavy ordnance which for want of animals the men themselves were obliged to draw by attaching ropes to it Kit Carson did not return with them for it was considered that he had seen service enough for the present besides his feet were badly swollen and inflamed from the rough usage they had recently been obliged to submit to He graphically described the position of general Kearney so that the relief party could have no difficulty in finding him He remained to recruit in San Diego though had the commodore expressed the least wish to have Kit Carson return every man who knows him can bear witness with me that he would have been the last person to object so long as there was life in his body Unused then to such hardships and mental excitements on land as was his more experienced companion Lieutenant Beale from the trials of the service performed became partially deranged and for treatment was sent on board the frigate Congress which ship lay in the harbor being one of the vessels attached to the commodore s fleet Two long years elapsed before the gallant lieutenant fully recovered from the effects of this adventure which for the bravery and unselfishness evinced in its planning and the boldness with which it was carried out without mentioning the good results it produced was not excelled by any one feat performed during the Mexican War Better than all had these two men known previously the poor rewards which were afterwards to be bestowed upon them by their government for this heroic deed I hesitate not in saying that it would have had no effect in changing their purpose The reinforcements sent out to meet General Kearney by traveling both by day and night soon reached and released him without coming in contact with the enemy They kept a bright look out and were early apprised through their spies of what was transpiring among the Americans hence as the naval brigade drew near they retreated The road being now clear General Kearney with his soldiers and the marines marched on to San Diego where his wounded men were comfortably housed and received the attentions of skillful surgeons CHAPTER XII A Command of Six Hundred Men is sent against Los Angelos The Mexican Army evacuates the Town Its Capture Rumors of an Attack to be made on Fremont s Command The Mexicans surrender The Winter Quarters Kit Carson is ordered to carry Dispatches overland to Washington Lieutenant Beale accompanies him A Night Attack made by the Indians Arrival in the United States Kit Carson s Introduction to colonel Benton and missus Fremont Hospitality offered to him at Washington Kit Carson receives the Appointment of Lieutenant in the Rifle Corps of the U S Army from President Polk He is ordered to carry Dispatches to California The Journey A Brush with the Camanche Indians Arrival at Santa Fe More trouble with hostile Indians Arrival at Los Angelos Dispatches delivered Kit Carson is assigned to do Duty with the Dragoons Is ordered to Guard Tajon Pass The Winter spent there Is ordered again to carry Dispatches to Washington The Journey and its Adventures The return to New Mexico One month elapsed before the forces of the United States that were concentrated at San Diego were entirely recruited and in fine trim for taking the field again At the expiration of this time a command of six hundred men was detailed for the purpose of capturing Los Angelos The commanding officers of this force were General Kearney and Commodore Stockton At Los Angelos was assembled the main strength of the Mexicans then in California the number of their fighting men was about seven hundred Towards this town the Americans took up their line of march and in the course of a few days they arrived within fifteen miles of it The Mexican forces had taken a strong position on a hill near by where they had pitched their tents and strongly fortified their camp Between the Americans and the enemy s camp ran a small river It was decided to postpone the attack until the following day Early the next morning General Kearney ordered two pieces of artillery to be brought to bear upon the Mexican position The guns were so well and successfully served that the Mexicans were forced to break up their camp As soon as this state of things became apparent General Kearney and Commodore Stockton crossed the river and marched on the town On entering Los Angelos they found that it had been evacuated by the Mexicans and that only a few stragglers remained in or near the place From some of these they learned that the retreating army had gone to attack colonel Fremont who with a force of four hundred Americans collected in Monterey was also on the march for Los Angelos It turned out afterwards that the Mexicans succeeded in finding colonel Fremont but for unknown reasons failed to give him battle as they had boasted they would but instead they gave him the preference over the other American commanders by surrendering to him colonel Fremont continued his journey and finally reached Los Angelos where he and all the officers and men heretofore spoken of as engaged in this campaign rested for the winter and managed to pass the time very agreeably considering their remote position Carson who had for a great length of time been rendering valuable services to Kearney rejoined Fremont when that officer arrived in town and once more enrolled himself on his old commander s muster roll We have said that the cold and dreary winter days were passed at Los Angelos as agreeably and happily as the circumstances of the case would permit This is only true to a certain extent It was at Los Angelos and during this winter that the seeds of discord were first sown between the rival commanders and the plot carefully laid which finally led to Colonel Fremont s court martial Rank with its green eyed monster jealousy which is ever watching with a restless and caustic determination to snatch from the subaltern his hard earned laurels was actively at work during these winter months By the programme cut and dried the ambitious young soldier who was nobly breasting the conflicts against the enemies of his country was to be summarily put down and his career quickly guillotined These ungenerous plans had their birth and were carefully fostered at Los Angelos but the wise decrees of the American people ever just in the cause of truth although tardy came at last to the rescue and stamped the course with its approval and complete indorsement which had led the bold Explorer to unfurl the standard of his country over the modern El Dorado In this view the course of the Mexican forces at Los Angelos in surrendering their swords to Colonel Fremont becomes significant A brave though fallen enemy seldom fails to admire a heroic chivalrous and discreet victor The choice here plainly indicated between Colonel Fremont and General Kearney we repeat is sufficiently significant In Colonel Fremont the fallen chieftains of the brave Californian Mexicans discerned all the qualities which make up true nobility of character Many of the men under him were well known to the Mexicans as being upright honorable and generous For many years they had lived among them Hence we discover the reason of their preference in laying down their arms in their presence Kit Carson took no active part in these unhappy differences but his simple action in leaving General Kearney s command and reenlisting under his old commander shows plainly to a discerning public that he could not be alienated from his friend by acts of injustice It also spoke more significantly than words that he adjudged his friend to have performed in behalf of his country meritorious actions and a great service Such was Kit Carson s view and no man was capable of forming a better judgment in the premises than he As an occupant of an inferior rank he then kept his counsel to himself the time has at last arrived when he should fully and appropriately express his opinion though that opinion he is well aware has been rendered entirely unnecessary by the honorable mention since attached to the name of Fremont by the highest officer in the American service by the recommendation to the President of the officers of the court to commute the sentence and by the President of the United States in appointing unsolicited the court martialed Conqueror of California to the high and important trust of commissioner to run the boundary line between the United States and Mexico and finally by the spontaneous outburst of enthusiasm which greeted the name of John C Fremont from around the firesides of the American people when his name was placed at the head of one of the great political parties of the nation It is not for or against regulations that these remarks are directed The transactions with which they deal have not been forgotten They are recorded as historical facts and as such are always open for investigation or deductions In the month of March eighteen forty seven Kit Carson was ordered to carry important dispatches to the war department at Washington Lieutenant Beale who was still a great invalid was permitted to accompany him In order to show the regard which Kit Carson entertained for this brave officer and also to portray to the reader the goodness of heart which has ever been the actuating impulse in all of Kit Carson s actions we will give his own words in relating this part of his adventures He says Lieutenant Beale went with me as bearer of dispatches intended for the Navy Department During the first twenty days of our journey he was so weak that I had to lift him on and off of his riding animal I did not think for some time that he could live but I bestowed as much care and attention on him as any one could have done under the circumstances Before the fatiguing and dangerous part of our route was passed over he had so far recovered as to be able to take care of himself For my attention which was only my duty to my friend I was doubly repaid by the kindness shown to me by his family while I staid in Washington which was more than I had any reason for expecting and which will never be forgotten by me On the river Gila Kit Carson s party was attacked by Indians during the night while they were encamped These savages threw a good round number of arrows into the midst of his men which however did no damage as early in the commencement of the assault he had directed them to hold up before them their pack saddles behind which they could pretty securely conceal themselves while lying upon the ground He also directed the men not to talk lest they should indicate their positions It was very dark and the Indians from the above precautions being taken were frustrated in their plans His men lay very still and having previously received the order so to do they awaited the near approach of the red men when they were to use their rifles as clubs The reason which made this latter command best was because no man could see to shoot hence were they to fire at random they would only expend their ammunition a loss they were in no situation to sustain However the Indians became weary of their shooting after a few hours and did not hazard a close attack but went away to parts unknown Kit Carson and Lieutenant Beale arrived at Washington in the following June having accomplished their journey overland a distance of nearly four thousand miles in about three months a record which shows that they had not been idle while on the route With the exception of the Indian attack sustained on the Gila they were not again annoyed by the red men although over the vast tract of wild territory which they had traversed there roam thousands of savages who often for the slightest pretext and frequently without any reason whatever will murder the unsuspecting traveler as it chances to please them Hence to accomplish this journey it was not only necessary to know the direction to shape their course but also to be familiar with the haunts and habits of these various tribes in order to avoid them All of this knowledge Kit Carson the mainspring of this little party was well possessed of and as a matter of business guided himself and men in a direct and safe course The hardships and privations of this trip were trivial affairs when compared to most of Kit Carson s previous adventures and not considered by him as worthy of mention Indeed Kit Carson appears so hardened in all kinds of vicissitudes that a man in his eyes must have stood on the brink of death before he has seen much real suffering but probably if the reader had been one of the members of this party he would unless equally experienced in Western frontier life have considered that he had seen something of the world and the rough side of it at that It requires no small amount of courage and determination to start out with but a handful of men to perform the difficult and dangerous task of threading the American continent from tide to tide even at the present epoch but eleven years ago there were few men living who had ever performed or were able to perform the feat at all much less with the certainty and speed which lay within the power and experience possessed by Kit Carson In describing these trips he now speaks of them as lightly as a man would after making a journey of a few hundred miles in a railroad car He seems to have acted with the idea that this duty was expected of him and it required but the official orders to send him bounding over the country without regard to obstacles or dangers His final object was his destination which on reaching he was ready to quit at a moment s warning with as much sang froid as a Russian courier possesses when doing his master s bidding Yet so cautious is he when traveling that at first to a new companion he often appears to be wanting in courage Not a bush a tree a rock or any other hiding place on his path escapes his notice Towards the heavens in search of smoke ascending from or crows as they hover about Indian encampments which are deserted or for ravens and back again to the earth on the look out for moccasin or horse tracks his eyes are continually turning There is a nervous action about the man that shows he is ever alive to meet and be ready for any emergency These traits are sure to instill confidence in his followers On starting from Los Angelos Kit Carson took but a few rations of provisions with him as he could not burden the few animals he had too heavily hence he was compelled to depend on the rifle and the chances of meeting with game This of course is always an uncertain mode of supporting life and consequently it not unfrequently happened that the party were out of food and went fasting yet not a murmur was heard On they sped in the hopes of reaching their homes and firesides where kind friends were awaiting them and where their cares and troubles would be buried in the past and appear like dreams In the breast of the leader of this expedition there was throbbing a heart that was anxious to do its duty well for he was approaching not his family circle but instead the fireside of strangers to whom he was only known by name Yet in the common cause of his country s honor he recognized in every American with whom he came in contact his true friend and therefore he also was very happy as he neared Washington There he looked confidently forward to hear the words Well done thou good and faithful servant At saint Louis Kit Carson had the honor of an introduction to the honorable Thomas H Benton who was greatly interested in him and who kindly invited him to make his house in Washington his home during his stay there Of this invitation Kit Carson availed himself and since considers that he was very fortunate in doing so for the best of everything was heaped upon him while he enjoyed the satisfaction of meeting and conversing with the great men of his country missus John C Fremont daughter of Colonel Benton and wife of the distinguished explorer was in attendance at the railroad depot when the train of cars in which Kit Carson was traveling arrived in Washington It was quite late in the evening when he reached the terminus of his journey yet notwithstanding this Kit had hardly landed on the platform of the depot before he was addressed by a lady who said that she knew him from her husband s descriptions of him and that he must accept the hospitalities of her father s house The distinguished father in law of John C Fremont became from the time of their first meeting in saint Louis the warm friend and patron of Kit Carson and up to the time of his death he had no cause to change his first impressions of him There was not a friendly favor within his power which would not have been freely given had it been asked It is one thing to make a friend but another to keep him and those who knew the true character of mister Benton are cognizant of the fact that he was not easily won but when gained that he was true as steel as is beautifully illustrated by the able and devoted manner in which he stood by General Andrew Jackson It is indeed a valuable possession to know that one has friends who cannot be bought by wealth or other sordid attractions men who can discern through the rough garb of the working as well as thinking man those noble qualities which place them on a par This acquisition Kit Carson holds He easily makes a friend and never deserts him hence those with whom he comes in contact who are worthy of this name are enrolled on his side and he seldom has occasion to call a man his enemy Kit Carson was so embarrassed and overcome by the expressions of kindness and hospitality which greeted his first arrival at Washington that he could hardly essay a reply and yet he was almost too happy at the opportunity presented of accepting missus Fremont s invitation If there was anything wanted to cement Carson more firmly in his friendship and admiration for Colonel Fremont it was thus to know his accomplished and gifted lady The situation of Jessie Fremont has often been comparable with that of the noble hearted Lady Franklin Again and again has she been compelled to part from her husband when he started out to battle in the cause of science and in the words of the poet she seemingly said Go wondrous creature mount where science guides Go measure earth weigh air and state the tides Kit Carson remained some time in Washington but had it not been for the many tokens of kindness which he there received he would have grown weary of the restraints of civilization As it was he continually longed to be once more in the mountains and prairies His desire in time was granted for having received the appointment of lieutenant in the rifle corps of the United States army from President Polk he was ordered as bearer of dispatches to return across the continent from whence he had but recently come Lieutenant Beale had intended to return with him but did not eventually proceed any further than saint Louis There he became too ill to continue on the journey After arriving at Fort Leavenworth Kit Carson was furnished with an escort of fifty men who were volunteers in the war which was then being carried on against Mexico With his usual promptness and dispatch Kit Carson was soon under way crossing the plains At Leavenworth he had learned that the Camanche Indians were at war with the whites As he knew them to be a numerous and treacherous tribe he had taken this strong escort in order to give them battle if they should be anxious for it However he arrived at a place called the Point of Rocks which is not far from the Rocky Mountains and on their east side without discovering any signs of these Indians At this place they made their appearance The Point of Rocks appears to be a favorite place of resort for the Indians of the plains It is notorious as being one of the most dangerous places for the traveler in all the far West It is a series of continuous hills which project out on the prairies in bold relief They end abruptly in a mass of rocks out of which gushes a cold and refreshing spring which is the main attraction about the place The road winds about near this point and therefore it is a chosen spot for the Indians to lurk in order to catch the unwary pilgrim Several encounters with the savages have taken place here which has caused it to be pointed out as the scene of bloody tragedies thereby making it quite historical The Indians themselves have made this spot the stage on which has been enacted several desperate battles In making the journey to Santa Fe when these rocks are passed the traveler counts his march as being drawn to a close Government troops on the look out for Indians on the plains rarely fail when they come from New Mexico to give this place a visit Kit Carson had arrived at the place with his escort and was about establishing his camp His men were under orders to keep a vigilant watch for Indians while Kit Carson s restless eye was searching the country in every direction to discover their signs About three hundred yards distant he discovered white men and found there was encamped a company of United States volunteers under the command of Lieutenant Mulony With this company was a large train of wagons bound for New Mexico Kit Carson ordered his men to go into camp The night passed by without any signs of the Indians but early in the morning of the subsequent day as Lieutenant Mulony s men were leading out their animals to picket them in fresh grass the savages suddenly made their appearance and began an attack upon the picketing party capturing all their cattle and twenty six horses Mulony s men had left their rifles in camp and therefore in order to escape being killed they retreated to their wagons The cattle in the confusion which ensued turned and came towards Kit Carson s camp He and his men who were instantly on the alert made an unexpected charge upon the Indians and recaptured the oxen During the skirmish which ensued two of his men dismounted in order to be more certain of a deliberate aim but in so doing they accidentally let their own horses go loose and lost them as they ran away with those that were being stampeded by the red men In this affair three of the volunteers were wounded With the two horses lost by Kit Carson s men twenty eight riding animals belonging to the United States government were stolen by this band of Camanches But had it not been for Kit Carson and his men Lieutenant Mulony would have lost his cattle likewise Young oxen when stampeded are sometimes lost by the Indians When not killed by wolves they usually join with the herds of buffalo and soon become wild In this state they are represented as being quite fleet of foot More generally they fall a prey to the wolves and sometimes again into the hands of the savages A party was crossing the plains in the year eighteen fifty four the advance of the party sent back word that the first buffalo was in sight Many amateur hunters eagerly volunteered for the chase and soon quite a squad of men were traveling at a good round gallop towards the supposed game On approaching the game it was found to be an old lame ox which had been turned out by some caravan to die The disappointment which prevailed in this crowd of neophyte hunters on discovering this mistake can be better imagined than described The poor ox apparently had no idea of giving up the ghost quite yet He was in good health and spirits and showed signs of being pleased to see a white man again The little birds of the prairies had used him as a perch This office he appeared quite accustomed to perform for he did not disturb the flock that was then occupying his back How he had escaped the wolves is a miracle From signs discovered after the Indians had decamped it became evident that several of the thieves had been mortally wounded but being tied on their horses they were carried out of sight before they died This is a fair sample of many of the Indian fights which have occurred and are yet not unfrequent on the prairies the object of the savages is to plunder therefore an unguarded moment is selected for their attacks In this instance by the time the whites had got their firearms and men ready to commence the contest the Indians had perpetrated their intended assault and were off Illustration CAMANCHE WARRIOR The Camanches are excelled by no men in the world in their horsemanship not excepting the famous Cossacks of Europe The level prairies are beautiful fields for them to act on It is in a skirmish similar to the one we have endeavored to describe that they put these qualifications to the test The arena where these scenes are enacted is a very undesirable place for a mere spectator Kit Carson and party resumed their march the same day and arrived safely at Santa Fe without meeting with any other adventures At this town he left his escort of fifty volunteers and hired sixteen other men with which to perform the remainder of his journey This was in obedience to the orders he had received at Fort Leavenworth Pursuing his route on Muddy Creek a tributary of Virgin River he came upon a village of some three hundred Indians so suddenly as his route twisted about among the hills that he had to make a bold matter of it and go into camp for the purpose of having a talk Kit Carson had learned some time before that these very red men had massacred seven Americans For this reason he determined not to trust them even if they professed friendship The Indians wished to come into his camp but this privilege he would by no means grant to them He posted his men and selected a place so that he himself could talk and at the same time let them see that if the least hostile demonstration was made by their side it would be answered by a volley of bullets from the rifles of the white men Kit Carson harangued them and informed them that he knew of the murders they had committed on his people during the past year He told them that they bore a treacherous character and could not be treated as friends and wound up his discourse by adding that he would not allow himself to be deceived for he knew that their only object in gaining admission into his camp was to repeat their bloody acts He now gave them a limited period of time in which to be off at the expiration of which several lounged about apparently doubting his words He now gave the order to fire In consequence a few shots were aimed at them which killed one and wounded three or four others This had the tendency to hurry the movements of the remainder who retired from the dangerous proximity to his camp This was a case which required some nerve and great experience in the commander of the little party Nothing but the personal courage and promptness of Kit Carson saved his command The success of fifteen men against three hundred Indians in this manner is chiefly due to their commander The party proceeded on their journey but soon were troubled for food Having used up all the game they could find they were obliged to kill two mules on which they lived until they arrived at Los Angelos Kit Carson finding that the officers to whom he was ordered to deliver his dispatches were at Monterey journeyed thither and having reached that town in safety gave the documents to colonel Mason then of the First Regiment of United States dragoons who was in command Obeying orders Kit Carson now an acting lieutenant in the United States army returned to Los Angelos and was assigned to do duty in the company of United States dragoons commanded by Captain Smith Kit was allowed little time to recruit but his restless disposition did not ask nor his habits require it consequently he remained at Los Angelos only a short period With a command of twenty five dragoons he was ordered to proceed to Tajon Pass the main outlet through which hostile Indians went out of California bearing the proceeds of their incursions such as cattle horses sheep and captives Kit Carson s duty in this place was to intercept the Indians and examine their papers and cargoes He spent the winter in doing much good in this service In the spring he was again ordered to proceed overland to Washington with dispatches An escort being furnished him he was soon under way and had reached Grand River without encountering any serious difficulty At this place an accident happened to his party while crossing the river on rafts During the early part of summer the fording of streams which have their source in the Rocky Mountains is no safe or easy task When the sun and the warm south winds begin to melt the immense piles of snow and ice in the mountains the water comes tumbling down in torrents and having overflowed the rivers banks floods the adjacent country By this means new gullies and ravines are continually forming which when the melting process ceases are converted into dry beds With this rush of angry water large rocks and masses of earth are swept from their natural seat leaving a wreck behind that is fearfully grand to behold The roaring of these torrents as they come leaping past and over every obstacle resembles a low rumbling thunder which is reechoed through the deep forests and canons Sometimes travelers are compelled to wait weeks before these rivers fall sufficiently to allow a safe transit Heavy rains have the same effect to enlarge them and in one instance a body of soldiers while crossing the plains were overtaken by these rains which fell with such rapidity and in such quantity as to make the level prairies almost one sheet of water while every ravine was converted into a river swift and deep To cross these the men were obliged to use their best exertions with very poor means to guard against loss and even with the best care one man was drowned while several mules shared the same fate In the prospective construction of bridges for highroads and railroad tracks across the continent in certain seasons of the year this sudden accumulation and explosion of water may cause trouble by sweeping them suddenly away This accident crippled the resources of Kit Carson s party very much and caused them afterwards great suffering The accident occurred something after the following manner One division of the men with their leader as a companion had constructed a float of logs on which they had crossed the stream in safety but the second branch of the party under charge of Lieutenant Brewerton then of the United States army and who was traveling in company with Kit Carson were not so successful with their raft for no sooner did they get it into the swift current than it became unmanageable and finally precipitated its contents among which were included several of the men and their luggage into the water The wrecked men with great difficulty saved their lives by swimming to the shore from which they had started The day was far spent and no attempt to succor them could be made that evening so in their semi state of nudity and without the means of making a fire they passed a miserably cold night but early the next morning one of their friends recrossed and carried them an axe by the aid of which a new raft was made on which they embarked a second time and were soon safe with their companions Among the very useful articles that were lost by this mishap there were several saddles and six valuable rifles What made this loss peculiarly unpleasant was that they could not be replaced until the party could reach the settlements The owners of the saddles were now in a sad plight for neither to the rider or his horse is it a very pleasant prospect to make a long journey without these useful articles After repairing their damages as best they could they struck out afresh Setting aside hunger and the suffering experienced from exposure to cold they were not again incommoded in any way until they had come to the vicinity of the Mexican towns Here they met several hundred Utah and Apache Indians These red skins showed some warlike symptoms which Kit Carson did not in the least fancy but to make the best of his situation he ordered his men to post themselves in a neighboring thicket and be ready to act on the defensive Kit Carson then informed the Indians that they must keep at a proper distance or otherwise he would direct his men to fire into them He told them that if they were disposed to be friendly which they professed to be towards the white men they could show it by leaving and not annoying his party who being nearly naked and in a destitute condition could give them nothing Evidently the savages saw this was true and so did not hazard a fight but departed Kit Carson traveled that night ten miles further It was late in the day when he again ventured on the trail but this distance was all that his animals could accomplish without food and rest for they were fatigued and poor His object in thus resuming his march was to separate himself and men as far as he could from the Indians fearing that they might change their minds and conclude to attack him Being too weak his party was in no condition for an engagement At the end of this distance he fortunately met with a party of volunteers who had been out in search of these very savages in order that they might punish them for some rascality they had been recently guilty of The next day Kit Carson reached Taos where he allowed himself a short respite for the purpose of recruiting and also to have the pleasure of a visit to his family and friends These were privileges which during his life in the mountains had been seldom granted to him though his feelings of attachment for relatives and intimate acquaintances are not exceeded by those of any living man Indeed his love for his children is unbounded We have several times heard him assert that if there was any one thing that could make him a coward it would be the thoughts of his little ones When his party was sufficiently recruited Kit Carson left Taos and proceeded to Santa Fe At this time Colonel Newby of the Illinois Volunteers was in command of the United States forces stationed there This gentleman informed Kit Carson that his appointment as lieutenant made by President Polk was not confirmed by the United States Senate Many of Kit s friends on hearing this came to him and advised him not to carry the dispatches any further but instead they counseled him to deliver them to the commanding officer of the post he was at advising him that he was doing duty as an officer in the army and yet was not recognized by government The language used by Kit Carson on this occasion in reply to his friends is so much to his credit and is so like the man that every American citizen ought to know it It was as follows I was intrusted with these dispatches having been chosen in California from whence I come as the most competent person to take them through safely I would try to fulfill this duty even if I knew it would cost me my life It matters not to me while I am performing this service for my country whether I hold the rank of a lieutenant in the United States army or am known merely as an experienced mountaineer I have gained some little honor and credit for the manner in which I have always conducted myself when detailed on any special and important business and I would on no account now wish to forfeit the good opinion formed of me by a majority of my countrymen because the United States Senate did not deem it proper to confer on me an appointment which I never solicited and one which had I been confirmed I would have resigned at the termination of the war The reasons why the wishes of the President were not carried out by Congress in this instance we know not but certain it is that the lucky aspirant who eventually received this office at the hands of the same United States had no credentials to present that could as far as merit was concerned compare with those held by Christopher Carson It is fair to infer that Kit Carson had but few friends at court though it cannot for one moment be supposed that his name was not well known at Washington when for five long years he had been the right hand man of John C Fremont in his explorations The privates and the hardships which that commander and his guide willingly submitted to during those years it is impossible to describe through reports The whole newspaper press of the United States together with several volumes of well written books have attempted it but all have failed in giving a true picture of the reality These things availed nothing when brought in contact with political moves and Kit Carson was doomed to go by the board He had however met during his eventful life with too many disappointments to be much chagrined at this and we find him soon afterwards making inquiries in relation to the state of feeling among the Indians who inhabited the country through which he had to pass The appointment of civilians to the responsible duties of a command in the United States army has of late years become in many instances very unfortunate Perhaps it is this that has taught our legislators a lesson But there is a truth which lies above this difficulty The severe ordeal necessary to be gone through with at West Point in order to make military men of the proper standard has very naturally raised a jealousy between these two classes of men This is very healthy for the country as it stimulates each to noble exertions In order to make the army less secluded it is necessary to appoint a certain per centage of men from the walks of private life and therefore the most meritorious should be selected West Point men as a body are a great credit to our country and as a scientific corps they cannot be surpassed but the fact is incontrovertible that many if not most of the leading officers of the United States army are self educated and have risen to their exalted positions by untiring industry and distinguished services For frontier work men to be capable of taking command are required to have great experience in Indian strategy and to become accustomed to endure privations and vicissitudes These cannot be taught by schools or books For these positions those are best fitted who have been trained to the mountains from earliest boyhood and where is the man in North America who has battled in this service longer or more successfully than Christopher Carson But Kit Carson could see no reason why the votes of the United States Senators refusing to confirm the President s effort to reward him for his services to his country should cause him for one moment to swerve from his duty He pocketed at once his disappointment and went to work Colonel Newby informed him that the Camanches had of late been very hostile and that they were then roaming in war parties numbering from two to three hundred scattered along the old Santa Fe road on which their depredations had so far been mostly committed On learning this Kit Carson determined to make a trail of his own and endeavor thus to avoid them He reduced the number of his escort to ten trusty followers With them he returned to Taos and after a halt there of two days once more was on the march At first he traveled to the northward until he reached a tract of country which these Indians seldom visited then changing his route by compass he struck the Bijoux River which is a tributary of the Platte River and followed it down stream At about twenty five miles from the mouth of the Bijoux he quit that stream and struck out diagonally across the prairies and soon reached the Platte itself down which he journeyed to Fort Kearney Here he again changed his course for the Republican Fork On leaving this last named stream he traveled direct to Fort Leavenworth finally reaching that post with his men and animals in fine condition for the journey had been as pleasant as could have been expected Here he left his escort and set out alone for Washington After reaching the land of railroads and steamboats he was but a few days in bringing the latter part of his journey to an end Handing his dispatches to the proper authorities Kit Carson turned right about and made his way to New Mexico where he arrived in the month of October eighteen forty eight It will be seen by following on a map the route which Kit Carson planned on this occasion that it was very circuitous and led him a great distance out of his way Indeed he was at times far beyond the roaming grounds of the Camanches but this was necessary He was not however free from danger but was obliged to be on the lookout for their allies the Kiowas who are usually at war whenever the Camanche nation is His trail led him through a country which is celebrated as abounding in game and also in being well watered and last but not least the desideratum of finding grass of a good quality whenever he desired it was proved a valuable assistant on the march It may be well to mention here that one of the most curious of the phenomena of the plains to the inexperienced traveler are those mirages which on every clear day are sure to meet and delude his eyes So wonderful are these deceptions that often the vision leads one to believe he is beholding in the distance a beautiful city which is located on the banks of some attractive lake The outlines of the palaces spires of cathedrals and even the lesser buildings themselves all surrounded with trees bearing luxuriant and green foliage together form an imaginary picture which throws into the background any of the realities which are the work of man The shading is oftentimes very captivating and on it the traveler can be entertained for hours until a change in the rays of light or intervening clouds or else by approaching the delusion itself the magic scene fades away A mirage and a prairie on fire seen by night the one a delusion the other a fearful reality are two of the grandest sights to be seen in the far West we might add on the American continent CHAPTER XIII Kit Carson at his Home The Apache Indians become hostile An Expedition sent against them It is not successful Another is organized with which Kit Carson goes as Guide Two Indian Chiefs captured Other Incidents of the Trip Colonel Beall attempts to force the Indians to give up Mexican Captives Two thousand Savages on the Arkansas River The Visit to them Kit Carson emigrates and builds a Ranche at Rayado Description of the Valley The Massacre of a Santa Fe Merchant His Wife is made Prisoner The Expedition sent to rescue her The Indians overtaken Bad Counsel and Management The commanding Officer wounded missus White s Body found Severe Snow Storm on the Plains One Man frozen to Death Kit Carson returns to Rayado The occupation of a Farmer resumed The Apaches steal from the Settlers nearly all their Animals Kit Carson with thirteen others in the Pursuit The Surprise A running Fight The Animals recovered A gallant Sergeant and his Fate Kit Carson and Goodel go on a Trading Expedition to meet California Emigrants at Fort Laramie Humorous Adventures The Dangers that beset the Road to New Mexico Hair breadth Escape Arrival at Taos Being comfortably housed in his own pleasant home at Taos Kit Carson made up his mind to treat himself to a more lengthy stay there than he had for some time enjoyed While he was quietly enjoying the pleasures of home active operations were transpiring about him for the neighboring Indians had dug up the tomahawk and buried the calumet and were holding in defiance the United States forces which had been stationed in New Mexico to protect its inhabitants Colonel Beall was at that time commanding officer of the district and had established his head quarters at Taos The colonel soon after assuming the command being a resolute man saw that there was but one way to deal with these Indians and that was to bring them to a strict account and make them amenable for their many crimes This tribe of Apaches has given the government of the United States almost as much trouble as have the Seminoles in Florida and I hesitate not in saying that before they are exterminated which is the only sure plan of making a peace with them they will have surpassed their red brethren of the swamps of the South in the number and enormity of their crimes Before New Mexico came under the jurisdiction of the United States the Apaches for many years had committed all kinds of heinous offences against the Mexicans and for a period of ten years after that event these same savages were continually on the war path notwithstanding military expeditions one after another were organized and sent out against them Their mountain retreats are almost inaccessible to white men while the Indians apparently play about in them like rabbits The amount of physical endurance and the length of the journeys these red men can make appear very astonishing to one not accustomed to them The Apaches as an Indian race are not wanting in bravery the best evidence of which statement is that nearly all their warriors die in battle Their country is the healthiest in America Besides waging war against the whites and Mexicans they have their differences to settle with their neighboring tribes with whom they are punctilious in vindicating their national honor Colonel Beall commenced his operations against these Indians by dispatching a junior officer backed by a strong force with orders to pursue overtake and chastise them This expedition started but on coming to the mountains the guides reported that there was too much snow on them for the command to pass through in safety so the undertaking was given up and the men were marched back to Taos The most famous war chief of the Apaches during these troubles was called by the Mexicans Chico Velasques and his name for many years was a terror to the surrounding country His savage brutality knew no bounds and he was truly in his element only when he was tearing the bloody scalp from his half lifeless victim He was the sworn enemy of the Americans and Mexicans and his hunting knife was rarely clean of human blood until his cruel life by the wise decrees of an all seeing Providence was suddenly cut short He fought against his disease small pox with that rashness that had been his ruling spirit through life and thus ingloriously terminated his days The pride of this man was to strut through the Mexican towns and gloat over his many crimes To the gazing crowd he would point out the trophies of his murders which he never failed to have about him To his fringed leggins were attached the phalanges or finger bones of those victims whom he had killed with his own hands On the one side he proclaimed to his auditors were the fingers of the Mexicans while on the other were the same tokens from the Americans and it gave him great delight ironically to dwell upon the latter name With whip in hand he struck out right and left when anything displeased him He met one day more than his match in the person of the famous Mexican hunter Armador Sanchez of whom we have previously spoken The circumstances of this rencounter were as follows The bold Indian with but few followers was on a visit of pleasure to the Mexican town of Culebro He had agreed to a temporary peace to suit his convenience and ends and taking advantage of it he made his appearance in the settlements to lord it over the peaceable inhabitants After indulging in a little fire water his wicked propensities could be controlled no longer and broke forth in minor cruelties At last he found himself in the house belonging to Sanchez who was quietly conversing with his aged father for whom he had great veneration and also with his son The Indian peremptorily demanded that some whisky should be given him He was informed by Sanchez that he did not keep the article A second demand was now made with the threat that if it was not forthcoming immediately he would whip the person who refused him This had the effect of bringing Sanchez to his feet when the following colloquy in Spanish between him and the Indian transpired Chico Velasques you have long been accustomed to treat our people almost as you please You have robbed and murdered us at your will notwithstanding we have given you no cause thus to act Had you asked for bread I would have given it to you for the door of my house is always open to the friendly red man but as for whisky you can have none from my hands Raise that whip but once to strike me and I will dash your brains out with this mass of lead Suiting his actions to his words Sanchez drew forth from the pocket of his hunting shirt a slung shot that weighed nearly four ounces which he always carried to dispatch his game with when it was in the last agonies of death With uplifted hand the Indian hesitated for he knew the character of the man who stood before him as they had hunted together during many moons gone by on the same mountains and on the same trail At last using his own savage dialect in order that his words could not be understood by others about him the savage answered the Mexican hunter by saying that by chance they might some day meet again a threat which fell harmless at the feet of Sanchez As he took his departure the chief added in Spanish I will tell these things to my father twenty Kit Carson as if further attempting to intimidate the hunter but Sanchez knew that his own and Carson s opinions were the same in regard to this man therefore he smiled at the rascal s knavery Chico Velasques was followed in his chieftainship by Blanco who did his utmost to walk in the footsteps of his illustrious predecessor but he was not so cunning and was less successful in his encounters with the Americans and Mexicans and therefore had not that influence with his tribe which the former possessed Still he performed his quantum of mischief and yet lives to play his part in the great drama of Indian life An Apache Indian is rather small in stature but everything about him denotes symmetry and strength His limbs are almost straight and their muscles are as hard as iron The elasticity of his movements when in the least excited shows a high degree of physical training His coal black eye exhibits an amount of treachery rarely seen elsewhere proving the truth of the Chinese adage that the tongue may deceive but the eye can never play the rogue Footnote twenty This expression of father with these Indians means their agent But to return to the narrative The commanding officer of the party sent out against these Indians on arriving again at Taos reported to colonel Beall that the reason he had returned was because at the present time it was impracticable to cross the mountains That brave and experienced officer replied that there was no such word as impracticable in the soldier s vocabulary and that nothing ought to be impossible for the first regiment of United States dragoons to accomplish Suiting his actions to his words colonel Beall reorganized the command took charge of it himself and employed Kit Carson as his guide When everything was in proper trim this expedition set out and after surmounting many obstacles and privations finally accomplished the feat of crossing the snow clad mountains and after a long and fruitless search for the Indians the men were obliged to turn about because their stock of provisions was running low As the command emerged through the Sangre de Christo Pass on their return route they came suddenly into view of a village of Apaches As soon as the Indians were discovered the charge was sounded but the animals of the dragoons were too much jaded to obey the summons with the celerity wished for by their riders the result was that besides a considerable amount of plunder only two persons were taken but they fortunately proved to be no less than two important chiefs In order to impress these Indians with the fairness and liberality which his government wished to show to the red men after a long talk in which the colonel exacted promises of good behavior he let the prisoners go They departed to forget as quickly as possible all their vows and promises for seemingly they will act in no other way than as their own savage instinct teaches After this affair colonel Beall made a direct march for Taos where he remained for some time attending to the ordinary duties of his garrison In the treaty between the United States and New Mexico entered into at the close of the Mexican War a clause was inserted binding the former to turn over to the latter all the Mexican captives then held by the Indians who inhabited territory belonging to the first named government The carrying out of this provision of the treaty involved the United States government in a large and constant bill of expense This was undoubtedly unavoidable for even had the clause not been inserted in the treaty the maintenance of about the same frontier military forces would have been necessary It would have proved a difficult matter to carry out this treaty to the letter If it had been so carried out to the letter the Camanches would have been great sufferers for at least one third of the blood that now runs in their veins is Mexican During the last half century and perhaps longer they have been accustomed to make annual visits into the Mexican settlements of Old Mexico The object of these hostile incursions has ever been to load themselves with plunder They steal all the horses that fall in their way and also take for captives as many young children as they can lay hands on The latter are brought up in true Indian style and having cast off all remembrance of their former habits and friends they gradually become the wild men of the plains The female captives on arriving at the suitable age are married to the young warriors of the tribe and thus the true Indian stock becoming amalgamated with the Mexico Spanish blood is fast becoming degenerated The reason therefore why the fulfillment of this treaty would have militated strongly against the Camanche Indians especially is clearly apparent In the following February colonel Beall learned that on the Arkansas River there were congregated a large body of Indians who had quite a number of Mexicans in bondage He felt it to be his duty to visit these savages and endeavor to have them deliver up all such captives using peaceable means to accomplish this result in the first instance and should they fail he made up his mind to resort to more forcible and potent arguments With this determination and with two companies of dragoons to back him and Kit Carson as his guide he set out on his mission In due time he reached the Arkansas and there found congregated four tribes of Indians who numbered in the vicinity of two thousand souls Their object in thus coming together was to have a grand council and lay out plans for the future and also to meet their agent This agent who was an experienced mountaineer informed the colonel that considering the present state of ill feeling existing among these Indians towards the whites it would be useless to make the demand for the prisoners and as to using force it would almost certainly prove a failure when such a large number of well armed warriors were arrayed against him It required a great deal of persuasion to bring the colonel around to this mode of thinking but at last he yielded to the advice of his friends and concluded to make no demonstration against the Indians at the present time concluding as his anger cooled that it was the wisest policy to await a more favorable opportunity when a treaty could be made with them in which there could be an article inserted that would stipulate for the restoration of the captives In parting with these red men without accomplishing the main object for which they came both officers and men felt that their labors had not been entirely thrown away Their presence must have left lasting impressions on the minds of the savages in showing them that they no longer had poorly clad and poorly armed Mexican soldiers to deal with On arriving again in Taos Kit Carson returned to his home to ruminate over what was best for him to take up as a business for the future He revolved in his thoughts his past career and in the end finished the mental study by resolving to give up his roaming life as he rightly considered that now was the time if ever that he should be making a substantial home for himself and family before old age crept upon and disabled him from the undertaking About the time that he was in this frame of mind his old mountaineer friend Maxwell was about going to a pretty little valley called by the Mexicans Rayado Maxwell proposed to Kit Carson to join him in the enterprise of building a ranche on the site which he had selected This offer the latter gladly accepted Rayado would have long before been settled by the Mexicans had they not been deterred by its exposure and consequent inviting position for Indian depredations The valley is about fifty miles east from Taos and for its scenery cannot be surpassed by anything of the kind in America Standing at the head of it on a blunt bluff you look down and out on the prairies and nothing can be more enchanting than the view that is thus presented On each side there are lofty hills which when green with grass and foliage add a magic beauty to the scene Through the valley as if it had been intended for its dividing line runs a broad mountain stream the banks of which are now metamorphosed into beautiful fields We stop here to undeceive the reading public concerning an idea which has gained currency by the extraordinary imaginative writings of novelists These trashy fictions represent the western plains or prairies as flower beds In this a great mistake has become prevalent A traveler often pursues his way over them for many days without seeing anything to interrupt the continuity of green grass except it be the beautiful road over which he is journeying Near the slopes of the mountains and on the river banks the remark will apply There fields of wild flowers are often found growing in great luxuriance The settlement was soon after commenced by Kit Carson and Maxwell and as now completed is really a beautiful spot It is located about midway down the valley Among its several houses there are two which are more conspicuous than the rest In the finest of these two the owner of which has taken great pains and spent much valuable time with its construction lives Maxwell whose honest pride is the being master of a model farm In the residence next most to be admired in Rayado Kit Carson sometimes sojourns The mansion which belongs to Maxwell would be an ornament to any country At one time it was used as a garrison for American troops and on it the soldiers made many improvements It is built one story high in the shape of a hollow square and has the size of an ordinary block in a city Around the whole runs a fine veranda With its lofty ceilings large and airy rooms and its fine yard in the centre of the square which is well stored with its fowls pigeons and other pet animals with appropriate kennels with antlers of noble buck and elk hams of venison buffalo meat wild turkeys et cetera and near by a fine vegetable garden altogether it presents a picture of sumptuous living rarely seen within the pale of civilization Maxwell counts his steeds and cattle by hundreds while his flocks of sheep are enumerated by thousands Near by stands Kit Carson s ranche which though more modest yet when the hunter occupies it in dead game and comfort it fully rivals its compeer Around these two hunters live a handful of Mexican friends who are either engaged in agricultural pursuits for themselves or else in the employ of the lords of the manor Carson and Maxwell In this his residence at Rayado Kit Carson is only kept from spending his whole time by business for which his tastes are more suited Soon after the commencement of the settlement and while he was engaged in his vocation as farmer news reached him that the Apaches had been committing a most wicked murder the details of which are horrible in the extreme A merchant by the name of White who was engaged in business at Santa Fe had been into the United States for the purpose of purchasing goods With his train of wagons and his small escort of men traveled his private carriage in which there were as passengers his accomplished but unfortunate lady and her only child On arriving at a point where he anticipated no further danger mister White started on ahead of his caravan in order that he might reach Santa Fe as soon as possible and thus relieve his family from the privations of camp life He had proceeded but a few miles when he was attacked by some Indians who had concealed themselves in the rocks on either side of the road The savages as the carriage neared their hiding place fired with such accuracy of aim that they killed by their first volley all of the men who were with the carriage before they were aware of the danger which surrounded them missus White and her child were reserved for a worse fate They were carried off into captivity The child proved to be a source of annoyance to the blood thirsty savages and its angel spirit was released from earth by their cruel ferocity Before the eyes of its captive mother the fatal tomahawk was raised and by one dastard blow its keen edge was made to mingle with its brains The horrid work failed not to bring the bitter woes and anguish of despair to the breast of the unhappy mother It was then thrown into Red River which was the stream nearest to the scene of the bloody tragedy Red River and its great canon has always been to the Apache Indians a favorite haunt of refuge either when pursued or after the committal of some terrible crime There are several streams in the West called by this name The one here referred to is the Red River of the plains and is one of the upper tributaries of the Arkansas River In olden times it went by the name of the Canadian River Several sharp conflicts have occurred on this stream between the Apache Indians and parties of United States troops It has also formed the stage of many an Indian tragedy in conflicts between the mountain Indians and the Indians of the plains Quite recently attempts have been made by whites to use its banks for grazing purposes but every enterprise which has been set on foot to establish ranches in its vicinity have been warmly contested by the Camanches who have killed several persons who have dared to essay such attempts The intelligence of this terrible butchery having been carried to New Mexico a command was organized in hot haste which had for its object the immediate rescue of missus White from her bondage worse than death Two men went with this party as guides named Leroux and Fisher Watkins Leroux is an old and famous trapper and mountaineer whose reputation and skill as a guide in the far West is second only to Kit Carson s A few of his warm partisans who are ever very warm in their praise of their friend at one time considered him superior even to Kit Carson but when the skill of the two men came to be tried in the same cause the palm was yielded to Kit Carson Leroux has guided several parties over new routes with meritorious success His knowledge of Indian character is nearly equal to that possessed by Kit Carson and he is endowed with a wonderful amount of forethought and prudence but in an Indian fight or on any great emergency his faculties appear to be less active and his judgment less certain than those exhibited by the great Nestor of the Rocky Mountains It is a well well understood maxim that there are more or less narrow minded persons who are ready and eager to pull down any and every rising man and for this purpose such must choose a champion Kit Carson s association with Colonel Fremont had won him so great renown as a mountaineer and guide that an opposition party was formed to detract from his merits and capabilities Leroux owing to his popularity was chosen for the leader of this party and whenever the name of Kit Carson was mentioned the friends of Leroux always saw fit to compare the deeds of the two men together This strife of course could not be lasting and now it is almost forgotten It is a just tribute of praise due to both of these brave men to say that they do not sanction by word or deed either party to the controversy They could but appreciate each other and as friends ever felt elated the one at the success of the other and vice versa They mutually considered that every fresh laurel of glory added a measure full of honor and renown to their common brotherhood of mountaineers among whom the good reputation of their cloth was as dear as it was among the knights attached to the orders of chivalry Their ranches are located in the same valley and in the same town where having lived together as fast friends in life in all probability they will find their last resting places in the same graveyard Few men can say aught against the character of Watkins Leroux but in this estimate of his actions we are only reviving what has already been given to the public With Leroux and Fisher employed as guides the expedition for the rescue of missus White set out on its route and on its journey passed by Rayado Kit Carson immediately proffered his services for the expedition They were accepted but much to the surprise of many of the party instead of being at once placed in the position which his great experience demanded he was assigned to an inferior position under the command of Leroux Kit Carson however was too good a soldier to exhibit the conduct which the little buzzing talkers so anxiously looked for from their supposed kindling of his jealousy and quietly took the post assigned him eager to lend a helping hand which might even thus be instrumental in saving a valuable life It is proper however that we should add that this slight upon his reputation and experience wounded his feelings But especially as the life in jeopardy belonged to a woman he would not and did not think of allowing his actions to partake of his feelings We have reason to believe that this slight at least on the part of the commanding officer of the expedition was not intentional That gentleman was an honorable man and would not have committed an act which he considered would have resulted otherwise than for the best and in appointing Leroux his chief counsellor he had selected a good man but one whom he afterwards learned to his sorrow was every way the subordinate of Kit Carson in managing Indian affairs A few years subsequent to the transpiring of this murder and the skirmish which succeeded it we traveled near to the spot under the same officer who had the command of the above expedition He reverted to the affair with much feeling and from his actions and remarks we could plainly see that his sympathies had been perhaps too greatly enlisted in behalf of his unfortunate countrywoman and that his better judgment had been overcome by giving way to the urgent advice of others If it had been a battle where either scientific attainments or manly courage could have succeeded he would doubtless have been himself and carried everything through with success This is no mere assertion for his long and well tried military career warrants us in this belief We have the greatest respect for this gentleman and consider him a very able man but as a biographer we are called upon to narrate the facts as they come to us If he had succeeded everything would have been considered as well done but he failed and the cause of his failure is plain The party being thus constituted and no delay having been occasioned by any unforeseen accident the party arrived in good season at the place where the cold blooded murder had been consummated Around the spot there was strewn in great confusion boxes trunks pieces of harness and many other things which had belonged to the unfortunate party and which the villains did not fancy and carry away with them The path taken by these Indians was soon found and on it the command traveled in full chase for twelve days without seeing the outline of a savage Carson describes this as being the most difficult trail to follow he remembers ever to have undertaken for the rascally Apaches on breaking up their camps would divide into parties of two and three and then scatter over the vast expanse of the prairies to meet again at some preconcerted place where they knew water could be had In several of these camps the pursuers found remnants of dress and other articles that were known to have belonged to missus White By these signs they were led to believe that she still lived Although these things would be trifles on ordinary occasions yet at the present time they were the cause of stimulating the white men to their utmost exertions and as they grew fresher the excitement among the party increased At last the camp and even the persons of the savages became visible to the foremost of the pursuers and among the first to get a glimpse of them was Kit Carson At the time the discovery was made Kit Carson was considerably in advance of most of the men Turning to those near him he shouted to have the command come on as fast as possible for he saw at once that there was no time to be lost in consultation as to the best mode of assaulting the Indians They already were in commotion and were making hurried preparations to decamp Riding on at full speed for some distance Kit Carson again turned his head and saw to his dismay that he was not followed but instead the command had halted The cause of this curious order being given at such a precarious moment was as he afterwards learned brought about by the advice of the chief guide who told the commanding officer that the Indians wished to have a parley On seeing what was transpiring behind him Kit Carson had no alternative but to rein up his horse also for to ride on alone into the midst of the savages would have been unjustifiable rashness and might perhaps have destroyed the plans his superior officers were concocting So he stood paralyzed and confounded at the inactivity of his companions Just about this time a bullet fired from the Indian camp struck the commanding officer in the breast and bent him forward Those around him for a little while supposed that he had received a mortal wound Still he retained his seat in the saddle but could not speak Thus again was precious time lost as the party during this time were virtually without a leader and did not seem to be inclined to make one Fortunately for this officer just before he received the shot he had taken off his thick buckskin gauntlets and crowded them into a breast pocket The ball had struck this bundle and as its force was somewhat expended by the distance it had come it was unable to more than penetrate the mass and contuse the soft parts of the chest This accident assisted in preventing this well known military man from inflicting such a blow on these savages that they would have been long in recovering from it He had undoubtedly seen soon after he had halted that Kit Carson was right in recommending a charge for as quick as he recovered sufficiently from his injury to be able to speak he commanded the men to make the attack and leave him to himself Unfortunately the time had passed to accomplish the desired effect when this order was given for on arriving among the lodges the men found only one warrior He as a matter of course was slain The body of missus White was also found in the camp Life was extinct though her soul had but just flown to heaven There was still warmth in the corpse when the men first discovered it An arrow had pierced her breast Evidently she had been conscious that friends were near and was trying to make her escape when the missile of death produced the fatal wound Much has been written and said about this sad affair and much unjust calumny has been heaped upon the head of the leader of the expedition therefore the opinion of Kit Carson in reference to the matter may not be out of place hence we give it word for word I am certain says Kit Carson that if the Indians had been charged immediately on our arrival missus White would have been saved At first the savages were much confused at our approach and I do not hesitate to say that she saw us as quick as any one of the redskins did for it undoubtedly was the all absorbing topic of her mind that her rescue would be attempted by her friends and countrymen On seeing us coming she had attempted to run towards us when she was shot down Had she been liberated she could not have long survived the brutality hardships and vicissitudes she had experienced Words cannot describe the bitter cup that she had been obliged to drink during her captivity It was the will of Providence that having suffered like a martyr on earth she should be taken to himself before we arrived to where her remains lay upon coming upon which we shed tears at thus being defeated in what had been our cherished hopes even had it cost some of us our own lives By this language it can be readily seen that Kit Carson regretted the failure of this attempt made to rescue missus White as deeply as any one either in the expedition or among her friends at the home from which she had so recently in health and happiness been torn Yet I cannot says Kit Carson blame the commanding officer or the other guide for the action they took in the affair They evidently did as they thought best but I have no doubt that they now can see that if my advice had been taken the life of missus White might have been spared for at least a short period This expedition was far from being a failure for the Indians lost all their provisions camp equipage and a few animals Many of these savages ran away leaving behind them everything they possessed in the world except the scanty amount of clothing they had on For six miles they were pursued over the level prairies when another brave was killed several wounded and three children taken prisoners The horses belonging to the Expedition broke down one by one until at last the chase had to be given over after which the Indians made short work in getting out of sight Among the trinkets and baggage found in the captured camp there was a novel which described Kit Carson as a great hero who was able to slay Indians by scores This book was shown to Kit and was the first of the kind he had ever seen After glancing at it he made the remark that perhaps missus White to whom it belonged knowing he lived not very far off had prayed to have him make his appearance and assist in freeing her He wished that it might have been so but consoled himself by thinking that he had performed his duty While on their route back to Taos the command was overtaken by a terrible snow storm which was accompanied by a high wind as there were no hills to break its force it amounted almost to a tornado The snow was driven with such force into the men s faces that they became nearly blind and were bewildered as to the course they should travel During its continuance they wandered about on the prairies Finally they were so fortunate that at last they reached a clump of timber in the neighborhood of Las Vegas in New Mexico but during the tramp one man had been frozen to death and others had come near to perishing After arriving in the settlements the party learned from some friendly Indians that the Apaches had suffered severely by being exposed to this same storm and the report was that many of them had since died in consequence thereof From this it would appear as if an all seeing power had protected the whites while it had dealt out a fearful judgment upon these wicked savages who have more than vague ideas of the sin of murdering in cold blood innocent people sages and philanthropists far distant and safe in great cities to the contrary notwithstanding There are no set of men in the world who can draw the line between right and wrong based on its first principle and taught to them by the great lessons of nature as can many tribes of Indians Among themselves and especially among their individual bands in regard to all crimes the Indian has his moral code of laws which in many respects is not surpassed by those of his pale faced brother They have their civil chief who is responsible for the peace and good order of the camp and before him are tried by the lawyers of the tribe all cases worthy of notice If the parties are found guilty the offender or offenders are summarily dealt with therefore with his untutored mind in his intercourse with white men the Indian is not altogether excusable in committing crime There are many people who believe that the Indians as a race have been greatly sinned against and to sustain their views have called in the assistance of flowery written romances and the high sounding language of prose and poetry Much of this novelty and interest rubs off by coming in contact with the savage as he really exists Admiration often changes in this case into distrust and even enmity It is natural that this should be so for mere book education biases the mind always either for or against and therefore it is not strange that in the far West we should often meet with men who unhesitatingly declare that the red man if capable is unwilling to entertain in his character even one redeeming trait but on investigating their individual case we find that they are but superficial observers who are prone to find fault with everything that does not exactly suit their tastes It is necessary to spend a whole life with Indians in order to judge them without prejudice The Great Spirit has endowed his red children with reason the same in quality as possessed by any other race but their habits mode of life and experience is of such a kind that when taken as a whole they are truly original Looking upon this class of people either in the light of an enthusiast or as a detractor cannot be otherwise than wrong for as is usually the case the truth lies between the extremes To be caught in one of these winter storms on the plains is a very serious affair and one only needs to have been through a fearful gale on the seas to render him dubious of which to choose To the faint heart death seems inevitable in either case and to such a one a choice between a watery grave or a bed of snow when hunger and cold are his attendants while life is gradually ebbing out is a question in which the contrast appears small During many of the winter months a life on the prairies becomes a necessity to the frontiersman and not a pleasure The force and power of the winds on the level earth of the far West are beyond human imagination The snow storms there at the proper period of the year are terrific in their grandeur The quantity of the snow that falls is not so much a matter of notice as the force with which it comes being almost blinding in its effects and requiring all the physical powers of both man and beast to meet and contend against it It but seldom happens during one of these seasons that the roads are so blocked up by snow that human ingenuity cannot overcome the obstacle for the wind drifts the snow rendering the path clear at intervals which vary in their area The poor mail parties are the ones who experience this undesirable life and in their attempts to make their journeys they are often driven near to death s door although every precaution is taken to make the transit safe The mules of these parties are well protected with india rubber coverings which are lined with blankets and so snugly are they made to fit every available part of the animal that it seems almost impossible for cold to touch them Corn and fodder to a limited extent is transported but even with these precautions the mules now and then succumb to cold The man covers his body with warm clothing and carries with him furs and robes enough to be seemingly able to defy the storms He can provide himself only with a scanty amount of fuel for his means of conveyance are very contracted When overtaken by the storms which may last several days he is rendered almost powerless and is at the tender mercies of the gale for he cannot make fires and without them he may perish This is not true of every trip made across the plains during the winter for like on the ocean the passage may be frequently gone through with the encountering of but little real suffering One thing in favor of making the journey in this season of the year is the probability of not seeing an Indian They usually during the cold months stow themselves away in their comparatively speaking warm mountain retreats In crossing the plains small parties find the item of meeting Indians to be of considerable importance as even in the time of peace they are very exacting and troublesome demanding that provisions should be given them by way of toll To refuse is apt to bring down their ire when they will usually help themselves to whatever suits their fancy They are very partial to sugar which when they cannot say the word in English they call Shoog If not understood they make their wants known by the Indian sign of touching with the index finger the tip of the tongue thereby indicating the sweetness of the article Many of them come armed with a piece of paper which testimonial of good behavior they have obtained from their agent or forced from some traveler As they cannot read it makes but little difference what is the sense of the writing so long as it is bona fide penmanship I once saw one of these documents which the owner prized very highly but had he known the purport of his paper he would have sighed for the scalp of his kind friend who wrote it The language was as follows Crossing of the Arkansas et cetera The bearer Young Antelope is a good Indian and will not take anything out of his reach This is to warn traders and travelers to beware of his race breed seed and generation It was signed evidently with a fictitious name and answered the purpose for which it was intended which was to get rid of an ugly customer and to put strangers on their guard against the man who carried it On arriving at Taos Kit Carson left this party and proceeded to Rayado where he was soon after actively engaged in farming pursuits During the subsequent winter a detachment of ten dragoons under the command of sergeant Holbrook was stationed at Rayado to protect the little settlement In order that their animals might have the benefit of the good grass which was to be found in the mountains at a place where but little snow fell the settlers established there a herder s ranche posting two men there to look after and guard the property The cold months were passed in peace and quiet but in the spring the marauding Apaches came and after wounding both of the herders stole all the gentle animals including both horses and mules One of the wounded men made his way to Rayado notwithstanding his injuries and gave information of what had happened to himself and companion On learning these facts Kit Carson the dragoons and three of the settlers immediately proceeded to the ranche They arrived there just as the shades of night began to fall Nothing could be attempted until the dawn of another day consequently a camp was ordered and duly arranged As the first faint beam of light gilded anew the mountain tops the party were up and moving They soon found the trail made by the thieves and commenced a sharp pursuit The pace at which they traveled became so rapid that at the distance of only twenty five miles from the spot where they first struck the trail the Indians were discovered moving on the prairie a long way in advance There remained nothing but an open chase Orders were issued to accelerate even the hitherto rapid march Each man resumed his exertions to put his horse to his best speed The chase was growing intensely exciting when four of the animals belonging to the pursuers gave out completely ridden down Their riders were the most unhappy of any of the party at this circumstance for it precluded even the chances of engaging in the expected affray Leaving the four men behind the remainder of the party pushed on in the pursuit and every bound made by their horses brought them nearer to their foes After several hours of this hard riding they came near enough to the warriors to count their numbers Their force consisted of twenty well armed and equipped Indians They showed no fear of the party pursuing them but clung to their stolen property with such pertinacity that they allowed themselves to be overtaken A running fight was immediately commenced which became most exciting as well as dangerous to the participants but all the more exciting because thus dangerous The Indians were all skillful horsemen and fought with great dexterity Their animals being comparatively fresh in this respect they had the advantage Notwithstanding this fact the pursuing party administered to them a severe lesson Five of the rascally Indians were killed and several wounded while all of the stolen animals with the exception of four were overtaken and recaptured The whole of this pursuit and the running fight which terminated so successfully was accomplished under the advice of Kit Carson Each man in the pursuing party felt that the simple fact that Kit Carson s eagle eye and experienced hand watched and guided their movements was a guaranty of certain and ample success Hence the labor of the long chase and the demands upon their personal skill activity and courage made by the necessities of the fight were all met with that kind of readiness and determination which seldom fails to make the soldier invincible Every man in that party knew well that an Indian chase with Kit Carson for a leader meant fight and win success or die In referring to this adventure Kit Carson when speaking of the gallant men who accompanied him said They all proved themselves to be men of the very best material Unfortunately two of this gallant party have since fallen by the hands of these same Apache warriors One of these was Sergeant Holbrook a brave man a skillful soldier and a noble friend He was one who adorned his profession of arms and who was an honor to the country whose uniform he wore He was killed at the well known battle of Ceneguilla while bravely fighting against overwhelming odds This battle was fought in New Mexico in the year eighteen fifty four In it a company of United States dragoons were worsted and cut to pieces by a greatly superior force of these Indians who succeeded in drawing them into an ambuscade The other person referred to as having been since killed by this tribe of Apaches was a brave and experienced trapper well known throughout the range of Indian depredations as a fearless and dangerous adversary His name was William New He was literally murdered at Rayado by these Apaches This occurred only a few months after he had formed one of the party to pursue and recover the animals stolen from their ranche When he was attacked New was engaged tilling the soil on his own farm The rascally Indians surrounded him before he became aware of their presence Having an empty rifle with him he succeeded for some time in keeping his assailants at bay by pretending that the piece was loaded and pointing it at the foremost warrior as if he intended to fire it The savages however finally discovered the truth and immediately made a rush upon him A most desperate fight ensued for William New even thus defenceless was not one who would yield up his life without a struggle He made almost superhuman efforts to effect his escape using the rifle as a club wound after wound was given him in rapid succession in return for the desperate blows which he dealt with the rifle His efforts however proved futile Gradually the red blood was gathered from his body and drank up by the soil to which he looked for the sustenance of himself and family until finally he sank upon the ground fainting from its loss literally covered from head to foot with frightful wounds Thus died one more of the sparse race of original mountaineers now fast passing away bravely meeting the fate that has hitherto usually awaited this band of fearless men We again turn to the adventures of Kit Carson On the fifth day of May eighteen fifty accompanied by an old mountaineer named Timothy Goodel he started with fifty head of mules and horses for Fort Laramie This fort is distant from Rayado over five hundred miles The object which the two men had in view was to trade their animals with the emigrants who were at that time thronging the overland route to California The journey was safely accomplished Kit Carson and Goodel arriving at the fort with their animals all in good condition sometime in the following June They remained here about one month disposing of their animals at good bargains A few rather amusing anecdotes have had their rise connected with this visit which Kit Carson made to Fort Laramie Among several other incidents the following is somewhat laughable and seems to us worth relating Among the line of emigrants then on the road the report was circulated for some distance back that the famous Kit Carson was at the fort The result was that every man woman and child as fast as they arrived at the fort were eager to gratify their curiosity by a sight of the man whose name and exploits had already been the theme of many a conversation among them If ever Yankee or American which is the more appropriate term we will not attempt to decide inquisitiveness was exhibited it certainly could be then seen at Fort Laramie The large majority of those who were thus anxious to see the famous guide were led astray by the descriptions which they had heard and read and picked out some powerfully built trader who chanced to present himself especially if the man was tastefully dressed in a hunting shirt with buck skin leggins and whose appearance indicated ferocity Of this kind of personages there were quite a number present at the fort Usually they would accost the man whom they had thus selected Sometimes if their address was appropriate and the humor of the person accosted so inclined they would get put right but more frequently they were left to enjoy and cherish their mistake or were made the subject of a joke Among the rest there came along quite a rough looking individual fresh from the cane brakes of Arkansas He also was seeking to place his eyes upon Kit Carson Accidentally or intentionally it matters not for the story he was directed to the place where the bona fide Kit Carson stood His powerful frame and determined looks as he put his inquiries made those inquired of apparently cautious how they perpetrated a joke upon the Arkansas man At last standing face to face with Kit Carson he thus interrogated him I say stranger are you Kit Carson Being modestly answered in the affirmative he stood a moment apparently quite taken aback at beholding the short compact and mild looking man that stood before him Evidently his beau ideal of the great mountaineer did not compare with the man whom he thus faced This momentary hesitation resulted in the conviction that he was being deceived The conviction at last took form in words Rolling an immense quid of his beloved Indian weed from one cheek to its brother he said Look ere stranger you can t come that over me any how You ain t the kind of Kit Carson I am looking for This was too much for Kit Carson to hear without treating the person addressed to his beau ideal of Kit Carson so suppressing a laugh and assuming a very meek expression of countenance as if he was afraid to impose upon the Arkansas man he quietly pointed to a powerfully built trader who chanced to be passing near by dressed in true prairie style The Arkansas emigrant followed around after the trader until seemingly he was perfectly satisfied that he had at last found the famous person of whom he had heard so many wonderful stories narrated After gazing at the man for some time he departed no doubt with one more perfect description of what sort of personage Kit Carson was From the time Kit Carson s name began to be heralded throughout the world up to the present date impostors have presented themselves in various cities and acting on the credulity of the people they have palmed themselves off as the individual of whom we write but from the perusal of this work it can be seen how seldom the real Kit Carson has enjoyed the luxuries of civilized life It is in this way many persons have gathered wrong impressions concerning Kit Carson Within the past few years a stranger one day presented himself in the quiet town of Taos and being a fellow of words he soon let everybody there know his business both past and present In one of the principal stores of the town there happened to be congregated a small party of friends among whom was Kit Carson They were talking of the important affairs of their section of country when this strange individual entered His familiarity with all things soon gave him an introduction and after a short conversation a wag present was tempted by the fellow s boasting to quiz him Addressing the traveler he asked What part of the world pray sir do you come from The answer was prompt I kum from the Cheyenne Nation I ve been living with them Injins fur several years Indeed I consider myself more of an Injin than a white man The conversation then turned upon other matters The fellow made some remarks which led the party to believe that he was entirely unacquainted with the Cheyenne Indians or any other Indians When he was apparently off of his guard the wag resumed his questioning I presume stranger you accompany the Cheyennes when they go out on war parties as you say that you have turned warrior The reply was When they go out gainst t other Injins I do but when they hunt white men s hair I am allowed to stay behind This was one of the stip lations when I took a squaw and jined the tribe Oh ho that is the way you manage exclaimed the wag Yes and I ve bin the means of saving some scalps for my race too fur the Injins believe in me they do continued the fellow The wag resumed Perhaps stranger you have heard of Kit Carson It is said he is on the prairies somewhere either dead or alive The fellow answered You ve got me Know Kit Carson I reckon I do It is strange that you should ask me that when Kit was the very last man I laid eyes on as I left our tribe Here the fellow lowered his voice and said as if exemplifying sympathy Poor Kit was in a very bad way one hour before we parted The fact is you know he d bin playin the papers meaning gambling and had lost everything However I made him happy by giving him my gun and powder horn With them you know he will git along anywhere All hands except Kit Carson joined in the laugh at the fellow s impudence Kit Carson s patience was exhausted in listening to the barefaced falsehoods which the man was uttering so with some excuse he left the party The fellow was unapprised of the farce which he had been acting and shortly after left the town believing that he had acquitted himself as became a hero By way of episode and while story telling keeps its hold on our pen we may as well relate a short anecdote which though it does not form any close connection with this part of the narrative seems to illustrate the practical jokes which are sometimes played off by the western men upon those who have yet to undergo their novitiate A German accidentally wandered out to and located himself in company with others on or near the Greenhorn River which is one of the tributaries of the Arkansas Their business was trading with the Mormons many of whom at that time traveled to Salt Lake by what is known as the Arkansas River route In so doing they came near the vicinity of the site selected for trading purposes In the commencement the German was very inexperienced in matters that pertained to trading with these emigrants and as a matter of course in an Indian country met with many singular adventures It so happened that this man was exceedingly afraid of rattlesnakes and those he was associated with by way of amusement delighted in augmenting his fears by telling him wonderful stories of what feats the reptile had been known to perform On the first trip which he made to the camp of some Mormons located about nine miles off his ride took him through a perfect hot bed of these snakes Behind his saddle on the horse s back which he rode he had tied a bag of rice which he had intended to barter The German not being used to riding was a poor horseman while unfortunately his steed was a spirited animal and at once on his mounting started off on a trot The string of the bag of rice became loosened by the severe jolting and its contents came tumbling on the ground in great quantities but afterwards as the stock on hand decreased this was lessened The German who had his hands full to keep his seat in the saddle heard the rattling noise behind him but dared not look around for fear of being thrown off from his horse He supposed he was chased by a ferocious snake and at once thought only of escape therefore seizing the mane of the horse he gave him the spurs He was soon going at a flying gait still the rattling noise pursued him as the increased speed sent the little grains of rice out of the sack in greater quantities At last the sound died away as the cause of the trouble was expended The frightened rider now considered himself safe and began to rein in his horse After a while he brought him to a stand still and turned to look for his retreating enemy but instead found the origin and cause of the mischief His loss was irrecoverable and he could only laugh at the ridiculous figure he must have cut This adventure gave his friends much merriment and served to open his eyes in reference to the much vaunted capabilities of this snake He has since often told this story of himself and considers it a capital joke The labor of settling up their business at Fort Laramie was soon over when Kit Carson and Goodel took their departure Goodel started for California while Kit Carson commenced his tramp homeward As a traveling companion he took with him a Mexican They pursued their journey quite pleasantly and safely enough but on their arrival at the Greenhorn River the scene of the German s adventure with a rattle snake they were obliged to be very wary in their progress for Kit had learned that the Apache Indians were out on the warpath and were waylaying the road which he intended to pursue with the avowed purpose of attacking plundering and murdering whoever chanced to fall in their savage clutches Kit Carson therefore halted for six days on the banks of the Greenhorn and spent the time recruiting his animals While here and thus engaged a party of white men whom he found encamped on the same river formed the subject of his earnest attention They had come thus far on their route to New Mexico but on learning the news of the hostile attitude of the Apache nation their courage had entirely deserted them They did not dare venture into New Mexico and counselled the retracing of their steps Kit Carson set himself to work but found he had a difficult task to talk courage into these men By dint of much argument he succeeded in persuading one of them to accompany him On the seventh day with this one companion for the Mexican had left him he broke up his little camp on the Greenhorn and set out upon his dangerous journey By taking a zigzag course avoiding in the mountains all the usually traveled trails he advanced on his route forty miles without seeing any very fresh Indian signs As often as the moon was unclouded the two men embraced the assistance of its pale light to make progress through the dangers that beset them and on the days which succeeded this night work they would conceal themselves and animals in some out of the way place where they were not to be easily discovered Kit Carson had not sufficient confidence in the quickness of perception of his companion to trust him as a sentinel therefore he had to take upon himself all of that important duty While on the lookout he usually posted himself in the top limbs of a tree and always took care to select one that commanded a good prospect of the surrounding country After several days passed without having proper rest Kit in the monotony of his position as sentinel would feel sleep stealing over him until it was difficult to keep longer awake He would close his eyes and commence to nod but on these occasions he was sure to be quickly aroused on almost losing his balance by which however he endangered his neck One day while thus employed he was perched in the highest branches of a lofty old cotton wood on the banks of the River Timchera and not far off from the Spanish Peaks Nearly ten hours had passed without anything special having attracted his attention when all at once a band of straggling Apaches came into view not over one half mile distant A single look was sufficient to convince him that as yet neither himself nor his companion had been discovered No time was to be lost so Kit as quickly as possible descended and ran to where his friend was and informed him of their danger The animals were soon saddled and the two men mounting them struck out in a direction just the opposite to that in which the Indians were traveling Fortune favored them as soon after they had emerged from the timber into the open prairies night set in thus shutting them out from the view of the savages Profiting by the darkness and the level country which lay before them they reached by the rising of the next morning s sun the Mexican town of Red River which was sixty five miles distant from the place they had last started from All dangers having been now surmounted they made a sufficient stay at Red River to rest themselves and animals On resuming their journey they jogged along over the now rough trail and after a ride of thirty miles came to Taos where they were once more safe from the perils that had so recently surrounded them and where they were well provided for by kind friends Rio Colorado or Red River settlement is next to Taos the oldest town in northern New Mexico It is located on a small stream of the same name which flows into the Rio Grande The town itself contains some two or three hundred inhabitants and occupies rather a pretty site being built on a high bank while between it and the river there is a large strip of bottom land which is under cultivation The scenery about is picturesque embracing lofty and bold mountains beautiful wood land and open prairies The external appearance of the village is that of abject poverty and on entering it one readily sees that his eyesight has not deceived him but that his first impressions are fully realized It was here that Fremont and his men found a haven of safety after meeting their trying reverses on the fourth exploring expedition To them the sight of this town must have been hailed with delight In Red River there live two old trappers who have long since been weaned from the habits and manners of civilization These two men are Canadians one of them notorious for the yarns he can spin but as they are many of them past belief they are listened to by the traveler as a help to pass the time while he is obliged to tarry in the place A young English nobleman who was on a visit of pleasure to the western country once fell into this man s clutches and from the trapper s after boasting we infer that he the trapper more than surpassed himself in story telling Among other things he informed this nobleman that he had once mastered a grizzly bear in a hand to hand fight by cramming a stick that was sharpened at both ends into the bear s mouth in such a way that the monster could not close his jaws because it fastened and kept them open Being asked by the nobleman how large were the hare in that vicinity of country his answer was that he had seen them of such a magnitude that one would be a load for a man and that when strung across the hunter s shoulder one part was sure to be dragging on the ground He then boasted that he had killed a grasshopper that with his head cut off weighed six ounces Notwithstanding his love of talk this old man had once been a brave and famous hunter but no confidence could be placed in him owing to his habituated want of regard for truth and honor hence he has long since been excluded from the companionship of the mountaineers The English gentleman above spoken of was an experienced traveler and therefore undoubtedly knew how to weigh the truth of his astonishing information CHAPTER XIV Kit Carson reaches Home Himself and Neighbors robbed by the Apaches Major Grier goes in Pursuit of and recaptures the stolen Stock A Plot organized by White Men to murder two Santa Fe Traders for their Money The Disclosure Kit Carson

pleasant visit which he was thus enabled to make while recruiting himself among the good people of Taos Kit Carson bent his way to his home at Rayado He safely reached there and had but just dismounted at his own door when he was informed of a recent calamity that had befallen himself and neighbors during his absence It was the old story viz that the Indians had come in and boldly stole all the animals belonging to the settlement At the time this depredation had been committed there was a small detachment of United States troops stationed in the place but the soldiers were too few in number to attempt a rescue of the property from the savages The latter had visited the little town with a strong force on this occasion the settlers therefore made application to the commanding officer of the territory who promptly dispatched Major Grier with a command of dragoons to hunt up the guilty parties and punish them This the major did and was so fortunate as to recover nearly all of the stolen stock which he had the satisfaction of returning to its owners Kit Carson remained through the following summer months at his ranche at Rayado busying himself in efforts to improve his house and lands In his employment Kit Carson had several faithful Mexicans His task was to superintend their labors which occupied only a part of his time When anything required it he lent a hand to assist them but these men had to be provided with provisions which to purchase in those distant parts would have entailed a great item of expense indeed more than equal to the profits arising from their labor Therefore a certain amount of time had to be set apart for hunting which kind of employment he truly enjoyed Mounted on a fine horse with his faithful gun and dog early each day he would start out on the prairies to engage in the chase In a few hours he would return on foot with his noble hunter loaded down with choice game Sometimes it would be antelope or elk on another occasion it would consist of black tailed deer which are celebrated as being the largest and the finest species of venison that roam the forests of any country and are only to be found in the Rocky Mountains on another wild turkeys and then mountain grouse and prairie chickens helped to complete the load When thus provided for it is no wonder that Kit s workmen loved their employment and labored with good will While thus engaged Kit Carson s weather eye was always open for Indian signs His horses cattle and sheep which he had bought since the last depredation were watched with great vigilance as no one could foretell what the next hour would bring forth In his mountain home Kit was often visited by Indian friends who came to smoke the pipe of peace with him and enjoy his hospitality When thus surrounded by rival hunters worthy of his steel who had sprung up like oaks of the forest he felt truly happy This happiness was greatly enhanced and augmented by the thrifty appearance of everything that pertained to him He saw himself in the possession of fine lands well watered and well timbered Also plenty which was ready for the plow It was almost a farm made to order by the most perfect Workman The soil unsurpassed in richness and fertility was a safe and sure depository for his seeds telling him in its silent but unmistakable language of the rich harvest in store for him His stock was the best which heart could wish and last but with him not least he was within a stone s throw of splendid hunting grounds which to his unerring rifle as the reader has already seen proved as safe an assistant as would have been a Wall street bank with a large credit side to his account We have here a picture of Kit Carson enjoying the rewards of a home congenial to his taste and knowledge of life while around him are gathered the objects which his manly soul had learned to love and live for The painting is one which we find beautiful to the sight and which is rich in its lessons of life But these deductions must be left for the sensitive and honest hearted imagination to draw It is not fitting to add them to these pages however truthful they may be until the last sad rites which are measured out to all shall have been performed for the brave man of whom we write and his noble soul shall have winged its flight to the happier hunting grounds of eternity The duties of farming and hunting were only once interrupted during the summer which Kit Carson thus enjoyed with his family The exploit which called him on this occasion from his home was caused by an effort to save the lives of two well known traders To accomplish this he assumed the character and duties of a detective police officer The circumstances of the case were as follows An American by the name of Fox had organized a party to accompany as a guard over the plains and while professedly engaged in this duty to murder Messrs Brevoort and Weatherhead two gentlemen who were traveling into the United States as the rascal and party supposed with a large sum of money which they expected to expend in the purchase of goods to be used for trading purposes Fox played his part so well that when he offered himself and men as an escort the offer was accepted by the intended and unsuspicious victims as if it had been a mark of particular favor Before the route was entered upon Fox visited Taos for the purpose of enlisting among his band of desperadoes a fellow who resided in that town He was a person who bore a very bad character but for some reason which has never transpired he refused to go yet proving true as a wicked confidant he waited until he thought his friend Fox was sufficiently advanced on the road to accomplish his hellish purposes without any chance of his being overtaken and arrested He then saw fit to divulge the plot Every new country is the favorite place of resort for desperadoes and rascals of all grades who cannot live in their native districts on account of their many crimes Until the machinery of law and order begins to work smoothly these fellows in their new homes have every thing their own way unless they go to too great excesses when their neighbors will rise for their own protection and treat them with summary and severe punishment Often by thus making an example of a few large numbers are prevented from doing further mischief In the early history of nearly every one of our western territories escaped convicts murderers thieves and the worst sort of humanity mingled in with good men have commenced their nefarious practices on a grand scale These things have brought such sections of our country into bad repute abroad It needs but time for communities to ferret these human monsters out and visit upon them a just retribution The inland position of New Mexico and the consequent difficulty of intercourse with the General Government of the United States made it an inviting place from time to time for men of this stamp to visit but as they have met on most occasions with a reception from the friends of order not in the least suited to their tastes they have almost ceased their coming thereby showing what a few resolute men can accomplish at the commencement of such trouble The reforming work of mitigating the evil which is sure to result among a mixed population under the best regulations is slowly progressing and the day is not far distant when New Mexico in this respect will compare favorable with her sister and older territories The purport of this diabolical plot accidentally came to the ears of an officer in the army who chanced to be in Taos at the time This gentleman was one of the first to hear of it and at once sought Kit Carson but instead of directly telling him what he had just heard from some strange reason of his own he demanded of Kit whether he would be willing to pursue and apprehend Fox for debt To this proposition Kit Carson replied in the negative On hearing Kit s indignant refusal to be employed in such a menial undertaking the officer concluded to lay the true state of the case before him who he naturally enough thought could above all others in that territory devise some plan that would result in rescuing Brevoort and Weatherhead from their impending fate Here it may be proper for us to add that the officer who had thus indiscreetly acted must have had previously a very slight acquaintance with Kit Carson or he would not have selected him as a man ready and anxious for any dirty job which might offer as it is entirely foreign to his true character Kit Carson on being apprised of the facts became interested and took the management of the affair for the most part into his own hands and on investigating it more thoroughly he came to the conclusion that Fox and his companions contemplated committing the crime on the Cimaron River This river is nearly east from Taos and the point at which Carson anticipated overhauling the party was between two and three hundred miles distant At this time the Mountain Indians were unusually hostile but Kit Carson was always well informed of their movements as much so as it was in the power of any one to be With the little command under him he was willing where so weighty a matter as saving the lives of two of his countrymen demanded his services to march anywhere even if he had to contest his way One hour was sufficient time for him to make ready for the undertaking but not so with the soldiers They had to put their horses and themselves in trim for it might be severe and taxing duty The route taken by the party was a trail which leads direct to Rayado and on which just before reaching the last named place there are many curious piles of stones which are scattered over the side of a mountain and have formed a puzzle to many an inquiring mind By some they are supposed to be Indian graves but by others they are thought to have been made as a sort of landmark by the older inhabitants of the plains when they started into New Mexico on some marauding incursion These latter persons believe that the Indians were unacquainted with the country they were invading and had left these marks to assist them in making their way out again Most likely the first hypothesis is true and that the stones were thus heaped up to protect the corpses from being devoured by the wolves On quitting Rayado Kit Carson struck out on the open prairies By making an expeditious march Kit Carson felt that the traders could yet be saved His party consisted of ten picked men of the dragoons and it was splendidly mounted on horses furnished him to assist in the undertaking The pace which Kit commanded and required was one which would try the nerves and courage of most good horsemen Onward over the level prairie the party galloped every man feeling proud of the guide whose spirit they caught and imitated The second night out from Taos they came upon the camp of a detachment of United States recruits who were under the command of Captain Ewell and who were bound for New Mexico where they were to reinforce the regiments of the army which were stationed in that territory It is customary to send out each year detachments of recruits to the different departments of the West These men are enlisted and collected at the depots within the States and whenever a sufficient force is collected to fill up the requisitions they are dispatched at the proper seasons to their respective regiments Those intended for New Mexico set out during the summer months They are rarely sent at the same time or as the same command of men These recruits are a hard set to manage especially when traveling through the States where they are exposed to temptation On arriving at the commencement of their hardships on the plains it is usually found that many have deserted and also that many might have done so with benefit to the government Military service with recruits and the same with old soldiers are two different things With the former officers are obliged to command threaten and punish to accomplish in one day what the latter would perform without much trouble in half the time Recruits know little or nothing about marching or camp duty and in taking care of them an officer has his hands full Even the most minute items have to be looked to for example they are men rarely used to fire arms being for the most part foreigners by birth and are just as apt to load a gun with the ball of the cartridge first down as with the powder Old soldiers look upon these new comers as verdant in the extreme and the pranks they often play upon them are very humorous With patient discipline they become serviceable men and are an honor to the standard which they carry and what appears to be the strangest fact of all frequently the poorest looking recruit may make the best soldier This is a fair picture of the men captain Ewell was commanding Kit Carson at once informed the captain of the duty he was on when that distinguished officer generously determined to assist in putting a damper on the wicked designs of the wretches Taking with him twenty men Captain Ewell joined Kit Carson and together they proceeded in the pursuit By using every precaution in their power and forcing their marches they entered into the camp of the traders and arrested Fox before he had time even to suspect the business upon which the party had come After Fox was secured Messrs Weatherhead and Brevoort were informed of the dangers through which they had passed These gentlemen at first were astounded but they soon became assured of the truth of what they heard They then selected fifteen men whom they knew to be innocent and ordered the remainder of their escort numbering thirty five souls to leave their camp instanter which command was promptly obeyed To Kit Carson they offered any sum of money that was in their power to bestow in return for the invaluable service he had rendered them Kit Carson replied that it was reward sufficient for him to have been instrumental in saving the lives of two worthy citizens and that he could not think of receiving one cent of money A long colloquy was held that night around a good camp fire that was freely fed with buffalo chips twenty one At midnight most of the party were asleep and nothing could then be heard except the barking of wolves and the heavy tread of the guard as they walked to and fro on their respective beats On the first appearance of day light all hands were up and preparing to strike their tents Soon after the parties separated but before doing so the traders again expressed their thanks and then resumed their journey Fox was first taken to Captain Ewell s camp then he was turned over to Kit Carson who conveyed him to Taos where he was imprisoned for some time but was finally released as nothing positive could be proved against him chiefly because he had committed no overt act but had only thus far engaged in plotting the double murder and robbery This is always a difficult crime to establish In this instance the difficulty was greatly augmented from the fact that the witnesses in the case as soon as they heard of Fox s capture scattered and left for parts unknown He was finally set at liberty Footnote twenty one Buffalo chips form the principal fuel of the plains It is dry buffalo manure At that day the keeping of a prisoner in close confinement in New Mexico or of having him continually under the surveillance of the military was no ordinary or easy matter The only places which could be converted into jails were the common adobe houses of the inhabitants From these a wide awake and determined prisoner with the free use of his hands and the assistance of the smallest kind of a tool as a jack knife or pair of scissors could dig out of his dungeon in five or six hours The large majority of the criminals who were thus incarcerated managed to effect their escape In the case of Fox however he had a man to deal with who was seldom thwarted in any of his undertakings With so much convicting evidence of his wicked intentions and with so much trouble to bring him to trial it was greatly regretted that he did not receive a suitable punishment As soon as he was set free Fox made his way out of the country but his further history is not known The general impression left upon the minds of the people who were familiar with the minutiae of this affair was that Fox was guilty As he was known to be a finished villain it was universally believed that after murdering and plundering the two traders he intended to grasp the lion s share and with his portion to proceed to Texas where as he was there entirely unknown he hoped to enjoy the rewards of his rascality This valuable service rendered to Messrs Brevoort and Weatherhead was most gracefully and handsomely rewarded by them In the course of the following spring they presented Kit with a pair of magnificent revolvers Upon the silver mountings there were engraved a very few but expressive words indicating the obligations which the donors considered themselves laboring under towards their deliverer Such a testimonial to an unselfish heart like that which beats in the breast of Kit Carson is a prize of greater value than any more substantial gift which money could purchase These beautiful weapons Kit Carson prizes very highly and the donors may here learn the fact that in the hands of their owner they have since been duly initiated into active service and found to perform their necessary duties most admirably After the task of the arrest of Fox was thus successfully undertaken and consummated by his being securely lodged in jail and placed under suitable guard Kit Carson returned to Rayado where he spent the winter in a very quiet manner We use the term quiet manner it should be qualified with the phrase quiet manner for him He found plenty of employment in looking after his animals besides spending a large share of his time in hunting This however although always attended with paying practical results he did as much for pleasure as from necessity He always found a large number of hungry mouths ready to relieve him from any superabundance of game and as his hospitality to all classes is unbounded he took especial delight in feeding and liberally bestowing his bounties upon his poor Mexican neighbors to whom powder and lead were more of a desideratum than to himself and with whom his experience and skill as a hunter were a source of support which they could only wish for Early the next summer Kit Carson in charge of a train of wagons belonging to himself and his friend Maxwell set out for the United States After an unusually pleasant journey he reached the Missouri River and proceeded down it in a steamboat to saint Louis Here he purchased a large stock of goods With this freight he returned to Kansas where he had left his caravan into which on his arrival he transferred his merchandise He then started on his return trip to New Mexico In order that his animals might take advantage of the fine grass to be found there he chose the route known to all traders on the plains as well as to the reader as the road by Bent s Fort He was progressing on his journey quite happily when unfortunately at a point that is located about fifteen miles above the fording of the Arkansas he fell in with a village of Cheyenne Indians who were just at that time violently hostile towards the whites and were waiting an opportunity to wreak their vengeance on them This state of feeling had been brought about only a few days previous and was due to an officer who was attached to a command of recruits that some ten days before Kit Carson s arrival had passed by He had flogged a warrior for some liberty which the fellow had taken while he was in the camp of the soldiers These Cheyennes are very fond of dress and show but as a body they are as noble and athletic looking men as tread this earth Singular though the contrast may appear a greater set of rascals never went unhung yet they are Indians and as such they ought to command sympathy and forbearance The young men who belong to the Cheyenne nation are fond of dress and when arrayed in full costume one of them is a picture to look upon when thus gilded no man could be prouder These Indians wear their hair in a long cue a la Chinese style They take great pleasure in ornamenting this cue with innumerable pieces of silver which are made from half dollar pieces and are beat out in the shape of small shields With their blue or red blankets long ribbons of different colored flannel fancy leggins and bead decorations and finally as I once saw one with a red cotton umbrella they represent the very Paris tip of Indian fashion Their squaws do not possess as regular and fine features as the men but this may be said to be true of most of the wild tribes of savages in North America for it requires an enormous stretch of the imagination to call them handsome while many of the men are fine looking Hard work spoils the beauty of the Indian women To admire an Indian woman one must seclude himself from the society of other females under such circumstances it may be that a person might be inclined to change his opinion and think the race lovely The lazy brave considers it beneath his station to work therefore all camp labor and the packing saddling and looking after the ponies devolves upon the squaw When there is a scanty supply of horses she is obliged to give her lord the preference in taking his ease and go herself on foot and carry her pappoose In fact it is lowering to the Indian s pride to do else than hunt and fight Owing to the scarcity of timber on the western prairies the Indians transport their lodge poles from camp to camp This is done by attaching them to the sides of the pack animals while the free ends drag on the ground and in time of war this constitutes one of the signs of the trail by which to follow when in pursuit of them The reason why the commanding officer of this party of recruits inflicted the summary punishment referred to is not known to the writer but it surely does appear as if the person who ordered its execution or perhaps courageously performed it himself might have reflected that a savage least of all men allows a supposed injury done to him or his tribe to pass by unrevenged and also that it is a matter of perfect indifference to him as to who the victim is if he only gets the chance to strike a blow on the same nation This revenge will quench his cruel thirst for blood quite as effectually as if he had the satisfaction of scalping the perpetrator of his real or supposed injury It is a fact alas too frequently true that the parties who are strong in numbers courage and equipment while crossing the plains are prone to treat in an overbearing and insolent manner the bands of Indians with whom they chance to come into contact For these insults and injuries weaker parties who travel upon the same road are held to a strict and revengeful account by being made to suffer even with their lives as well as effects Kit Carson and his small force unfortunately or rather fortunately so far as Kit himself was concerned for no man could be better fitted to deal with such a crisis of trouble than he were the first white men who came along after the flogging of their warrior had wrought up the temper of the Cheyenne nation to a degree which nearly bordered on frenzy As soon as the whites were discovered the Indians went into council evidently to decide on the best mode of attacking and making away with them Kit Carson though he did not know that this tribe had declared war and much less their reasons for so doing when he first saw them was not long in coming to a conclusion from their actions that there was a screw loose somewhere He therefore began to act with more than usual sagacity and caution He ordered his men to keep their wagons close together to have their rifles in good trim and be ready for an instant fight In this manner with every man on the watch he pushed on for a distance of twenty miles Although he had left the Indians far behind he did not relax his vigilance being still impressed with the belief that a storm was brewing His surmises began to be verified soon after for the Indians in parties of two three and four appeared in sight arrayed and painted in their full war costume Having approached some of them to within a distance sufficiently near so to do Kit Carson commenced talking to them in a conciliatory manner They were inclined to heed his words and in order to make it appear that he was not intimidated by their actions he went into camp and invited these advance parties of the Indians to come in and have a talk and smoke with him The savages accepted the invitation and were soon seated in a circle After the pipe had passed from one to the other until all present had had a puff or two from it they began to talk loud among themselves At the time we now speak of several years as the reader can readily compute had elapsed since Kit Carson was a hunter at Bent s Fort and then well known to most of the Cheyenne nation but these few years had so altered him together with his new style of dress that it is no doubt that at first not one of the Indians remembered ever having seen him before Kit Carson remained quiet and allowed the Indians to open the talk as he was watching to find out what had so suddenly aroused their anger and he well knew that if they supposed that he and his men did not understand what they were conversing about they might refer to the cause of the trouble and thus give him a clue whereby he might take advantage and form a line of conduct It was clear to his mind that the Indians were resolved to have revenge on his party and that there was time enough to let himself be known to them which in their present excited state would serve him but little The Indians had at first conversed in the Sioux tongue The reason for this was to conceal their own nationality and thus if necessary in the future they could shield themselves by laying the massacre which they were about to commit on the shoulders of that tribe This is a ruse often employed by the Indians but in this case in their heated state they forgot their native cunning and commenced conversing in the language which was most familiar to them A Frenchman called in the mountains Pete who spoke English fluently and who was with Carson during these trying scenes informed the writer on one occasion that he never fully knew or appreciated Kit Carson until this occurrence Why said he in his enthusiasm Kit knew just what was to be done and did it too With any other man we would have gone under twenty two The Indians were more afraid of him than all the rest of us put together There were red fellows enough there to eat us up and at one time I could almost feel my hair leaving my head We had two women traveling with us and their crying made me feel so bad that I was sartin there was no fight in me Women he added are poor plunder to have along when going out on a war party but Kit talked to them and then to the Indians and put them both finally on the right trail Wah but them were ticklish times Footnote twenty two A trapper phrase for being killed As soon as the Indians in their excitement began to speak their own language they became very violent and so unguarded were they in expressing their individual sentiments that they treated Kit and his party with perfect indifference and openly though secretly as they thought arranged for the massacre Little did they imagine that Kit Carson whom they had at first sight selected as the leader of the company understood every word that was said Kit listened attentively to their plans and heard them decide that the time to kill him was when he again took the pipe to smoke for in so doing he would lay down his weapons They could be instantly seized and therefore he would be prevented from doing them any harm As to the Mexicans who accompanied him they said they could kill them as easily as they could buffalo Already enough had passed among the Indians to arouse in Kit Carson s breast the greatest feeling of alarm as to what would be the result of the position in which he was placed He had with him fifteen men two only of which number were men on whom he felt that he could rely The other members of the party who counted thirteen in all were Mexicans of whom he had a poor opinion as to their bravery Nothing daunted by such an accumulation of unfavorable circumstances he at once saw that a bold face was to be put on in order to extricate himself from the grasp of the Indians Springing to his feet with his weapons ready for immediate use Kit Carson as he advanced into the centre of the seated warriors gave directions for his men to be ready to defend their lives Then turning to the Indians who sat rooted to the earth as it were with astonishment at the suddenness of such actions and such coolness he commenced addressing them He informed them that they might readily see from the fluency with which he spoke their language that he had comprehended all that they had been talking about What puzzled him most however was the cause of their wishing to have his scalp Never said he to his knowledge had he been guilty of any wrong to their tribe that on the contrary there were braves among those present who if they turned to their memories would recognize his face as that of an old friend in years gone by and who could testify to the many acts of kindness which he had performed in their behalf He reminded them how that even now he had received them into his camp and treated them with all the hospitality in his power and yet they persisted in repaying him by taking his life In the end he wound up his discourse by giving peremptory orders for them to leave his camp and should any one refuse he would be shot The Indians were completely nonplused and not feeling inclined to risk a fight without their usual accompaniment of a surprise after saying something about returning to which they were answered that if they did they would be received by a volley of bullets they departed to join their friends who were in swarms upon the neighboring hills It is supposed that a grand council was called in which the proceedings that had transpired in the camp of the white men were fully reported and perchance many of the braves in refreshing their memories began to recollect some of the daring deeds which Kit Carson had performed when he lived in their country This doubtless led them to the conclusion that they had caught an experienced traveler for certain it was that afterwards their actions became somewhat disconcerted and not so rash as they had been No sooner had the savages retired from the camp than Kit Carson ordered his men to harness their animals to the wagons so that they could resume their journey As the train moved on the Indians were once more left behind although they had by no means formed the idea of allowing the white men to depart in peace They were busy concocting some scheme whereby they could accomplish their ends without loss to themselves The muleteers as they walked beside their teams by order of Kit Carson held in one hand their rifles while in the other were their whips which from time to time they were obliged to apply freely to their animals in order to keep the caravan in compact order Mounted on a fine horse with his rifle and pistols so adjusted that he could lay his hands on them at a moment s notice Kit Carson rode from one end of the line to the other inspiring his men with his own courage He felt that upon him was rested the responsibility of saving the lives of his companions and that it was to him they all looked to be rescued from the perils that surrounded them As he rode along his eyes were busy scanning the prairies in every direction Now and then he rested from this duty as his mind became somewhat relieved when he could discover nothing except bands of antelope or here and there a hungry wolf who with his white canine looking teeth seemingly spoke volumes of the empty condition of his stomach For the remainder of that day the train traveled on in apparent safety When the shades of evening had fairly set in a camping ground was selected on a small stream The wagons were formed in a circle in which were huddled the men and animals so that both could be protected by the weapons of the former Grass was cut with the butcher knives belonging to the members of the party and was laid before the mules In this dangerous locality they could not be allowed to procure this food for themselves As strong a guard as their forces would permit of was posted The remainder of the party gathered some wood that had floated down the stream from the mountains and was sparingly scattered along the shores of the river near to the camp This was brought in when small fires were made over which their frugal meal was prepared after which the men lay down to rest Many persons there are who would think that after escaping such perils once it would take very great inducements to make them thus expose themselves a second time Nevertheless there exist in our land hundreds upon hundreds of men who take delight in returning into the midst of these dangers A life on the prairies of the Far West has its good chances as well as its counter chances and no man can be happier than the true mountaineer At first to one accustomed to luxuries and modern refinement nothing can be more unpleasant than a journey over the plains but each day thus spent hardens the traveler until meals that a beggar in our towns or cities would hardly deign to touch are by him eaten with a relish to which he has long been a stranger It is on these long tramps that the dyspeptic and melancholic man becomes the liveliest of the party his sociability often increases to such a degree that he soon can spin a yarn in a true Baron Munchausen style Eat Carson as he rode silently along all the following day had been meditating over the scenes through which he had so recently passed and also the most practicable means to be employed for the future When the night had fully set in without saying one word to the other members of the party he called to a young Mexican whom he knew to be very fleet of foot and whose powers of endurance were wonderful On his coming to him he led him one side when after he had depicted to the boy their fearful situation in its true colors he told him that he held the power of saving the lives of the whole party The New Mexicans of the north are famous as being very fleet of foot and the great distance which they can run in a short period of time is astonishing As a general rule they are very partial to horses but when they have no riding animal they will start on a journey of hundreds of miles and accomplish it in an incredibly short time A journey of forty or fifty miles in a day is an ordinary circumstance with them even when the inducement for making it has in its behalf only a minor consideration Owing to want of mail routes it sometimes becomes necessary to dispatch them on express duty such as carrying one or several letters to some distant point Their charge is wrapped up in a handkerchief and tied about their waists to prevent being lost Then on a jog trot they will start out and over mountains and broken country they will not alter the pace for many consecutive hours and this for a reward of one or two dollars per diem It is not uncommon to meet traveling companions where one is on horseback and the other on foot but notwithstanding they will keep together for an entire journey and complete it as quickly as if the horseman had undertaken it alone When by chance they come to and stop at a village where there is a fandango or other festive scene in full blast they will notwithstanding their long tramp join in and dissipate as hard as any member present Their healthy climate coarse but plain diet and the great amount of exercise which they take in the open air make them capable of a wonderful amount of physical endurance under which they seem never to grow weary In this respect the only successful rivals which they have are the Indians This was the kind of material Kit Carson had in the Mexican boy whom he was now about to part with having detailed him for a very important duty That youth had long been known by and had the full confidence of his employer He was ready at his bidding to undertake anything Therefore on hearing the mission which Kit proposed sending him on he promised to use every exertion in its accomplishment and at once set about its execution Having obtained a few rations of provisions he soon rejoined Carson They then proceeded outside of the camp where he was to receive his final instructions By the dim light of the moon Kit pointed in the direction of Rayado where he was to travel and after warning him of the dangerous places that lay in his route and giving him the message that he was to deliver to the commanding officer at Rayado he bid him good bye with the words be sure and leave a good many miles between us by to morrow s sunrise The distance to the settlement of Rayado from Kit Carson s camp was between two and three hundred miles yet this runner was capable of travelling it in as short a period of time as could any ordinary horse Kit now returned among his men not to sleep but to watch This he did until the break of the following day when he summoned all hands to hitch up the teams and proceed Until twelve o clock no Indians were visible but at about that hour five of the savages were seen approaching On they came and when within speaking distance Kit Carson ordered them to halt They obeyed his command On scanning them closer he bade them come nearer when he informed them that the night before he had sent an express to Rayado for the purpose of letting the troops there know of the annoyances their tribe were causing him Among the soldiers he said he had many friends who would be certain to come to his relief and if they should find that his party was massacred which he let the Indians know could only be accomplished by his men being overpowered they would be already informed by whom it was done and would be sure to visit upon the perpetrators of the crime a terrible retribution The Indians said they would look for the moccasin tracks made by the messenger and thus decide whether that which they had just heard was true or not Kit Carson hearing this at once considered it as the turning point in favor of the safety of his party The Indians immediately went to look for the trail Shortly afterwards the entire Indian village passed within sight and were evidently making the best of their time in seeking some safe hiding place The five warriors had therefore evidently found the expressman s trail as they had been informed that they would and that the boy had proceeded too far on his journey to think of pursuing him On his way to Rayado the messenger overtook the detachment of recruits to which was attached the officer who had caused the trouble To the commander of these men the young Mexican reported the position as he left them of his employer and companions but that gentleman for some unaccountable reason would not then grant the desired aid therefore the boy pushed on to Rayado where he found a warm hearted and brave soldier in the person of Major Grier who commanded the post The major on hearing the message sent by Kit Carson immediately ordered Lieutenant R Johnston his subaltern officer to take a squad of dragoons and proceed to the assistance of his countrymen While on his march Lieutenant Johnston met with the command of recruits of whom we have before spoken In the course of the conversation which ensued Johnston was asked by the officer in charge of the recruits what was the service he was engaged on and being informed that gentleman probably gave the subject deeper thought and it may have occurred to him and such is the opinion of Kit Carson that if the affair was properly managed there might be some glory accruing from it At any rate he suddenly changed his mind and ordered a detail of men to go with the lieutenant The relief party as thus reinforced again started and found Kit Carson and his train of wagons at a point that is some twenty five miles below Bent s Fort Under the escort of the soldiers Kit and his men travelled in safety to Rayado where he had the pleasure of thanking Major Grier for his praise worthy and prompt action in succoring him and a few other American citizens who had thus been exposed to the barbarities of savages made hostile by the overbearing conduct of a man whose double blunder was shielded by power Although the fighting qualifications of the soldiers were not called into requisition yet they performed a meritorious service by coming They might have been instrumental in saving lives while protecting commerce and their frequent visits to remote Indian countries always leaves salutary impressions on the minds of the red men Kit Carson s thorough knowledge of Indian character and his established bravery and integrity ought it appears to us to have been a sufficient guaranty to this officer that he was acting in good faith when he asked through the proper channel that protection to which he was certainly entitled while pursuing the necessary though hazardous business connected with the commerce of the plains Never throughout his eventful career had Kit Carson refused to offer his services in the cause of a countryman who stood in need of them and now when the first time came that he felt it necessary to make the call for assistance he could not understand why two valuable days were allowed to pass by an officer who could have aided him without some notice being taken of his urgent requisition It is true that by some especially those who are not acquainted with the character of Kit Carson he is regarded as being ever anxious for an Indian fight but had this been the case he would have long since paid the forfeit with his life To contradict such a statement we have but to appeal to the reader of this narrative and ask him to bear testimony of the marked discretion that has so far coupled itself with Kit Carson s fame An amusing incident which came under the eye of the writer is to the point In the early part of the so called gold fever of California when parties were organizing in the city of New York to proceed overland to the Pacific we chanced to be present at a meeting held by one of the companies As most of those present were entirely unacquainted with the country to be passed over and as they were anxious to place themselves in a safe position some one proposed that Kit Carson should be employed as a guide provided his services could be had This was ruled out The amusing part of this incident consists in the reason which governed this judgment It was on account of the fear that he might lead them out of their way in order to engage in some bloody Indian fight it being generally represented and believed that he was sanguinarily inclined Cheap literature had so ferociously made the man that he of all men most experienced could not be trusted showing thereby how little had been known of the real Kit Carson CHAPTER XV Kit

Part of the Apaches Davidson s desperate Fight with them The Soldiers defeated with severe loss Davidson s Bravery is unjustly questioned Kit Carson s Opinion of it The Apaches elated by their Victory Their Imitations of the Actions of Military Men The expedition into the United States which terminated with the last chapter proved to be valuable in its results so far as the parties engaged in it were concerned Kit Carson was once more trying hard to keep quiet in his comfortable home at Rayado But his restless spirit was not proof against this inactivity His stay at home therefore was short The memories of other days came upon him and he longed once more to enjoy in company with the friends of his youth the scenes excitements and pleasures of his old life as a trapper Throughout his eventful life as the reader has been able clearly to see Kit Carson seldom spent his time in idle thinking His thoughts almost invariably take form in actions This eager longing resulted therefore in the forming of a regular trapping expedition after the olden style shape et cetera which he organized with great care and attention The members of the party were selected by himself chiefly with great exclusiveness and numbers who wished to join the party were refused on account of their inexperience After a good deal of inquiry Kit succeeded in collecting eighteen of his old companions No one among them was not entitled to be called a mountaineer Kit looked upon this party of men with an eye of real affection The meeting previous to the start was a scene to behold Such a greeting of old friends well tried and true will not soon be again seen on the American continent The day when men went trapping was long time ago Kit Carson as he stood among this band of friends the acknowledged leader of the party every man of whom he knew would have periled his life for either one of the company felt that indeed the days of his youth had returned unto him Everything preliminary was arranged in the most approved style When all was complete Kit Carson mounted on his magnificent charger Apache riding to the head of the line gave the order to march Kit had put it to vote and the result was unanimous that the expedition should be no boy s play On the contrary the boldest and one of the longest of the routes known to their experienced footsteps was selected It comprised many of the mighty rivers of the Rocky Mountains every one of which was almost a hunting ground by itself Onward over the wild and broad plains this band of stalwart men brave and kindred spirits dashed They soon put many a mile between them and the comfortable firesides at Rayado But these miles Kit Carson has often said were the shortest he ever traveled The way was beguiled by many a recollection in which every man present could participate with a relish keen as disuse alone can render the palate of enjoyment In a short time the well remembered waters of the South Fork of the River Platte were descried Their practised eyes soon discovered the oft noted signs of the beaver The camp was formed and the traps set The beaver so long left to mind their own business had increased in great numbers The hunt proved correspondingly successful The party continued working down this stream through the plains of Laramie to the New Park and from thence on to the Old Park We cannot follow them through this long and enlivening hunt They trapped a large number of their old streams until finally the expedition was terminated on the Arkansas River Throughout the whole course the hunt proved to be very successful With a large stock of furs they returned in safety to Rayado via the Raton Mountains which are spurs of the great Rocky chain The fact that most of the old trappers had given up their vocation furnishes the reason why the beaver were found along the entire route to be so plentiful We desire that the reader shall paint for himself the enjoyment which these men gathered in this renewal of a pursuit rendered congenial by the experience of long years of activity in following it It has been our purpose to enable the reader to gather a spark of this same enjoyment by the endeavor to make of him an amateur trapper He has followed Kit Carson throughout the trapping expeditions of his earlier life It is to be supposed that with Kit he has acquired some experience With Kit therefore he shall now receive his final polishing and if he does not in the end catch a beaver he shall at least learn how they are caught and all the necessary minutiae of toil which he must expect to encounter and undergo On striking any river when on the hunt the trappers are accustomed to keep a bright lookout for signs often heretofore referred to The word signs conveys but a vague idea of its all important meaning as it was received by the trappers The news of the presence of signs sent a thrill of joy through the hunters of the olden time only equalled on board of whale ships when the man at the lookout cries there she blows It rarely happens that this cunning amphibious animal can be seen moving free either on the river banks or in the water for nature has given him no powerful weapons with which to defend himself when surprised and attacked but what is better she has endowed him with exceedingly sensitive eyesight and hearing which enables him to detect the approach of danger in time to escape The marks however which he leaves behind are for a time ineffaceable These were only to be detected and used for his own purposes by the superior intellect of man The unequalled industry of gnawing down trees and cutting twigs peeling off the tender cuticle of the willow bushes digging away banks and carrying on their shovel shaped tails the earth together with innumerable foot prints and sometimes dams were the items which filled up the catalogue of signs on which the trappers vision was regaled after long and dangerous tramps in search of them These signs were not always found together but instead they each could exist separately and thus would arouse the hunter s suspicions of the game near by The little twig as it floated down the stream half denuded of its bark would go unheeded by the casual observer but to the experienced trapper it was a prize to be obtained for by its freshness it indicated to his mind how near he was to the chance of obtaining and adding another pound or so of valuable fur to his stock on hand To him this small event or one like it as for instance a fresh footprint with its neatly defined claw tracks as moulded in the moistened earth or sand was of a greater importance than the wonderful and striking workmanship exhibited in a dam for the latter might be old and deserted whereas the former was too recent to cause him to be deceived with such a sign and in such a vicinity he hesitated not to set his trap An idea prevails which ought to be exploded It is boldly asserted that the beaver builds his dam for the purpose of having a nice swimming pond in the neighborhood of his residence which is always located in the river s bank This is not true for in every stream which he inhabits if this was his sole object he could select many natural places where the water is without a ripple and where it is both deep and broad The animal has a wiser object in view and it consists in providing against the pinching wants of hunger during winter when nearly everything green has lost its sap and nutrition and is as a body without blood and animation He therefore chooses a place favorable for obtaining food and also where his labors will be assisted by natural formations or accidents in the river s course and construction Having pitched upon the right section to build he sets to work with his fellows and falls giant trees In this he again exhibits his wonderful instinct for while one party is cutting with their sharp teeth the hard wood of one side of the tree another division is actively employed on the other side never forgetting to make like unto the woodman the lowest incision on the side the tree is to fall which to suit their purposes is always directly into and across the stream When a tree is thus fallen it is attacked in its branches which are so turned and woven together in the outline of the dam as to catch in their meshes any floating material or receive the tail loads of soil and rubbish which they carry to it Another and another tree are then systematically fallen and arranged as is the first until the work is finished as completely as if it had been planned and executed by a reasoning mind The finishing stroke is the transporting of the mud and laying it In this labor they show themselves to be excellent masons They now act in concert A large gang marches in a line to the bank where they load each other s tails and swim with their cargoes elevated above and free from the water When they arrive at an unfinished point of the dam they dump the mud and mould it in place Their houses they have previously built in the river banks These consist of holes which lead into large and airy subterranean rooms and which are above the water mark In these houses they are said to sleep and live in pairs and if we could believe the story of the trapper related many pages back they imitate human beings in managing their household and in keeping house The main object they have in staying the progress of the current of the river is to afford a deep place where having fallen numbers of trees the deep water will preserve tender and fresh the limbs and shrubs on which to subsist during not only time present but also time to come It is well known that fresh branches of trees and young willows when placed in water will keep up partial life for a considerable length of time On this principle the beaver acts in submerging his food deep in the water where it will retain its verdure and where the freezing process that is going on at the surface of the river will not bar his efforts in getting at his store of provisions during the winter season It is said that the beaver goes so far as to bundle up small branches of trees and willows which he stows away in the muddy bottom of the river The trapper in his wondrous yarns insists that there are grades of society among beavers the same as among men and he will have it that they have their head chiefs and that often individuals among them roll in wealth and that they have slaves who stand ready to do their master s bidding at a moment s warning for instance to bring them a bundle of green twigs on which to feast According to their imaginative stories the life of a beaver cannot be rivaled in happiness and if we could put full credence in their descriptions of the pastimes of the animal his palaces and luxuries we could only compare a beaver to a citizen of Venice in her most palmy days the difference between the two being that the former enjoyed himself more in the water than the latter did on it in his favorite gondola The beaver when captured young can be sufficiently domesticated to make him a pet but their unattractive form is anything but an ornament to the house With young children they are very friendly though their disposition is amiable to any one They are very neat in their person and when moved from their comrades and domiciled with human beings nothing do they so much like as being allowed the daily privilege of taking a clean bath When thus engaged they are a curiosity to look at as they are very agile and particular in removing every particle of dirt We remember seeing one of these pets in the Mexican town of Culebro thus enjoying himself His owner hesitated not in taking the animal to the river which was close by and giving him his freedom On finishing his ablutions the beaver returned to where his owner was standing without making an effort to escape and by a look as much as said I am ready to return to your home The signs having been discovered the trappers next select a suitable location for a camp which they soon occupy After the pack animals are unloaded a part of the men start out to set the traps while the remainder busy themselves in looking after their wants and in cooking and guarding their property et cetera The trap is very much like the same instrument used in different sections of the United States for catching foxes wolves et cetera excepting that it is smaller and perhaps made with more skill Old trappers were very superstitious in regard to the makers of their traps for they entertained the idea that much of their good or bad fortune depended on the tools they worked with hence they always had their favorite makers and would pay more for their traps than for those of any other maker This is true also with their rifles For many years a rifle was condemned at first sight if it did not have the name of Hawkins twenty three stamped on it and it was not uncommon for them when boasting of the good qualities of their riding animals if they considered them of the maximum degree of superiority to style them regular Hawkins horses thereby showing how far in this respect their predilections grounded their opinions Footnote twenty three mister Hawkins was the owner of a large gun establishment at saint Louis Mo The setting of the trap required expertness and experience or else it availed nothing for the game to be caught is as the reader can now readily conceive very wary and his suspicions of there being anything wrong near at hand had to be allayed by concealing as much as possible the instrument from view yet it must not be far from the surface of the water and then again it had to be firmly fixed in its position by being made fast to something that was firm so as prevent its being dragged off The trapper while thus engaged is in the water About his waist there is a strap to which is attached a pouch in which is carried the bait Everything being arranged the trap is set and the bait applied when the man notes the place where he has been at work so as to recognize it again and then takes his departure to return early the following morning The beaver during this interim is attracted by the peculiar scent of the bait and as a reward for his curiosity he generally is caught by one of his paws and thus falls a prey to the hunter s pleasure The traps when visited are relieved of the contents and then set again The game is put out of its misery and carried to camp where it is skinned and where all of the pelts recently taken are stretched out dried cured and packed in small bales whenever a sufficient quantity is obtained so to do with it The trapper when in full dress for an expedition and especially after having been on one with its concomitant hair breadth escapes Indian and bear fights et cetera cuts to all appearances a sorrowful figure His wardrobe is meagre in the extreme yet it answers all of his purposes and the man would have no other When summed up it would be found to consist usually of two pairs of moccasins one or two pair of buckskin pantaloons two woollen shirts a loose fringed buckskin coat and an old slouched hat usually made of some kind of skin with the fur on His baggage limited to a very small bundle comprises his blankets a buffalo robe or two a spare hide of dressed buckskin his extra garments above spoken of and a little tobacco when it can be had These with his camp kettle and outfit of powder lead extra traps scanty allowance of provisions guns pistols horses bridles twenty four saddles et cetera make up his traveling and working kit it may be only for a few months or it may be for years With them he was ready to penetrate the loftiest mountains and unexplored regions This is but a true picture in a brief space of the appearance of Kit Carson and the resources of his earlier days the tools he had to work with the mode of doing his labor and the habits of the animal he diligently hunted for several years in order that his fellow man might convert into a luxury the products of his toil yet had he been allowed the choice he would not have exchanged situations with the consumer of the commodity In the company of his boon companions and enjoying the pure mountain air he had often seen as happy hours as ever fell to the lot of any man And now he was starting out on probably his last trapping expedition Footnote twenty four These saddles and bridles are queer looking articles but for use they could not be surpassed either for durability or comfort Their bridle bits are the same as are used by the Mexicans They are very powerful and intended for managing wild horses and mules particularly the latter With one in his mouth an animal cannot drink or feed A Mexican only waters his horse twice a day when traveling viz morning and night The party did not return to their homes until several months had expired and as much of the excitement that used to pertain to their former exploits had been worn off from the changes brought about by civilization they decided that this as far as they were concerned should be their last trapping expedition therefore this visit to their old haunts was a sort of funeral service performed over their early adventures On quitting each favorite river the trappers felt that they were shaking hands with the streams and bidding them one by one a final good bye Kit Carson after disposing of his beaver occupied himself in attending to his ranche and was thus employed when news was brought to New Mexico of the exorbitant prices which sheep were bringing in California He made up his mind to embark in a speculation in those animals by collecting a herd and driving it to that territory He set out for the valley of Rio Abajo which lies to the south of Santa Fe and there to his satisfaction made his purchases In company with two friends after employing a suitable number of shepherds he commenced his journey and traveled northward to Fort Laramie where he came to and followed the emigrant road that leads direct into California via Salt Lake et cetera In the month of August eighteen fifty three after meeting with very trifling losses as he traveled very slowly and understood thoroughly the business he was employed in Kit Carson with his flock of sixty five hundred sheep reached the point of his destination in California where he found no difficulty in disposing of them at the rate of five dollars and fifty cents per head The making of these long journeys with such large herds of sheep over a diversified country sometimes abounding in water and grass while on the other hand and not unfrequently for many miles the earth is barren is a difficult task When broad deep and swift rivers are to be forded it requires dexterity and management to prevent heavy losses The trail which Kit Carson followed to Fort Laramie is now a well beaten path It runs almost due north from Taos and abounds in the proper season in good grass and water For about one hundred and twenty miles it passes through a broken country but when that distance is accomplished the traveler is ushered on to the plains and keeps on them for most of the way close under the Rocky Mountains The scenery on this route is most magnificent and at times as grand perhaps as can be seen in any part of the world The distance from Taos Kit Carson s starting point to Laramie River is counted by hundreds of miles and in this great tract of country there live several of the largest and most troublesome tribes of Indians in the far West The names of these tribes are the Utahs Apaches Arrapahoes Cheyennes and Sioux A man with a large drove of sheep is so conspicuous an object that he is certain to attract their notice and bring them to him Kit Carson however was well received by them and allowed to pass unmolested They were pleased to find so formidable an enemy moving boldly into their country and bearing the olive branch of peace He however forgot not to pay them toll by presenting them with a suitable number of the sheep In this way he prevented them from being tempted to steal from him This is a usual custom and the Indians expect that this sort of attention will be shown them They do not like at all seasons of the year to have these herds pass through their country Being so large they eat up much of their grass which assists greatly to drive away the game We remember on one occasion that an American in charge of several thousand sheep started on a journey from New Mexico to California Everything went prosperously with the man until he left the Raton Mountains and entered the country inhabited by the Arrapahoes and Cheyennes At first he was received in a friendly manner by these Indians but was commanded by them to rest where he was until they went ahead and killed their annual amount of buffalo This the man could not do for the season was so far advanced that if he delayed and then attempted to make California he would be certainly overtaken by snow storms which would bury him and his property in the mountains In vain he used his best endeavors to impress this state of affairs on the minds of the Indians They would not listen to him or sanction his going on and threatened to punish him if he undertook to disobey them Bidding defiance to these threats this man started but had only proceeded a few miles when a band of one hundred squaws mounted on horseback overtook him and dashed into his herd and with savage delight put to death one hundred and fifty of the sheep before their owner s eyes and without his being able to stop them The carcasses of the slaughtered animals were left to rot on the ground thereby showing that the Indians did not stand in need of food but that they wished to teach the intruder a lesson which he would be apt to remember These women had been sent out by their husbands who no doubt were close by in case their services should be needed to show to the white man the contempt they had of his power The result was that the American was obliged to return to New Mexico from whence he came When he set out again he chose what is known as the Southern Route which runs via the Rio Gila and strikes California in its lower section In the Rocky Mountains the Indian women are rather small in stature but from their constant exercise they are physically very strong They are naturally not wanting in modesty but being compelled to work and even engage in war they soon become roughened and hardened Their dresses consist principally of deer skins and sometimes they are very tastefully arranged They give birth to their children with great ease and as they have not become martyrs to fashions or dress they suffer but little inconvenience from this provision of nature The children learn during their earliest years to look out for themselves and soon become expert at it The marriage ceremony amounts to little or nothing and consists of a mere barter The warrior is obliged to pay so many horses to the father for the bride We remember on one occasion buying a superior pony from a trader who said that he had obtained him from his Indian owner with great difficulty The facts were as follows This Indian was in love with a young maiden of his tribe The young girl wished some silver ornaments which the trader had The only thing the warrior had to exchange for these trinkets was his prized pony An old chief stood by with the trader and saw the warrior look and sigh at his horse The chief gave the trader a wink and said in a low tone of voice to him That man loves his horse and he loves his affianced bride but the bride elect will conquer Hold on and he will sacrifice the horse to please the girl His love for her is the deepest feeling Sure enough this came true and we never regretted that it was so The pony proved a valuable addition to our stock of animals Besides the many dangers to his flock which a person runs the risk of both from the numerous accidents to which it is liable and the unwelcome visits of the Indians when thus traveling there are others which may occasionally happen to his own person He may be while standing guard suddenly attacked and bitten by a mad wolf On this event occurring he is almost certain to be seized with that terrible and we might as well add incurable disease hydrophobia which renders him a most pitiful object to behold From a human being so recently respected and beloved by his companions a person thus unfortunate is suddenly changed into an object most dreaded and detested A party of Mexicans in charge of a large herd of sheep a few years since were bound to California One night a large ferocious wolf entered the camp and bit a man in the leg Symptoms of hydrophobia very soon set in and in a short time the victim was a confirmed case of the disease His comrades had no proper means of taking care of and transporting him as they were hundreds of miles from the nearest house They were superstitious and believed that all would die if they kept the man s company any longer accordingly they drove a stake in the ground to which they inhumanly secured him and after depositing a small allowance of provisions near by they left him to die Human bones were afterwards found near the identical spot where it was said this unfortunate incident happened which afforded strong circumstantial evidence that the man had eked out a miserable existence soon after he was deserted by his so called friends and also that the truth of this story rested upon strong probability When the Americans first obtained possession of New Mexico sheep could be bought at the rate of twenty five cents per head The reason of this was the want of a market and the ease with which they were raised Cheapness of labor also assisted in reducing their value The wool of these sheep was rather coarse resembling hair more than wool The only use in which it was employed was for manufacturing blankets rough carpet and in filling mattresses The valley of the Rio Grande is wonderful as a sheep growing country The mountain districts also cannot be excelled in this respect Their fitness for grazing is best exemplified by their abounding in the famous Rocky Mountain sheep In many respects this animal resembles the chamois They live on the tops of the highest peaks eat the tenderest grass and produce the finest flavored mutton in the world One of their heads with the horns often weighs one hundred pounds To shoot them requires all of an experienced hunter s skill and when he has brought down one of these trophies he feels he has done more than if he had killed ten deer The sight of one of these mountain sheep as perched on a high rocky peak is beautiful The hostile Indians are the main drawback in New Mexico to the successful raising of sheep The usual modus operandi employed by Mexican herders who cannot be surpassed in their vocation to which they appear to take intuitively although many of them serve an apprenticeship at it which begins with early life and ends only by death is to send a youth who leads a goat in advance of the flock From some strange and unaccountable reason the sheep will follow after him even to the crossing of rivers whose currents are deep and swift The shepherds with their dogs to assist them when necessary allow the herd to scatter over a space varying in its size but always allowing sufficient area so that the animals can move on at their ease and at the same time be able to feed The danger above all others that is to be apprehended and guarded against while thus travelling is crowding for in this manner when journeying through deep gorges in the mountains and over the precipitous banks of rivers hundreds of sheep can be and not unfrequently are smothered When this crowding commences it is next to impossible to arrest it a sort of panic prevails over the entire herd and they rush on one on top of another until a mass of dead and dying is thus piled up and a barrier is made or else until as most frequently happens a bridge of carcasses is formed over which the survivors pass in safety The Indians who inhabit the country on the various routes to California have a strong predilection for mutton which is a fact to bear in mind when migrating with this sort of property Such accidents as having a few sheep bitten by rattlesnakes and also a certain percentage becoming foot sore and breaking down from fatigue are common to every herd that crosses the Rocky Mountains Economy in living is the great fundamental principle among the lower classes of the Mexicans therefore when a sheep is going to die from fatigue or any simple disease natural death is anticipated by the herders with the aid of the hunting knife and the meat being dressed and cooked is unhesitatingly eaten by them Next to the Mexican shepherd his dog although he is not generally a handsome animal is found to be ever faithful in guarding the flocks The greatest enemy to the herds is the wolf and in keeping them at bay and preventing their inroads by night the dog is capable of performing valuable service hence no band of sheep should cross the plains and mountains without a full complement of them It was at one of the frontier towns of California that Kit Carson disposed of his flock There having heard of the rapid and marvelous growth of San Francisco he made up his mind to verify these reports with his own eyes for he was well acquainted with its ancient aspect San Francisco had now had since the year eighteen forty eight to grow under the impulse of the gold fever Kit Carson remembered it a Spanish settlement as it existed in eighteen forty five six seven then containing not over two hundred inhabitants In eighteen forty seven the first gold discovery was made at Sutter s Fort In two months thereafter about two hundred fifty thousand dollars in gold dust were carried into the town The next two months six hundred thousand dollars more In February eighteen forty nine the population of the town was two thousand In the six months following it increased to five thousand In the early part of the year eighteen fifty the population had increased to nearly twenty thousand In eighteen fifty two according to the census it was thirty four thousand eight hundred and seventy The first settlement made at San Francisco was commenced in the year seventeen seventy six The place was then called Yerba Buena or Good Herb from the fact that an herb of that name which was supposed to have great medicinal value grew in rich luxuriance over the surrounding country The houses were at first built of adobes or sun dried bricks It is now one of the most important cities on the western continent As Kit Carson neared this great emporium of California possessed of some of the details of its astonishing growth and remembering it as it existed when its inhabitants could be easily counted in an hour he was perfectly astonished to behold the great changes which a few short years had produced Had it not been for the immovable landmarks about the city and the familiar scenery of the bay he would have been entirely at a loss in considering that this was the spot called San Francisco which he had visited in former years This metropolis however like all others presented few attractions to Kit Carson s vision further than its objects of curiosity which were a source of interest and amusement to him When he had finished sight seeing he was ready and anxious to be on his way to New Mexico Previous to his setting out he went on business to Sacramento City While there he received a message from his friend and partner Maxwell asking him to wait until the latter could come in with a herd of sheep from Carson River when they could join forces and return home together Kit Carson s stay in California was shortened by the annoyance as he considered it of being made a lion His society was constantly courted by men whom he had never seen he was passed free on steamboats and to all places of public amusement and in fact the people in acknowledging his worth treated him with marked distinction He was pointed out wherever he went as a man who had done the State great service This reward of his merit was indeed a just tribute to his worth Kit felt himself highly honored and favored but he did not expect or wish such attention He felt himself to be a humble individual who had honestly and faithfully performed his duty as it had been assigned to him and his modesty would not allow him to ask or be willing to receive any other than the unexpressed opinion of the people There were some men there always are such persons in every community who sought his company expecting to hear him boast of his deeds and proclaim himself a hero such as had never before existed but what must have been their surprise on seeing his unassuming bearing his disregard of notoriety and his anxiety to escape that popularity which they themselves would have highly prized Tired by the anxiety and hard work of bringing his property over a long and dangerous journey to a good market he had looked for rest and retirement but instead he was everywhere sought out and made conspicuous And here we pause to speak of the noble qualities of moral character and good judgment evinced by Kit Carson on this occasion of his eventful life He found himself surrounded with the choice spirits of the new El Dorado his name a prestige of strength and position and his society courted by everybody The siren voice of pleasure failed not to speak in his ear her most flattering invitations Good fellowship took him incessantly by the hand desiring to lead him into the paths of dissipation But the gay vortex with all its brilliancy had no attractions for him the wine cup with its sparkling arguments failed to convince his calm earnestness of character that his simple habits of life needed remodeling To the storm however he was exposed but like a good ship during the gale he weathered the fierce blast and finally took his departure from the new city of a day with his character untarnished but nevertheless leaving behind him many golden opinions With a hurried farewell and many kind remembrances of the good people of California he left their great city to return to a home where he was certain to find a life better suited to his tastes Money getting had no charms for him Had he chosen to accept some of the offers made him while then in San Francisco he could easily have amassed an immense fortune But his home had now the greater allurements and a legitimate business gave him the certainty of comfort The power merely which wealth assumes Kit Carson never has desired to grasp The time had nearly arrived for the appearance of Maxwell He finally joined Kit Carson when the two immediately engaged in the very profitable work of disposing of their sheep The market proved to be quite active so much so that they disposed of their entire flock at high cash values without the least difficulty The speculation thus proved to be highly satisfactory to all concerned In a monetary point of view the adventure proved to be the most fortunate in which Kit Carson had been engaged Heretofore money had been a second consideration with Kit Carson He had directed his energies and attention to almost everything or at least to many things besides its accumulation The sums which he had received for the important services rendered both to government officers and private individuals had been expended on the wants of his family and on his suffering friends and countrymen A trifling amount had always sufficed to satisfy his own immediate desires The calls upon his purse at the end of each year had left therefore but little which he could call his own The snug sum now at his disposal Kit Carson determined to lay by and serving as a nucleus around it he has since accumulated enough amply to supply those comforts which will tend in his old age to make him happy Maxwell and Carson decided to return to their homes by the southern route which runs through the country on and adjacent to the Rio Gila Maxwell determined to take a steamer down the coast as far as Los Angelos distant from San Francisco about three hundred and fifty miles and used his best endeavors to persuade his friend Kit Carson to accompany him In this however he failed Already one cruise over a part of the ocean route which Maxwell contemplated making had been made by Kit Carson in eighteen forty six and which had so sickened him of sea life that he resolved never to travel on salt water again while it was in his power to obtain a mule to assist him in journeying by land Maxwell by his water conveyance reached Los Angelos fifteen days in advance of Kit Carson and employed himself in making the necessary preparations for their trip to New Mexico When Kit rejoined his companion everything was in readiness for them to proceed on their route and in a day or so afterwards they started Everything favored them until they reached a village belonging to some Pimo Indians and located on the Rio Gila Here the grass became suddenly very scarce They learned from these Indians that the season had been unusually dry and that if they attempted to proceed on the regular trail they would do so at the risk of losing their animals by starvation While undecided as to which was the best course to pursue Kit Carson informed the party that he could guide them over a new route which though difficult and rough to travel he felt confident would afford sufficient forage to answer all their purposes At once the men agreed to be governed by their experienced friend s advice and having signified to him their willingness to do so they resumed their march following up the Rio Gila until they came to the mouth of the San Pedro when they struck out up the latter for three days and then parted with it to risk the chances of reaching at the end of each day the small mountain creeks that lay on their contemplated route After traveling in as direct a course as the nature of the country would admit they arrived seasonably at the copper mines of New Mexico While pursuing this experimental journey Kit Carson who was well acquainted with the general outline of the country but was not equally conversant with it in reference to the certainty of finding eligible camping sites where wood water and grass presented themselves in abundance was frequently made the subject of a tantalizing joke by the men of the party Occasionally his memory would not solve the question what is the next course He had neither map chart nor compass and depended entirely upon old landmarks Occasionally the resemblance of different mountains one to another would serve to embarrass him For a time he would become doubtful as to the exact course to pursue At such moments the mischievous dispositions of the men would get the better of their judgment and they would exert their lungs in shouting to him as he spurred his riding animal to keep out of the sound of their raillery He was not always successful in this and occasionally a few sentences reached him like the following Hurrah I say are you the famous Kit Carson who knows this country so well Are you really a good pilot or are you lost These and similar expressions saluted Kit s ear a language to which he had not been heretofore accustomed as some impediment such as a fallen tree a rock a swamp or a creek staid for a brief period his progress thus allowing the party to approach within speaking distance The remarks might have temporarily chafed his spirit but he had too much good sense to allow his friends to see that they had gained any advantage over him He rode boldly on and answered their raillery with silence He knew however very well that his turn would come and when he had brought them in safety to a spot with which all were familiar he turned the tables on them by retorting to their questions in a playful manner which made their future interpretation of his occasional doubts less sweeping in its conclusions Kit succeeded in guiding the party safely to the Copper Mines from whence their route was plain From the Copper Mines the party traveled through to the Rio del Norte This river is eighteen hundred miles in length and forms the boundary line between Texas and Mexico It takes its rise in the Rocky Mountains and empties into the Gulf of Mexico It is navigable for small steamers sloops and schooners for a distance of about four hundred and fifty miles from its mouth About nine hundred miles from its mouth there is a spot where the river is only about three or four feet deep Here the Apache and Camanche Indians always cross when on their depredatory tramps into Mexico Leaving the Rio Grande or del Norte the party pursued their homeward route through the settlements of the Rio Abajo and Santa Fe and finally reached Taos on the twenty third day of December eighteen fifty three Soon after the party entered the Territory of New Mexico Kit Carson accidentally met the Mormon delegate to Congress That person informed Kit Carson that the appointment of an Indian Agent had been conferred upon him On learning this piece of intelligence Kit was much elated He felt that the office was perfectly suited to his tastes and he was honestly impressed with the belief that he was capable of performing the duties of this office and of accomplishing much good His happiness and pride were heightened by thinking that finally his services had met the approbation of his government the substantial proof of which was the offering to him of an important trust without solicitation on his part Immediately on arriving at Taos he wrote an answer to the authorities at Washington in which he expressed his willingness to serve the government and the pleasure he felt in accepting the office at the same time he sent the necessary bond required of persons who hold this appointment Hardly had Kit Carson been ushered into his new duties before the Jiccarilla Apaches who formed one of the tribes of his agency began to show new signs of dissatisfaction by committing various kinds of outrages on the property and lives of the citizens of the northern part of New Mexico To arrest them in their career and make them amenable for the crimes they had already committed Lieutenant Bell of the twod Regiment of United States dragoons was sent in quest of them He found them on the Red River and at once commenced operations against them At first these red men were equally ready to break a lance in combat with their foes but after the soldiers had made two charges and penetrated through and through their ranks they were although in superior numbers glad to give up the mastership of the field and run away In this fight the Apaches lost by his being killed one of their great chiefs besides many warriors On the side of the soldiers two men were killed and several seriously wounded A short time after the news of this skirmish had reached Taos Kit Carson found it necessary in order to attend to some official business to proceed to Santa Fe but just as he was on the point of setting out he was informed that a large party of these Jiccarilla Apaches had recently arrived at a place in the mountains only about twenty miles from Taos and were there encamped With the view of pacifying them if it was possible Kit Carson immediately posted thither and with no small degree of peril attending his movements for he went unattended and among Indians who were at the time very bitter against the whites he confronted their head men in their den He needed no introduction for during many years he had been well known to them Therefore he proceeded at once to business After passing through the usual Indian salutations he commenced by haranguing them in a style that most pleases their fancy thereby fixing their attention on what he was saying Among other things he forewarned them that the course they were pursuing if persisted in would prove the cause of their being exterminated as their Great Father the President had at his disposal thousands of soldiers to replace those who fell in battle while when their warriors were killed they could not immediately place others in their moccasins When a warrior was killed they were compelled to wait until their children grew up He added that the Great Father loved his red children and through him whose servant he was he wished to give them annuities and otherwise aid them in living at peace These Indians on learning that Kit Carson was their agent expressed great pleasure and at his earnest solicitation came forward and professed friendship So little reliance however was to be placed in this tribe that Kit Carson doubted their sincerity although he exacted every pledge which he thought would in the least tend to bind them to their promises he feared they would not prove true Having finished his business Kit bent his way to Santa Fe but he had not more than reached there before he heard that the Jiccarillas had already become tired of the restraints which he had placed upon them and had broken out in open defiance of the authorities From this time onward so thick and fast did their wicked crimes increase that coercive measures became necessary to put them down This finally resulted in as sanguinary a battle being fought between a small band of soldiers and this tribe as was ever recorded A rapid sketch of it must suffice to illustrate to the reader what kind of a fight this was and what plucky fellows these Apaches are Lieutenant J W Davidson with a command of sixty men belonging to F and I companies of the first Regiment of United States dragoons was ordered out to seek and act against these red men Both the soldiers and their officers were renowned for their bravery and experience in Indian mode of warfare hence more than ordinary deeds were expected to be performed by them The result will show that they did not disappoint any reasonable expectation Lieutenant Davidson marched to the Embuda Mountains which range lies between fifteen and twenty miles southwest of Taos as he had been informed by good authority that the Indians were to be found there On reaching the mountains he soon came upon the savages and found them fully prepared to meet him They had selected their ground with great skill The site which they had chosen was upon a high elevation and at the first glance to get at them appeared to be an impossibility on account of the roughness of the country If the Indians had hunted over the whole of the Rocky Mountains they could not have hit upon a place that offered them so many advantages for the use to which they intended to put it but as the red men had by great labor reached the tops of the crags therefore the soldiers resolved not to be outdone even if they had to be the assaulting party The strength of the Apaches amounted to eight lodges or two hundred and forty warriors and as they were on foot and without their families they were entirely unencumbered Lieutenant Davidson s first manoeuvre was to send in advance a small party whose duty it was to act as spies while at the same time they endeavoured to engage the Indians in a talk of which they are usually so fond but the courage of the red men was apparently much elevated on seeing the smallness of the whole force sent against them therefore they received the advance with such coldness that the latter soon after gladly retreated to their companions who were halted on the little creek that runs by the foot of the mountains Lieutenant Davidson now saw that his only course was to commence the attack and trust to fortune and the bravery of his men Therefore he ordered the gallant fellows to dismount and after leaving their horses with a small guard they commenced the work of scrambling up the rocks so that they might get at and dislodge the enemy In this they succeeded notwithstanding they met with a powerful and determined resistance In the attempt five soldiers were killed and when the dragoons had reached the highest eminence of the mountain they found to their disappointment that the Apaches had not taken to flight according to their anticipations but instead they were scattering and surrounding them There being great danger as already demonstrations were visible in that quarter that the Indians would capture the horses of the soldiers therefore Lieutenant Davidson placed himself at the head of his men and led them back to the spot where the animals were congregated In so doing he was obliged to fight his way as every foot of ground he passed over was stoutly contested but at last he arrived just in time to save them The fight then became desultory but desperate on the part of the soldiers for the Indians by concealing themselves behind rocks trees and whatever came in their way were quite secure against injury from the carbines and revolvers of the whites while from their side came a deadly fire that fast diminished the numbers of their adversaries In vain did the dragoons charge them and cause the foremost of the enemy to retreat to their friends in the rear Lieutenant Davidson soon found his party so much crippled in strength that he saw he could no longer protect his horses and at the same time carry on the combat against such great odds When there was little left that he could do except to offer himself and men as targets to be shot at Lieutenant Davidson reluctantly ordered his men to retreat In obeying this command the soldiers had not more than wheeled about when down came the foe in full pursuit making the very air ring with their war whoops and unearthly shouts So bold did these Indians become from the victory which they had achieved that they charged so hotly and so near the soldiers that the latter were compelled in self defence to turn and in a hand to hand contest beat them off After resisting a succession of these assaults the command finally gained the main road Upon counting his men Lieutenant Davidson found that twenty of them were killed and left behind on the battle field and that out of the surviving forty hardly one man had escaped being wounded thereby showing considering the numbers engaged how bravely the fight had been maintained and how gallantly each one had endeavored to turn the tide of affairs to a more favorable result The course pursued by and even the bravery of Lieutenant Davidson in this affair has been unjustly assailed and questioned by some persons who have probably been misinformed on the subject Judging from the evidence of his companions there was not a more courageous man on that ground than the officer in command Kit Carson refutes the accusation made against his friend in the following strain I am intimately acquainted with Lieutenant Davidson and have been in engagements with him where he has taken a prominent part and can testify that he is as brave and discreet as it is possible for a man to be Nearly every person engaged in and who survived that day s bloody battle has since told me that his commanding officer never once sought shelter but stood manfully exposed to the aim of the Indians encouraging his men and apparently entirely unmindful of his own life It was however in the retreat they say that he acted the most gallantly for when everything was going badly with the soldiers he was as cool and collected as if under the guns of his fort The only anxiety he exhibited was for the safety of his remaining men The Indians must have lost many of their warriors in this fight but the exact number has never been ascertained The news of the defeat was brought by the retreating soldiers themselves to the town of Taos where on hearing it for short time consternation seized hold of its inhabitants but slowly they calmed down and a party consisting of Americans and Mexicans with wagons was sent out to bring in the mutilated remains of the fallen On reaching the field the dead were found but they were all mutilated and stripped of all their clothing The Indians had left nothing which they thought might be turned to the least account One poor fellow had escaped the rigid scrutiny of the red men by crawling to an obscure place where he had died from his wounds On his body was found a belt that contained three hundred dollars in gold his hard earnings that he had been saving up against a day of need Had the savages known of this money they would not have left it for they are quite familiar with the use if not with the real value of gold A few days later the Apaches made their appearance in a small Mexican settlement which was far distant from the scene of their success They were dressed in portions of the uniforms and accoutrements taken from the dead dragoons and as they sauntered about the town they would salute each other in military style and otherwise mock the actions of the military men Calling for a piece of paper one fellow with a bit of charcoal pretended to write on it an order No doubt by so doing he thought he was imitating something of the kind which he had seen done at a military post After making a few scratches on the paper he handed it to one of his red companions and with a smile on his rough countenance addressed to him some directions in reference to the document Although the Mexicans were much amused at these burlesque actions of the Indians yet they did not dare to show their mirth until the latter had departed and left them in possession of their lives The day following the one on which the fight had taken place Kit Carson returned from Santa Fe and passed near to the spot where the soldiers had been so roughly handled but he did not see a visage of an Apache They had by that time traveled to the west side of the Rio del Norte Indeed he anticipated no danger to himself as he was well aware that the safest time to travel through any section of an Indian country is just after the savages have been guilty of some highhanded act They are then instinctively as some may say but as the fact appears to us by use of their reasoning powers well aware that active measures will be set on foot to repay them for their rascality The trail which on this occasion Kit Carson traveled over in coming from Santa Fe is one of the most interesting routes in safe times that the mere traveler can select It comprises some of the most beautiful scenery in New Mexico The length of the trail is about seventy five miles and so many windings and turns does it make through mountains forests and gorges that every hundred yards furnishes a suitable place for an Indian ambuscade The largest part of the country which lies between Taos and Santa Fe is mountainous therefore this trail is one series of ascents and descents The greatest pitch is near the scene of the fight in which Lieutenant Davidson and his command were engaged where the path in order to avoid an almost perpendicular declivity makes a zig zag course To accomplish the ascent of this mountain on a good riding animal it takes at least two hours therefore the height of the mountain can be easily imagined by those accustomed to mountain climbing On reaching some of these immense eminences the scenery is principally formed by the broken country studded here and there with mountains which appear as if in miniature as well as real Between are valleys rivers creeks canons et cetera which render the views truly grand There is sufficient woodland plenty of pure air and different species of game in great abundance playing about and filling up the picture with life To use the words of romance this does not fail to make the scenery perfect The trail runs through hamlets and villages which come in at the proper distances and form great auxiliaries to the traveler when fatigued by horseback riding for at most of these places the traveler can find rest for the night always provided that he be willing to submit to a multitude of inconveniences The most desirable place at which to stop on this trail is a town nearly midway between Taos and Santa Fe It is called Rio Arriba In this village the traveler can obtain many comforts which are denied him even in the larger towns At the present time it is a very difficult matter for loaded caravans to pass direct from Santa Fe to Taos but the United States government has taken the matter in hand and has appropriated large sums of money for making a good road between the two places therefore it will not be a long time before the transit will be accomplished with ease and safety Scattered over the country adjacent to this trail now under consideration there are many hamlets and villages which are being greatly augmented by new settlers yearly Many of these have been seldom if ever visited by white men and the minute geography of this tract of country is still in the embryo Perhaps a new El Dorado is there in store for mankind and that some day its resources will receive an impetus and be developed by the sudden discovery of valuable mines therein This is no chimerical illusion it scarcely rests upon an uncertainty for the mineral wealth of New Mexico we are firmly persuaded is still in its infancy To use trapper language judging from signs which exist there in abundance we shall not be surprised to hear in time that this territory has turned out to be a second California Rumors of gold and even specimens of the article itself are frequent in many parts of the country but the poverty of the inhabitants keeps them from searching as they ought in order to make the discovery The Americans find a more profitable business in commerce and trade therefore they but seldom indulge in speculations designed to develop the mineral wealth of the country but nevertheless they have faith that gold in immense quantities exists there and believe that in time scientific men will disclose the fact and position We have seen quills full of gold dust which has been collected there and we are well acquainted with men who have washed out from several streams in the northern part of the Territory the value of two and a half dollars per diem but with the high prices of living this rate of produce cannot be made to pay unless the work shall be carried on by the assistance of capital On this trail to Santa Fe there are several small Pueblos which are inhabited by the descendants of the ancient Aztecs These settlements generally are quite thrifty and exhibit many external appearances of comfort To prepare and cultivate the soil it takes much labor in irrigating and bestowing other farming operations upon the land in order to bring crops to perfection Hence these people like the New Mexicans can realize from their toil but little beyond their own subsistence This trail as it approaches Santa Fe enters through groves of small pines which are many miles in extent In such places the ground is sandy and the vegetation poor in the extreme It has proved an exceedingly difficult problem for more than one mind to solve the reason why the capital of the Territory should have been located in such a barren section of the country Perhaps it was because this was the most central spot that could be selected although such a reason can hardly be offered in sober earnestness The most charitable reasoning which we can offer for it is because the Mexicans knew no better It is true there are valuable silver mines near by but this could only cause a town to be raised to suit the miners and not to form the attraction where the elite of New Mexican society should for so many years congregate Santa Fe is located on a plateau of ground which is about seven thousand feet above the level of the sea The town itself contains about five or six thousand inhabitants which includes all races It is built of adobes or sun burnt brick and occupies both sides of a small stream which is called the Rio Chicito and which flows into the Rio Grande nearly twenty miles from the town The site of Santa Fe is low when compared with the altitude of the surrounding country being bounded on nearly all sides by lofty mountains One of these mountains is quite famous It is the loftiest of all in that section of country and is capped during the greater part of the year with snow As is invariably the case with the large majority of Mexican towns there is but little regularity in the streets of Santa Fe but yet the plaza is easily reached by several avenues Santa Fe forms the grand commercial emporium of the great interior continent of North America and its trade diverges to every point of the compass The extent of this trade can be realized when we assert the fact that with the State of Missouri alone it amounts annually to several millions of dollars In the south it has overland communication even with the city of Mexico If the tariff between the two countries could be arranged upon a more equitable footing than it now is the Mexican trade would swell into an enormous sum Every acquisition of a new territory in the far west and southwest aids in developing the commerce of Santa Fe therefore until steam shall cause a revolution in the course of trade this town must necessarily increase greatly in importance The stores in the town are mostly owned and the mercantile business chiefly carried on by Americans These American speculators are celebrated for the daring manner with which they launch out their money upon various enterprises With them the greater the risk when their chances appear that the gain will be large the more eager they are in facing the hazard They sometimes lose but oftentimes realize large fortunes The appearance of these stores is captivating to the fancy and many of them would be ornaments to any of the larger cities or towns of the east The most expensive articles of luxury and dress are to be found in them and in these distant parts such property commands a price which would startle and quite shake the nerves of a prince but when the people can obtain the money they purchase everything which their fancy dictates A Santa Fe senorita dashes in her rich silks which have cost hundreds of dollars with as much grace as does one of the Washington or Fifth Avenue belles clothed in the same luxuriant style In Santa Fe we are sorry to say it requires vice of the worst shade for women to support such a style of living but the morals of the Mexicans are so loose in all classes that virtue is boldly parted with by both sexes in a spirit which the triumphs of natural reason alone ought to prevent and which no lover of humanity can admire or tolerate Gambling in this town has long held its full sway and many is the victim which this wretched wickedness has prematurely hurried into a vortex from which there has been no recovery The palmy days of gambling in San Francisco have been rivaled in the little town of Santa Fe and the boldness with which the Mexican player will part with his last dollar shows the hardened state to which the man and what is perhaps worse the woman have been brought by years of habitual playing for money In olden times the Mexicans used to travel hundreds of miles and bring their money with them in order to squander it at their favorite game of monte Not only this fact is true but men will often sell themselves into the slavery of debt in order to satisfy their craving desire to gamble The town of Santa Fe is watered by azequias or small canals which are used in every section of the Territory with which to irrigate the soil Near the town and on a hill adjoining stands the ruins of Fort Marcy which was used by the American Volunteers during the conquest of the country in the year eighteen forty six This fort commands the town and for the purpose which governed its building it answered very well There are several good boarding houses in Santa Fe and one hotel which is well fitted up and well kept It forms the rendezvous for the whole town The commanding general of the military department which comprises the Territory of New Mexico with his staff makes this town his head quarters There is also a garrison of American soldiers stationed in the town The governor of the territory the judges surveyor and all the government officials of any importance make this place their home The Territorial buildings being the halls of legislation and such other buildings as are necessary for the State and Territorial purposes both finished and under process of erection are located in Santa Fe On one side of the plaza there stands a long low building known as the Palace No one however would be aware of the fact if not informed of it for the building has more the appearance of having been intended for a rope walk than for the assemblage of savants who were to discuss and arrange matters of state and public interest Notwithstanding the small pretensions in the way of architecture which the Palace presents nevertheless within it there have lived old Mexican governors who ruled their people with a rod of iron and whose fiery impulses went forth as just and equitable law These tyrants for it was very seldom that the poor and ignorant New Mexicans were favored with a good wise and just governor governed on the principle of self aggrandizement Being far separated from their home government they took care to smother all evil reports while the good only were allowed to circulate and these so far as the home government was concerned solely by their authority in order to have the desired effect to retain them in office In this they were usually successful as they generally retained their lucrative positions until cut off by death or until they had amassed a fortune which made their tasks burdensome Many of these men might have been envied by the richest among Americans so far as wealth is considered They were so envied by the wealthy men at the capital of the republic These provinces of Mexico were the Indies where troublesome opponents were to be sent by government to suck like leeches the public treasury and thus obtain their fill to repletion When the United States came into possession of the territory of New Mexico affairs were somewhat tempered to the state of reason and justice but a people who had so long been kept down could not at once appreciate the value of the changes consequently they have been slow in elevating their heads to the proper standard of men The legislature of New Mexico as it has been recognized under the constitution of the United States resembles other forms of territorial governments This statement is true in theory but not in practice for it is impossible to collect an uneducated people unused to self government and allow them to steer their own bark as law makers without observing that they make many openings for serious mistakes to creep in which are and should be severely criticised The pioneer laws as they came from the first New Mexican legislature were faulty in the extreme They seemed to point out wickedness as a punishment for wickedness If we desired to afford our readers a laugh we should permit them to read many of these laws The simple perusal of them would cause merriment equal to the most laughable comedy Had it not been for the few white men who from time to time have found their way into the legislature of New Mexico the whole body would long since have lost themselves in the depth of learning which their untutored minds had undertaken to engraft upon their statute books The members of this body for a long time turned their attention more to the emoluments which naturally accrued from their position than to endeavors to steady the helm of government for the good of their country In order to save their pay they studied economy which caused them to make a beggarly appearance and in the eyes of the white men they were often contemptibly mean Greatly predominating in numbers the Mexicans of course had no difficulty in ruling the country and they naturally preferred their own countrymen in filling the law making department of their government The consequence was that they thus obtained a crowd of legislators who could hardly read By the aid of a few schools an enlightened press and the examples of a few worthy Americans they are gradually mending their ways in this respect and the time will come in a few years when the legislature of New Mexico will compare favorably with its sister territories but this not until education has made her indelible mark upon the people The town of Santa Fe is provided with a Roman Catholic church which under the judicious management of the present bishop and clergy is doing what it can to improve the condition of the Mexican population Other religious denominations have not yet been fully developed although the attempt is being made to establish churches of the Protestant faith on a sure and permanent footing but this although we regard it as certain will take time for the majority of the people lean strongly to the Roman Catholic faith It is a very singular fact that among a population of seventy thousand souls included in the limits of the Territory of New Mexico there have been such feeble and vain attempts made by Protestant missionaries to bring the people to their mode of thinking The task might have been impossible when the country was under the jurisdiction of old Mexico but since it has changed masters this excuse does not hold good The Mexicans as a body learn readily they easily discern between right and wrong and as the field for Christian enterprise to work in is large enough for all sects it is strange that the Protestant church is not found laboring in the good cause side by side with its Roman Catholic friend It is true there are a few persons struggling on under the auspices of the Protestant church but they are so few that they are seldom met in the great expanse of the country Santa Fe has long been celebrated as having a depraved population but as honest and honorable men are now working with satisfactory success for a reformation the day cannot be far distant when this town will redeem itself It is true that not many years back Santa Fe was filled with gamblers and desperadoes of all grades but at the present time law and order is beginning to predominate and it is to be hoped that the next generation will see a better state of affairs The vices which have characterized the inhabitants have not been confined by any means to the Mexicans but rather they have been exemplified in those Americans with bad characters who have from time to time crept in among the people These men in several instances have set examples which the most debased Mexican would hesitate to follow The appearance of Santa Fe from an outside view is anything but striking Its houses like most Mexican buildings are seldom higher than one story and with few exceptions they are entirely wanting in beauty They are built after what may be styled a Mexican mode of architecture and consist of a series of rooms which encircle an open square or court the access to which is through a large portal These buildings are usually huddled together towards the centre or plaza while in the outskirts of the town they are greatly scattered The arrangement of the streets appears as if they were mere matters of accident rather than matters of system or intention The town is ornamented by few if any trees while the general appearance of the adjacent country as has been seen is barren The markets of the town are but sparingly supplied with a variety and those articles which are the most common bring comparatively speaking good prices Not many miles from Santa Fe there are famous silver mines which for many years were worked almost entirely by hand Within a recent date machinery has been introduced by some enterprising Americans and the precious silver ore is being brought to light in large quantities In point of amusement the people still cling to the pleasures of the fandango and as this town is much in advance of any other in the Territory the Santa Fe balls are carried on sometimes on quite a grand scale The majority of them are the places of resort for the free classes of society The more respectable people seldom attend them and then only when they are certain that they will find the ceremonies conducted in the spirit which administers really to pleasure and not to excess The distance from Santa Fe to the Missouri River is in the neighborhood of nine hundred miles The road for the first one hundred miles towards the Santa Fe terminus is rough and hilly but after that it strikes out on the open plains and is as level as can possibly be for such an immense distance It is over this beautiful road that we have several times described Kit Carson as he traveled to and from the United States though more frequently as has been seen he preferred routes of his own selection which enabled him with his small escorts to elude the vigilant watch of hostile Indians The rich merchandise which finds its market in New Mexico passes over this road and during the summer months the heavily laden caravans are continually traversing it CHAPTER XVI A fresh Campaign set on foot colonel Cook in Command Kit Carson goes as Guide The Apaches and Utahs leagued together The Roughness of the Country and the Privations to which the Command was exposed The Indians overhauled A running Fight The Advantages gained The Chase resumed The Apaches resort to their old Tricks colonel Cook is obliged to return to Abiquiu A Utah taken Prisoner through Mistake Kit Carson goes to Taos and has a Conference with the Chiefs of the Utah Nation Cook s second Scout He is caught in a furious Snow storm and obliged to return to Rio Colorado Major Brooks and Reinforcements come to the Rescue Major Brooks on the Lookout but fails to find the Indians Carleton s Expedition Kit Carson goes with it as Guide The Adventures met with Kit Carson s Prophecy comes true The Muache Band of Utahs summoned by Kit Carson to a Grand Council Troubles brewing among these Indians The Small Pox carries off their Head Men To retrieve the ground lost and also to show the Jiccarilla Apaches that their recent victory had tended only to stimulate the movements of the Americans to a display of greater activity and energy after a brief space of time a large body of regular troops were made ready to take the field against them The commander of this expedition was colonel Cook of the twod Regiment of United States dragoons That officer chose for his principal guide Kit Carson whose peace duties as Indian Agent had been abruptly arrested by the warlike attitude of some of his Indians It was necessary also that Kit Carson should be on the ground in case the red men were overtaken in order to ascertain whether or no the Utahs were mixed up with the operations of the Apaches A large branch of the former tribe were part and parcel of his agency and the two nations were known to be on very friendly terms with each other consequently it was surmised that they might be secretly and under disguise acting together in the war colonel Cook employed besides the troops of the line which were under his command some forty men selected from among the Mexican and Pueblo Indians whose duties were to act as spies and trailers These Pueblos were selected for spies on account of their being familiar with Indian habits and their mode of warfare They were taken from among the best hunters which the Pueblo villages could furnish They presented themselves provided with their own horses rifles and in most cases with their own ammunition and were supplied only with their rations of food When it was practicable they were allowed to kill game and being very expert at it they seldom returned from a hunt open handed Their peaceful mode of life prevented them from engaging in any deep league with the hostile Indians but yet there is no doubt that when the different tribes were at war with the whites the Pueblos harbored the warlike Indians and supplied them in many instances with such articles as they stood most in need of Their policy in thus acting might have been to retain the friendship of these Indians and thus prevent their committing any depredations on themselves The Pueblos may have taken advantage of the state of affairs when war existed and doubtless frequently did under disguise of the enemy become guilty of crimes which could easily have been proven against them The Mexicans have often tried to criminate the Pueblos for thus acting but they have proceeded with such bungling policy that it has seldom happened that anything criminal has been definitely proven against them If a part of them have thus acted there is not the least doubt but that the majority are guiltless They are as a body loyal to the government of the United States but not so much from love of the Americans as from being shrewd They know it is for self interest to keep good friends with the strongest power On these war scouts they rendered valuable service and in this light have been long regarded with favor by the whites The command of these forty Mexicans and Pueblo Indians was conferred upon James H Quinn a well known and prominent citizen of New Mexico This gentleman became intimately associated with the Territory of New Mexico soon after that country was annexed to the United States In politics military life farming and mercantile pursuits he was most actively engaged and by his talents and industry took a prominent position and became an influential member of society He had some faults who has not but his unexpected death came so suddenly upon his friends that they could only think of him for the many good qualities both of his head and heart Hence his faults were most willingly passed over in silence All things being in readiness the command entered upon the pursuit of the Indians They marched from Taos ten miles north to a stream called the Arroya Hondo Thence following the banks of this stream down through its deep and rocky canon they came to the Rio del Norte On the first named stream there is a small and unattractive settlement which bears the same name Several years since there was a large distillery in full operation at this place This establishment was owned by an American and was very extensive The building was celebrated as being the place where several Americans were slaughtered by the Mexicans during the revolution in which Governor Bent lost his life heretofore spoken of On the plain which is contiguous with the south bank of the Arroya Hondo there are to be found the remains of a large Aztec town which was at some remote period the largest settlement inhabited by that interesting people to be found in northern New Mexico At the present day can be seen the size and almost the number of houses which formed the town which are very numerous The building material as here used by the Aztecs was small cobble stones which undoubtedly were mixed with mud and thus formed the structure Pieces of pottery flint arrow points stone pipe and rude tools have been from time to time found on the site of the town going to prove that the people were not wandering in their habits but that instead they occupied their time in farming raising cattle and mining The wild Indians may have murdered the inhabitants and then destroyed the town or civil war and pestilence might have caused it to become deserted when as a natural result it fell to decay The most plausible theory to entertain is the former as every old Mexican town of the north contains relics which could not have been designed merely in case of an emergency Not one of these towns in olden times was without a large well which in most instances was bountifully supplied with water In time of peace these extensive reservoirs were covered over and concealed from view and therefore but few strangers could be made aware of their existence On the breaking out of war these wells were thrown open for public use and being located in the centre of the towns the inhabitants escaped that danger in procuring water which necessarily would have surrounded them in case they had been obliged as they are now to bring it from the neighboring streams As time rolled on and danger was lessened these wells were almost forgotten until the timber which covered them rotted and allowed their fragments and the earth to cave in when the object of the digging these reservoirs became apparent It is an established fact in history that the town of Taos once withstood a long and fearful siege but finally escaped as did its people uninjured The besieging party in this instance was composed of the Indians of the plains they were present to the number of many thousand and were at last compelled to depart as is supposed in consequence of their provisions giving out Reasoning from analogy it is no more than proper to suppose that if the early settlements of the Mexicans were thus annoyed the case of the Aztecs must have been still harder and that being overcome by numbers they were necessitated to succumb and hence were swept by the Indians of the plains from the face of the earth leaving but a dim outline of their ancient grandeur The party found the stream very much swollen by the melting of the snows in the mountains When they arrived at its fording place notwithstanding a torrent rolled before them the command was of a necessity given to cross There was no shrinking Without a single murmur the entire command set themselves about the perilous task The bed of the river at this place is rocky and shelving At low water these facts offer no great obstacles in crossing The case is very different when the torrent has reached high water mark then a single step will often plunge horse and rider into the angry waters beyond their depth Kit Carson boldly took the lead and before the infantry had all passed the horses of the dragoons had to be sent back to assist them To facilitate this fording Kit Carson crossed and recrossed the stream at least twenty times No serious accident occurred although three of the dragoons came near being swept down the current which at the time was very swift and strong Had they gone below the fording place they would most assuredly have been drowned as the river there takes a fearful leap through a cut in the rocks Having safely gained the opposite shore the men found that their labors had but just commenced In front of them stood a precipice that was at the least calculation six hundred feet in height of solid rock and almost perpendicular Up this ascent the command had to mount by following a zigzag trail With much trouble and toil the summit of the height was reached when they once more commenced their journey over a diversified country made up of plains and ravines No grass or water was found until the expedition arrived at a small Mexican town called Sirvilletta Here an encampment was formed for one night and here their animals were to have their last rations of corn and forage The sale of these latter articles proved a windfall to and made glad the hearts of the inhabitants of the settlement for the money which they received in exchange for their produce was the largest sum they had ever possessed Thus in more ways than one these campaigns in the mountains caused good results These settlements on the remote frontiers of the territory of New Mexico are composed of very poor people who for many years succeeding their first efforts on establishing their small farms find great difficulty in doing more than to feed themselves Their distance from markets such as Taos affords prevents them from transporting thither more than their small surplus of grain but as in this case on thus finding many hungry horses and mules to feed their corn stalks and wheat straw come into demand and bring them in a remuneration in ready money in sums which they have not even dreamed of before The only difficulty in trading with such people is to fix a fair price on their produce for they are so fearful of not receiving enough that they often overshoot the mark and charge so much as to prevent other expeditions of the same sort from visiting them With the few dollars in their pockets thus gained from the party these Mexicans for once felt themselves rich men Early on the subsequent day the whole force was again in motion and continued an active march for two days over a rough country At last Kit Carson struck the Indian trail The course was instantly made to suit this trail when the party marched on two days more at a rapid pace On the second day s march the Indians were overhauled The band of Apaches had been jogging on slowly and consequently their animals were in good order The case was far different with their pursuers their horses were much used up by overwork and privations Thus when their strength was most needed it was found wanting The Indians espied the soldiers in time to make good their flight but not quick enough to save the lives of all their warriors Several of them were killed and many more were wounded They also lost a few of their horses and nearly all their camp equipage The roughness of the section of the country where they were overtaken assisted the savages in escaping notwithstanding every effort was made by the Americans to prevent their leaving so easily Kit Carson when describing these events says To captain Sykes who commanded the infantry is due the greatest amount of praise for the part he acted in our adventures When his men were almost broken down with sore feet long and difficult marches want of provisions the coldness of the weather and with their clothing nearly worn out and when they were on the point of giving up with despair they were prevented from so doing by witnessing the noble example set them by their captain He showed them what a soldier s duty really was and this so touched their pride that they hobbled along as if determined to follow him until death relieved them from their sufferings Although this officer had a riding animal at his disposal yet never for once did he mount him but instead he lent the horse to some deserving soldier who was on the point of succumbing to overwork When the Indian village was discovered he cheered his men from a limping walk into a sort of run and dashing through a swollen mountain stream that was nearly up to their arm pits and full of floating ice he was with his company the foremost in the attack Two soldiers of Captain Sykes s company twenty five were wounded and one of them afterwards died The other man was severely injured but eventually recovered The Indians on being routed were pursued through a deep canon for about four miles A few who had been previously wounded were overtaken and slain Night now came on therefore the men had to give up the chase and on returning to their own encampment they found their friends had located it on the same ground which the Indians had occupied when they were first discovered The next morning the surviving wounded man with an escort was sent back to the nearest military post so that he could receive proper attention The pursuit at an early hour was then resumed by the soldiers taking the fresh trail of the Indians Away went both parties through valleys canons and over snow clad mountains until in the end the Americans saw that it was impossible to overtake the red men who began to break up into squads of two and three and scatter in every direction During the latter days of the chase the routes which the Indians traveled were the worst they could select their object being entirely to use up the animals of their pursuers who were thus vigorously driving them from one haunt to another Very often at night the soldiers would find themselves bivouacked but a short distance from the place which they had left on the previous morning and this happened when not once during the whole day had they missed the trail or ceased travelling but the fact was that the enemy were so familiar with the country that they made these crooked trails with impunity Finally the Indians saw that in this trial of muscles and nerves they gained nothing and could not thus shake off their pursuers but that it was necessary for them to try other expedients therefore they separated to meet again at some preconcerted rendezvous On this occasion as so often heretofore the Apaches did not belie the character formed of them by some of our most experienced military men and of which we have before spoken viz that they have no equals for endurance and such a thing as overtaking them when once put to flight is almost out of the category of the white man s feats Footnote twenty five Company D twod Regiment U S Artillery There being nothing more that could be accomplished by the pursuit consequently colonel Cook ordered his men to face about and they having done so he made a direct march to Abiquiu a Mexican village that is located on the Rio Chamo a tributary of the Rio del Norte The design he had in going there was to recruit his men and animals Their sufferings had been severe Although performing constantly more than double duty the entire command was put upon half allowance of food and that little could not be properly cooked For this reason the trials and hardships which they experienced were of no ordinary character The town of Abiquiu where Colonel Cook arrived is about sixty miles northwest from Santa Fe and a traveler can make a journey through valleys from one town to the other It stands next to Taos in point of magnitude and importance in the matter of townships in the north of New Mexico The scenery about this settlement is very attractive and as it lies on the borders of the Utah Indian country it is frequently visited by these Indians The neighbors of the Utahs the Navajoes occasionally make their appearance in the town The Mexicans of Abiquiu from their continued intercourse with bands of the Utah Indians are more or less linked in with them and in time of war the Americans can place but little confidence in the inhabitants of Abiquiu on this account The grazing and farming facilities of the country adjacent to this town are quite progressive and were it not for the Indians its resources would be much more rapidly developed than they now are Utah was originally part of the territory of Upper California The United States came into possession of it by treaty with Mexico in eighteen forty eight The population is chiefly Mormon The new territory as set off by the United States in eighteen fifty includes an area of one hundred and eighty seven thousand nine hundred and twenty three square miles or one hundred and twenty millions two hundred and seventy thousand and seven hundred and twenty acres Near the eastern base of the Sierra Nevada range there are several lakes which receive the waters of the eastern slope of these leviathan mountains One of these lakes bears the name of Kit Carson having been named Carson Lake by Colonel Fremont In one respect this country has characteristics seldom met with in any part of the globe Large numbers of the lakes and rivers have no outlets Such is the fact in regard to Carson Lake The only means by which their waters are reduced is by evaporation The Great Salt Lake of Utah to the traveler is of great interest It may well be called the Dead Sea of Utah As has been seen colonel Cook and party were now halted at a Mexican village on the Rio Chama a tributary of the Rio Grande or del Norte The party that had been sent back with the wounded man while on their journey met and captured an Indian Supposing him to be an Apache they deprived him of his horse and arms and otherwise treated him as a prisoner While they were en route the Indian made his escape and joined his tribe This captive they afterwards learned was a Utah whose tribe had the external appearance of being friendly towards the whites although there were existing good reasons for doubting their sincerity colonel Cook fearing that such treatment might offer the Utahs a plausible excuse for openly declaring war determined to clear himself of censure by making such reparation as was in his power Accordingly he dispatched Kit Carson to the head quarters of his Agency in order to settle matters On reaching Taos Kit Carson sent an expressman to the Utah village with the request that their chiefs would come and have a talk with him They obeyed his summons and when they were seated in Council with their Father Kit he explained to them how that the soldiers had taken prisoner their brave through mistake and ignorance He informed them that his countrymen did not wish to do their tribe any injury and he trusted that they would overlook the affair advising them that the best way to show to the white men that their intentions were honest would be by not rendering aid to the Apaches He said that he had not sent for them through fear as their warriors were but a handful when compared to the soldiers of their Great Father but the main object always to be held in view in their deliberations was to cultivate friendship as the country was large enough for both parties to live in The Indians replied that they were satisfied with the explanation made to them and declared that their hearts were not in the least inimical towards the whites On hearing this Kit Carson restored to them the captured property and also made to the chiefs themselves a few useful presents colonel Cook after granting a sufficient rest to his men and after obtaining supplies at Abiquiu started out again to hunt the Jiccarillas He was so fortunate soon after as to find a fresh trail and in hot haste followed it for several days when unfortunately he was caught in a furious snow storm which obliterated the tracks of the Indians besides otherwise greatly damaging his resources The fair prospects of a successful termination to the expedition being so suddenly frustrated the commander had no other alternative open to him but to return This he did by going to the Rito Colorado a small town that lay on his route Here the command was joined by Major Brooks of the threed Regiment of U S Infantry who had marched to the relief of colonel Cook with reinforcements As soon as the necessary preparations were gone through with another scout was undertaken under charge of this last named officer while colonel Cook and his men retired from their active service Major Brooks without much difficulty struck upon a recent path made by the enemy and on it gave them chase The Indians were making their way to the Utah country and on arriving there the plans of the major were completely balked owing to the great numbers of fresh trails that he discovered in those parts They were so numerous that they crossed and recrossed one another at all points and were so similar that his best guides could not distinguish the one made by the Apaches from those belonging to the Utahs The result was that this command after being in the field for fifteen days was compelled to return without accomplishing anything These two nations the Utahs and Apaches have been so long intimate that many of their habits and customs are the same and very often it requires them to speak their respective languages before they can be recognized but usually the Utahs are cleaner and better dressed than their faithful allies the Apaches whom they use in time of peace and war as tools After allowing sufficient time for the Apaches to collect and reorganize so that they would be more accessible a third expedition was made ready and placed under the command of Major Carlton of the First Regiment of United States dragoons Major Carlton employed as his guide Kit Carson This command at first traveled to the north one hundred miles until it reached Fort Massachusetts Here it halted for one day until the final arrangement could be finished Major Carlton then divided his party sending one division which consisted of his spy company under Captain Quinn to examine the country on the west side of the White Mountains while he took it upon himself to inspect the territory on the east side of the same range Captain Quinn followed up the valley of San Luis When he reached the Mosco Pass he turned off through it in order to get into the Wet Mountain Valley where it had been previously agreed upon that he should meet with and report progress to his commanding officer The Mosco Pass is a narrow opening in the White Mountains which latter is but another name for a branch of the Rocky Chain This pass has been traversed by colonel saint Vrain many years ago with wagons but at the present time such a feat would prove to be an impossibility as the mountain streams have washed down large rocks and other obstacles which now present difficulties which simply men and animals cannot overcome The pass itself is but a few miles in length It is but a deep cut through very lofty mountains Its sides are rocky craggy and very rough defying in many places the most experienced climber to ascend them It is a favorite route which the Apaches delight to take when hotly pursued as it offers them the saving of many miles of difficult and circuitous traveling when they wish to reach the open prairies On reaching the place of rendezvous Carlton while in the Sangre de Christo Pass by the aid of his guide Kit Carson discovered a trail made by three of the enemy and on following it up it was found to join the main path on the Huerfano Creek On the arrival of Quinn who had discovered signs which indicated the direction the Indians were taking a conference was called when all the old guides and spies of the party agreed in believing they were on the right scent The skill shown by men accustomed to the business of tracking Indians either for friendly or warlike purposes is oftentimes truly wonderful and especially is it so to a person brought up in a civilized community only familiar with the reports of such things The age of the trail the haunts the red men are bound to their object in going there the numbers on the trail and the tribe or tribes to which they belong can in the majority of cases be told with the greatest accuracy It is by philosophizing on minute things which in ordinary life would be considered mere trifles and hardly worth a consideration that this knowledge is arrived at Thus it takes but a minimum amount of wisdom to realize that a spear of grass when trodden upon is usually crushed to the earth but few reflect that the attempt is made by nature to restore the blade to its naturally upright position and in doing so requires a certain period of time to accomplish the task This process to the trailer is an index by which he judges the age of the visit made by the Indians to that section of country The shape of the sole of the moccasin or the carvings on arrows when they are found which not unfrequently happens and many other like things are sure signs in guiding the experienced trailer to the particular party he is seeking Carleton and his men became flushed with the prospects of success on finding the main trail and they lost no time in following it up For six days they made rapid progress and at the end of that time espied the Indians encamped on Fisher s Peak in the Raton Mountains Although the mountain was none the easiest to climb yet the soldiers went at its performance with a determination that brought them upon the Indians before they could collect their animals and be off and the consequence was that many a brave warrior then and there drew his last breath However the most of the Indians ran away but were pursued and a few were overtaken and shot The mountain on which the Apaches were concealed as described in this adventure with them is devoid of trees and hence is what in western language is known as a bald mountain Its summit contained a dry basin which besides the open lookout that the eminence commanded formed another inducement to these Indians in selecting it for a hiding place The route from New Mexico to the United States which we have before spoken of as the Bent s Fort road runs through or rather close to the Raton Mountains On account of its being well timbered and offering somewhat of a protection this route is often chosen late in the autumn and early in the spring as the safest for caravans to travel As a hunting district it cannot be surpassed especially in the seasons of the year above mentioned as the game collects there for shelter from cold and storms At night a squad of men under command of Lieutenant R Johnston of the First Regiment of United States Dragoons secreted themselves in the camp lately occupied by the Indians in the expectancy that some of them would return to reconnoitre and see what had been done there Along with this detachment there was a man belonging to the spy company who could counterfeit the call used by these Indians when they wish to find each other and collect their forces At about midnight when all was still this peculiar toned whistle was sounded when lo and behold two warriors and two squaws came forth and commenced groping about in the darkness They were fired upon but as no accurate aim could be taken only one of the men was mortally wounded There is no reason to doubt that there were more of these Indians concealed in the neighborhood but the report of the rifles and the yells of their exposed brothers caused them to cling to their hiding places and as the shades of night advanced they thought it was best to be on the move to distant parts Hence they escaped The Apaches in this affray parted with forty head of horses and also their scanty allowance of camp equipage for by prosecuting the war they were fast becoming poverty stricken but to do them as much harm as possible all the articles that could be of any service to them were collected and destroyed A spectator not used to seeing Indians in all phases on beholding these Apaches in their most nourishing condition would at once decide they had but little else to lose than their bodies for they usually have but a small quantity of clothing on them but this is but an instance where human eyes can be easily deluded As long as he has his rifle with plenty of ammunition or even when he is reduced to his bow and arrows the Apache still considers that he is amply provided to carry on war Least of all the Indians in the far West does this race prepare for the future When deprived of his horse which he is ready at a moment s warning to convert into food by killing his spirits are as buoyant as if he was mounted on the fleetest charger He is equally careless about partaking of his last morsel of nourishment although his rashness may drive him and often does to the alternative of subsisting on roots and bark or such other articles as may fall in his way On the morning of the day that the Apache village was discovered and captured Kit Carson rode up to his superior officer and said Major if no accident shall happen to prevent us we are certain to overtake the Indians by two o clock this afternoon The signs are becoming so fresh that I feel confident that I will not be mistaken Carleton replied that if his words came true he would present him with the finest hat that could be purchased in the United States Strange as it may appear the Indians were found at the hour which the guide had predicted Sometime afterward as it required quite a length of time to write and have the commission executed Kit Carson was presented with a superb hat in which there was a very appropriate inscription viz AT two O CLOCK KIT CARSON FROM MAJOR CARLETON This prophecy was not guesswork On the contrary it was a matter of calculation made on the same principle which any experienced workman would adopt in reference to some undertaking that was within the range of his calling A few years later an officer who had been an eye witness of this incident had the opportunity of trying Kit Carson a second time on the same business but Kit was not mistaken The Indians were overtaken within five minutes from the time he had foretold they would be Major Carleton having performed all that lay in his power commenced his homeward bound march While en route he traveled by the head waters of the Canadian River and its tributaries and passed over bold and lofty mountains and through a picturesque country Finally he reached Taos His command was in a very good condition considering the hardships to which it had been exposed Although we say in common parlance that this command returned in good condition yet it must not be presumed by this assertion that they came back making a fine appearance like that presented by soldiers on a parade When out on these campaigns the comfort of the men is considered to be of more importance than either pomp or show hence those military trappings which are not particularly essential are left behind while there is just enough uniformity of dress remaining to make them recognizable as soldiers But little luggage can be transported on these trips hence the soldiers are obliged to limit their wants to actual necessity which seldom amounts to more than the clothes they have on When about starting out the soldiers bear the appearance of being ready for hard work which after finishing they are glad to return even if they present themselves at their quarters in rags It is wonderful what a change in personal appearance a few weeks can make by traveling in the mountains The person thus exposed partially conforms to the habits of the wild Indians both in appearance and mode of life Such toilet articles as mirrors and razors with their paraphernalia are dispensed with personal beauty being a thing the most to be despised In lieu thereof robust health shows itself in the cheek the eye and the whole economy of the man The blood courses through his veins as pure as the water in the mountain streams about him By this training the mind becomes clear and well balanced and the whole system reaches a condition which far surpasses the finest constructed machinery This happy state of the body does not however communicate itself to the fantastical appearance of the soldiers as they come marching along Were they to enter a town belonging to a civilized community when arrayed in this mountain costume they would be at once judged as a band of desperadoes On arriving at his home Kit Carson resumed the duties of his office as Indian Agent which occupied his time during the remainder of the year Soon after another expedition was organized and sent out against the Apaches but it returned unsuccessful We have used this word organizing when speaking of the fitting out of various expeditions against the Indians and it seems proper that here we should give the reader an idea of what kind of preparation is necessary to put one of these commands in proper trim The company or companies of soldiers will be first detailed for the arduous duties of the field to castigate the Indians This matter is easy to accomplish but the next thing to be thought of is to take care of these troops which is not quite so puerile a task The quartermaster estimates from the number of the soldiers how many mules will be required to transport their luggage equipments and provisions This having been determined upon he collects the animals and has them provided with pack saddles The task of shoeing the horses and mules is also no easy matter for they cannot go until after they have been properly shod A certain weight of freight is assigned to each pack mule and a suitable number of men are employed to take care of load and unload these animals when in camp When on the march these men perform duty as drivers and otherwise look after their charge Notwithstanding their proverbial obstinacy these pack mules quickly learn the labor which they have to perform After finishing their usual day s work they often exhibit impatience to be relieved of their burdens In the morning they are correspondingly reluctant about being loaded and by their hostile demonstrations they plainly show their unwillingness to engage in further labor Especially is this true when by careless management their backs have become injured or when from the steadiness of pressure from the dead weight of their cargoes the same result has been brought about The Mexicans understand the art of packing animals to perfection hence they are preferred before other men to serve in this capacity It is often a laughable scene to witness a mule who is used to the business having his load strapped on and otherwise arranged in proper place The packer with the lashing rope in hand and with his foot braced against the side of the animal by the assistance of a kind of pulley arrangement in the saddle gearing uses his utmost endeavors to make things as firm as possible Every effort which he thus put forth is strenuously and obstinately resisted by a trick which we will call a straining process that is resorted to by the mule The animal seems to know when his pack is securely and properly adjusted for if it is not he is ready to dump it on the first opportunity occurring When the mules are loaded they start out in a drove but are allowed to select their own path provided they follow on after the command It generally happens that one of them is more ambitious than his companions This one taking the lead the others resign to him their right to the place and are content to keep his company at a respectful distance in the rear One of the duties of the Commissary Department in fitting out such expeditions is to provide a sufficient quantity of rations for the men such as beef bacon beans sugar and coffee These form the reliable subsistence of the soldiers while absent from their posts or the settlements The estimate is judged of by the number of days which the expedition will require to be absent in order to perform a certain amount of work From this result is calculated the weight and number of the rations required always when practicable allowing a small surplus In this respect old and experienced soldiers are far superior to volunteers The former will allow of no waste They are accustomed to be methodic in their modes of life while the volunteer is usually ignorant of such teaching hence he is wanting in making little things go a great way While out on one of these campaigns it is often practicable to a certain extent provided the undertaking is not a hotly contested chase to drive along beef cattle which can be killed and used at discretion Bacon however is the soldier s sheet anchor and the variety of forms in which he can cook and prepare for eating this article while in the field would astonish even a French chef de cuisine It very frequently happens however that in an Indian country he is not allowed to exercise his talent for making large fires might have the effect of apprising the enemy of the near approach of danger In such a case he is obliged to make his coffee in a tin cup over a very small fire the fuel of which consists of a handful of dry twigs which are carefully and cautiously replenished as the first supply is consumed This coffee together with the remains of his last frugal meal serves to stay his appetite for the time being nolens volens The organization is said to be complete and fit for service when the soldiers are judiciously provided with arms ammunition and riding horses When the party consists of mounted men they also are provided with such other articles as are deemed necessary which are included usually under the heading of an outfit for the especial business in which the soldier is to engage In the latter part of the summer Kit Carson departed from the agency on a visit to the band of Utahs one of the tribes who were placed under his special charge Although usually he went to their country several times in a year yet more frequently these Indians came to him in order that they might enjoy the hospitality of his house and receive from him presents of tobacco and other little commodities which he was always sure to give them articles which he generally had to pay for himself In visiting them at their home on this particular occasion Kit Carson had the double object in view of notifying them of the moon when they must meet the superintendent of the Indian affairs of the territory at Abiquiu a town adjacent to their hunting grounds and one which they often frequented and also to inform himself of the schemes which they had on foot and their actual wants so that he could report to the proper authorities the necessary articles of which they stood most in need To define the actual wants and requirements of Indians is a subject which has puzzled many a person who has endeavored thoroughly to investigate their character and who has understood their mode of life If the question was left to themselves it would be readily settled for they desire to possess everything which in the least pleases their active fancy and so extensive are their demands in this respect that they know no limit provided their own inclinations are consulted By some it is supposed that the presents of blankets and trinkets which they annually receive from government are more than sufficient rewards for depriving them of parts of their country Others there are who charitably add to these things presents of weapons and ammunition arguing that thus they can kill their game and gain their own subsistence without resorting to plunder but alas this latter argument is not found in the majority of instances to be the peaceful manner in which they employ these gifts Very often the weapons which they have but recently received are turned upon their donors with a view of destroying them The reasoning of the Indian in regard to these presents is perhaps right and just yet it is by no means pleasing to the exposed frontiersman The Indian argues that these gifts are but rights which he is forced to receive in lieu of his hunting grounds with which he is very loath to part no matter what be the terms or consideration offered The inference which he draws is that he can use these presents as he pleases Money in the hands of wild Indians is almost worthless to them and paying it for their lands by way of annuity is extreme folly Some of them in time as they have become half civilized begin to appreciate the value of money Such only should be allowed to receive or accept it They sometimes desire it by way of ornament Then by the usual means of exchanging property they know how easily to obtain it Every tribe has its own peculiarities in respect to its wants and the best judge of these is the agent who should be first chosen for his honor integrity and skill and then allowed a large discretion in his decisions The distance to be traveled over while on this duty was in the vicinity of two hundred and fifty miles and was performed like all of Kit s previous journeys on horseback Indeed there are but few men living or dead who have ridden in the saddle over as much territory as the man we write of On his way to the Utah village Kit accidentally fell in with the Apaches but as he was constantly on the look out and therefore first in making the discovery he lost no time in effecting his escape from them by changing his course He thus was able to pass around them in perfect safety Kit Carson met with no difficulty in finding the Utahs among whom he spent two days investigating their affairs Just before parting with them he left directions for them to be at the council at the time appointed which was in the new moon of October Notwithstanding his path was beset with the same perils that existed on his outward journey yet by careful traveling he surmounted them all and arrived at his home safe and sound Little or nothing worth noting transpired until the time arrived for him to set out for Abiquiu where all parties soon assembled in grand council and proceeded to business Speeches were made by the superintendent by Kit Carson and also by the head chiefs After these interesting proceedings were gone through with the annuities to which the band were entitled according to their treaty were presented to them which they received with outward signs of friendship though the knowing ones who were on the ground could see lurking beneath that stoic appearance which a savage usually assumes when facing his white brother that the red men were not entirely satisfied with past events However every means had been employed to pacify the band who on first coming into the council had succeeded in showing that they had been greatly outraged and injured and that they had sufficient cause for resentment The following circumstances will show the truth of this Just previous to the holding of this council one of the warriors who was much esteemed by his tribe had been waylaid and murdered by a small party of Mexicans The only excuse offered by the latter for committing this bloody deed was that they wished to deprive the warrior of an old coat which by some means had come into his possession The killing of a human being to deprive him of a garment which was almost worthless is perfectly characteristic of the depravity exhibited by the lower classes of Mexicans It is a singular fact that these people love to steal trifling articles or sums of money We remember two instances where this trait is singularly illustrated An American on one occasion left on a table in his log house a large sum of money in gold He sent a Mexican into this room to bring him something which he wanted but the man returned saying he could not find it The American now went himself to look for the article and while in the house recounted his money and found one of the smallest coins missing He at once called the thief and charged him with the crime The Mexican knew this American to be very resolute when therefore he heard him threaten him with severe and summary punishment if he did not at once produce the money he knew there was no escape and accordingly drew from its hiding place on his person the missing coin and restored it to its owner The American being used to such every day occurrences passed by the affair without further notice In the other instance an American was traveling and had occasion to stop at a Mexican s house during the night On going to pay his bill for his lodging in the morning he noticed that two pieces of his money had been abstracted while he was sleeping These coins had been taken one from either end of his purse This was what drew his attention to the fact of his having been robbed The host was informed of what had happened and at once proceeded to restore the missing money He called his son to him a boy twenty years of age and after threatening a good deal he made the lad take his choice between owning the theft or submitting to the risk of being discovered by a search of his person for the missing coins This had the desired effect and at once the stolen property was returned to its rightful owner Both of these facts are simple and perhaps uninteresting but they serve to exhibit a characteristic of the lower classes of Mexicans Doubtless such paltry thieving is the result of a want of animal courage easily discernible by the close observer of the Mexican race Of course there are many exceptions to this statement The white men interested in the council had their hands full in their endeavors to smooth over this affair for the Indians were much dissatisfied with such treatment At first they demanded that reparation should be made them by their agents giving them a certain number of horses The Superintendent explained to them that he had not the power to do this but he assured them that the murderers should be arrested and dealt with according to law The Indians willingly received this promise but seemed to feel as finally was the fact that they were doomed to be disappointed as far as the punishment was concerned It afterwards happened that only one of the murderers was apprehended and in a very short time after he was locked up as a prisoner he succeeded in making his escape and was never retaken This was all that was ever done by those in authority to render the justice that had been agreed upon and which was richly due to the Indians After quitting the council and while on their way back to their hunting ground the small pox broke out among the red men and carried off in its ravages the leading men of this band of Muache Utahs On the first appearance of this trouble the Indians held a council among themselves and decided that the Superintendent was the cause of the pestilence that had visited them They also decided that he had collected them together in order thus to injure them and to further his designs he had presented to each of their distinguished warriors a blanket coat They found that nearly every Indian who had accepted and worn this article had died It so happened that the writer several years after these events occurred visited the camp where this pestilence reigned in its full vigor The site of this camp was very beautiful Perhaps it was this aided by other circumstances which caused the red men to select it as a refuge for their sick The place is located on the west side of the Valley of San Luis and is about midway between its upper and lower extremes Two mountain streams have so joined as to form a peninsula of tableland which is well shaded by cotton wood trees This ground when the writer saw it was literally strewn with the bleached bones of the Indian victims who had died from the scourge As we lifted up one skull and another the thought struck us that perhaps we might have touched the bones which once belonged to the famous chief Chico Velasques of whom we have before spoken as it was here that he died Had we done so knowingly on account of that man s many cruel deeds a thrill of horror must have run through our veins The funeral rites of the dead among the Indians were clearly exemplified here Whatever may be these rites observed among the Indians on the west side of the Rocky Mountains I am satisfied that most of the tribes of Indians on the east side of this same range use but few if any imposing ceremonies in committing the body to the dust It is very difficult to find the bones of an Indian on the plains and therefore I believe and herein I am assisted by the observations of experienced men that these Indians burn their dead bodies when they can do so or completely hide them in the mountains by covering them with rocks so that it is impossible to find them Such a course would also serve the purpose of preventing the wolves from digging them up The high colored novels referred to heretofore which have during the past few years had for their theme the Indian race love to dwell on the imposing and affecting spectacle of an Indian burial When stripped of fancy the truth is that beyond the lamenting of a few hysterical squaws and the crackling of the flames of the funeral pile there is little else done that is noticeable But to return to results of the council The Indians naturally enough argued and persuaded themselves that these presents were intended as poisonous destroyers and that they had been steeped in contagion for that end It wanted but the happening of this affair or a similar one to destroy the small amount of confidence which the superintendent had hitherto enjoyed with these savages While they were secretly preparing for war they anxiously inquired of the traders who came among them what was transpiring in regard to the Mexican prisoners who had wantonly murdered their brave On each separate occasion they were answered with intelligence that did not in the least satisfy them They therefore renewed their energies in order soon to be ready to take the redress in their own hands Kit Carson apprehended difficulty even at the council but after it broke up he was early apprised of the trouble which was brewing and to prevent any outbreak he brought all his Indian experience to bear upon the task In him they said that they knew they had a true friend but their nation had received too many wrongs to allow any more to be thrust upon them without showing to the world that they were worthy of the names which their fathers had given to them CHAPTER XVII The Commencement of a formidable Indian War High handed Measures on the Part of the Indians The Governor of New Mexico raises five hundred Mexican Volunteers and places them under the Command of Colonel saint Vrain Colonel Fauntleroy placed in Command of all the Forces Kit Carson is chosen as Chief Guide The Campaign commenced The Trail found The Indians are met and the first Fight and its Consequences An Excitement in Camp The Indians again overtaken The return to Fort Massachusetts Intense Cold Weather experienced The Second Campaign Colonel Fauntleroy surprises the Main Camp of the Enemy The War and Scalp Dance broken up Terrible Slaughter of the Indians The Great Amount of Plunder taken and destroyed Another small Party of Indians surprised and routed saint Vrain equally fortunate in his Campaign The Indians sue for Peace The Council held and Treaties signed Kit Carson opposes the making of them The poor Protection Indian Treaties usually afford to Settlers Kit Carson s House at Taos and his Indian Friends His Attachment for his Family put to the test Cowardice of a Mexican Kit Carson s Friends as they look upon him His influence over Indians General remarks Conclusion The Muache band of Utahs under their renowned Chief Blanco after trading for all the powder and lead which they required joined the Apaches and commenced the war in earnest They waylaid and murdered travelers on the roads attacked towns killed and made prisoners the people who inhabited them and became so formidable that for a length of time everything was at their mercy They lost no opportunity in showing their power and in possessing themselves of the finest herds of horses mules cattle and sheep within their reach This Chief Blanco is a man who stands in his moccasins about five feet nine inches He is rather thickset but to use an Indian phrase he is straight as an arrow The chief attraction about this Indian is his head which is finely developed His lustrous black eye is filled with animation and shows an active brain which unfortunately is turned to bad account His forehead is lofty yet it is symmetrically chiselled and every feature about his face is as regular as if it had been carved for sculptured perfection Blanco is a man who in any sphere of life would have become most certainly distinguished and under the influence of education he might have risen even to greatness In his present unreclaimed state he shows to a disadvantage It is within my province fully to attest to the earnestness the savageness and the brutality with which these Indians commenced this contest I was then stationed in their country and came very near being one of their first victims The circumstances of this narrow escape happened as follows For a considerable length of time the post to which I was then attached was kept in a constant state of excitement by receiving authentic accounts daily of murders and robberies committed by the Indians While these events were transpiring the officers and soldiers were anxious to take the field in order that they might punish the perpetrators of the crimes but as the force of the Indians was numerically speaking very strong therefore it required in order to insure success a well organized command to match them and checkmate their plans at once It required time and much labor for the officers in charge of the military district to arrange and complete their plans Every man who left our post ran the risk of losing his life for the enemy kept an eye on the road which led away from it to the principal towns of New Mexico as often there was rich booty for them to obtain passing over it Notwithstanding this critical state of affairs express duty had to be performed and it required brave men for the task There were present however those who stood ready to volunteer to execute all express orders Before proceeding with our own case we will illustrate these critical times It was necessary to dispatch an expressman to Fort Union This post from Fort Massachusetts was one hundred and fifty miles distant The ever faithful Mexican Armador Sanchez was then attached to Fort Massachusetts as a hunter and interpreter On account of extensive experience with the habits and customs of the hostile Indians Armador was selected to perform this dangerous mission In his usually quiet manner this noble hunter soon prepared himself for the undertaking By using every precaution he reached his point of destination in safety Having finished up his business he instantly began his homeward bound journey While on the rough trail which leads from Fort Union to Taos he came near being surprised and captured by the enemy under the following circumstances Armador had selected the night as the safest time to travel and as it was quite dark in order to pick out his way and prevent his growing sleepy by riding he traveled on foot and led his animal He had made good progress on his journey when suddenly his hunter trained ear detected a noise on ahead of him which sounded like the rolling of stones down the side of the hills over which the trail ran He stopped and listened more attentively This time he was certain that he was not deceived and thought that he could hear voices singing Indian war songs This was convincing proof to him that danger was near at hand therefore he turned off from the trail and led his animal as high up the steep hill as he could where fortunately he found sufficient under brush aided by the darkness of the night to conceal himself from view Hardly had he taken up this position when the noises suddenly became very distinct The Indians while following the trail had made a turn round a bluff and were almost beneath him Now the hunter felt his situation to be most precarious for should his mule bray as these animals are apt to do when others are approaching his own life would have to pay the forfeit but to prevent this Armador held the mule s nostrils firmly with his hands and otherwise drew off the animal s attention by various gentle manipulations bestowed upon him He saw the outlines of the Indians as they passed along in single file beneath him and estimated them to be at least twenty strong Had these savages known that a victim was so close by they would have made short work of him but before they could have killed him it is safe to affirm that Armador Sanchez would have had a companion with whom to draw in his last breath Fortunately affairs took a better turn and the expressman finished his journey without further trouble To return to my own case I was obliged to visit Taos As an escort I was allowed one faithful and brave soldier We traveled together over the first half of our journey and as we had considered far the most dangerous part in perfect safety At the Mexican town of Costillo after our day s ride we rested for the night Our fears of meeting Indians were now almost dispelled but still we took the precaution to question the Mexicans of the town in regard to their knowledge of their whereabouts In reply we were invariably answered that no fresh signs had been discovered and that intercourse was both safe and free for the remainder of our route By the first appearance of daylight on the following morning we were up and preparing for our journey and but a little time elapsed before we were leisurely traveling along on the main road We had left the town but a few miles behind us when the morning sun began to make its appearance in all his splendor The country through which we were journeying was prairie land and was bounded on either side by lofty and picturesque mountains and the distance of the one range from the other was considerable but yet could fully be taken in by the eye almost at a single view As we rode along we were amusing ourselves admiring the beauty of the morning and especially directed our attention to the rising of the sun All at once just as we had reached a high plateau of land the soldier made the discovery of a flock of sheep at a great distance off on the prairie They appeared to be moving under rather suspicious circumstances We reined up our horses for the purpose of obtaining a better observation What puzzled us was the dim figures of apparently mounted men who were moving at great speed from one point of the band of sheep to another as if hurrying them along After taking a searching look we came to the conclusion that the horsemen which we saw were hostile Indians as we had not been accustomed to see Mexican herders mounted and acting so strangely The herders near the towns in New Mexico are usually small boys who are under the surveillance of one or two men stationed near by When the Apaches and Utahs steal these herds they always take the young herders along in order to look after the property in their mountain retreats They rarely mortally injure these boys for they say that it is against their own interest to do so but instead they prefer to save their lives so that they may be useful in guarding other flocks which perchance may fall into their hands Most of these youthful prisoners in time make their escape and after a series of hardships return safe to their homes Many Mexicans can give such adventures of their early experience but scarcely one of them can recall a single kind act shown them by their captors save the mere sparing of their lives As we were viewing the herd we thought that we noticed the figures of the horsemen throwing themselves from one side to the other of their horses as if very busily employed in frightening the sheep We now held a council and decided that our best policy was to quit the main road as it was crooked and make a straight march across the prairies for the town of Red River which was located about twenty miles in our advance It was our opinion which afterwards proved to be correct that if the Indians were stealing the stock belonging to the town of Costillo they were also engaged in attacking the place itself For while a strong party were engaged in drawing off the attention of the people another would be driving off the cattle sheep et cetera To return therefore would be almost certain death so at a full gallop we commenced our direct course As the sage bushes were thick and high and the ground much broken by various kind of holes we soon found that we had our hands full in managing our horses We had hardly started afresh before our eyes were attracted to one side of us and in the direction of the Rio del Norte which runs through the valley saw what we at first considered to be antelope but which afterwards proved to be Indians in pursuit of us As we watched closely these supposed antelope we remarked that they kept in Indian file and that the course they were on would diagonally intercept our own point of the compass We began now to suspect that the white appearance assumed by these objects was owing to the strong sunlight which dazzled our eyesight and struck on the dressed side of buffalo robes and that in these robes were concealed human beings who had formed the determination to have our scalps During the cold weather most of the Indians who dwell in the country adjacent to the Rocky Mountains and especially those living on the eastern side of them wear buffalo robes with the fur next to their bodies These robes serve the double purpose of shirts or coats and a covering by night The wearers make them fast around the waist and in the heat of the day they are allowed to fold over and hang down but as the cool air of the evening comes on they are wrapped around the head and body something after the Spanish fashion of wearing a cloak The Indians frequently for the purpose of decoying their enemies into battle go out on the prairies and by turning the fur side of these robes out and covering their persons having previously assumed a half bent position imitate the Simon Pure buffalo while in the act of grazing In order to keep up the ruse they move about with a rocking motion When taken for the buffalo which frequently happens they are enabled to gain an advantage in approaching a party or village which they wish to attack The Cheyenne Indians are very partial to loose sack coats which are made out of white blankets To these coats a hood is attached which is thrown over the head at the wearer s pleasure In addition to this during the winter season they also resort to the buffalo robe The squaws of the various tribes of Indians on the plains are well versed in the art of tanning and dressing buffalo hides They frequently ornament them with beads porcupine quills and rude paintings In times long since gone by these robes could be purchased or rather traded for at good bargains but the unlimited and increasing demand for them has greatly enhanced their value Now days they bring standard prices Being satisfied that the Indians were in pursuit of us we carefully guided our horses at the same time using our spurs freely and keeping them at their maximum speed As the Indians drew nearer we could see distinctly that they were urging on their animals Our safety therefore depended entirely on outriding them The race became most exciting and demanded the greatest caution for we well knew that one misstep made by either of our horses would prove fatal to the rider We had decided on commencing the race that neither of us should fire a shot except as a last resort and that we should do it only on the principle of man for man While putting our horses to their speed our weapons were held in our hands and kept ready for instant service The most dangerous point was that at which the two trails would inevitably intersect To gain this place in advance of our savage enemies all our hopes now centered For twelve miles we dashed along laboring under a state of suspense not to be easily forgotten When at last we arrived at the desired point we were only about two hundred yards in the advance of our savage pursuers still we felt that our lives for the time being were saved and accordingly breathed a prayer to the Almighty in thanks for our deliverance thus far The pace now became tremendous and here our grain fed horses proved to be too much and their powers of endurance were fully put to the test for the grass fed ponies of the Indians After a short run the savages saw that the advantage belonged to us consequently soon after they halted We however kept steadily but with slackened speed on our course fearing that some accident might change the happy turn of affairs in their favor On finding themselves thwarted in their designs the Indians fired two or three shots at us but even these final compliments did not to use nautical phraseology make us heave to We reached the settlement of the Red River in good season and concluded that we had traveled the distance in about as brief a space of time as it ever had been accomplished either before or since our adventure Our horses were so used up by this race that we were obliged to exchange them for fresh ones on which we finished our journey without further annoyance The Indians in this incursion stole five thousand sheep besides other property from the Costillo and killed two men who were traveling behind us and on the same road When the bodies of these men were discovered one of them had a mouthful of bullets which he had evidently put there in order that he might drop them into his rifle as he should require them and not be obliged to be delayed in taking them from his ammunition pouch but evidently before he could have used more than one from this supply he was shot dead It cannot be denied but that this outbreak on the part of the Indians and its subsequent outrages was the result of mismanagement and it is but justice to the reputation of Kit Carson to assert that it was no fault of his that affairs had terminated so disastrously He had used every means which human skill could devise to allay the anger of the Indians Had his superiors in power acted with the same discretion and judgment in all probability the Utahs might have been kept at peace It is wonderfully strange that our Government will persist in placing at the head of Indian affairs men who are not practically acquainted with Indian habits which can only be learned by a long life passed upon the frontiers If it was a matter where dollars and cents alone were to be estimated it might be different but where valuable lives are legitimately exposed it seems to us morally wrong to give the control of tribes of wild men to politicians who are liable to make all kinds of mistakes and in whom the Indians will not repose the least confidence It is because such appointments are made that in a great measure the troubles with these border Indians arise and many is the section of country in western America where apparently the reward for taking a white man s scalp is a blazing red or a sky blue blanket which is paid under the plea of keeping the peace This too when efficient means and decided measures are the only hopes of a lasting peace Illustration FORT MASSACHUSETTS NEW MEXICO IN eighteen fifty five While engaged in our travels through the far West we remember to have met with an Indian agent who was both in years and experience but a mere boy To him had been intrusted the affairs of a large tribe notorious in the country where they reside as being great thieves These Indians had so little respect for their agent that they would openly boast of the crimes which they had committed in his very presence Not only this but on horses stolen from the neighboring settlers they would ride by him thus defying his power The settlers were loud in their complaints against the Government for thus neglecting to protect them and sending them a block of wood for a king The young man of whom we speak bore an exemplary character but it was plainly and painfully apparent that he was in no way whatever fitted for the office he held and which he had attained through the influence of powerful political friends This is but a fair example by which many of the so called Indian agents may be rated who are the actual managers of Indian affairs on our frontiers The Utahs and the Apaches having now openly combined met with such success in their endeavors to attack the whites that during the course of a few months they overran almost the entire northern part of the territory of New Mexico They utterly defied the power of the American Government and whenever the opportunity offered boasted to the Mexicans that they no longer stood in fear of the white man The subsequent cruel and barbarous crimes of which they were guilty clearly demonstrated that they had become greatly elated by their success It soon became apparent that unless checked they would exterminate the population and burn or otherwise destroy their settlements At this time it was only by running great risk that the whites could leave their towns and go to the neighboring mountains for the purpose of obtaining even a little firewood Working parties were daily surprised and murdered women and children were carried into bondage and reserved for a worse fate and all kinds of business were receiving a check which was becoming ruinous to the country It was even greatly feared that the boldness of the savages would carry them so far as to make them attack Fort Massachusetts To give them a warm reception should they dare undertake that enterprise the post was strengthened by cutting down and removing everything which might in the least tend to aid the Indians and give them a cover which they so much like when fighting all the trees and brush about the post were cut away Breastworks were thrown up on the block house attached to the fort so that the soldiers could be well protected in case of emergency In these sentinels were posted and the strength of the guard doubled and greater vigilance exacted Haystacks were removed to a safe place for fear they would be fired by the enemy The sentinels were ordered to cry out every half hour of the night while on their posts and no man was allowed to approach after the shades of night came on without giving the countersign It proved to be well that these precautions were taken for on the neighboring mountains Indian watch fires were seen nightly and on several mornings Indian moccasin tracks were discovered in close proximity to the fort showing thereby that the enemy was watching and waiting for a favorable opportunity to strike a sudden and overwhelming blow upon the garrison within The savages no doubt were deterred from making a bold attack by the prompt precautionary measures which had been taken by the commander to anticipate their plans The wagons belonging to the fort were sent out after wood under a strong escort and the government herd of beef cattle horses and mules were well protected by the soldiery On one occasion through a false alarm of Indians the whole command of the post which numbered less than one hundred men was put in great and sudden commotion The cause will appear in connection with the following circumstances The party in charge of the herd had espied a large cavalcade of men and animals approaching them At the long distance they were off the strangers resembled Indians The commander of the party immediately sent an expressman to the fort to apprise its occupants of the fact The drums immediately sounded the rally which caused the men to rush for their arms They quickly fell into their ranks and the order was given to march Headed by a gallant lieutenant they dashed out of the fort on a fast run in order to reach and save their property from being captured by the enemy The soldiers were elated at the prospect of having a brush with the Indians and on an open plain giving them battle where notwithstanding the great numbers which would certainly be arrayed against them they felt that they could soundly chastise them On reaching the herd the soldiers scattered and were soon prepared to commence the skirmish but lo when the strangers drew near enough to be discernible they were recognized as a large party of Mexicans under the command of an American These people had been absent several months on a trading voyage among the Cheyennes and Arrapahoes and for the purpose of returning home in safety they had formed themselves into one body Their dress was similar to that of the Indians and therefore at the great distance at which they were first discovered it is not strange that such a mistake had been made especially during these dangerous times The reason of the sudden stationing of the soldiers about the herd the traders easily surmised hence on drawing near they began to cry out that they were friends No set of men were ever more disappointed than were these soldiers at this unexpected termination of the affair Matters eventually arrived at such a crisis that the Governor of the Territory by and with the advice of the commanding general felt obliged to issue a proclamation calling upon the people to volunteer for the purpose of defending their lives and property The inhabitants of New Mexico promptly responded to this call by flocking to the places designated for them to organize Out of the great number who presented themselves and offered their services there were selected men sufficient to fill six companies each of which when fully organized contained eighty mounted men They had the power of electing their own officers by and with the advice and consent of the Governor These volunteers furnished themselves with riding horses The pay which they were to receive amounted to about thirty dollars per month which was considered very liberal inasmuch as they were provided in most cases with arms Rations were issued out to them the same as to the regular army The willingness which the Mexicans exhibited on this occasion to volunteer does them great credit and clearly proves the fact that they do not always lack in courage but that they are prompt to defend their homes when properly disciplined and aided with the means necessary to do so It is the opinion of many of the most prominent citizens of the Territory of New Mexico that if the chastisement of the Indians when it was required was left to the people themselves the general government only supplying them with money and arms that peace between the two parties would in a short time be firmly established on a sure and permanent footing In giving currency to such opinions we risk them with the knowledge that the previous experiments made on this policy which have proved unsuccessful in the various older territories belonging to the United States will be brought to bear as potent arguments against such a course by a large and powerful opposition But such facts of Indian history are exceptions Indian history clearly demonstrates the proposition that well organized volunteers under able leaders have accomplished more in warfare against the savages than regular troops taking into consideration that the same length of time which each have been engaged in actual service has given them equal experience The cause of this is plain These two distinct forces are composed entirely of different material The one is made up of frontiersmen who thoroughly understand the effective use of the rifle and a life in an Indian country while the regular soldiers have been for many years back chiefly foreigners who as has been heretofore stated have to be taught these things and as it very often happens they have never seen one of their enemy until sent out in quest of the savages As matters usually stand the Indians are almost the actual although not the nominal masters of the country In short they commit excesses whenever it suits them paying no regard to treaties This has been their habit from time immemorial and it is found to be a difficult task to break them from it Their minor crimes are allowed to accumulate and when at last they are actuated by increasing success and consequent boldness to commit some great and overt act it is noticed and expeditions are sent out against them These usually fail to punish the really guilty parties but instead they recover a small share of the property stolen and with it the thirst for revenge must be satiated The officers and soldiers do their utmost to accomplish something more and readily meet hardships and privations in every shape in order to accomplish the desired end but their time is too limited rightly and efficiently to perform the work for the campaign must be ended when in reality it has but just commenced The reason exists in the fact that those high in authority are liable to be called to an account for spending a dollar too much in a good cause Perhaps this state of affairs has been brought about by the immense expenses which have attended many of the Indian wars in which the United States government has been engaged when mismanagement and paltry results have characterized the acts of whole campaigns This charge cannot however reach to the military department in which New Mexico is included for the leading officers who have from time to time been stationed there have invariably exhibited an unusual amount of discretion and sound judgment and have set examples of military science promptitude and skill which it might be well for others to follow Under the existing causes for difficulty and peculiarity of circumstances it is sometimes hazardous to assume the responsibility of punishing the hostile Indians as they deserve By punishing the Indians we do not wish to impress the reader with the idea that they must be collected and butchered like animals in order to bring them to terms Milder means serve the same purpose but when they dig up the hatchet battles must be fought in which they ought to be so closely driven as to cause them to see that it is perfect rashness to attack the whites One victory gained by savages over white men so exhilarates their pride that they forget the past and believe themselves invincible In these fights valuable lives are sacrificed but they are necessary sacrifices for the common good When one tribe is severely chastised the surrounding Indians hear of it and becoming alarmed for a time they behave themselves with propriety This happy state of things will continue until some weak move on the part of government officials counteracts this good influence when misconstruing kind acts for fear the red men at once dig up the tomahawk and boldly march upon the war path to spill innocent blood Such results often follow when the power is taken from the experienced military commanders and vested in the hands of often the fact inexperienced superintendents These men pompously invite the Indians to grand councils where unmeaning speeches are manufactured to suit the occasion Usually when thus summoned the wily savages are delighted to go into council for as a rejoinder to the many concessions which are easily obtained from them and which they are always ready to make after assuming a little coquetry they receive presents which the superintendent informs them are merely tokens of the high appreciation with which they are regarded by their Great Father at Washington It is the opinion of Kit Carson that the Territory of New Mexico will continue to remain in its present impoverished state during the time that the mountain Indians are allowed to run at large The only true remedy he says for this great evil is to compel the savages to form settlements by themselves Then and there assist and teach them to cultivate the soil In time they will be able to gain a maintenance independent of the General Government and to a certain extent they will become responsible for their acts The people who form the chief population of the territory have so often been deprived of their property that it is not strange that they have become poverty stricken and indolent It is enough to strike down the enterprise of any nation to have been so long badly governed and then without any resources in the way of arms and ammunition to be compelled to beat back hostile Indians Under the provisions of the government of the United States they are improving but yet even now they have not the protection which they require and should receive In their territory it takes a daring man to venture his small capital in raising stock To be sure claims are allowed them by Congress for the losses by Indian depredations but these usually fall into the hands of speculators and in reality assist the people to a very trifling extent It can be said to their credit that Mexicans bear reverses of fortune with a nonchalance seldom seen among any other race Although generally poor they are as happy and joyous as it is possible for human beings to be The organization of the Mexican volunteers was made complete by the governor of the Territory who selected as their leader mister Ceran saint Vrain of Taos This gentleman although he had much important business which called his attention elsewhere immediately expressed his willingness to accept the responsible position which without solicitation had been conferred upon him The commission received by saint Vrain gave him the rank of lieutenant colonel Without delay he set about the difficult and important work that lay before him bringing to bear upon the details that sound judgment gentlemanly bearing and ready zeal which have long characterized the man He had the good fortune to secure the services of Lieutenant Creigg of the regular army whom he appointed one of his aids de camp Having completed his staff and other arrangements to place his force upon a military basis he was ready to take the field The appointment of saint Vrain as commander of the Volunteers was hailed with delight throughout the territory His great experience in the mountains his knowledge of the Indian mode of warfare and the respect which the people he was called to command invariably paid him seemed to convince every thinking mind that something more than usual was to be accomplished They felt that the wrongs of their country would now be certainly redressed The sequel will prove that the people were not doomed to disappointment Early in the month of February eighteen fifty five colonel T T Fauntleroy of the First Regiment of United States Dragoons arrived in Taos from Fort Union New Mexico Fort Union is the first post met with on entering the Territory of New Mexico from the east It lies on the Santa Fe road usually traveled by parties when crossing the plains and is about one hundred miles distant from the capital The site of this fort at the first view is bold and picturesque as it is located near the west side of a broad valley which is continuous with the open prairies The houses composing the fort are built mostly of logs and as there are quite a number of them the post has the appearance of a small settlement The soil about is sandy and the place being exposed it suffers when the high winds spring up This fort is usually garrisoned by several companies of soldiers As it has such free access to the mail communication with the States it is comparatively speaking quite a desirable fort for an officer to be stationed at The difficulty of procuring fuel for the fort and also other necessary articles is the great objection to the present location but its importance more than counterbalances these therefore the post will probably be kept up either where it is or in the immediate vicinity for many years to come Colonel Fauntleroy had received orders from the Department General to proceed to the town of Taos and take command of the entire expedition The little force had been made as powerful as the resources of the country would permit The Mexican Volunteers soon after their enrollment purchased woolen shirts and felt hats the color of which in each company was similar this fact with a little drilling gave them quite a military appearance Never were men prouder of the position they now held than the volunteers under consideration and a more daring and expert band of horsemen has been seldom collected So pleased were they at being recognized as soldiers that they could not when afterwards marching through their own towns resist the temptation of jocosely taunting their countrymen whom they chanced to meet for being obliged to till the ground We have before said that these men were mounted At first sight it would appear as though they would soon be on foot for their horses appeared to be in a sad plight for so severe a campaign as that which lay before them As has often occurred before looks are frequently deceptive In this instance it was found to be the case for no sooner did these hardy ponies reach the mountains than their wonderful powers of endurance began to be exemplified When the noble dragoon horses began to droop from hunger and overwork these little fellows were fresh and strong as the day they started The reason of this was that the Mexican horses were well versed in taking care of themselves and when the snow fell and prevented their having free access to the dry grass beneath they were not in the least disconcerted for with the aid of their fore feet they readily pawed the snow away and thus obtained full rations but their more enlightened rivals did not fully understand this science and owing to a want of proper nourishment their strength would fail gradually until finally they broke down The only real inconvenience under which the ponies seemed to labor arose from tender feet for the rocky trails in the mountains rapidly wore away and broke off their hoofs This continued so that at last reaching the matrix of these horny growths their feet became very sensitive Many of the Mexicans had taken the precaution to guard against this before leaving the towns and military posts which lay on their route They had obtained horse shoes with which they shod the ponies We remember seeing a large party of them thus engaged as blacksmiths It was at night while some held burning torches others were busy with hammers stones and hatchets in applying all sorts and sizes of horse and mule shoes with which they were content provided they approached the diameters of the hoofs to which they were to be nailed Strange to say this rough work answered the purpose and but few if any of the animals so shod went lame After the command had got under full headway if any of these ponies became so tender in their feet as to be able to travel only with great difficulty their riders resorted to other expedients for relieving them When practicable they obtained the fresh hides of the beef cattle as they were killed and binding the material around the injured feet and making it fast about the fetlocks they allowed it to dry on In the morning thus protected the horse could journey on It is customary regularly to shoe these ponies only on the fore feet as the weight of the animal s head and neck together with that of the rider comes harder on these hoofs and causes them when traveling over sharp rocks to wear away quickly It seldom happens that the hind feet become tender The Indians cannot understand the policy of this and one of them philosophizing on the subject while visiting the blacksmith s shop attached to a military post made the remark in Spanish after apparently having been for some little time engaged in a deep study that it was not right Said he The horse with his eyes can see where to put his fore feet when traveling over bad places but he cannot do this with those behind therefore you white men ought to put the moccasins there The Mexicans had so much confidence in the powers of endurance of their ponies while out on this campaign that they hesitated not to run them on races whenever circumstances and the site of the camp would permit such pastime The only training required for these trials of speed consisted in the rider foregoing the pleasure of riding for a day or two in order to allow his horse to recruit As their walking did not in the least interfere with the order of the march they of course were permitted to race as they pleased for their services on the march are just as valuable on foot colonel Fauntleroy s command when completed consisted of four companies of Mexican volunteers two companies of dragoons one company of artillery who were performing duty as a rifle corps and one company of spies The two remaining companies of volunteers were dispatched to exposed towns on the remote frontiers in order to protect them The artillery company was the only one on foot but the soldiers who then composed it were known from actual experiment to be more than a match for the horses in traveling when the party should reach and penetrate the mountains colonel Fauntleroy engaged the services of Kit Carson as his chief guide and having arranged all of his plans necessary for a vigorous campaign he set out upon its execution The command proceeded at first one hundred miles due north to Fort Massachusetts which was to be their depot Without delay they left this post and proceeded encountering snow storms and severe cold weather The mercury of the thermometer for most of the time ranged several degrees below zero They marched to the Rio Grande del Norte and thence on up this river to where it makes its exit through a deep canon from the mountains It was as will be remembered by the reader on the head waters of this last mentioned stream that colonel Fremont while engaged in his last great exploring expedition met with severe reverses in which several of his men lost their lives from exposure hunger et cetera while he and the remainder of his party barely escaped the same fate While passing over this point of his journey colonel Fauntleroy sent out as an advance party the company of spies Their duty was to seek for fresh Indian trails On reaching the mouth of the canon of this river the main portion of the soldiers halted for a short time while their trailers penetrated the mountains in search of the much desired Indian signs During this resting spell an incident occurred which for an hour or two created some little stir and excitement among part of the men present A large Newfoundland dog belonging to an officer had accidentally been allowed to follow the soldiers By his pranks and his good disposition he had become a general favorite among them While attempting to drink this animal lost his foot hold on the ice and slipped into the swift current of the river which was partially frozen over The dog at once attempted to extricate himself but with all his efforts he could do no more than stem the flood making no progress against it His situation was very precarious for should his strength begin to give out he was certain to be carried under the ice and lost The sympathies of the men were soon well awakened in his behalf and many plans were devised to rescue him but they all proved abortive until at last a Mexican approached him with a lasso and after making several vain attempts succeeded finally in encircling the dog s head with the slip noose On tightening the rope he found that he had the animal firm and soon dragged him from his perilous position The spies were not long in discovering a trail made by the Indians to which they led the main portion of the command This trail had been so frequently used of late by the Indians in driving stolen bands of sheep and cattle over it that it was now a well trodden road and therefore there was no difficulty in keeping on it at all hours of the day and night Being accustomed to perform his duty carefully and at the same time to use dispatch the Colonel in the course of a few days led his party to the entrance of the Saquachi Pass which is the great natural opening in the mountains that bound on the west the valley of San Luis As they approached the mouth of the pass the men were traveling close under the hills therefore on coming to it and in order to follow it up it was necessary to turn off almost at a right angle The spies as was usual when the command was on the march were considerably in the advance They had hardly entered the pass and had just reached the summit of a knoll which lay in their path and which had hitherto prevented their seeing up the valley when all at once the long looked for Indians were presented to their view They were but a short distance off and as if surprised at thus so suddenly discovering each other both parties halted During this state of suspense the white men noticed that the Indians were arrayed in their war costume showing that they were bound on another plundering expedition Everything went to show that the visit which the white men were making to their mountain haunts was unexpected by the red men The Indians quickly recovered from their astonishment and began to form in line of battle by spreading themselves out across the valley They were evidently emboldened by the small force with which apparently they had to contend and felt certain that a victory would be both easy and sure Having taken their position Blanco their chief was easily recognized by the red woolen shirt which he wore He was busy riding along in front of his warriors occasionally stopping to give some command As they were near enough so to do the Indians opened a warfare of small talk in the Spanish language They charged their adversaries with being afraid to advance or to use their expressive words the Americans were as cowardly as squaws To these taunts no reply was made but to keep up the decoy the few soldiers who were exposed to view remained stationary while word was passed to the rear of what was transpiring in the advance Thus several minutes passed by but they were not thrown away During this time most of the dragoons and volunteers were relieving themselves of such extra luggage as overcoats blankets et cetera saddle girths were tightened and weapons put in order for immediate use The Indians were finely mounted and about two hundred and fifty strong and as their wild career had gone so long unchecked their bravery was aroused to its highest pitch All things being in readiness the bugles sounded the command to charge when away dashed the gallant soldiers eager for the affray and each trying to be foremost in the fight As they came bounding over the knoll before spoken of the Indians began to see the delusion under which they had been laboring and at once turned to fly but not in time to escape for the soldiers were soon among them and with their revolvers and small arms were fast thinning their ranks and sending many a brave to his final home A running fight ensued which was continued up the valley for about eight miles when a majority of the Indians gained the mountains and made good their escape The chase was a splendid affair to behold and many feats of horsemanship were performed that would be difficult to excel Among the foremost in this skirmish was as the reader might readily imagine Kit Carson The pursuit was continued far into the mountains and was only given over when night came on The soldiers then retired to their reserve guard who had established a camp on a small stream which runs through the centre of the pass where their pack animals and stores could be easily guarded During this exciting fight several of the soldiers were slightly wounded With this exception the command came out of the skirmish unharmed On the side of the Indians affairs in this respect were quite different Their blood had well sprinkled the battle ground and several of their swarthy forms were stretched out at full length sleeping that sleep that knows no wakening except it be at the final judgment day Had it not been that most of the Indians as is usually the case with them when in action were tied on their horses this number would have been augmented The bloody trails that were afterwards found in the mountains went to prove that many of the wounds given to the escaped Indians were mortal and while their horses were carrying them from the danger they themselves were sinking from furious hemorrhage Early in the pursuit a fine warrior was thrown from his horse As he had been crippled by a ball he could not recover himself and make off For some time he lay alone and neglected but when the rear guard came along they noticed that he was playing a game by pretending to be dead but he had closed his eyes too firmly for a man in that condition and this fact attracted the notice of the passers by A Mexican raised his rifle and fired at the brave but the bullet only served to cause another flesh wound This so irritated the would be dead savage that seizing his lance which lay by his side he attempted to reach and kill his adversary with it but others coming up he was soon dispatched While this running fight was in progress the author met with an adventure which came near costing him his life It was my duty to follow the charging soldiers in order to be near at hand to render professional services to the wounded should there be any I was mounted on a mule and when the dragoon horses started off he became frightened and unmanageable I soon found that this mule lacked the speed of the former animals hence he was in a short time left far behind but not until he had fallen and thrown me into a thrifty bed of prickly pears the thorns of which did not in the least save me from being hurt On regaining my feet I found that my injuries were but slight and that I still retained my bridle rein therefore I quickly regained my seat in the saddle and started on again remembering the old proverb which says All is fair in war While riding on I was joined by a soldier whose horse had broken down in the charge As we now advanced together our route led us by some large sand hills behind which several Indians had sought refuge when hotly pursued Seeing that they had been overlooked during the excitement of the moment they remained quiet until we came along when they made a dash at us and commenced firing their arrows in fine style We returned their volleys with our revolvers but whether we produced any result further than preventing their coming too near it is difficult to say Several of their arrows came in close proximity to our bodies and one struck the soldier s horse in the neck and wounded a main artery which bled for a time furiously As danger was thick about them the Indians soon left us to effect their own escape when we halted and attended to the wounded horse whose life we were so fortunate as to save by putting a ligature about the bleeding vessel The night succeeding the day on which this fight occurred with a single exception passed by quietly A soldier who lay near the centre of the camp had retired to rest perhaps impressed with the belief that he and his comrades would be attacked by the Indians before morning this train of thought had led him into dreams of war and while reveling in them he imagined that danger was at hand Suddenly starting up and seizing his rifle he fired at random His bullet came near striking a Mexican sentinel who was on duty and who was making his rounds The sentinel was very naturally startled by this unaccountable noise in the camp and supposing that the Indians had unobserved crept within the lines he returned the compliment by discharging his piece in the direction of the supposed danger The report of these firearms had the effect of arousing the entire command The men were quickly on their feet and ready for active service In the confusion which ensued several more rifles were fired but fortunately no harm was done and as soon as the cause of the trouble was explained quietness and order was promptly established At the break of day on the next morning the soldiers were up and preparing for their march The Indians had on this morning made fires and even presented themselves to view on the mountains but they were few in number and it was well known that this was only a ruse to allure the white men to the wrong trail while their families should have time to escape in the contrary direction hence but little notice was taken of these demonstrations colonel Fauntleroy here determined to relieve himself of all drawbacks which should in the least tend to prevent his now giving full chase to the Indians Accordingly he left his baggage and provision train under escort of the foot company and quartermaster men the whole being placed under the command of Lieutenant Lloyd Beall of the Second Regiment U S Artillery with instructions to meet him at an appointed rendezvous in the Wet Mountain Valley It required but a short search by his guide Kit Carson and his spies to put him on the right trail taken by the main portion of the enemy When it was found the pursuit was resumed and kept up vigorously Late and early the soldiers followed on this trail and although the Indians purposely led them over the worst conceivable routes yet they gained nothing substantial by it On one occasion when the men were pushing on as fast as possible their advance guard surprised three Indians one of them a woman while they were leisurely watering their ponies These Indians attempted to fly and succeeded in making a good run for about four miles but at the end of that distance two of them were overtaken A Mexican who was mounted on a very swift horse was the first to come up with the savages He fired and brought the woman to the ground Quickly dismounting he made a trophy of her scalp The other Indian being arrested by a slight wound was made a prisoner On questioning him it was found that they all belonged to one family The man who had made his escape was the husband of the woman who was killed while the prisoner was her brother These Indians had heard nothing of the recent fight in the Saquachi Pass and had the soldiers dropped down from the heavens they could not have been more surprised at thus unceremoniously meeting them It was very much regretted by those present that this Indian woman had lost her life but as she was dressed in the disguise of a man her sex could not be recognized There are many of our readers who will perhaps censure this Mexican for his barbarous action of scalping a human being but it must be remembered that the education of his people is different from our own The taking of Indian scalps for a long time has been authorized by the Mexican Government as a means of lessening their savage enemies and handsome premiums have been offered as an inducement to obtain them In the case of this Mexican there were extenuating circumstances which if they did not warrant such a cruel act yet they rendered him somewhat excusable He had recently lost a near and dear relative by the hands of these same Indians and the appearance of this mangled body was still fresh in his memory making him to thirst for revenge It must not be supposed for a moment that the commanding officer of this expedition had sanctioned such a mode of procedure for he had no knowledge of the matter until after it had been ended It was not within his province to preach humanity to a people who had been so greatly outraged by savages He came to punish and not to intercede for wild men who had long been a terror to the surrounding country and upon whom in order to reconcile them every kind act had been expended in vain It may possibly be asked whether or no a man who has simply lost his scalp can recover In reply we can safely say that without any other wound and under favorable circumstances with good care the sufferer stands a chance of being restored to health There was a man who formerly was living and working at his trade as a blacksmith in Santa Fe who in a fight with the Camanches while crossing the plains was wounded by a lance and then scalped After a long period of suffering this person entirely recovered although the cicatrix of the wound was ever afterwards a source of annoyance to him compelling him continually to wear a skull cap made of oiled silk The size of the scalp as usually taken off by the Indians varies Sometimes they remove only the back covering of the head At other times they cut off the whole running down even with the margin of the ear When a man has died in a manner which the Indians style as brave that is desperately fighting for his life and never for once showing fear they take two scalps one from either side of the head The object of this is to have scalp dances for each as they consider such a man as deserving the fate of two ordinary men These scalps are often stretched dried decorated and frequently kept for years as trophies The more scalps a warrior takes the greater favorite he becomes with his tribe and finally having obtained a given number he is considered eligible to fill the office of War Chief provided he has other qualifications such as the power of quickly conceiving the right plan on which to act in case of emergency When a party of Indians in the Rocky Mountains have been on a war trail met the enemy and vanquished them they appoint a brave who is honored as being the scalp bearer This warrior carries a long pole to which at suitable distances from each other the scalps are attached When the party returns to and enters their own village this brave is the observed of all observers Eagerly by the old men women and children these bloody trophies are counted for each of them offers an occasion for rejoicing to be at separate intervals of time They are then each synonymous with the phrase a fete day and the scalp bearer is looked upon with the same jealous eye which greets the color bearer of an army after having been engaged in some great battle which has proved successful to his standard An Indian will not remove as a general thing a scalp which contains grey hairs This he considers to be a business fit only for women The scalp which is to cause a general jubilee on an appointed evening is attached to the top of a long pole planted in the earth at a suitable place The warriors who have been instrumental in tearing it from the head of its owner form a circle around the pole outside of which are arranged the spectators By the aid of one drum stick the person who has been detailed for this duty keeps up a beating motion on a sort of kettle drum the noise of which serves the purpose of marking time The voices of the dancers make the music At first the song is a mere humming sound but after a time it grows gradually louder until the participants in the dance being excited to the highest attainable pitch with interest in the ceremonies it becomes terribly hideous Almost naked with tomahawk and hunting knife in hand the warriors imitate the process of dispatching and tearing off the scalps of their victims So excited do the dancing savages sometimes become while reveling in these fantastical scenes that they frequently are aroused to a pitch which borders on frenzy The spectators of these sights get so deeply interested that it is not an extraordinary matter for them to appear as if almost deranged Their excitement breaks out into exclamations of encouragement and applause until at last they can control themselves no longer and on their own account commence making bodily demonstrations of joy by jumping about The scalp dance may last an entire night or until worn down with fatigue the actors are willing to forego their pleasure and seek rest The Mexicans on the frontiers have fallen into this Indian custom and they can go into the spirit of the scalp dance with a relish which fully equals that exhibited by their savage neighbors This is not true as a general rule but very many of their people really enjoy these ceremonies Illustration INDIAN WAR DANCE Colonel Fauntleroy and his men traveled at such a rapid pace that in the course of a very few days they succeeded in once more overtaking the main village belonging to the enemy The Indians took refuge in a steep and rocky mountain A skirmishing fight immediately commenced which lasted several hours During this engagement a large number of the savage warriors were killed their band completely routed and the inhabitants of the whole village made to scatter in every direction in order to save their lives At first the braves attempted to make a stand but they were driven from rock to rock until they broke their ranks and fled It was about the time of this crisis and when they were most needed that the dragoon horses began to break down and die The word village has many times appeared in our pages and as it may prove ambiguous to a few of our readers and render them liable to confound its meaning with that of a fixed town we will here stop and explain its signification when applied to Indians An Indian village as understood in border parlance comprises the lodges the women children old men and such movable property as Indians may chance to possess They are usually found in some safe retreat where the old men women and children stay while the warriors are engaged following the hunt or war path The word has become more generalized since it was first given to stationary camps of the savages and may now include any band of Indians traveling with their families and property The village is the home of the red man where those persons and things which he most cherishes he tries to keep intact and sacred from the spoiler s hand It is also where the Indian allows his love friendship and all the better feelings of his nature to exhibit themselves It is where in early youth he has listened to the legends of his tribe and where he is taught those lessons and forced to endure those trials which are to prepare his heart in seeking out revenge It is the place where as he approaches the age of manhood he takes those steps which are to make for him the reputation of a daring hunter and brave warrior Here he first learns to shoot his arrows with precision and to handle the lance with dexterity His boyish feats in horsemanship which he daily performs in the village would be witnessed with astonishment by skillful riders It is here that he runs to welcome his father when he returns either from the chase or the war path and while he listens to the marvellous adventures which his sire has encountered he secretly wishes himself a man so that he can emulate his greatness In fact the same feelings exist between parent and child with the Indian race as with those who boast of being more civilized Youth and the vigor of manhood are the golden days with the savage To be doomed to old age is considered by him to be a punishment When he is no longer able to hunt and seek out his enemy he loses his desire to live His life is then considered an incumbrance to the camp The old and infirm therefore are often willingly deserted that they may the more quickly die The village is always under the surveillance of men who are past the middle age and who no longer can act out the stirring deeds of the warrior Their experience renders them capable of giving good advice and attending to the less active affairs of the nation They hold the power of restraining the rashness and indiscretion of the younger men therefore they are selected to watch over the property of the tribe while the strong warriors are seeking to provide the dependent portion of the band with food or to revenge their real or imaginary wrongs Order and good fellowship is made to prevail in these villages somewhat similar to the habits found in civilized communities for the passions and evil propensities of all men are found to be alike no matter what differences of education or color exist We find that the Indian tribes have their wise men whose voices are heard and heeded on all occasions When these villages are located or to use soldier phrase when the Indians go into camp care is taken that each lodge shall be placed where it will not interfere with the common good The internal economy of these habitations is arranged on a social system which in many respects is commendable When one person is poor generally speaking the whole tribe is found to be so The herds of horses and mules belonging to the tribe are turned loose in one body as if they were the property of one man If game exists in plenty and danger is not apprehended happiness holds complete sway within these Indian homes The proverbial caution of the red man rarely allows him to be surprised therefore even in times of peace he keeps his fleetest horse tied at the door of his lodge so that he may make haste and collect his property and be away before his enemy can harm him These favorite animals are fed by hand Before trusting his body in sleep some warrior in whom the tribe repose the utmost confidence must ascend a neighboring eminence if there chance to be one and examine the country in search of dangers Parties are always kept out as spies and at the least appearance of suspicious signs they become easily aroused and vigilant and if danger really exists word is immediately sent to their village to be ready to move This is a homely but literal interpretation of the term Indian village The reader has seen that the dragoon horses gave out before the fatigues of the march while the Mexican ponies performed their tasks so admirably and easily This was a painful subject to contemplate and one which no man who loves the noble horse could wish to witness the second time The dragoon horses reduced to skeletons from starvation while retaining all their natural spirit with tottering limbs faithfully tried to perform the labor which their riders seemingly asked of them Long before the arrival of the time when they could no longer support a burden the soldiers had humanely relieved them from this work and were assisting them by all the means in their power to reach a haven of safety where food so essential in restoring their sinking powers of life existed in abundance As their little remaining strength was leaving them they would exhibit the fact by staggering Finally breaking down in their hinder legs they would sink to the ground but not until they had made the effort to drag themselves along with their fore feet To relieve them from their agonies and prevent their falling into the hands of the Indians one by one they were shot When these horses broke down and began to die off it was decided to be best to return to Fort Massachusetts in order to recruit and also to allow the Indians an opportunity to concentrate their forces when another effective blow could be struck against them On his return Colonel Fauntleroy met at the designated place Lieutenant Beall who had managed the affairs intrusted to him very much to his credit Having once more consolidated his command Colonel Fauntleroy retired to Fort Massachusetts which he made for a time his head quarters Kit Carson the guide of this expedition when afterwards speaking of it says During the time our forces were in the field they were exposed to the most intense cold weather I ever remember experiencing We were overtaken by several severe snow storms which came near completely using us up For the success that had so far attended the labors of this body of soldiers the greatest amount of praise is due to their leader who set a noble example to his men During those hours when hardships and trials came thickest upon the command all eyes were turned to the commander and as the result proved with no lack of confidence Kit Carson s services were found to be invaluable His long experience and untiring energy proved to be one of the best anchors of the goodly ship We should not omit to state in regard to the severity of the cold that it was early in the morning just before the break of day that the cold was invariably found to be the most intense During this time it is the greatest wonder that the Mexicans did not perish for but few of them had more than one blanket as a covering by night and the remainder were but very little better provided for When wood was plenty and they were allowed so to do they made large fires and laid down near to them to attempt sleep After about one hour thus spent they were routed out by being nearly frozen Getting into close contact with the fires they would thaw out and then were ready to make another endeavor to repeat the sleeping operation In this manner they managed to live through each night and on the following day they were apparently none the worse for wear A person judging these men as he oftentimes sees them during the summer season basking in the sunlight on the sunny side of their houses in New Mexico would not for an instant suppose that they could undergo such hardships and yet they can do so as the above example sufficiently proves without allowing one murmur of complaint to escape their lips With the regulars who were amply supplied with blankets and buffalo robes it would appear that they could have obtained sound sleep But this too proved to be almost an impossibility The heat of the man s body during the early and warmer part of the night served to melt the icy covering of the mother earth just under him When the cold increased this was again frozen rendering the portion of the body nearest to the ground almost benumbed By frequently reversing the posture a little some relief from suffering was obtained but not sufficient to reach a degree which could be called comfortable or in the least be claimed as desirable Every member of this expedition can truthfully assert that they have experienced a foretaste of what the first symptoms of freezing to death must be Finally the command reached Fort Massachusetts where in ease and plenty the half starved half frozen half used up men soon forgot all their troubles and privations A few weeks spent at the fort acted like a magic charm in recruiting the men and the remaining animals when they were once more in a fit condition and again eager to go on the war path anxiously desiring to surpass the splendid deeds of their first tramp At the permanent camp which was made near Fort Massachusetts the Mexican Volunteers especially enjoyed themselves hugely From privations of various kinds to which they had shown themselves to be well trained and which consequently affected them but little they were suddenly placed in a state of comparative comfort and even luxury rarely realized at their own homes They had not much else to do beyond guarding their animals and attending to such other minor duties as were required by camp duties Had not their hardy ponies required the rest that was now being given them these troops would have been kept in more active service but as this could not be they were allowed a respite which they themselves turned into pleasure Foot races and various athletic games were concocted and played by them making the time pass merrily by Their discipline and respect for their officers had reached a degree seldom if ever attained by volunteer soldiers and which in many respects could be imitated with advantage by regular troops But the time soon arrived for the march to be resumed At a council held among the chief officers it was decided that the best and surest course to be followed would be to divide the forces and send them out in quest of the Indians as if they were separate commands Thus it might happen that being caught between the two as they were running from danger they would rush into it and receive chastisement sufficient to answer all purposes Acting on this plan Colonel saint Vrain with most of the Volunteers was ordered to proceed in one direction while Colonel Fauntleroy with the main division started in another while on his route Colonel Fauntleroy traveled close in under the mountains and kept his men as much concealed as possible making most of his marches by night He traveled through the Valley of San Luis up to its head The Valley of San Luis is about one hundred miles in length Its greatest width is fifty miles On either side it is bounded by snow capped mountains The scenery of the valley is very prepossessing being sure to enchant the eye throughout its entire length In the south the valley is continuous with prairie land which extends down as far as the settlement of Rio Colorado It is well watered by mountain streams and bears the appearance of being an excellent farming district but the probability is that its climate is too cold for raising crops and that its true value will be found chiefly to consist in using it for grazing purposes From time to time the Indians have reported that it contains gold mines but there are no authentic proofs that this is a fact At one time the Indians succeeded in making the Mexicans converts to the belief in the existence of these mines as they showed them specimens of gold which they affirmed to have been taken from them It was agreed that for this valuable information presents such as blankets horses and guns should be made to those Indians who had openly proclaimed the good news provided they could conduct the Mexicans to them A party was formed and started to explore the valley but as nothing was afterwards heard of their success and as many of them to all external appearances were as poor as ever when they returned it is presumed that they were duped by the Indians The bottom land of the Rio Grande which skirts the southern border of the valley of San Luis is judging from the luxuriant hay crops which it produces year by year quite a good farming section and no doubt ere long the Mexicans will there establish a new settlement and thus practically demonstrate the use to which this beautiful valley can be put While passing up the valley of San Luis Colonel Fauntleroy came to the Punchi Pass This pass is the main opening through the mountains which bound the valley of San Luis on the north The pass itself is less than half a mile wide but yet it presents some of the grandest scenery human eyes ever beheld The mountains on either side are not so lofty as their compeers close by but they are rugged and picturesque Through the pass runs a bold stream which at about midway and at this time was obstructed by a beaver dam that was so scientifically constructed as immediately to attract the attention of the entire party Near to this dam there is a very large hot spring which is located close under the base of one of the mountain sides and which under the favorable circumstance of a fine day lends enchantment to the view The Punchi Pass is but a few miles long and leads into a beautiful little valley called by the Mexicans after the same name which is given to the pass On arriving at the Punchi Pass colonel Fauntleroy proceeded on through it to the head waters of the Arkansas river where fortunately a fresh trail made by the Indians was found This trail was followed with such assiduity and prudence that the camp of some spies belonging to the enemy and which was in their rear was passed by the Americans one night without their presence being noticed Early the ensuing morning before the break of day the main village of the Indians was discovered Its occupants were enjoying a war and scalp dance and their voices as engaged in the song which usually accompanies such festivities could be heard for a distance of at least a mile Unconscious of danger they were having a merry time One can imagine better than can be described the scene that followed when three hundred loaded rifles poured their contents into this crowd Suffice it to say that among those who survived this terrible retribution the greatest consternation prevailed but as a dernier resort they began to fly when they were hotly pursued by the soldiers Before quitting their late camp some of the savages had managed to get their own rifles and with them to fire several shots which did some execution as two soldiers were killed and two wounded Thus it will be seen that the main village of these Apaches and Utahs fell into the hands of the Americans It proved to be rich in plunder for it contained all their stock of dried buffalo meat besides other provisions Also several cart loads of robes saddles weapons ropes skins blankets trinkets and camp equipage Most of this property was collected and destroyed by fire being of little use to the command whose means of conveyance was limited to their own actual wants The number of Indians killed in this surprise has been variously estimated as has been also the number of the red men on the ground when the carnage commenced but all agree that this was the severest blow these savages had ever received Among the many other objects of curiosity found by the victors was a Medicine lodge which had from appearance but recently been in full blast It was highly and to Indian eyes it must have been very artistically decorated and contained all the emblems and symbols of witchcraft If sickness was to be frightened away or even coaxed to dethrone itself from the afflicted there was sufficient in this temple of the Indian gods seemingly to have answered either purpose Some potentate of the magnitude of a great chief had evidently but a few hours since been its occupant for in his hurry to desert the premises on hearing the music of the white man s rifle he had forgotten his beautiful head dress of feathers and other articles pertaining to his wardrobe which designated to the captors his high rank Perhaps and the surmise may not be far out of the way this chief was suffering from a gun shot wound inflicted in a recent fight by his pale faced enemy and having received one of their most dangerous potions of lead he was not anxious for another and therefore made his escape with the activity of a well man In this expedition a company of artillery eleven who have before been described doing duty as infantry performed a feat that will compare well with anything of the same kind on record These men under the command of Lieutenant Beall who shared all the privations of his soldiers marched on foot through a mixture of mud and snow nearly ankle deep over an uneven country from the Mosco Pass in the Valley of San Luis to the head waters of the Arkansas River a distance which is computed at eighty five miles in thirty six hours including all their stoppages This company had been long celebrated as being expert marksmen therefore their services were much needed when the Indian village was discovered Although nearly broken down with fatigue yet as soon as the electrifying news of the enemy being so near at hand reached them it seemed to inspire them with new vigor They dashed ahead and gallantly led the van in this assault which terminated so favorably to the side of the Americans Footnote eleven D Company twod Regiment U S Artillery Colonel Fauntleroy was not satisfied with the victory already obtained but after having accomplished all that was possible for him in this quarter and having scattered the Indians to the four winds he determined to make forced marches in order to surprise another band of them who were supposed to be located in a distant mountain haunt well known to his guide His object in thus hurrying away from the scenes of his late triumph was to reach and surprise the Indians before their friends had time to travel to and apprise them of their defeat In this manoeuvre he was also successful He came upon this second band also before they were aware of their danger They were routed and after severe loss were followed far into the mountains At this camp Blanco the celebrated Apache chief was driven to such close quarters that he evidently began to feel that the safety of his whole tribe stood in jeopardy He made his appearance on a high point of rocks and asked the white men who occupied the plain beneath for a parley which was granted him He said in the Spanish language that he and his Indians wished to make peace that they were tired of fighting In reply he was informed that the terms he demanded would be listened to on his coming into the soldiers camp He was going on to say that he was afraid to trust himself there when a bullet was sent whizzing by his head which caused him to decamp in all haste It was ascertained afterwards that a Mexican who had great antipathy to this chief had unknown to the rest of the party crept secretly up into the rocks When he had reached a place where Blanco was within the range of his rifle he fired but as the reader has inferred he missed an accurate aim At this latter camp or village and near the close of this same day another incident happened which will long be remembered by those who witnessed it Two Indians who probably had been absent to some distant section of the country having no knowledge of the matters which had lately been transpiring were seen approaching Gradually they drew near to a cotton wood grove of trees in which the soldiers were resting thinking no doubt that they were there about to meet their friends A mountaineer by the name of Stewart who commanded the Spy company and another man one of the Mexican Volunteers immediately on seeing the Indians sprang upon the backs of their horses which chanced to be near by and started out to attack them Not until these Indians saw the men advancing were they made aware of their danger when instantly they turned around their animals and put them on a keen run for the nearest mountain They were pursued and the race hotly contested for at least two miles but the Indians succeeded in making their escape although shots were fired at them and returned by the Indians In doing so one of them was obliged to dismount and leave his horse behind him which fell into the hands of his pursuers At the time that the chief Blanco was endeavoring to gain a parley a stirring scene was being enacted at the soldiers camp which was several miles distant Most of the soldiers had left it and were then out engaged in the business of scouring the country In the camp there were all the pack animals provisions luggage et cetera of the command To guard this property there were only about fifty men left who anticipating no danger were employing themselves in cooking and otherwise providing for the wants of their absent friends against their return The herd of mules was scattered about and grazing under the charge of a few herders Suddenly a band of about one hundred warriors were discovered coming down the little valley where the camp was located The alarm was given when each man seizing his rifle rushed to place himself in the line of sentinels which were forming around the property The mules were quickly driven together in a compact body into the centre of the camp Hardly had this movement been performed before the red men came galloping by Seeing the smallness of the force opposed to them they made two or three attempts at an attack on the weakest points of the lines They were about to succeed when a shout went up from the Americans who descried relief in the shape of the foot company which having been left behind for one night in order to make easy marches and thus partially rest themselves was now approaching The Indians saw the near approach of this powerful reinforcement and using that discretion which is often the better part of valor they started off and were soon lost sight of Had not this reinforcement providentially thus arrived the Indians would have certainly captured the pack mules belonging to the soldiers and got away with them Never was succor hailed with more delight than on this occasion for had the red men succeeded in this endeavor the benefits of this whole campaign would have been greatly frustrated Colonel Fauntleroy after thoroughly scouring the adjacent country in the hope of meeting with parties of straggling Indians but as the result proved without success returned to Fort Massachusetts where he had the satisfaction of learning that Colonel saint Vrain in his expedition had caught other bands of these same Indians and most severely chastised them The Fort Massachusetts here referred to has recently been abandoned and another one has been built distant about six miles from the original site The name is retained for the new defences which are located on the river Trinchera The present location is picturesque and beautiful in the extreme In one of his fights colonel saint Vrain had overtaken the red men on the prairies where a running battle ensued in which the volunteers killed many of the enemy and made several prisoners During this skirmish the Indians tried the ruse of setting fire to the prairie grass and as the wind was blowing in the direction from which their foes were coming they hoped thereby to impede their progress and thus give themselves time to escape but the volunteers boldly rode through the flames and successfully continued the chase The time for which the New Mexican volunteers had enlisted was fast drawing to a close but as the hostile Utahs and Apaches were scattered to the four winds it was thought best not to send out again a regularly appointed force to act against them Instead while awaiting the effect of their late telling blows it was decided to be judicious to keep out in different directions small scouting parties who could better follow the trails of the small parties of fugitive Indians with some prospect of success It was now the season for the richly laden caravans to arrive on the borders of the territory and perchance they might fall in with bands of the hostile savages of sufficient strength to cause them trouble or it might be the Indians would combine in sufficient strength being driven by pressing want to capture some one of these trains and thus obtain the material for renewing the contest In view of these apprehensions it was decided that the regular troops should go out on the plains where they could be on hand ready to afford protection in case of need Major Blake in command of the dragoons started out and faithfully performed this mission After this duty was fully accomplished he visited the mountains to the northeast of Fort Massachusetts and then returned to Taos via the fort and the intervening Mexican towns While intimating the dangers which may befall trains on their journey across the plains especially in time of Indian war it may be well to narrate a fatal adventure which once happened to a mail party while traveling this route Not many miles from Fort Union and on the plains there is a clump of hills known as the Wagon Mound so called from their resemblance to one of those peculiar wagons which are used to transport valuable freight across the country It being dangerous times a party of ten picked men had been sent out to insure the safe transit of the mail Everything went well with the little band of travelers and their prospects were becoming bright for making a safe journey when suddenly a large band of hostile Apaches and Utahs hove in sight The mail party on making this discovery immediately halted and prepared for a fight The Indians very soon granted to them this favor At first the attack was sharply maintained but at last fortune favored the whites for the time being and they succeeded in repulsing their foes who retreated out of sight The mail party being thus freed from the unpleasant society of the Indians at once hitched up their teams and proceeded on their route It was afterwards learned that the Apaches made the first attack but they were countenanced by the Utahs who remained close by On the return of the unsuccessful war party of Apaches to the Utahs the latter at once commenced charging them with cowardice and boasted that they could have done better The true state of the case was that the Utahs were using the Apaches as tools by which to gain plunder crying go dog while they themselves were keeping out of harm s way The anger of the Apaches was fully aroused at these derisive imputations Under the new impulse they said to the Utahs if you will help we will return and show you whether we are afraid to meet these pale faces Another attack having been decided upon the Indians set out and overtook the mail party once more near to this Wagon Mound It was snowing fast at the time therefore the white men were comfortably traveling in their vehicles and had their guns protected with suitable coverings to prevent their being injured for they anticipated no further danger The curtains of the mail wagons were all fastened down and there was no look out kept for it was considered sufficient to prepare for the furies of the storm The Indians accordingly approached unperceived and made such a desperate attack that all the white men were quickly killed Not one if the boasts of the Indians can be believed had time to get out from his seat Several days elapsed and no tidings were heard of the expected mail party therefore a body of men started out in quest of the missing men and found them sleeping the last sleep which knows no awakening The bodies of the dead were decently interred and since that day the Wagon Mound is pointed out to the traveler accompanied with a historical account of this awful tragedy During the campaign under consideration several Indian children were captured These were generally under the age of ten years They could not stand the kindly planned treatment which they received while in bondage for many of them died from over eating after having so long been accustomed to Indian frugality One of the women prisoners taken openly declared and there is no reason why she should not be believed that many of the younger children belonging to her tribe had been strangled by their parents and friends in order to prevent their becoming an inconvenience and thus prevent their being able to prosecute the war thereby showing that their hatred of the white man was deeply rooted and that their anger had been aroused to its highest degree On the publishing of peace those Indian children who still lived were collected and through the Indian agents restored to their relatives and friends The good effect which the moral of this campaign had on the surrounding Indian nations cannot be denied They soon became loud in proclaiming their friendships for the Americans Taking advantage of the now crippled condition of the Utahs and Apaches their enemies the Arrapahoes and Cheyennes were ready to pounce upon them at a moment s warning The opportunity did not however present itself until long after peace had been established with the white men when the Utahs and Apaches had been able to recover from their losses and collect again War party after war party of Cheyennes and Arrapahoes entered the country of their old enemies the Apaches and Utahs but returned unable to find them Yellow Bear a head war chief of the Arrapahoes did not accompany his braves on these expeditions and he would not believe that they could not find either the Apaches or Utahs therefore to show his people that there was one warrior living of the olden stamp he started accompanied only by his youngest squaw to meet and fight them A severe snow storm compelled this noble chieftain to come into Fort Massachusetts While he was there the commanding officer of the post endeavored to dissuade him from his rash undertaking In reply the chief said Captain my young men are no longer warriors They have become squaws I sent them to seek our nation s enemies They went discovered their fires and counted their lodges but were afraid to attack them I am now on my way to find the Utah village where I intend either to smoke the pipe of peace or offer fight to any three of their chiefs If they kill me otherwise than fairly perhaps it will stir up once more the fire in the breast of the warriors of the Arrapahoe nation This speech was delivered with so much pathos and yet with such an oratorical air that the interpreter was enabled to catch and translate every word of it Yellow Bear was now informed of the recent campaign against the Utahs and Apaches but the news made no change in his determination The advice was words thrown away as he was found conversant with the whole proceedings of the campaign We have brought in this incident to show how surrounding tribes are directly affected and personally interested in the results of all military transactions with hostile Indians As we have taken up for a theme the story of this brave and really noble Indian it may prove interesting to some of our readers if we complete the picture Yellow Bear has always been the firm friend of Kit Carson both by word and action He is the finest specimen of an Indian that the writer ever laid eyes on He stands in his moccasins over six feet is straight and symmetrically proportioned The head however is the main attraction of this Indian Never was a statesman possessed of a better We once heard him address a large council of his warriors and although we could not understand one word he said yet our attention was fixed on the man for we never saw either before or since such majestic gestures mixed with equal grace in any speaker It was a master piece of acting and from the humphs or grunts ejaculated by his auditors we were inclined to think that the speech was impressive There is one great point about this chief which those who are familiar with the Indian race as they now exist cannot but admire He has never been known to beg rather than do this we believe he would actually starve We will finish this description of Yellow Bear by adding that he finally listened to the advice of the then commanding officer of Fort Massachusetts and returned to his own nation On the final arrival at Taos of the troops engaged in this brilliant Indian campaign against the Utahs and Apaches they received orders to disband Those whose calling was arms returned to their respective military posts while the New Mexicans scattered to seek their homes where they were received and justly treated as heroes Before the forces were dispersed the Pueblo Indians who had been employed in the spy companies gave with the aid of their friends by moonlight a grand war dance entertainment in the plaza of the town It proved a fine display of this time honored Indian custom The combined efforts of the two commanders Colonel Fauntleroy and Lieutenant Colonel saint Vrain aided by their followers among whom Kit Carson played a most conspicuous and important part had the effect to compel the Indians to send a delegate to Santa Fe commissioned to sue for peace Peace was finally granted which formed a most happy and pleasing termination to this brilliant Indian campaign It proved afterwards that a great mistake was made in hastily allowing these Indians to evade the punishment they so richly deserved and which was being so summarily inflicted by entertaining so soon conciliatory measures At the council that was subsequently held it was found that only a part of the Apaches were present to sanction the proceedings and that the remainder were still in the mountains and were either hostile or undecided what course they would pursue Kit Carson their agent was at the meeting and earnestly opposed the policy of making a treaty so long as any portion of the two nations were insubordinate as it offered a loop hole for those present to creep out whenever they were so inclined He said that now was the time if ever when they might at a small additional expense and with the prospect of saving many valuable lives show these Indians that they were dealing with a powerful government His voice and experience were overruled by the other officials present and the treaty was made It stipulated that the Indians should receive certain sums annually in case they would settle down and commence farming and that they should be allowed to select their own locality within certain prescribed limits The making of such offers to tribes of savages half subdued is absurd The wisdom of this assertion has since been clearly shown for hardly one article contained in the treaty there made has been carried out The actions of those Apaches present at the council were trifling in the extreme notwithstanding which they were presented with some cattle These they objected to receiving on the ground that they were not fat enough to suit their fastidious tastes They insolently addressed the Government officials in the following strain If you do not give us better we will again take the road where we can have our choice The fact was that these half starved rascals saw that the white men were anxious to make peace and hence they assumed a haughty air in order to drive a good bargain The great results which should have been brought about by the teachings of Colonels Fauntleroy and saint Vrain by this weak diplomacy were more or less frustrated These gentlemen however had won great renown They had the savages driven to such extremes that one more expedition led by them in person would have subdued all their obstinacy and made them over anxious for peace The Indians had been seven times caught and on every one of the occasions they had been greatly worsted They had lost at least five hundred horses all their camp equipage ammunition provisions and most of their arms and were indeed almost at the mercy of the whites Under these circumstances they should have been shown true magnanimity and greatness by forcing them into that course which was and is for their own welfare as well as the welfare of the country and against which they themselves so blindly contend Say to an Indian that ere many years have passed by the buffalo will all be destroyed and he will answer you that the Great Spirit rains them down in the mountains for his red children This is a fair example of the manner in which most of them listen to the voice of reason It requires practical and active demonstrations by means of rifles and other weapons to teach them that they will not be permitted to plunder and murder at pleasure The wrong of this conduct they are as well aware of as their white brethren It is by rifle arguments that their treaties become worth the value of the paper upon which they are written It is a well known fact that people who live in Indian countries prefer to have the red men at war rather than bound to peace by such slender ties as they are usually called upon to take upon themselves In the former case the settler knows what to expect and is always prepared for the worst so far as it lies in his power but in the latter position he is continually exposed to the caprices of a race who are in many respects as changeable as the very air they breathe In the old Mexican town of Don Fernandez de Taos as we have before said resides at the present time Kit Carson A stranger entering this town and especially at a little distance from it is reminded of a number of brick kilns just previous to being burnt and all huddled together without any regard being paid to symmetry In order to reach the Plaza which is the main feature of attraction belonging to the town the traveler is obliged to follow the crooks and turns of several unattractive streets The home of Kit Carson faces on the west side of this public square It is a building only one story in height but as it extends over a considerable space of ground it makes up in part this defect and within it is surpassed by but few other houses in the country for the degree of comfort which is furnishes to its occupants On most any fair day around the doors of this house may be seen many Indians of various tribes who are either waiting for their companions within or else for the opportunity to present itself so that they themselves can enter Business or no business to transact with Kit Carson they cannot come to town without visiting Father Kit and having a smoke and talk with him Kit Carson enjoys himself in their society for his heart and hand have long since taught them that irrespective of the office which he holds towards them he is their true friend and benefactor Never is his patience exhausted by their lengthy visits He listens to their narrations of grievances which they lay freely before him for his counsel even in matters exclusively personal Being familiar with all those things which will in the least touch their feelings and make them interested he finds no difficulty in entering into the spirit of their affairs in a manner that exactly suits their tastes This causes them to look upon him in the same light as they would upon some brave and experienced chief of their own race Kit Carson takes every opportunity to warn the Indians against the use of intoxicating drinks and shows them by his own example that fire water is a dangerous luxury which man does not require and in which he should not indulge Notwithstanding his best efforts now and then they get under its influence On becoming sober they are so ashamed of their conduct that they often keep clear of their agent until they think he has forgotten the occurrence Kit Carson to a certain extent treats Indians as a wise father does his own children hence he has won their respect as well as confidence which fact has given him more influence over them than any other man in the country where he lives When Kit Carson enters the various villages of the Indians under his supervision he is invariably received with the most marked attention Having selected the warrior whose guest he intends to be he accompanies him to his lodge which is known during his stay as the soldiers lodge He gives himself no concern about his horse saddle bridle rifle or any minor thing The brave whom he has thus honoured considers that he has assumed the responsibility of a soldier and so styles himself This making of a soldier is no every day business with the Indians It is only when they are visited by some great personage for whom they have the greatest respect that this ceremony is gone through with When thus favored the soldier at once becomes the sworn friend of the white man who occupies his lodge and will fight and die for him even against his own brethren It is the opinion of Kit Carson that Indians should not be allowed to come when it pleases them into the settlements Every visit which they thus make is detrimental to them in many ways He thinks that the time thus spent could be better employed in hunting or otherwise providing for the wants of their families In the towns of the frontiers they do nothing but beg and learn the vices of the white man which added to their own make them as dangerous and wicked as men can be In lieu thereof he advises that mission and agency houses should be established in their midst when supplies should be furnished to them in a time of need As matters stand now the Indians during a severe winter or from some unforeseen accident are liable to become suddenly destitute They are then compelled either to starve or to make inroads upon the property of the settlers on the frontiers Besides his Indian friends Kit Carson is surrounded by a host of Mexicans and Americans to whom he has greatly endeared himself To his children Kit Carson is a kind and indulgent father and to best illustrate his self sacrificing attachment for them it is only necessary to relate one striking incident of its proof A few years since he was returning to Taos from Rayado whither he had been on a visit in company with his wife two children and two servants a Mexican man and woman The party had completed the first half of their journey and were jogging along over a tract of prairie land that was of considerable extent when suddenly Kit Carson discovered far off a band of about forty Indians Being so exposed he at once concluded that he also had been seen for while he was looking he thought he could see the speed of their riding animals increase The glaring rays of the sun impeded his view so that he could not discern at such a distance either from their dress or appearance to what tribe they belonged He was in a section of country that was frequently visited by the marauding Camanches and as their signs had been recently seen in the neighborhood he made up his mind that it was a band of this tribe that he now saw No time was to be lost so dismounting from the very fleet horse he was riding he placed in his saddle his wife and eldest child To the first named he gave directions to follow on the trail that led to Taos and let the bridle reins be a little slack so that the horse would know what was expected of him when he would travel at the top of his speed He said that he intended to ride towards the Indians and engage them at first in a parley and then if necessary offer them a single handed combat At any rate before they could manage to kill him she would have sufficient time to lessen her danger As to the remainder of the party he added there was no alternative but for them to take their chances for life or death Bidding his wife and boy good bye with one heart rending look he turned to face his apparent doom As Kit approached the Indians they began to call out his name As soon as he heard this he aroused himself from the agonizing frame of mind he had been laboring under after parting with all that was so dear to him and as he had thought for the last time To his joy Kit quickly recognized before him the familiar faces of some of his Indian friends They had come as they afterwards informed him to see him and his helpless charge safely lodged in their home for they had become aware that he was exposed to great danger While the friends were talking some of the Indians began to laugh which caused Carson to turn his head and look in the direction they were gazing To his astonishment and disgust he saw the truth was too evident to be mistaken that the cowardly Mexican man had on his leaving pulled off from her horse missus Carson and her child and having mounted the animal himself was making good his escape The Indians wished to keep up the ruse pursue Attempt to overtake and punish the poltroon but Kit Carson was too thankful that matters had gone so well therefore he said that he felt that he could excuse such dastardly conduct and requested the Indians to let it pass unnoticed It is hardly necessary to add that with his faithful body guard who had come to watch over him from feelings of earnest respect gratitude and affectionate regard the agent accomplished the remainder of his journey in perfect safety Several years have elapsed as the reader can easily estimate since Kit Carson met while traveling home from one of his expeditions the Mormon delegate to Congress who had first informed him of his appointment as Indian agent During this length of time Kit Carson has retained this office and rendered satisfactory service The tract of country over which the Indians roam who are especially connected with his agency is about equal in its area to any one of the larger States in the American Confederacy The Indians who are under his jurisdiction are large and powerful bands of the Apaches and Utahs but as we have said before neighboring tribes freely seek his counsel aid and protectorate power as they may require it and they all from habit consider that they have a claim on his services To best illustrate this we have but to cite one instance of which a thousand similar exist Two Indian women were taken prisoners by the red men of the plains from a band of savages not under the immediate control of Kit Carson who inhabited a section of New Mexico These squaws while captives were subjected to the severest labor and the most brutal punishment which Indian ingenuity could invent For one year they submitted without exhibiting any outward symptoms by which their condition could be known but at the end of that time they resolved to escape even if they were killed in the attempt Watching a favorable opportunity they started and fortunately so well laid their plans that for some time they were not missed On their prolonged absence being noticed a party who were well mounted commenced the pursuit no doubt believing that to recapture the runaways would be an easy task The squaws however eluded these horsemen and on foot made their way to Kit Carson s house at Taos By him they were hospitably received entertained and amply provided for They had traveled on foot for hundreds of miles and while en route had lived on roots and such other food as fell in their way In their reduced condition it required kindness proper diet and rest to resuscitate them In the comfortable house to which they had come these things were at hand and were freely given without hoping for the rewards which man can give The pursuers of these unfortunate Indian women followed on their trail which with native instinct the squaws had made as indistinct as possible until they found themselves at a Mexican settlement within the boundaries of New Mexico Here they were informed that their late captives were safe under the protection of Kit Carson This name acted like magic in settling their future mode of proceedings They needed nothing more to bid them face about and retrace their steps to their own homes The squaws in the household of Kit Carson rapidly recruited and when the time came for them to be sent to their own tribe they went away rejoicing at their good fortune first in making their escape and second because they had been so humanely treated by a man whose name they had often heard but never before seen As we have said before and with truth this is but one example out of thousands which have passed by unheralded since Kit Carson first commenced his official career as Indian agent The duties of an agent are not by Kit Carson confined to the mere letter of the law His is a heart that could not be happy were he not daily doing some equitable and humane act to ameliorate the condition of the Indian race The strict duties of an Indian agent require that he should receive and disburse certain sums of money in purchasing such minor articles as the tribes over which he is placed may require He has to give monthly and quarterly reports to the General Government and the superintendent of the Territory he is in of the condition crimes practices habits intentions health and such other things as pertain to the economy of his charge How seldom is this knowledge properly attained and how often are these things intrusted to clerks while the principal receives the emoluments of his office Of the details which make the Indian happy or miserable he too frequently knows but little about except from routine The agent if he be a fit man and the Indian is by no means slow in forming his estimate of the person he has to deal with is received into the confidence of the tribes when after sufficient trial he has been proved worthy of their esteem and friendship When once he has gained a foothold in the affections of the savages his task assumes the condition of pleasure rather than severe labor but if he is ignorant of the minute workings of his business he is generally imposed upon and always disliked to such a degree that no honorable man would retain such a position longer than to find out his unpopularity and the causes of it The Indian agent to perform his duties well must be continually at his agency house or among the Indians in order that he may personally attend to their wants and protect them from the mercenary visits and contact of outside intruders who are continually watching their opportunity like hungry wolves to prey upon and cheat them in every shape and form In fine he is to assist the superintendent in managing the entire Indian family The business of Indian agent which he strictly and conscientiously attends to keeps Kit Carson employed during the most of his time yet as often as once each year he manages affairs so that he can spend a few weeks in the exciting scenes of the chase On these excursions which are eagerly looked forward to by his friends he is accompanied by the crack shots of the country including his Indian and Mexican friends On horseback and on open prairies Kit Carson is indisputably the greatest hunter in America if indeed he is not the greatest hunter now living He has killed in the brief space of three consecutive hours with his rifle twenty two antelope at a time when the game was so scarce that other men who followed the business of hunting under pay and were no ordinary shots thought themselves doing well to bring down six of the same animals It gives the greatest satisfaction to the people of New Mexico that Kit Carson is from time to time reinstalled in his office of Indian agent notwithstanding the other great changes that have been and are continually making in their politics His fitness for the position which he holds cannot be doubted when the good already accomplished by his efforts is considered No one would be so loath to part with his services as the Indians themselves His influence reaches far beyond his own tribes and is felt by the Cheyennes Arrapahoes and Kiowas who are fast becoming very chary about visiting with hostile intentions the settlements of northern New Mexico Kit Carson is still in the full vigor of his manhood and is capable of undergoing almost any amount of privation and hardship therefore we infer that to the country he has adopted he will be spared many years to come as one of its most valuable citizens And when the time arrives for his final exit from this stage of life he will bequeath to his family and friends a spotless character and an enviable reputation FINIS RECENTLY ISSUED BY W R C CLARK company three hundred forty
