Harper and Brothers edition by David Price email ccxseventy four coventry ac uk THE PURSUIT OF THE HOUSE BOAT by John Kendrick Bangs CHAPTER I THE ASSOCIATED SHADES TAKE ACTION The House boat of the Associated Shades formerly located upon the River Styx as the reader may possibly remember had been torn from its moorings and navigated out into unknown seas by that vengeful pirate Captain Kidd aided and abetted by some of the most ruffianly inhabitants of Hades Like a thief in the night had they come and for no better reason than that the Captain had been unanimously voted a shade too shady to associate with self respecting spirits had they made off with the happy floating club house of their betters and worst of all with them by force of circumstances over which they had no control had sailed also the fair Queen Elizabeth the spirited Xanthippe and every other strong minded and beautiful woman of Erebean society whereby the men thereof were rendered desolate I can t stand it cried Raleigh desperately as with his accustomed grace he presided over a special meeting of the club called on the bank of the inky Stygian stream at the point where the missing boat had been moored Think of it gentlemen Elizabeth of England Calpurnia of Rome Ophelia of Denmark and every precious jewel in our social diadem gone vanished completely and with whom Kidd of all men in the universe Kidd the pirate the ruffian Don t take on so my dear Sir Walter said Socrates cheerfully What s the use of going into hysterics You are not a woman and should eschew that luxury Xanthippe is with them and I ll warrant you that when that cherished spouse of mine has recovered from the effects of the sea say the third day out Kidd and his crew will be walking the plank and voluntarily at that But the House boat itself murmured Noah sadly That was my delight It reminded me in some respects of the Ark The law of compensation enters in there my dear Commodore retorted Socrates For me with Xanthippe abroad I do not need a club to go to I can stay at home and take my hemlock in peace and straight Xanthippe always compelled me to dilute it at the rate of one quart of water to the finger Well we didn t all marry Xanthippe put in Caesar firmly therefore we are not all satisfied with the situation I for one quite agree with Sir Walter that something must be done and quickly Are we to sit here and do nothing allowing that fiend to kidnap our wives with impunity Not at all interposed Bonaparte The time for action has arrived All things considered he is welcome to Marie Louise but the idea of Josephine going off on a cruise of that kind breaks my heart No question about it observed doctor Johnson We ve got to do something if it is only for the sake of appearances The question really is what shall be done first I am in favor of taking a drink as the first step and considering the matter of further action afterwards suggested Shakespeare and it was this suggestion that made the members unanimous upon the necessity for immediate action for when the assembled spirits called for their various favorite beverages it was found that there were none to be had it being Sunday and all the establishments wherein liquid refreshments were licensed to be sold being closed for at the time of writing the local government of Hades was in the hands of the reform party What cried Socrates Nothing but Styx water and vitriol Sundays Then the House boat must be recovered whether Xanthippe comes with it or not Sir Walter I am for immediate action after all This ruffian should be captured at once and made an example of Excuse me Socrates put in Lindley Murray but ah pray speak in Greek hereafter will you please When you attempt English you have a beastly way of working up to climatic prepositions which are offensive to the ear of a purist This is no time to discuss style Murray interposed Sir Walter Socrates may speak and spell like Chaucer if he pleases he may even part his infinitives in the middle for all I care We have affairs of greater moment in hand We must ransack the earth cried Socrates until we find that boat I m dry as a fish There he goes again growled Murray Dry as a fish What fish I d like to know is dry Red herrings retorted Socrates and there was a great laugh at the expense of the purist in which even Hamlet who had grown more and more melancholy and morbid since the abduction of Ophelia joined Then it is settled said Raleigh something must be done And now the point is what Relief expeditions have a way of finding things suggested doctor Livingstone Or rather of being found by the things they go out to relieve I propose that we send out a number of them I will take Africa Bonaparte can lead an expedition into Europe General Washington may have North America and I beg pardon put in doctor Johnson but have you any idea doctor Livingstone that Captain Kidd has put wheels on this House boat of ours and is having it dragged across the Sahara by mules or camels No such absurd idea ever entered my head retorted the Doctor Do you then believe that he has put runners on it and is engaged in the pleasurable pastime of taking the ladies tobogganing down the Alps persisted the philosopher Not at all Why do you ask queried the African explorer irritably Because I wish to know said Johnson That is always my motive in asking questions You propose to go looking for a house boat in Central Africa you suggest that Bonaparte lead an expedition in search of it through Europe all of which strikes me as nonsense This search is the work of sea dogs not of landlubbers You might as well ask Confucius to look for it in the heart of China What earthly use there is in ransacking the earth I fail to see What we need is a navel expedition to scour the sea unless it is pretty well understood in advance that we believe Kidd has hauled the boat out of the water and is now using it for a roller skating rink or a bicycle academy in Ohio or for some other purpose for which neither he nor it was designed doctor Johnson s point is well taken said a stranger who had been sitting upon the string piece of the pier quietly but with very evident interest listening to the discussion He was a tall and excessively slender shade like a spirt of steam out of a teapot as Johnson put it afterwards so slight he seemed I have not the honor of being a member of this association the stranger continued but like all well ordered shades I aspire to the distinction and I hold myself and my talents at the disposal of this club I fancy it will not take us long to establish our initial point which is that the gross person who has so foully appropriated your property to his own base uses does not contemplate removing it from its keel and placing it somewhere inland All the evidence in hand points to a radically different conclusion which is my sole reason for doubting the value of that conclusion Captain Kidd is a seafarer by instinct not a landsman The House boat is not a house but a boat therefore the place to look for it is not as doctor Johnson so well says in the Sahara Desert or on the Alps or in the State of Ohio but upon the high sea or upon the waterfront of some one of the world s great cities And what then would be your plan asked Sir Walter impressed by the stranger s manner as well as by the very manifest reason in all that he had said The chartering of a suitable vessel fully armed and equipped for the purpose of pursuit Ascertain whither the House boat has sailed for what port and start at once Have you a model of the House boat within reach returned the stranger I think not we have the architect s plans however said the chairman We had mister Chairman said Demosthenes who was secretary of the House Committee rising but they are gone with the House boat itself They were kept in the safe in the hold A look of annoyance came into the face of the stranger That s too bad he said It was a most important part of my plan that we should know about how fast the House boat was Humph ejaculated Socrates with ill concealed sarcasm If you ll take Xanthippe s word for it the House boat was the fastest yacht afloat I refer to the matter of speed in sailing returned the stranger quietly The question of its ethical speed has nothing to do with it The designer of the craft is here said Sir Walter fixing his eyes upon Sir Christopher Wren It is possible that he may be of assistance in settling that point What has all this got to do with the question anyhow mister Chairman asked Solomon rising impatiently and addressing Sir Walter We aren t preparing for a yacht race that I know of Nobody s after a cup or a championship of any kind What we do want is to get our wives back The Captain hasn t taken more than half of mine along with him but I am interested none the less The Queen of Sheba is on board and I am somewhat interested in her fate So I ask you what earthly or unearthly use there is in discussing this question of speed in the House boat It strikes me as a woful waste of time and rather unprecedented too that we should suspend all rules and listen to the talk of an entire stranger I do not venture to doubt the wisdom of Solomon said Johnson dryly but I must say that the gentleman s remarks rather interest me Of course they do ejaculated Solomon He agreed with you That ought to make him interesting to everybody Freaks usually are That is not the reason at all retorted doctor Johnson Cold water agrees with me but it doesn t interest me What I do think however is that our unknown friend seems to have a grasp on the situation by which we are confronted and he s going at the matter in hand in a very comprehensive fashion I move therefore that Solomon be laid on the table and that the privileges of the ah of the wharf be extended indefinitely to our friend on the string piece The motion having been seconded was duly carried and the stranger resumed I will explain for the benefit of his Majesty King Solomon whose wisdom I have always admired and whose endurance as the husband of three hundred wives has filled me with wonder he said that before starting in pursuit of the stolen vessel we must select a craft of some sort for the purpose and that in selecting the pursuer it is quite essential that we should choose a vessel of greater speed than the one we desire to overtake It would hardly be proper I think if the House boat can sail four knots an hour to attempt to overhaul her with a launch or other nautical craft with a maximum speed of two knots an hour Hear hear ejaculated Caesar That is my reason your Majesty for inquiring as to the speed of your late club house said the stranger bowing courteously to Solomon Now if Sir Christopher Wren can give me her measurements we can very soon determine at about what rate she is leaving us behind under favorable circumstances Tisn t necessary for Sir Christopher to do anything of the sort said Noah rising and manifesting somewhat more heat than the occasion seemed to require As long as we are discussing the question I will take the liberty of stating what I have never mentioned before that the designer of the House boat merely appropriated the lines of the Ark Shem Ham and Japhet will bear testimony to the truth of that statement There can be no quarrel on that score mister Chairman assented Sir Christopher with cutting frigidity I am perfectly willing to admit that practically the two vessels were built on the same lines but with modifications which would enable my boat to sail twenty miles to windward and back in six days less time than it would have taken the Ark to cover the same distance and it could have taken all the wash of the excursion steamers into the bargain Bosh ejaculated Noah angrily Strip your old tub down to a flying balloon jib and a marline spike and ballast the Ark with elephants until every inch of her reeked with ivory and peanuts and she d outfoot you on every leg in a cyclone or a zephyr Give me the Ark and a breeze and your House boat wouldn t be within hailing distance of her five minutes after the start if she had forty thousand square yards of canvas spread before a gale This discussion is waxing very unprofitable observed Confucius If these gentlemen cannot be made to confine themselves to the subject that is agitating this body I move we call in the authorities and have them confined in the bottomless pit I did not precipitate the quarrel said Noah I was merely trying to assist our friend on the string piece I was going to say that as the Ark was probably a hundred times faster than Sir Christopher Wren s tub which he himself says can take care of all the wash of the excursion boats thereby becoming on his own admission a wash tub Order order cried Sir Christopher I was going to say that this wash tub could be overhauled by a launch or any other craft with a speed of thirty knots a mouth continued Noah ignoring the interruption Took him forty days to get to Mount Ararat sneered Sir Christopher Well your boat would have got there two weeks sooner I ll admit retorted Noah if she d sprung a leak at the right time Granting the truth of Noah s statement said Sir Walter motioning to the angry architect to be quiet not that we take any side in the issue between the two gentlemen but merely for the sake of argument I wish to ask the stranger who has been good enough to interest himself in our trouble what he proposes to do how can you establish your course in case a boat were provided Also vot vill be dher gost if any put in Shylock A murmur of disapprobation greeted this remark The cost need not trouble you sir said Sir Walter indignantly addressing the stranger you will have carte blanche Den ve are ruint cried Shylock displaying his palms and showing by that act a select assortment of diamond rings Oh laughed the stranger that is a simple matter Captain Kidd has gone to London To London cried several members at once How do you know that By this said the stranger holding up the tiny stub end of a cigar Tut tut ejaculated Solomon What child s play is this No your Majesty observed the stranger it is not child s play it is fact That cigar end was thrown aside here on the wharf by Captain Kidd just before he stepped on board the House boat How do you know that demanded Raleigh And granting the truth of the assertion what does it prove I will tell you said the stranger And he at once proceeded as follows CHAPTER II THE STRANGER UNRAVELS A MYSTERY AND REVEALS HIMSELF I have made a hobby of the study of cigar ends said the stranger as the Associated Shades settled back to hear his account of himself From my earliest youth when I used surreptitiously to remove the unsmoked ends of my father s cigars and break them up and in hiding smoke them in an old clay pipe which I had presented to me by an ancient sea captain of my acquaintance I have been interested in tobacco in all forms even including these self same despised unsmoked ends for they convey to my mind messages sentiments farces comedies and tragedies which to your minds would never become manifest through their agency The company drew closer together and formed themselves in a more compact mass about the speaker It was evident that they were beginning to feel an unusual interest in this extraordinary person who had come among them unheralded and unknown Even Shylock stopped calculating percentages for an instant to listen Do you mean to tell us demanded Shakespeare that the unsmoked stub of a cigar will suggest the story of him who smoked it to your mind I do replied the stranger with a confident smile Take this one for instance that I have picked up here upon the wharf it tells me the whole story of the intentions of Captain Kidd at the moment when in utter disregard of your rights he stepped aboard your House boat and in his usual piratical fashion made off with it into unknown seas But how do you know he smoked it asked Solomon who deemed it the part of wisdom to be suspicious of the stranger There are two curious indentations in it which prove that The marks of two teeth with a hiatus between which you will see if you look closely said the stranger handing the small bit of tobacco to Sir Walter make that point evident beyond peradventure The Captain lost an eye tooth in one of his later raids it was knocked out by a marine spike which had been hurled at him by one of the crew of the treasure ship he and his followers had attacked The adjacent teeth were broken but not removed The cigar end bears the marks of those two jagged molars with the hiatus which as I have indicated is due to the destruction of the eye tooth between them It is not likely that there was another man in the pirate s crew with teeth exactly like the commander s therefore I say there can be no doubt that the cigar end was that of the Captain himself Very interesting indeed observed Blackstone removing his wig and fanning himself with it but I must confess mister Chairman that in any properly constituted law court this evidence would long since have been ruled out as irrelevant and absurd The idea of two or three hundred dignified spirits like ourselves gathered together to devise a means for the recovery of our property and the rescue of our wives yielding the floor to the delivering of a lecture by an entire stranger on Cigar Ends He Has Met strikes me as ridiculous in the extreme Of what earthly interest is it to us to know that this or that cigar was smoked by Captain Kidd Merely that it will help us on your honor to discover the whereabouts of the said Kidd interposed the stranger It is by trifles seeming trifles that the greatest detective work is done My friends Le Coq Hawkshaw and Old Sleuth will bear me out in this I think however much in other respects our methods may have differed They left no stone unturned in the pursuit of a criminal no detail however trifling uncared for No more should we in the present instance overlook the minutest bit of evidence however irrelevant and absurd at first blush it may appear to be The truth of what I say was very effectually proven in the strange case of the Brokedale tiara in which I figured somewhat conspicuously but which have never made public because it involves a secret affecting the integrity of one of the noblest families in the British Empire I really believe that mystery was solved easily and at once because I happened to remember that the number of my watch was eighty six thousand five hundred sevenB How trivial and yet how important it was to what then transpired you will realize when I tell you the incident The stranger s manner was so impressive that there was a unanimous and simultaneous movement upon the part of all present to get up closer so as the more readily to hear what he said as a result of which poor old Boswell was pushed overboard and fell with a loud splash into the Styx Fortunately however one of Charon s pleasure boats was close at hand and in a short while the dripping sputtering spirit was drawn into it wrung out and sent home to dry The excitement attending this diversion having subsided Solomon asked What was the incident of the lost tiara I am about to tell you returned the stranger and it must be understood that you are told in the strictest confidence for as I say the incident involves a state secret of great magnitude In life in the mortal life gentlemen I was a detective by profession and if I do say it who perhaps should not I was one of the most interesting for purely literary purposes that has ever been known I did not find it necessary to go about saying Ha ha as M Le Coq was accustomed to do to advertise his cleverness neither did I disguise myself as a drum major and hide under a kitchen table for the purpose of solving a mystery involving the abduction of a parlor stove after the manner of the talented Hawkshaw By mental concentration alone without fireworks or orchestral accompaniment of any sort whatsoever did I go about my business and for that very reason many of my fellow sleuths were forced to go out of real detective work into that line of the business with which the stage has familiarized the most of us a line in which nothing but stupidity luck and a yellow wig is required of him who pursues it This man is an impostor whispered Le Coq to Hawkshaw I ve known that all along by the mole on his left wrist returned Hawkshaw contemptuously I suspected it the minute I saw he was not disguised returned Le Coq knowingly I have observed that the greatest villains latterly have discarded disguises as being too easily penetrated and therefore of no avail and merely a useless expense Silence cried Confucius impatiently How can the gentleman proceed with all this conversation going on in the rear Hawkshaw and Le Coq immediately subsided and the stranger went on It was in this way that I treated the strange case of the lost tiara resumed the stranger Mental concentration upon seemingly insignificant details alone enabled me to bring about the desired results in that instance A brief outline of the case is as follows It was late one evening in the early spring of eighteen ninety four The London season was at its height Dances fetes of all kinds opera and the theatres were in full blast when all of a sudden society was paralyzed by a most audacious robbery A diamond tiara valued at fifty thousand pounds sterling had been stolen from the Duchess of Brokedale and under circumstances which threw society itself and every individual in it under suspicion even his Royal Highness the Prince himself for he had danced frequently with the Duchess and was known to be a great admirer of her tiara It was at half past eleven o clock at night that the news of the robbery first came to my ears I had been spending the evening alone in my library making notes for a second volume of my memoirs and feeling somewhat depressed I was on the point of going out for my usual midnight walk on Hampstead Heath when one of my servants hastily entering informed me of the robbery I changed my mind in respect to my midnight walk immediately upon receipt of the news for I knew that before one o clock some one would call upon me at my lodgings with reference to this robbery It could not be otherwise Any mystery of such magnitude could no more be taken to another bureau than elephants could fly They used to said Adam I once had a whole aviary full of winged elephants They flew from flower to flower and thrusting their probabilities deep into Their what queried Johnson with a frown Probabilities isn t that the word Their trunks said Adam Probosces I imagine you mean suggested Johnson Yes that was it Their probosces said Adam They were great honey gatherers those elephants far better than the bees because they could make so much more of it in a given time Munchausen shook his head sadly I m afraid I m outclassed by these antediluvians he said Gentlemen gentlemen cried Sir Walter These interruptions are inexcusable That s what I think said the stranger with some asperity I m having about as hard a time getting this story out as I would if it were a serial Of course if you gentlemen do not wish to hear it I can stop but it must be understood that when I do stop I stop finally once and for all because the tale has not a sufficiency of dramatic climaxes to warrant its prolongation over the usual magazine period of twelve months Go on go on cried some Shut up cried others addressing the interrupting members of course As I was saying resumed the stranger I felt confident that within an hour in some way or other that case would be placed in my hands It would be mine either positively or negatively that is to say either the person robbed would employ me to ferret out the mystery and recover the diamonds or the robber himself actuated by motives of self preservation would endeavor to direct my energies into other channels until he should have the time to dispose of his ill gotten booty A mental discussion of the probabilities inclined me to believe that the latter would be the case I reasoned in this fashion The person robbed is of exalted rank She cannot move rapidly because she is so Great bodies move slowly It is probable that it will be a week before according to the etiquette by which she is hedged about she can communicate with me In the first place she must inform one of her attendants that she has been robbed He must communicate the news to the functionary in charge of her residence who will communicate with the Home Secretary and from him will issue the orders to the police who baffled at every step will finally address themselves to me I ll give that side two weeks I said On the other hand the robber will he allow himself to be lulled into a false sense of security by counting on this delay or will he not noting my habit of occasionally entering upon detective enterprises of this nature of my own volition come to me at once and set me to work ferreting out some crime that has never been committed My feeling was that this would happen and I pulled out my watch to see if it were not nearly time for him to arrive The robbery had taken place at a state ball at the Buckingham Palace H m I mused He has had an hour and forty minutes to get here It is now twelve twenty He should be here by twelve forty five I will wait And hastily swallowing a cocaine tablet to nerve myself up for the meeting I sat down and began to read my Schopenhauer Hardly had I perused a page when there came a tap upon my door I rose with a smile for I thought I knew what was to happen opened the door and there stood much to my surprise the husband of the lady whose tiara was missing It was the Duke of Brokedale himself It is true he was disguised His beard was powdered until it looked like snow and he wore a wig and a pair of green goggles but I recognized him at once by his lack of manners which is an unmistakable sign of nobility As I opened the door he began You are mister I am I replied Come in You have come to see me about your stolen watch It is a gold hunting case watch with a Swiss movement loses five minutes a day stem winder and the back cover which does not bear any inscription has upon it the indentations made by the molars of your son Willie when that interesting youth was cutting his teeth upon it Wonderful cried Johnson May I ask how you knew all that asked Solomon deeply impressed Such penetration strikes me as marvellous I didn t know it replied the stranger with a smile What I said was intended to be jocular and to put Brokedale at his ease The Americans present with their usual astuteness would term it bluff It was I merely rattled on I simply did not wish to offend the gentleman by letting him know that I had penetrated his disguise Imagine my surprise however when his eye brightened as I spoke and he entered my room with such alacrity that half the powder which he thought disguised his beard was shaken off on to the floor Sitting down in the chair I had just vacated he quietly remarked You are a wonderful man sir How did you know that I had lost my watch For a moment I was nonplussed more than that I was completely staggered I had expected him to say at once that he had not lost his watch but had come to see me about the tiara and to have him take my words seriously was entirely unexpected and overwhelmingly surprising However in view of his rank I deemed it well to fall in with his humour Oh as for that I replied that is a part of my business It is the detective s place to know everything and generally if he reveals the machinery by means of which he reaches his conclusions he is a fool since his method is his secret and his secret his stock in trade I do not mind telling you however that I knew your watch was stolen by your anxious glance at my clock which showed that you wished to know the time Now most rich Americans have watches for that purpose and have no hesitation about showing them If you d had a watch you d have looked at it not at my clock My visitor laughed and repeated what he had said about my being a wonderful man And the dents which my son made cutting his teeth he added Invariably go with an American s watch Rubber or ivory rings aren t good enough for American babies to chew on said I They must have gold watches or nothing And finally how did you know I was a rich American he asked Because no other can afford to stop at hotels like the Savoy in the height of the season I replied thinking that the jest would end there and that he would now reveal his identity and speak of the tiara To my surprise however he did nothing of the sort You have an almost supernatural gift he said My name is Bunker I am stopping at the Savoy I AM an American I WAS rich when I arrived here but I m not quite so bloated with wealth as I was now that I have paid my first week s bill I HAVE lost my watch such a watch too as you describe even to the dents Your only mistake was that the dents were made by my son John and not Willie but even there I cannot but wonder at you for John and Willie are twins and so much alike that it sometimes baffles even their mother to tell them apart The watch has no very great value intrinsically but the associations are such that I want it back and I will pay two hundred pounds for its recovery I have no clew as to who took it It was numbered Here a happy thought struck me In all my description of the watch I had merely described my own a very cheap affair which I had won at a raffle My visitor was deceiving me though for what purpose I did not on the instant divine No one would like to suspect him of having purloined his wife s tiara Why should I not deceive him and at the same time get rid of my poor chronometer for a sum that exceeded its value a hundredfold Good business cried Shylock The stranger smiled and bowed Excellent he said I took the words right out of his mouth It was numbered eighty six thousand five hundred sevenB I cried giving of course the number of my own watch He gazed at me narrowly for a moment and then he smiled You grow more marvellous at every step That was indeed the number Are you a demon No I replied Only something of a mind reader Well to be brief the bargain was struck I was to look for a watch that I knew he hadn t lost and was to receive two hundred pounds if I found it It seemed to him to be a very good bargain as indeed it was from his point of view feeling as he did that there never having been any such watch it could not be recovered and little suspecting that two could play at his little game of deception and that under any circumstances I could foist a ten shilling watch upon him for two hundred pounds This business concluded he started to go Won t you have a little Scotch I asked as he started feeling with all that prospective profit in view I could well afford the expense It is a stormy night Thanks I will said he returning and seating himself by my table still to my surprise keeping his hat on Let me take your hat I said little thinking that my courtesy would reveal the true state of affairs The mere mention of the word hat brought about a terrible change in my visitor his knees trembled his face grew ghastly and he clutched the brim of his beaver until it cracked He then nervously removed it and I noticed a dull red mark running about his forehead just as there would be on the forehead of a man whose hat fitted too tightly and that mark gentlemen had the undulating outline of nothing more nor less than a tiara and on the apex of the uttermost extremity was a deep indentation about the size of a shilling that could have been made only by some adamantine substance The mystery was solved The robber of the Duchess of Brokedale stood before me A suppressed murmur of excitement went through the assembled spirits and even Messrs Hawkshaw and Le Coq were silent in the presence of such genius My plan of action was immediately formulated The man was completely at my mercy He had stolen the tiara and had it concealed in the lining of his hat I rose and locked the door My visitor sank with a groan into my chair Why did you do that he stammered as I turned the key in the lock To keep my Scotch whiskey from evaporating I said dryly Now my lord I added it will pay your Grace to let me have your hat I know who you are You are the Duke of Brokedale The Duchess of Brokedale has lost a valuable tiara of diamonds and you have not lost your watch Somebody has stolen the diamonds and it may be that somewhere there is a Bunker who has lost such a watch as I have described The queer part of it all is I continued handing him the decanter and taking a couple of loaded six shooters out of my escritoire the queer part of it all is that I have the watch and you have the tiara We ll swap the swag Hand over the bauble please But he began We won t have any butting your Grace said I I ll give you the watch and you needn t mind the two hundred pounds and you must give me the tiara or I ll accompany you forthwith to the police and have a search made of your hat It won t pay you to defy me Give it up He gave up the hat at once and as I suspected there lay the tiara snugly stowed away behind the head band You are a great fellow said I as I held the tiara up to the light and watched with pleasure the flashing brilliance of its gems I beg you ll not expose me he moaned I was driven to it by necessity Not I I replied As long as you play fair it will be all right I m not going to keep this thing I m not married and so have no use for such a trifle but what I do intend is simply to wait until your wife retains me to find it and then I ll find it and get the reward If you keep perfectly still I ll have it found in such a fashion that you ll never be suspected If on the other hand you say a word about to night s events I ll hand you over to the police Humph he said You couldn t prove a case against me I can prove any case against anybody I retorted If you don t believe it read my book I added and I handed him a copy of my memoirs I ve read it he answered and I ought to have known better than to come here I thought you were only a literary success And with a deep drawn sigh he took the watch and went out Ten days later I was retained by the Duchess and after a pretended search of ten days more I found the tiara restored it to the noble lady and received the five thousand pounds reward The Duke kept perfectly quiet about our little encounter and afterwards we became stanch friends for he was a good fellow and was driven to his desperate deed only by the demands of his creditors and the following Christmas he sent me the watch I had given him with the best wishes of the season So you see gentlemen in a moment by quick wit and a mental concentration of no mean order combined with strict observance of the pettiest details I ferreted out what bade fair to become a great diamond mystery and when I say that this cigar end proves certain things to my mind it does not become you to doubt the value of my conclusions Hear hear cried Raleigh growing tumultuous with enthusiasm Your name your name came from all parts of the wharf The stranger putting his hand into the folds of his coat drew forth a bundle of business cards which he tossed as the prestidigitator tosses playing cards out among the audience and on each of them was found printed the words SHERLOCK HOLMES DETECTIVE FERRETING DONE HERE Plots for Sale I think he made a mistake in not taking the two hundred pounds for the watch Such carelessness destroys my confidence in him said Shylock who was the first to recover from the surprise of the revelation CHAPTER III THE SEARCH PARTY IS ORGANIZED Well mister Holmes said Sir Walter Raleigh after three rousing cheers led by Hamlet had been given with a will by the assembled spirits after this demonstration in your honor I think it is hardly necessary for me to assure you of our hearty company operation in anything you may venture to suggest There is still manifest however some desire on the part of the ever wise King Solomon and my friend Confucius to know how you deduce that Kidd has sailed for London from the cigar end which you hold in your hand I can easily satisfy their curiosity said Sherlock Holmes genially I believe I have already proven that it is the end of Kidd s cigar The marks of the teeth have shown that Now observe how closely it is smoked there is barely enough of it left for one to insert between his teeth Now Captain Kidd would hardly have risked the edges of his mustache and the comfort of his lips by smoking a cigar down to the very light if he had had another nor would he under any circumstances have smoked it that far unless he were passionately addicted to this particular brand of the weed Therefore I say to you first this was his cigar second it was the last one he had third he is a confirmed smoker The result he has gone to the one place in the world where these Connecticut hand rolled Havana cigars for I recognize this as one of them have a real popularity and are therefore more certainly obtainable and that is at London You cannot get so vile a cigar as that outside of a London hotel If I could have seen a quarter inch more of it I should have been able definitely to locate the hotel itself The wrappers unroll to a degree that varies perceptibly as between the different hotels The Fortuna cigar can be smoked a quarter through before its wrapper gives way the Felix wrapper goes as soon as you light the cigar whereas the River fronting on the Thames is surrounded by a moister atmosphere than the others and as a consequence the wrapper will hold really until most people are willing to throw the whole thing away It is really a wonderful art said Solomon The making of a Connecticut Havana cigar laughed Holmes Not at all Give me a head of lettuce and a straw and I ll make you a box I referred to your art that of detection said Solomon Your logic is perfect step by step we have been led to the irresistible conclusion that Kidd has made for London and can be found at one of these hotels And only until next Tuesday when he will take a house in the neighborhood of Scotland Yard put in Holmes quickly observing a sneer on Hawkshaw s lips and hastening to overwhelm him by further evidence of his ingenuity When he gets his bill he will open his piratical eyes so wide that he will be seized with jealousy to think of how much more refined his profession has become since he left it and out of mere pique he will leave the hotel and to show himself still cleverer than his modern prototypes he will leave his account unpaid with the result that the affair will be put in the hands of the police under which circumstances a house in the immediate vicinity of the famous police headquarters will be the safest hiding place he can find as was instanced by the remarkable case of the famous Penstock bond robbery A certain churchwarden named Hinkley having been appointed cashier thereof robbed the Penstock Imperial Bank of one million pounds in bonds and fleeing to London actually joined the detective force at Scotland Yard and was detailed to find himself which of course he never did nor would he ever have been found had he not crossed my path Hawkshaw gazed mournfully off into space and Le Coq muttered profane words under his breath We re not in the same class with this fellow Hawkshaw said Le Coq You could tap your forehead knowingly eight hours a day through all eternity with a sledge hammer without loosening an idea like that Nevertheless I ll confound him yet growled the jealous detective I shall myself go to London and disguised as Captain Kidd will lead this visionary on until he comes there to arrest me and when these club members discover that it is Hawkshaw and not Kidd he has run to earth we ll have a great laugh on Sherlock Holmes I am anxious to hear how you solved the bond robbery mystery said Socrates wrapping his toga closely about him and settling back against one of the spiles of the wharf So are we all said Sir Walter But meantime the House boat is getting farther away Not unless she s sailing backwards sneered Noah who was still nursing his resentment against Sir Christopher Wren for his reflections upon the speed of the Ark What s the hurry asked Socrates I believe in making haste slowly and on the admission of our two eminent naval architects Sir Christopher and Noah neither of their vessels can travel more than a mile a week and if we charter the Flying Dutchman to go in pursuit of her we can catch her before she gets out of the Styx into the Atlantic Jonah might lend us his whale if the beast is in commission suggested Munchausen dryly I for one would rather take a state room in Jonah s whale than go aboard the Flying Dutchman again I made one trip on the Dutchman and she s worse than a dory for comfort further I don t see what good it would do us to charter a boat that can t land oftener than once in seven years and spends most of her time trying to double the Cape of Good Hope My whale is in commission said Jonah with dignity But Baron Munchausen need not consider the question of taking a state room aboard of her She doesn t carry second class passengers And if I took any stock in the idea of a trip on the Flying Dutchman amounting to a seven years exile I would cheerfully pay the Baron s expenses for a round trip We are losing time gentlemen suggested Sherlock Holmes This is a moment I think when you should lay aside personal differences and personal preferences for immediate action I have examined the wake of the House boat and I judge from the condition of what for want of a better term I may call the suds when she left us the House boat was making ten knots a day Almost any craft we can find suitably manned ought to be able to do better than that and if you could summon Charon and ascertain what boats he has at hand it would be for the good of all concerned That s a good plan said Johnson Boswell see if you can find Charon I am here already sir returned the ferryman rising Most of my boats have gone into winter quarters your Honor The Mayflower went into dry dock last week to be calked up the Pinta and the Santa Maria are slow and cranky the Monitor and the Merrimac I haven t really had time to patch up and the Valkyrie is two months overdue I cannot make up my mind whether she is lost or kept back by excursion steamers Hence I really don t know what I can lend you Any of these boat I have named you could have had for nothing but my others are actively employed and I couldn t let them go without a serious interference with my business The old man blinked sorrowfully across the waters at the opposite shore It was quite evident that he realized what a dreadful expense the club was about to be put to and while of course there would be profit in it for him he was sincerely sorry for them I repeat he added those boats you could have had for nothing but the others I d have to charge you for though of course I ll give you a discount And he blinked again as he meditated upon whether that discount should be an eighth or one quarter of one per cent The Flying Dutchman he pursued ain t no good for your purposes She s too fast She s built to fly by not to stop You d catch up with the House boat in a minute with her but you d go right on and disappear like a visionary and as for the Ark she d never do with all respect to mister Noah She s just about as suitable as any other waterlogged cattle steamer d be and no more first rate for elephants and kangaroos but no good for cruiser work and so slow she wouldn t make a ripple high enough to drown a gnat going at the top of her speed Furthermore she s got a great big hole in her bottom where she was stove in by running afoul of Mount Arrus root I believe it was called when Captain Noah went cruising with that menagerie of his That s an unmitigated falsehood cried Noah angrily This man talks like a professional amateur yachtsman He has no regard for facts but simply goes ahead and makes statements with an utter disregard of the truth The Ark was not stove in We beached her very successfully I say this in defence of my seamanship which was top notch for my day Couldn t sail six weeks without fouling a mountain peak sneered Wren perceiving a chance to get even The hole s there just the same said Charon Maybe she was a centreboard sad that s where you kept the board The hole is there because it was worn there by one of the elephants retorted Noah You get a beast like the elephant shuffling one of his fore feet up and down up and down a plank for twenty four hours a day for forty days in one of your boats and see where your boat would be Thanks said Charon calmly But the elephants don t patronize my line All the elephants I ve ever seen in Hades waded over except Jumbo and he reached his trunk across fastened on to a tree limb with it and swung himself over However the Ark isn t at all what you want unless you are going to man her with a lot of centaurs If that s your intention I d charter her the accommodations are just the thing for a crew of that kind Well what do you suggest asked Raleigh somewhat impatiently You ve told us what we can t do Now tell us what we can do I d stay right here said Charon and let the ladies rescue themselves That s what I d do I ve had the honor of bringing em over here and I think I know em pretty well I ve watched em close and it s my private opinion that before many days you ll see your club house sailing back here with Queen Elizabeth at the hellum and the other ladies on the for ard deck knittin and crochetin and tearin each other to pieces in a conversational way as happy as if there never had been any Captain Kidd and his pirate crew That suggestion is impossible said Blackstone rising Whether the relief expedition amounts to anything or not it s good to be set going The ladies would never forgive us if we sat here inactive even if they were capable of rescuing themselves It is an accepted principle of law that this climate hath no fury like a woman left to herself and we ve got enough professional furies hereabouts without our aiding in augmenting the ranks We must have a boat It ll cost you a thousand dollars a week said Charon I ll subscribe fifty cried Hamlet I ll consult my secretary said Solomon and find out how many of my wives have been abducted and I ll pay ten dollars apiece for their recovery That s liberal said Hawkshaw There are sixty three of em on board together with eighty of his fiancees What s the quotation on fiancees King Solomon Nothing said Solomon They re not mine yet and it s their father s business to get em back Not mine Other subscriptions came pouring in and it was not long before everybody save Shylock had put his name down for something This some one of the more quick witted of the spirits soon observed and with reckless disregard of the feelings of the Merchant of Venice began to call Shylock Shylock How much The Merchant tried to leave the pier but his path was blocked Subscribe subscribe was the cry How much Order gentlemen order said Sir Walter rising and holding a bottle aloft A black person by the name of Friday a valet of our friend mister Crusoe has just handed me this bottle which he picked up ten minutes ago on the bank of the river a few miles distant It contains a bit of paper and may perhaps give us a clew based upon something more substantial than even the wonderful theories of our new brother Holmes A deathly silence followed the chairman s words as Sir Walter drew a corkscrew from his pocket and opened the bottle He extracted the paper and as he had surmised it proved to be a message from the missing vessel His face brightening with a smile of relief Sir Walter read aloud Have just emerged into the Atlantic Club in hands of Kidd and forty ruffians One hundred and eighty three ladies on board Headed for the Azores Send aid at once All well except Xanthippe who is seasick in the billiard room Signed Portia Aha cried Hawkshaw That shows how valuable the Holmes theory is Precisely said Holmes No woman knows anything about seafaring but Portia is right The ship is headed for the Azores which is the first tack needed in a windward sail for London under the present conditions The reply was greeted with cheers and when they subsided the cry for Shylock s subscription began again but he declined I had intended to put up a thousand ducats he said defiantly but with that woman Portia on board I won t give a red obolus and with that he wrapped his cloak about him and stalked off into the gathering shadows of the wood And so the funds were raised without the aid of Shylock and the shapely twin screw steamer the Gehenna was chartered of Charon and put under the command of mister Sherlock Holmes who after he had thanked the company for their confidence walked abstractedly away observing in strictest confidence to himself that he had done well to prepare that bottle beforehand and bribe Crusoe s man to find it For now he said with a chuckle I can get back to earth again free of cost on my own hook whether my eminent inventor wants me there or not I never approved of his killing me off as he did at the very height of my popularity CHAPTER IV ON BOARD THE HOUSE BOAT Meanwhile the ladies were not having such a bad time after all Once having gained possession of the House boat they were loath to think of ever having to give it up again and it is an open question in my mind if they would not have made off with it themselves had Captain Kidd and his men not done it for them I ll never forgive these men for their selfishness in monopolizing all this said Elizabeth with a vicious stroke of a billiard cue which missed the cue ball and tore a right angle in the cloth It is not right No said Portia It is all wrong and when we get back home I m going to give my beloved Bassanio a piece of my mind and if he doesn t give in to me I LL reverse my decision in the famous case of Shylock versus Antonio Then I sincerely hope he doesn t give in retorted Cleopatra for I swear by all my auburn locks that that was the very worst bit of injustice ever perpetrated mister Shakespeare confided to me one night at one of missus Caesar s card parties that he regarded that as the biggest joke he ever wrote and Judge Blackstone observed to Antony that the decision wouldn t have held in any court of equity outside of Venice If you owe a man a thousand ducats and it costs you three thousand to get them that s your affair not his If it cost Antonio every drop of his bluest blood to pay the pound of flesh it was Antonio s affair not Shylock s However the world applauds you as a great jurist when you have nothing more than a woman s keen instinct for sentimental technicalities It would have made a horrid play though if it had gone on shuddered Elizabeth That may be but carried out realistically it would have done away with a raft of bad actors said Cleopatra I m half sorry it didn t go on and I m sure it wouldn t have been any worse than compelling Brutus to fall on his sword until he resembles a chicken liver en brochette as is done in that Julius Caesar play Well I m very glad I did it snapped Portia I should think you would be said Cleopatra If you hadn t done it you d never have been known What was that The boat had given a slight lurch Didn t you hear a shuffling noise up on deck Portia asked the Egyptian Queen I thought I did and it seemed as if the vessel had moved a bit returned Portia nervously for like most women in an advanced state of development she had become a martyr to her nerves It was merely the wash from one of Charon s new ferry boats I fancy said Elizabeth calmly It s disgusting the way that old fellow allows these modern innovations to be brought in here As if the old paddle boats he used to carry shades in weren t good enough for the immigrants of this age Really this Styx River is losing a great deal of its charm Sir Walter and I were upset while out rowing one day last summer by the waves kicked up by one of Charon s excursion steamers going up the river with a party of picnickers from the city the Greater Gehenna Chowder Club I believe it was on board of her One might just as well live in the midst of the turmoil of a great city as try to get uninterrupted quiet here in the suburbs in these days Charon isn t content to get rich slowly he must make money by the barrelful if he has to sacrifice all the comfort of everybody living on this river Anybody d think he was an American the way he goes on and everybody else here is the same way The Erebeans are getting to be a race of shopkeepers I think myself sighed Cleopatra that Hades is being spoiled by the introduction of American ideas it is getting by far too democratic for my tastes and if it isn t stopped it s my belief that the best people will stop coming here Take Madame Recamier s salon as it is now and compare it with what it used to be In the early days after her arrival here everybody went because it was the swell thing and you d be sure of meeting the intellectually elect On the one hand you d find Sophocles on the other Cicero across the room would be Horace chatting gayly with some such person as myself Great warriors from Alexander to Bonaparte were there and glad of the opportunity to be there too statesmen like Macchiavelli artists like Cellini or Tintoretto You couldn t move without stepping on the toes of genius But now all is different The money getting instinct has been aroused within them all with the result that when I invited Mozart to meet a few friends at dinner at my place last autumn he sent me a card stating his terms for dinners Let me see I think I have it with me I ve kept it by me for fear of losing it it is such a complete revelation of the actual condition of affairs in this locality Ah this is it she added taking a small bit of pasteboard from her card case Read that The card was passed about and all the ladies were much astonished and naturally so for it ran this wise NOTICE TO HOSTESSES Owing to the very great constantly growing and at times vexatious demands upon his time socially HERR WOLFGANG AMADEUS MOZART takes this method of announcing to his friends that on and after January one eighteen ninety seven his terms for functions will be as follows Dinners with conversation on the Marks Theory of Music five hundred Dinners with conversation on the Theory of Music illustrated seven hundred fifty Dinners without any conversation three hundred Receptions public with music one thousand private seven hundred fifty Encores single one hundred Three encores for one hundred fifty Autographs ten Positively no Invitations for Five o Clock Teas or Morning Musicales considered Well I declare tittered Elizabeth as she read Isn t that extraordinary He s got the three name craze too It s perfectly ridiculous said Cleopatra But it s fairer than Artemus Ward s plan Mozart gives notice of his intentions to charge you but with Ward it s different He comes and afterwards sends a bill for his fun Why only last week I got a quarterly statement from him showing a charge against me of thirty eight dollars for humorous remarks made to my guests at a little chafing dish party I gave in honor of Balzac and worst of all he had marked it Please remit Even Antony when he wrote a sonnet to my eyebrow wouldn t let me have it until he had heard whether or not Boswell wanted it for publication in the Gossip With Rubens giving chalk talks for pay Phidias doing Five minute Masterpieces in Putty for suburban lyceums and all the illustrious in other lines turning their genius to account through the entertainment bureaus it s impossible to have a salon now You are indeed right said Madame Recamier sadly Those were palmy days when genius was satisfied with chicken salad and lemonade I shall never forget those nights when the wit and wisdom of all time were ah were on tap at my house if I may so speak at a cost to me of lights and supper Now the only people who will come for nothing are those we used to think of paying to stay away Boswell is always ready but you can t run a salon on Boswell Well said Portia I sincerely hope that you won t give up the functions altogether because I have always found them most delightful It is still possible to have lights and supper I have a plan for next winter said Madame Recamier but I suppose I shall be accused of going into the commercial side of it if I adopt it The plan is briefly to incorporate my salon That s an idea worthy of an American I admit but if I don t do it I ll have to give it up entirely which as you intimate would be too bad An incorporated salon however would be a grand thing if only because it would perpetuate the salon The Recamier Salon Limited would be a most excellent title and suitably capitalized would enable us to pay our lions sufficiently Private enterprise is powerless under modern conditions It s as much as I can afford to pay for a dinner without running up an expensive account for guests and unless we get up a salon trust as it were the whole affair must go to the wall How would you make it pay asked Portia I can t see where your dividends would come from That is simple enough said Madame Recamier We could put up a large reception hall with a portion of our capital and advertise a series of nights say one a week throughout the season These would be Warriors Night Story tellers Night Poets Night Chafing dish Night under the charge of Brillat Savarin and so on It would be understood that on these particular evenings the most interesting people in certain lines would be present and would mix with outsiders who should be admitted only on payment of a certain sum of money The commonplace inhabitants of this country could thus meet the truly great and if I know them well as I think I do they ll pay readily for the privilege The obscure love to rub up against the famous here as well as they do on earth You d run a sort of Social Zoo suggested Elizabeth Precisely and provide entertainment for private residences too An advertisement in Boswell s paper which everybody buys And which nobody reads said Portia They read the advertisements retorted Madame Recamier As I was saying an advertisement could be placed in Boswell s paper as follows Are you giving a Function Do you want Talent Get your Genius at the Recamier Salon Limited It would be simply magnificent as a business enterprise The common herd would be tickled to death if they could get great people at their homes even if they had to pay roundly for them It would look well in the society notes wouldn t it if mister John Boggs gave a reception and at the close of the account it said The supper was furnished by Calizetti and the genius by the Recamier Salon Limited suggested Elizabeth scornfully I must admit replied the French lady that you call up an unpleasant possibility but I don t really see what else we can do if we want to preserve the salon idea Somebody has told these talented people that they have a commercial value and they are availing themselves of the demand It is a sad age sighed Elizabeth Well all I ve got to say is just this put in Xanthippe You people who get up functions have brought this condition of affairs on yourselves You were not satisfied to go ahead and indulge your passion for lions in a moderate fashion Take the case of Demosthenes last winter for instance His wife told me that he dined at home three times during the winter The rest of the time he was out here there and everywhere making after dinner speeches The saving on his dinner bills didn t pay his pebble account much less remunerate him for his time and the fearful expense of nervous energy to which he was subjected It was as much as she could do she said to keep him from shaving one side of his head so that he couldn t go out the way he used to do in Athens when he was afraid he would be invited out and couldn t scare up a decent excuse for refusing Did he do that cried Elizabeth with a roar of laughter So the cyclopaedias say It s a good plan too said Xanthippe Though Socrates never had to do it When I got the notion Socrates was going out too much I used to hide his dress clothes Then there was the case of Rubens He gave a Carbon Talk at the Sforza s Thursday Night Club merely to oblige Madame Sforza and three weeks later discovered that she had sold his pictures to pay for her gown You people simply run it into the ground You kill the goose that when taken at the flood leads on to fortune It advertises you does the lion no good and he is expected to be satisfied with confectionery material and theoretical If they are getting tired of candy and compliments it s because you have forced too much of it upon them They like it just the same retorted Recamier A genius likes nothing better than the sound of his own voice when he feels that it is falling on aristocratic ears The social laurel rests pleasantly on many a noble brow True said Xanthippe But when a man gets a pile of Christmas wreaths a mile high on his head he begins to wonder what they will bring on the market An occasional wreath is very nice but by the ton they are apt to weigh on his mind Up to a certain point notoriety is like a woman and a man is apt to love it but when it becomes exacting demanding instead of permitting itself to be courted it loses its charm That is Socratic in its wisdom smiled Portia But Xanthippic in its origin returned Xanthippe No man ever gave me my ideas As Xanthippe spoke Lucretia Borgia burst into the room Hurry and save yourselves she cried The boat has broken loose from her moorings and is floating down the stream If we don t hurry up and do something we ll drift out to sea What cried Cleopatra dropping her cue in terror and rushing for the stairs I was certain I felt a slight motion You said it was the wash from one of Charon s barges Elizabeth I thought it was said Elizabeth following closely after Well it wasn t moaned Lucretia Borgia Calpurnia just looked out of the window and discovered that we were in mid stream The ladies crowded anxiously about the stair and attempted to ascend Cleopatra in the van but as the Egyptian Queen reached the doorway to the upper deck the door opened and the hard features of Captain Kidd were thrust roughly through and his strident voice rang out through the gathering gloom Pipe my eye for a sardine if we haven t captured a female seminary he cried And one by one the ladies in terror shrank back into the billiard room while Kidd overcome by surprise slammed the door to and retreated into the darkness of the forward deck to consult with his followers as to what next CHAPTER V A CONFERENCE ON DECK Here s a kettle of fish said Kidd pulling his chin whisker in perplexity as he and his fellow pirates gathered about the captain to discuss the situation I m blessed if in all my experience I ever sailed athwart anything like it afore Pirating with a lot of low down ruffians like you gentlemen is bad enough but on a craft loaded to the water s edge with advanced women I ve half a mind to turn back If you do you swim we ll not turn back with you retorted Abeuchapeta whom in honor of his prowess Kidd had appointed executive officer of the House boat I have no desire to be mutinous Captain Kidd but I have not embarked upon this enterprise for a pleasure sail down the Styx I am out for business If you had thirty thousand women on board still should I not turn back But what shall we do with em pleaded Kidd Where can we go without attracting attention Who s going to feed em Who s going to dress em Who s going to keep em in bonnets You don t know anything about these creatures my dear Abeuchapeta and by the way can t we arbitrate that name of yours It would be fearful to remember in the excitement of a fight Call him Ab suggested Sir Henry Morgan with an ill concealed sneer for he was deeply jealous of Abeuchapeta s preferral If you do I ll call you Morgue and change your appearance to fit retorted Abeuchapeta angrily 
8432-54083-0000	train-other-500	By the beards of all my sainted Buccaneers began Morgan springing angrily to his feet I ll have your life Gentlemen Gentlemen my noble ruffians expostulated Kidd Come come this will never do
8432-54083-0001	train-other-500	I must have no quarrelling among my aides This is no time for divisions in our councils An entirely unexpected element has entered into our affairs
none	none	 and it behooveth us to act in concert It is no light matter Excuse me captain said Abeuchapeta but that is where you and I do not agree We ve got our ship and we ve got our crew and in addition we find that the Fates have thrown in a hundred or more women to act as ballast Now I for one do not fear a woman 
8432-54083-0002	train-other-500	We can set them to work There is plenty for them to do keeping things tidy and if we get into a very hard fight
none	none	 and come out of the melee somewhat the worse for wear it will be a blessing to have em along to mend our togas sew buttons on our uniforms and darn our hosiery 
8432-54083-0003	train-other-500	Morgan laughed sarcastically
none	none	 When did you flourish if ever colonel he asked Do you refer to me queried Abeuchapeta with a frown 
8432-54083-0004	train-other-500	You have guessed correctly replied Morgan icily I have quite forgotten your date were you a success in the year one or when Admiral Abeuchapeta Sir Henry interposed Kidd fearing a further outbreak of hostilities
none	none	 Admiral Abeuchapeta was the terror of the seas in the seventh century and what he undertook to do he did and his piratical enterprises were carried on on a scale of magnificence which is without parallel off the comic opera stage 
8432-54083-0005	train-other-500	He never went forth without at least seventy galleys and a hundred other vessels
none	none	 Abeuchapeta drew himself up proudly 
8432-54083-0006	train-other-500	Six ninety eight was my great year he said That s what I thought said Morgan That is to say you got your ideas of women twelve hundred years ago and the ladies have changed somewhat since that time I have great respect for you sir as a ruffian
8432-54083-0007	train-other-500	I have no doubt that as a ruffian you are a complete success
none	none	 but when it comes to feminology you are sailing in unknown waters The study of women my dear Abeuchadnezzar Peta retorted Abeuchapeta irritably 
8432-54083-0008	train-other-500	I stand corrected The study of women my dear Peter
none	none	 said Morgan with a wink at Conrad which fortunately the seventh century pirate did not see else there would have been an open break the study of women is more difficult than that of astronomy there may be two stars alike but all women are unique Because she was this that or the other thing in your day does not prove that she is any one of those things in our day in fact it proves the contrary 
8432-54083-0009	train-other-500	Why I venture even to say that no individual woman is alike That s rather a hazy thought said Kidd scratching his head in a puzzled sort of way I mean that she s different from herself at different times said Morgan
none	none	 What is it the poet called her an infinite variety show or something of that sort a perpetual vaudeville a continuous performance as it were from twelve to twelve 
8432-54083-0011	train-other-500	Morgan is right admiral put in Conrad the corsair acting temporarily as bo sun The times are sadly changed and woman is no longer what she was She is hardly what she is much less what she was
none	none	 The Roman Gynaeceum would be an impossibility to day You might as well expect Delilah to open a barber shop on board this boat as ask any of these advanced females below stairs to sew buttons on a pirate s uniform after a fray 
8432-54083-0012	train-other-500	or to keep the fringe on his epaulets curled They re no longer sewing machines they are Keeley motors for mystery and perpetual motion Women have views now they are no longer content to be looked at merely they must see for themselves
none	none	 and the more they see the more they wish to domesticate man and emancipate woman 
8432-54083-0013	train-other-500	It s my private opinion that if we are to get along with them at all the best thing to do is to let em alone I have always found I was better off in the abstract and if this question is going to be settled in a purely democratic fashion by submitting it to a vote I ll vote for any measure which involves leaving them strictly to themselves
8432-54083-0014	train-other-500	They re nothing but a lot of ghosts anyhow like ourselves and we can pretend we don t see them If that could be it would be excellent said Morgan but it is impossible
8432-54083-0015	train-other-500	For a pirate of the Byronic order my dear Conrad you are strangely unversed in the ways of the sex which cheers but not inebriates We can no more ignore their presence upon this boat than we can expect whales to spout kerosene
none	none	 In the first place it would be excessively impolite of us to cut them 
8432-54083-0016	train-other-500	to decline to speak to them if they should address us We may be pirates ruffians cutthroats but I hope we shall never forget that we are gentlemen The whole situation is rather contrary to etiquette don t you think suggested Conrad
none	none	 There s nobody to introduce us and I can t really see how we can do otherwise than ignore them I certainly am not going to stand on deck and make eyes at them to try and pick up an acquaintance with them even if I am of a Byronic strain 
8432-54083-0017	train-other-500	You forget said Kidd two essential features of the situation These women are at present or shortly will be when they realize their situation in distress and a true gentleman may always fly to the rescue of a distressed female
none	none	 and the second point we shall soon be on the seas and I understand that on the fashionable transatlantic lines it is now considered de rigueur to speak to anybody you choose to 
8432-54083-0018	train-other-500	The introduction business isn t going to stand in my way
none	none	 Well may I ask put in Abeuchapeta just what it is that is worrying you 
8432-54083-0019	train-other-500	You said something about feeding them and dressing them and keeping them in bonnets
none	none	 I fancy there s fish enough in the sea to feed em 
8432-54083-0020	train-other-500	and as for their gowns and hats they can make em themselves Every woman is a milliner at heart
none	none	 Exactly and we ll have to pay the milliners That is what bothers me I was going to lead this expedition to London Paris and New York admiral That is where the money is and to get it you ve got to go ashore to headquarters 
8432-54083-0021	train-other-500	You cannot nowadays find it on the high seas Modern civilization said Kidd has ruined the pirate s business
none	none	 The latest news from the other world has really opened my eyes to certain facts that I never dreamed of The conditions of the day of which I speak are interestingly shown in the experience of our friend Hawkins here Captain Hawkins would you have any objection to stating to these gentlemen the condition of affairs which led you to give up piracy on the high seas Not the slightest Captain Kidd returned Captain Hawkins who was a recent arrival in Hades It is a sad little story and it gives me a pain for to think on it but none the less I ll tell it since you ask me When I were a mere boy fellow pirates I had but one ambition due to my readin which was confined to stories of a Sunday school nater 
8432-54083-0022	train-other-500	to become somethin different from the little Willies an the clever Tommies what I read about therein
none	none	 They was all good an they went to their reward 
8432-54083-0023	train-other-500	too soon in life for me who even in them days regarded death as a stuffy an unpleasant diversion Learnin at an early period that virtue was its only reward an a wish in others
none	none	 I says to myself Jim says I if you wishes to become a magnet in this village be sinful If so be as you are a good boy an kind to your sister an all other animals you ll end up as a prosperous father with fifteen hundred a year sure with never no hope for no public preferment beyond bein made the super intendent of the Sunday school 
8432-54083-0024	train-other-500	but if so be as how you re bad you may become famous an go to Congress an have your picture in the Sunday noospapers So I looks around for books tellin how to get Famous in Fifty Ways an after due reflection I settles in my mind that to be a pirate s just the thing for me
none	none	 seein as how it s both profitable an healthy Pass in over details let me tell you that I became a pirate 
8432-54083-0025	train-other-500	I ran away to sea an by dint of perseverance as the Sunday school book useter say in my badness I soon became the centre of a evil lot an when I says to em Boys I wants to be a pirate chief they hollers back loud like Jim we re with you an they was
none	none	 For years I was the terror of the Venezuelan Gulf the Spanish Main an the Pacific seas but there was precious little money into it The best pay I got was from a Sunday noospaper which paid me well to sign an article on Modern Piracy which I didn t write Finally business got so bad the crew began to murmur an I was at my wits ends to please em when one mornin havin passed a restless night I picks up a noospaper and sees in it that Next Saturday s steamer is a weritable treasure ship 
8432-54083-0026	train-other-500	takin out twelve million dollars and the jewels of a certain prima donna valued at five hundred thousand Here s my chance says I an I goes to sea and lies in wait for the steamer I captures her easy my crew bein hungry an fightin according like
8432-54083-0027	train-other-500	We steals the box a hold in the jewels an the bag containin the millions
none	none	 hustles back to our own ship an makes for our rondyvoo me with two bullets in my leg four o my crew killed and one engin of my ship disabled by a shot 
8432-54083-0028	train-other-500	but happy Twelve an a half millions at one break is enough to make anybody happy I should say so said Abeuchapeta with an ecstatic shake of his head I didn t get that in all my career Nor I sighed Kidd But go on Hawkins
none	none	 Well as I says continued Captain Hawkins we goes to the rondyvoo to look over our booty Captain Awkins says my valet for I was a swell pirate gents an never travelled nowhere without a man to keep my clothes brushed and the proper wrinkles in my trousers this ere twelve millions says he is werry light 
8432-54083-0029	train-other-500	says he carryin the bag ashore I don t care how light it is so long as it s twelve millions Henderson says I but my heart sinks inside o me at his words an the minute we lands I sits down to investigate right there on the beach
8432-54083-0030	train-other-500	I opens the bag an it s the one I was after but the twelve millions Weren t there cried Conrad Yes they was there sighed Hawkins but every bloomin million was represented by a certified check an payable in London By Jingo cried Morgan What
8432-54083-0031	train-other-500	fearful luck But you had the prima donna s jewels
none	none	 Yes said Hawkins with a moan But they was like all other prima donna s jewels for advertisin purposes only an made o gum arabic Horrible said Abeuchapeta And the crew what did they say They was a crew of a few words sighed Hawkins Werry few words an not a civil word in the lot mostly adjectives of a profane kind When I told em what had happened they got mad at Fortune for a jiltin of em an well I came here I was sas inated that werry night They killed you cried Morgan A dozen times nodded Hawkins They always was a lavish lot I met death in all its most horrid forms First they stabbed me then they shot me then they clubbed me and so on endin up with a lynchin but I didn t mind much after the first which hurt a bit But now that I m here I m glad it happened This life is sort of less responsible than that other You can t hurt a ghost by shooting him because there ain t nothing to hurt an I must say I like bein a mere vision what everybody can see through All of which interesting tale proves what queried Abeuchapeta That piracy on the sea is not profitable in these days of the check banking system said Kidd If you can get a chance at real gold it s all right but it s of no earthly use to steal checks that people can stop payment on Therefore it was my plan to visit the cities and do a little freebooting there where solid material wealth is to be found Well Can t we do it now asked Abeuchapeta Not with these women tagging after us returned Kidd If we went to London and lifted the whole Bank of England these women would have it spent on Regent Street inside of twenty four hours Then leave them on board said Abeuchapeta And have them steal the ship retorted Kidd No There are but two things to do Take em back or land them in Paris Tell them to spend a week on shore while we are provisioning Tell em to shop to their hearts content and while they are doing it we can sneak off and leave them stranded Splendid cried Morgan But will they consent asked Abeuchapeta Consent To shop In Paris For a week cried Morgan Ha ha laughed Hawkins Will they consent Will a duck swim And so it was decided which was the first incident in the career of the House boat upon which the astute mister Sherlock Holmes had failed to count CHAPTER VI A CONFERENCE BELOW STAIRS When with a resounding slam the door to the upper deck of the House boat was shut in the faces of queens Elizabeth and Cleopatra by the unmannerly Kidd these ladies turned and gazed at those who thronged the stairs behind them in blank amazement and the heart of Xanthippe had one chosen to gaze through that diaphanous person s ribs could have been seen to beat angrily Queen Elizabeth was so excited at this wholly novel attitude towards her regal self that having turned she sat down plump upon the floor in the most unroyal fashion Well she ejaculated If this does not surpass everything The idea of it Oh for one hour of my olden power one hour of the axe one hour of the block Get up retorted Cleopatra and let us all return to the billiard room and discuss this matter calmly It is quite evident that something has happened of which we wotted little when we came aboard this craft That is a good idea said Calpurnia retreating below I can see through the window that we are in motion The vessel has left her moorings and is making considerable headway down the stream and the distinctly masculine voices we have heard are indications to my mind that the ship is manned and that this is the result of design rather than of accident Let us below Elizabeth rose up and readjusted her ruff which in the excitement of the moment had been forced to assume a position about her forehead which gave one the impression that its royal wearer had suddenly donned a sombrero Very well she said Let us below but oh for the axe Bring the lady an axe cried Xanthippe sarcastically She wants to cut somebody The sally was not greeted with applause The situation was regarded as being too serious to admit of humor and in silence they filed back into the billiard room and arranging themselves in groups stood about anxiously discussing the situation It s getting rougher every minute sobbed Ophelia Look at those pool balls These were in very truth chasing each other about the table in an extraordinary fashion And I wish I d never followed you horrid new creatures on board the poor girl added in an agony of despair I believe we ve crossed the bar already said Cleopatra gazing out of the window at a nasty choppy sea that was adding somewhat to the disquietude of the fair gathering If this is merely a joke on the part of the Associated Shades it is a mighty poor one and I think it is time it should cease Oh for an axe moaned Elizabeth again Excuse me your Majesty put in Xanthippe You said that before and I must say it is getting tiresome You couldn t do anything with an axe Suppose you had one What earthly good would it do you who were accustomed to doing all your killing by proxy I don t believe if you had the unmannerly person who slammed the door in your face lying prostrate upon the billiard table here you could hit him a square blow in the neck if you had a hundred axes Delilah might as well cry for her scissors for all the good it would do us in our predicament If Cleopatra had her asp with her it might be more to the purpose One deadly little snake like that let loose on the upper deck would doubtless drive these boors into the sea and even then our condition would not be bettered for there isn t any of us that can sail a boat There isn t an old salt among us Too bad missus Lot isn t along giggled Marguerite de Valois whose Gallic spirits were by no means overshadowed by the unhappy predicament in which she found herself I m here piped up missus Lot But I m not that kind of a salt I am present said missus Noah Though why I ever came I don t know for I vowed the minute I set my foot on Ararat that dry land was good enough for me and that I d never step aboard another boat as long as I lived If however now that I am here I can give you the benefit of my nautical experience you are all perfectly welcome to it I m sure we re very much obliged for the offer said Portia but in the emergency which has arisen we cannot say how much obliged we are until we know what your experience amounted to Before relying upon you we ought to know how far that reliance can go not that I lack confidence in you my dear madam but that in an hour of peril one must take care to rely upon the oak not upon the reed The point is properly taken said Elizabeth and I wish to say here that I am easier in my mind when I realize that we have with us so level headed a person as the lady who has just spoken She has spoken truly and to the point If I were to become queen again I should make her my attorney general We must not go ahead impulsively but look at all things in a calm judicial manner Which is pretty hard work with a sea like this on remarked Ophelia faintly for she was getting a trifle sallow as indeed she might for the House boat was beginning to roll tremendously with no alleviation save an occasional pitch which was an alleviation only in the sense that it gave variety to their discomfort I don t believe a chief justice could look at things calmly and in a judicial manner if he felt as I do Poor dear said the matronly missus Noah sympathetically I know exactly how you feel I have been there myself The fourth day out I and my whole family were in the same condition except that Noah my husband was so very far gone that I could not afford to yield I nursed him for six days before he got his sea legs on and then succumbed myself But gasped Ophelia that doesn t help me It did my husband said missus Noah When he heard that the boys were seasick too he actually laughed and began to get better right away There is really only one cure for the mal de mer and that is the fun of knowing that somebody else is suffering too If some of you ladies would kindly yield to the seductions of the sea I think we could get this poor girl on her feet in an instant Unfortunately for poor Ophelia there was no immediate response to this appeal and the unhappy young woman was forced to suffer in solitude We have no time for untimely diversions of this sort snapped Xanthippe with a scornful glance at the suffering Ophelia who having retired to a comfortable lounge at an end of the room was evidently improving I have no sympathy with this habit some of my sex seem to have acquired of succumbing to an immediate sensation of this nature I hope to be pardoned for interrupting said missus Noah with a great deal of firmness but I wish missus Socrates to understand that it is rather early in the voyage for her to lay down any such broad principle as that and for her own sake to morrow I think it would be well if she withdrew the sentiment There are certain things about a sea voyage that are more or less beyond the control of man or woman and any one who chides that poor suffering child on yonder sofa ought to be more confident than missus Socrates can possibly be that within an hour she will not be as badly off People who live in glass houses should not throw dice I shall never yield to anything so undignified as seasickness let me tell you that retorted Xanthippe Furthermore the proverb is not as the lady has quoted it People who live in glass houses should not throw stones is the proper version I was not quoting returned missus Noah calmly When I said that people who live in glass houses should not throw dice I meant precisely what I said People who live in glass houses should not take chances In assuming with such vainglorious positiveness that she will not be seasick the lady who has just spoken is giving tremendous odds as the boys used to say on the Ark when we gathered about the table at night and began to make small wagers on the day s run I think we had better suspend this discussion suggested Cleopatra It is of no immediate interest to any one but Ophelia and I fancy she does not care to dwell upon it at any great length It is more important that we should decide upon our future course of action In the first place the question is who these people up on deck are If they are the members of the club we are all right They will give us our scare and land us safely again at the pier In that event it is our womanly duty to manifest no concern and to seem to be aware of nothing unusual in the proceeding It would never do to let them think that their joke has been a good one If on the other hand as I fear we are the victims of some horde of ruffians who have pounced upon us unawares and are going into the business of abduction on a wholesale basis we must meet treachery with treachery strategy with strategy I for one am perfectly willing to make every man on board walk the plank having confidence in the seawomanship of missus Noah and her ability to steer us into port I am quite in accord with these views put in Madame Recamier and I move you missus President that we organize a series of sub committees one on treachery with Lucretia Borgia and Delilah as members one on strategy consisting of Portia and Queen Elizabeth one on navigation headed by missus Noah with a final sub committee on reconnoitre with Cassandra to look forward and missus Lot to look aft all of these subordinated to a central committee of safety headed by Cleopatra and Calpurnia The rest of us can then commit ourselves and our interests unreservedly to these ladies and proceed to enjoy ourselves without thought of the morrow I second the motion said Ophelia with the amendment that Madame Recamier be appointed chair lady of another sub committee on entertainment The amendment was accepted and the motion put It was carried with an enthusiastic aye and the organization was complete The various committees retired to the several corners of the room to discuss their individual lines of action when a shadow was observed to obscure the moonlight which had been streaming in through the window The faces of Calpurnia and Cleopatra blanched for an instant as immediately following upon this apparition a large bundle was hurled through the open port into the middle of the room and the shadow vanished Is it a bomb cried several of the ladies at once Nonsense said Madame Recamier jumping lightly forward A man doesn t mind blowing a woman up but he ll never blow himself up We re safe enough in that respect The thing looks to me like a bundle of illustrated papers That s what it is said Cleopatra who had been investigating It s rather a discourteous bit of courtesy tossing them in through the window that way I think but I presume they mean well Dear me she added as having untied the bundle she held one of the open papers up before her how interesting All the latest Paris fashions Humph Look at those sleeves Elizabeth What an impregnable fortress you would have been with those sleeves added to your ruffs I should think they d be very becoming put in Cassandra standing on her tip toes and looking over Cleopatra s shoulder That Watteau isn t bad either is it now No remarked Calpurnia I wonder how a Watteau back like that would go on my blue alpaca Very nicely said Elizabeth How many gores has it Five observed Calpurnia One more than Caesar s toga We had to have our costumes distinct in some way A remarkable hat that nodded missus Lot her eye catching sight of a Virot creation at the top of the page Reminds me of Eve s description of an autumn scene in the garden smiled missus Noah Gorgeous in its foliage beautiful thing though I shouldn t have dared wear one in the Ark with all those hungry animals browsing about the upper and lower decks I wonder remarked Cleopatra as she cocked her head to one side to take in the full effect of an attractive summer gown I wonder how that waist would make up in blue crepon with a yoke of lace and a stylishly contrasting stock of satin ribbon It would depend upon how you finished the sleeves remarked Madame Recamier If you had a few puffs of rich brocaded satin set in with deeply folded pleats it wouldn t be bad I think it would be very effective observed missus Noah but a trifle too light for general wear I should want some kind of a wrap with it It does need that assented Elizabeth A wrap made of passementerie and jet with a mousseline de soie ruche about the neck held by a chou would make it fascinating The committee on treachery is ready to report said Delilah rising from her corner where she and Lucretia Borgia had been having so animated a discussion that they had failed to observe the others crowding about Cleopatra and the papers A little sombre said Cleopatra The corsage is effective but I don t like those basque terminations I ve never approved of those full godets The committee on treachery remarked Delilah again raising her voice has a suggestion to make I can t get over those sleeves though laughed Helen of Troy What is the use of them They might be used to get Greeks into Troy suggested Madame Recamier The committee on treachery roared Delilah thoroughly angered by the absorption of the chairman and others has a suggestion to make This is the third and last call Oh I beg pardon cried Cleopatra rapping for order I had forgotten all about our committees Excuse me Delilah I ah was absorbed in other matters Will you kindly lay your pattern I should say your plan before us It is briefly this said Delilah It has been suggested that we invite the crew of this vessel to a chafing dish party under the supervision of Lucretia Borgia and that she The balance of the plan was not outlined for at this point the speaker was interrupted by a loud knocking at the door its instant opening and the appearance in the doorway of that ill visaged ruffian Captain Kidd Ladies he began I have come here to explain to you the situation in which you find yourselves Have I your permission to speak The ladies started back but the chairman was equal to the occasion Go on said Cleopatra with queenly dignity turning to the interloper and the pirate proceeded to take the second step in the nefarious plan upon which he and his brother ruffians had agreed of which the tossing in through the window of the bundle of fashion papers was the first CHAPTER VII THE GEHENNA IS CHARTERED It was about twenty four hours after the events narrated in the preceding chapters that mister Sherlock Holmes assumed command of the Gehenna which was nothing more nor less than the shadow of the ill starred ocean steamship City of Chicago which tried some years ago to reach Liverpool by taking the overland route through Ireland fortunately without detriment to her passengers and crew who had the pleasure of the experience of shipwreck without any of the discomforts of drowning As will be remembered the obstructionist nature of the Irish soil prevented the City of Chicago from proceeding farther inland than was necessary to keep her well balanced amidships upon a convenient and not too stony bed and that after a brief sojourn on the rocks she was finally disposed of to the Styx Navigation Company under which title Charon had had himself incorporated is a matter of nautical history The change of name to the Gehenna was the act of Charon himself and was prompted no doubt by a desire to soften the jealous prejudices of the residents of the Stygian capital against the flourishing and ever growing metropolis of Illinois The Associated Shades had had some trouble in getting this craft Charon through his constant association with life on both sides of the dark river had gained a knowledge more or less intimate of modern business methods and while as janitor of the club he was subject to the will of the House boat Committee and sympathized deeply with the members of the association in their trouble as president of the Styx Navigation Company he was bound up in certain newly attained commercial ideas which were embarrassing to those members of the association to whose hands the chartering of a vessel had been committed See here Charon Sir Walter Raleigh had said after Charon had expressed himself as deeply sympathetic but unable to shave the terms upon which the vessel could be had you are an infernal old hypocrite You go about wringing your hands over our misfortunes until they ve got as dry and flabby as a pair of kid gloves and yet when we ask you for a ship of suitable size and speed to go out after those pirates you become a sort of twin brother to Shylock without his excuse His instincts are accidents of birth Yours are cultivated and you know it You are very much mistaken Sir Walter Charon had answered to this You don t understand my position It is a very hard one As janitor of your club I am really prostrated over the events of the past twenty four hours My occupation is gone and my despair over your loss is correspondingly greater for I have time on my hands to brood over it I was hysterical as a woman yesterday afternoon so hysterical that I came near upsetting one of the Furies who engaged me to row her down to Madame Medusa s villa last evening and right at the sluice of the vitriol reservoir at that Then why the deuce don t you do something to help us pleaded Hamlet How can I do any more than I have done I ve offered you the Gehenna retorted Charon But on what terms expostulated Raleigh If we had all the wealth of the Indies we d have difficulty in paying you the sums you demand But I am only president of the company explained Charon I d like as president to show you some courtesy and I m perfectly willing to do so but when it comes down to giving you a vessel like that I m bound by my official oath to consider the interest of the stockholders It isn t as it used to be when I had boats to hire in my own behalf alone In those days I had nobody s interest but my own to look after Now the ships all belong to the Styx Navigation Company Can t you see the difference You own all the stock don t you insisted Raleigh I don t know Charon answered blandly I haven t seen the transfer books lately But you know that you did own every share of it and that you haven t sold any don t you put in Hamlet Charon was puzzled for a moment but shortly his face cleared and Sir Walter s heart sank for it was evident that the old fellow could not be cornered Well it s this way Sir Walter and your Highness he said I I can t say whether any of that stock has been transferred or not The fact is I ve been speculating a little on margin and I ve put up that stock as security and for all I know I may have been sold out by my brokers I ve been so upset by this unfortunate occurrence that I haven t seen the market reports for two days Really you ll have to be content with my offer or go without the Gehenna There s too much suspicion attached to high corporate officials lately for me to yield a jot in the position I have taken It would never do to get you all ready to start and then have an injunction clapped on you by some unforeseen stockholder who was not satisfied with the terms offered you nor can I ever let it be said of me that to retain my position as janitor of your organization I sacrificed a trust committed to my charge I ll gladly lend you my private launch though I don t think it will aid you much because the naphtha tank has exploded and the screw slipped off and went to the bottom two weeks ago Still it is at your service and I ve no doubt that either Phidias or Benvenuto Cellini will carve out a paddle for you if you ask him to Bah retorted Raleigh You might as well offer us a pair of skates I would if I thought the river d freeze retorted Charon blandly Raleigh and Hamlet turned away impatiently and left Charon to his own devices which for the time being consisted largely of winking his other eye quietly and outwardly making a great show of grief He s too canny for us I am afraid said Sir Walter We ll have to pay him his money Let us first consult Sherlock Holmes suggested Hamlet and this they proceeded at once to do There is but one thing to be done observed the astute detective after he had heard Sir Walter s statement of the case It is an old saying that one should fight fire with fire We must meet modern business methods with modern commercial ideas Charter his vessel at his own price But we d never be able to pay said Hamlet Ha ha laughed Holmes It is evident that you know nothing of the laws of trade nowadays Don t pay But how can we asked Raleigh The method is simple You haven t anything to pay with returned Holmes Let him sue Suppose he gets a verdict You haven t anything he can attach if you have make it over to your wives or your fiancees Is that honest asked Hamlet shaking his head doubtfully It s business said Holmes But suppose he wants an advance payment queried Hamlet Give him a check drawn to his own order He ll have to endorse it when he deposits it and that will make him responsible laughed Holmes What a simple thing when you understand it commented Raleigh Very said Holmes Business is getting by slow degrees to be an exact science It reminds me of the Brighton mystery in which I played a modest part some ten years ago when I first took up ferreting as a profession I was sitting one night in my room at one of the Brighton hotels which shall be nameless I never give the name of any of the hotels at which I stop because it might give offence to the proprietors of other hotels with the result that my books would be excluded from sale therein Suffice it to say that I was spending an early summer Sunday at Brighton with my friend Watson We had dined well and were enjoying our evening smoke together upon a small balcony overlooking the water when there came a timid knock on the door of my room Watson said I here comes some one for advice Do you wish to wager a small bottle upon it Yes he answered with a smile I am thirsty and I d like a small bottle and while I do not expect to win I ll take the bet I should like to know though how you know It is quite simple said I The timidity of the knock shows that my visitor is one of two classes of persons an autograph hunter or a client one of the two You see I give you a chance to win It may be an autograph hunter but I think it is a client If it were a creditor he would knock boldly even ostentatiously if it were the maid she would not knock at all if it were the hall boy he would not come until I had rung five times for him None of these things has occurred the knock is the half hearted knock which betokens either that the person who knocked is in trouble or is uncertain as to his reception I am willing however considering the heat and my desire to quench my thirst to wager that it is a client Done said Watson and I immediately remarked Come in The door opened and a man of about thirty five years of age in a bathing suit entered the room and I saw at a glance what had happened Your name is Burgess I said You came here from London this morning expecting to return to night You brought no luggage with you After luncheon you went bathing You had machine No thirty five and when you came out of the water you found that No thirty five had disappeared with your clothes and the silver watch your uncle gave you on the day you succeeded to his business Of course gentlemen observed the detective with a smile at Sir Walter and Hamlet of course the man fairly gasped and I continued You have been lying face downward in the sand ever since waiting for nightfall so that you could come to me for assistance not considering it good form to make an afternoon call upon a stranger at his hotel clad in a bathing suit Am I correct Sir he replied with a look of wonder you have narrated my story exactly as it happened and I find I have made no mistake in coming to you Would you mind telling me what is your course of reasoning It is plain as day said I I am the person with the red beard with whom you came down third class from London this morning and you told me your name was Burgess and that you were a butcher When you looked to see the time I remarked upon the oddness of your watch which led to your telling me that it was the gift of your uncle True said Burgess but I did not tell you I had no luggage No said I but that you hadn t is plain for if you had brought any other clothing besides that you had on with you you would have put it on to come here That you have been robbed I deduce also from your costume But the number of the machine asked Watson Is on the tag on the key hanging about his neck said I One more question queried Burgess How do you know I have been lying face downward on the beach ever since By the sand in your eyebrows I replied and Watson ordered up the small bottle I fail to see what it was in our conversation however observed Hamlet somewhat impatient over the delay caused by the narration of this tale that suggested this train of thought to you The sequel will show returned Holmes Oh Lord put in Raleigh Can t we put off the sequel until a later issue Remember mister Holmes that we are constantly losing time The sequel is brief and I can narrate it on our way to the office of the Navigation Company observed the detective When the bottle came I invited mister Burgess to join us which he did and as the hour was late when we came to separate I offered him the use of my parlor overnight This he accepted and we retired The next morning when I arose to dress the mystery was cleared You had dreamed its solution asked Raleigh No replied Holmes Burgess had disappeared with all my clothing my false beard my suit case and my watch The only thing he had left me was the bathing suit and a few empty small bottles And why may I ask put in Hamlet as they drew near to Charon s office why does that case remind you of business as it is conducted to day In this that it is a good thing to stay out of unless you know it all explained Holmes I omitted in the case of Burgess to observe one thing about him Had I observed that his nose was rectilinear incurved and with a lifted base and that his auricular temporal angle was between ninety six and ninety seven degrees I should have known at once that he was an impostor Vide Ottolenghui on Ears and Noses I Have Met pp six hundred thirty one six hundred forty Do you mean to say that you can tell a criminal by his ears demanded Hamlet If he has any yes but I did not know that at the time of the Brighton mystery Therefore I should have stayed out of the case But here we are Good morning Charon By this time the trio had entered the private office of the president of the Styx Navigation Company and in a few moments the vessel was chartered at a fabulous price On the return to the wharf Sir Walter somewhat nervously asked Holmes if he thought the plan they had settled upon would work Charon is a very shrewd old fellow said he He may outwit us yet The chances are just two and one eighth degrees in your favor observed Holmes quietly with a glance at Raleigh s ears The temporal angle of your ears is ninety three point one hundred twenty five degrees whereas Charon s stand out at ninety one by my otometer To that extent your criminal instincts are superior to his If criminology is an exact science reasoning by your respective ears you ought to beat him out by a perceptible though possibly narrow margin With which assurance Raleigh went ahead with his preparations and within twelve hours the Gehenna was under way carrying a full complement of crew and officers with every state room on board occupied by some spirit of the more illustrious kind Even Shylock was on board though no one knew it for in the dead of night he had stolen quietly up the gang plank and had hidden himself in an empty water cask in the forecastle Tisn t Venice he said as he sat down and breathed heavily through the bung of the barrel but it s musty and damp enough and considering the cost I can t complain You can t get something for nothing even in Hades CHAPTER VIII ON BOARD THE GEHENNA When the Gehenna had passed down the Styx and out through the beautiful Cimmerian Harbor into the broad waters of the ocean and everything was comparatively safe for a while at least Sherlock Holmes came down from the bridge where he had taken his place as the commander of the expedition at the moment of departure His brow was furrowed with anxiety and through his massive forehead his brain could be seen to be throbbing violently and the corrugations of his gray matter were not pleasant to witness as he tried vainly to squeeze an idea out of them What is the matter asked Demosthenes anxiously We are not in any danger are we No replied Holmes But I am somewhat puzzled at the bubbles on the surface of the ocean and the ripples which we passed over an hour or two ago barely perceptible through the most powerful microscope indicate to my mind that for some reason at present unknown to me the House boat has changed her course Take that bubble floating by It is the last expiring bit of aerial agitation of the House boat s wake Observe whence it comes Not from the Azores quarter but as if instead of steering a straight course thither the House boat had taken a sharp turn to the north east and was making for Havre or in other words Paris instead of London seems to have become their destination Demosthenes looked at Holmes with blank amazement and to keep from stammering out the exclamation of wonder that rose to his lips he opened his bonbonniere and swallowed a pebble You don t happen to have a cocaine tablet in your box do you queried Holmes No returned the Greek Cocaine makes me flighty and nervous but these pebbles sort of ballast me and hold me down How on earth do you know that that bubble comes from the wake of the House boat By my chemical knowledge merely replied Holmes A merely worldly vessel leaves a phosphorescent bubble in its wake That one we have just discovered is not so but sulphurescent if I may coin a word which it seems to me the English language is very much in need of It proves then that the bubble is a portion of the wake of a Stygian craft and the only Stygian craft that has cleared the Cimmerian Harbor for years is the House boat Q E D We can go back until we find the ripple again and follow that I presume sneered Le Coq who did not take much stock in the theories of his great rival largely because he was a detective by intuition rather than by study of the science You can if you want to but it is better not to rejoined Holmes simply as though not observing the sneer because the ripple represents the outer lines of the angle of disturbance in the water and as any one of the sides to an angle is greater than the perpendicular from the hypothenuse to the apex you d merely be going the long way This is especially important when you consider the formation of the bow of the House boat which is rounded like the stern of most vessels and comes near to making a pair of ripples at an angle of ninety degrees Then observed Sir Walter with a sigh of disappointment we must change our course and sail for Paris I am afraid so said Holmes but of course it s by no means certain as yet I think if Columbus would go up into the mizzentop and look about him he might discover something either in confirmation or refutation of the theory He couldn t discover anything put in Pinzon He never did Well I like that retorted Columbus I d like to know who discovered America So should I observed Leif Ericson with a wink at Vespucci Tut retorted Columbus I did it and the world knows it whether you claim it or not Yes just as Noah discovered Ararat replied Pinzon You sat upon the deck until we ran plumb into an island after floating about for three months and then you couldn t tell it from a continent even when you had it right before your eyes Noah might just as well have told his family that he discovered a roof garden as for you to go back to Spain telling em all that San Salvador was the United States Well I don t care said Columbus with a short laugh I m the one they celebrate so what s the odds I d rather stay down here in the smoking room enjoying a small game anyhow than climb up that mast and strain my eyes for ten or a dozen hours looking for evidence to prove or disprove the correctness of another man s theory I wouldn t know evidence when I saw it anyhow Send Judge Blackstone I draw the line at the mizzentop observed Blackstone The dignity of the bench must and shall be preserved and I ll never consent to climb up that rigging getting pitch and paint on my ermine no matter who asks me to go Whomsoever I tell to go shall go put in Holmes firmly I am commander of this ship It will pay you to remember that Judge Blackstone And I am the Court of Appeals retorted Blackstone hotly Bear that in mind captain when you try to send me up I ll issue a writ of habeas corpus on my own body and commit you for contempt There s no use of sending the Judge anyhow said Raleigh fearing by the glitter that came into the eye of the commander that trouble might ensue unless pacificatory measures were resorted to He s accustomed to weighing everything carefully and cannot be rushed into a decision If he saw any evidence he d have to sit on it a week before reaching a conclusion What we need here more than anything else is an expert seaman a lookout and I nominate Shem He has sailed under his father and I have it on good authority that he is a nautical expert Holmes hesitated for an instant He was considering the necessity of disciplining the recalcitrant Blackstone but he finally yielded Very well he said Shem be it Bo sun pipe Shem on deck and tell him that general order number one requires him to report at the mizzentop right away and that immediately he sees anything he shall come below and make it known to me As for the rest of us having a very considerable appetite I do now decree that it is dinner time Shall we go below I don t think I care for any thank you said Raleigh Fact is ah I dined last week and am not hungry Noah laughed Oh come below and watch us eat then he said It ll do you good But there was no reply Raleigh had plunged head first into his state room which fortunately happened to be on the upper deck The rest of the spirits repaired below to the saloon where they were soon engaged in an animated discussion of such viands as the larder provided This said doctor Johnson from the head of the table is what I call comfort I don t know that I am so anxious to recover the House boat after all Nor I said Socrates with a ship like this to go off cruising on and with such a larder Look at the thickness of that puree Doctor Excuse me said Boswell faintly but I I ve left my note bub book upstairs Doctor and I d like to go up and get it Certainly said doctor Johnson I judge from your color which is highly suggestive of a modern magazine poster that it might be well too if you stayed on deck for a little while and made a few entries in your commonplace book Thank you said Boswell gratefully Shall you say anything clever during dinner sir If so I might be putting it down while I m up Get out roared the Doctor Get up as high as you can get up with Shem on the mizzentop Very good sir replied Boswell and he was off You ought to be more lenient with him Doctor said Bonaparte he means well I know it observed Johnson but he s so very previous Last winter at Chaucer s dinner to Burns I made a speech which Boswell printed a week before it was delivered with the words laughter and uproarious applause interspersed through it It placed me in a false position How did he know what you were going to say queried Demosthenes Don t know replied Johnson Kind of mind reader I fancy he added blushing a trifle But Captain Holmes what do you deduce from your observation of the wake of the House boat If she s going to Paris why the change I have two theories replied the detective Which is always safe said Le Coq Always it doubles your chances of success acquiesced Holmes Anyhow it gives you a choice which makes it more interesting The change of her course from Londonward to Parisward proves to me either that Kidd is not satisfied with the extent of the revenge he has already taken and wishes to ruin you gentlemen financially by turning your wives daughters and sisters loose on the Parisian shops or that the pirates have themselves been overthrown by the ladies who have decided to prolong their cruise and get some fun out of their misfortune And where else than to Paris would any one in search of pleasure go asked Bonaparte I had more fun a few miles outside of Brussels said Wellington with a sly wink at Washington Oh let up on that retorted Bonaparte It wasn t you beat me at Waterloo You couldn t have beaten me at a plain ordinary game of old maid with a stacked pack of cards much less in the game of war if you hadn t had the elements with you Tut snapped Wellington It was clear science laid you out Boney Taisey voo shouted the irate Corsican Clear science be hanged Wet science was what did it If it hadn t been for the rain my little Duke I should have been in London within a week my grenadiers would have been camping in your Rue Peekadeely and the Old Guard all over everywhere else You must have had a gay army then laughed Caesar What are French soldiers made of that they can t stand the wet unshrunk linen or flannel Bah observed Napoleon shrugging his shoulders and walking a few paces away You do not understand the French The Frenchman is not a pell mell soldier like you Romans he is the poet of arms he does not go in for glory at the expense of his dignity style form is dearer to him than honor and he has no use for fighting in the wet and coming out of the fight conspicuous as a victor with the curl out of his feathers and his epaulets rusted with the damp There is no glory in water But if we had had umbrellas and mackintoshes as every Englishman who comes to the Continent always has and a bath tub for everybody then would your Waterloo have been different again and the great democracy of Europe with a Bonaparte for emperor would have been founded for what the Americans call the keeps and as for your little Great Britain ha she would have become the Blackwell s Island of the Greater France You re almost as funny as Punch isn t drawled Wellington with an angry gesture at Bonaparte You weren t within telephoning distance of victory all day We simply played with you my boy It was a regular game of golf for us We let you keep up pretty close and win a few holes but on the home drive we had you beaten in one stroke Go to my dear Bonaparte and stop talking about the flood It s a lucky thing for us that Noah wasn t a Frenchman eh said Frederick the Great How that rain would have fazed him if he had been The human race would have been wiped out Oh pshaw ejaculated Noah deprecating the unseemliness of the quarrel and putting his arm affectionately about Bonaparte s shoulder When you come down to that I was French as French as one could be in those days and these Gallic subjects of my friend here were every one of em my lineal descendants and their hatred of rain was inherited directly from me their ancestor Are not we English as much your descendants queried Wellington arching his eyebrows You are said Noah but you take after missus Noah more than after me Water never fazes a woman and your delight in tubs is an essentially feminine trait The first thing missus Noah carried aboard was a laundry outfit and then she went back for rugs and coats and all sorts of hand baggage Gad it makes me laugh to this day when I think of it She looked for all the world like an Englishman travelling on the Continent as she walked up the gang plank behind the elephants each elephant with a Gladstone bag in his trunk and a hat box tied to his tail Here the venerable old weather prophet winked at Munchausen and the little quarrel which had been imminent passed off in a general laugh Where s Boswell He ought to get that anecdote said Johnson I ve locked him up in the library said Holmes He s in charge of the log and as I have a pretty good general idea as to what is about to happen I have mapped out a skeleton of the plot and set him to work writing it up Here the detective gave a sudden start placed his hand to his ear listened intently for an instant and taking out his watch and glancing at it added quietly In three minutes Shem will be in here to announce a discovery and one of great importance I judge from the squeak The assemblage gazed earnestly at Holmes for a moment The squeak queried Raleigh Precisely said Holmes The squeak is what I said and as I always say what I mean it follows logically that I meant what I said I heard no squeak observed doctor Johnson and furthermore I fail to see how a squeak if I had heard it would have portended a discovery of importance It would not to you said Holmes but with me it is different My hearing is unusually acute I can hear the dropping of a pin through a stone wall ten feet thick any sound within a mile of my eardrum vibrates thereon with an intensity which would surprise you and it is by the use of cocaine that I have acquired this wonderfully acute sense A property which dulls the senses of most people renders mine doubly apprehensive therefore gentlemen while to you there was no auricular disturbance to me there was I heard Shem sliding down the mast a minute since The fact that he slid down the mast instead of climbing down the rigging showed that he was in great haste therefore he must have something to communicate of great importance Why isn t he here already then It wouldn t take him two minutes to get from the deck here asked the ever auspicious Le Coq It is simple returned Holmes calmly If you will go yourself and slide down that mast you will see Shem has stopped for a little witch hazel to soothe his burns It is no cool matter sliding down a mast two hundred feet in height As Sherlock Holmes spoke the door burst open and Shem rushed in A signal of distress captain he cried From what quarter to larboard asked Holmes No returned Shem breathless Then it must be dead ahead said Holmes Why not to starboard asked Le Coq dryly Because answered Holmes confidently it never happens so If you had ever read a truly exciting sea tale my dear Le Coq you would have known that interesting things and particularly signals of distress are never seen except to larboard or dead ahead A murmur of applause greeted this retort and Le Coq subsided The nature of the signal demanded Holmes A black flag skull and cross bones down at half mast cried Shem and on a rock bound coast They re marooned by heavens shouted Holmes springing to his feet and rushing to the deck where he was joined immediately by Sir Walter doctor Johnson Bonaparte and the others Isn t he a daisy whispered Demosthenes to Diogenes as they climbed the stairs He is more than that he s a blooming orchid said Diogenes with intense enthusiasm I think I ll get my X ray lantern and see if he s honest CHAPTER IX CAPTAIN KIDD MEETS WITH AN OBSTACLE Excuse me your Majesty remarked Helen of Troy as Cleopatra accorded permission to Captain Kidd to speak I have not been introduced to this gentleman nor has he been presented to me and I really cannot consent to any proceeding so irregular as this I do not speak to gentlemen I have not met nor do I permit them to address me Hear hear cried Xanthippe I quite agree with the principle of my young friend from Troy It may be that when we claimed for ourselves all the rights of men that the right to speak and be spoken to by other men without an introduction will included in the list but I for one have no desire to avail myself of the privilege especially when it s a horrid looking man like this Kidd bowed politely and smiled so terribly that several of the ladies fainted I will withdraw he said turning to Cleopatra and it must be said that his suggestion was prompted by his heartfelt wish for now that he found himself thus conspicuously brought before so many women with falsehood on his lips his courage began to ooze Not yet please answered the chairlady I imagine we can get about this difficulty without much trouble I think it a perfectly proper objection too observed Delilah rising If we ever needed etiquette we need it now But I have a plan which will obviate any further difficulty If there is no one among us who is sufficiently well acquainted with the gentleman to present him formally to us I will for the time being take upon myself the office of ship s barber and cut his hair I understand that it is quite the proper thing for barbers to talk while cutting their hair to persons to whom they have not been introduced And besides he really needs a hair cut badly Thus I shall establish an acquaintance with the captain after which I can with propriety introduce him to the rest of you Perhaps the gentleman himself might object to that put in Queen Elizabeth If I remember rightly your last customer was very much dissatisfied with the trim you gave him It will be unnecessary to do what Delilah proposes said missus Noah with a kindly smile as she rose up from the corner in which she had been sitting an interested listener I can introduce the gentleman to you all with perfect propriety He s a member of my family His grandfather was the great grandson a thousand and eight times removed of my son Shem s great grandnephew on his father s side His relationship to me is therefore obvious though from what I know of his reputation I think he takes more after my husband s ancestors than my own Willie dear these ladies are friends of mine Ladies this young man is one of my most famous descendants He has been a man of many adventures and he has been hanged once which far from making him undesirable as an acquaintance has served merely to render him harmless and therefore a safe person to know Now my son go ahead and speak your piece The good old spirit sat down and the scruples of the objectors having thus been satisfied Captain Kidd began Now that I know you all he remarked as pleasantly as he could under the circumstances I feel that I can speak more freely and certainly with a great deal less embarrassment than if I were addressing a gathering of entire strangers I am not much of a hand at speaking and have always felt somewhat nonplussed at finding myself in a position of this nature In my whole career I never experienced but one irresistible impulse to make a public address of any length and that was upon that unhappy occasion to which the greatest and grandest of my great grandmothers has alluded and that only as the chain by which I was suspended in mid air tightened about my vocal chords At that moment I could have talked impromptu for a year so fast and numerously did thoughts of the uttermost import surge upward into my brain but circumstances over which I had no control prevented the utterance of those thoughts and that speech is therefore lost to the world He has the gift of continuity observed Madame Recamier Ought to be in the United States Senate smiled Elizabeth I wish I could make up my mind as to whether he is outrageously handsome or desperately ugly remarked Helen of Troy He fascinates me but whether it is the fascination of liking or of horror I can t tell and it s quite important Ladies resumed the captain his uneasiness increasing as he came to the point I am but the agent of your respective husbands fiances and other masculine guardians The gentlemen who were previously the tenants of this club house have delegated to me the important and I may add highly agreeable task of showing you the world They have noted of late years the growth of that feeling of unrest which is becoming every day more and more conspicuous in feminine circles in all parts of the universe on the earth where women are clamoring to vote and to be allowed to go out late at night without an escort in Hades where as you are no doubt aware the management of the government has fallen almost wholly into the hands of the Furies and even in the halls of Jupiter himself where I am credibly informed Juno has been taking private lessons in the art of hurling thunderbolts information which the extraordinary quality of recent electrical storms on the earth would seem to confirm Thunderbolts of late years have been cast hither and yon in a most erratic fashion striking where they were least expected as those of you who keep in touch with the outer world must be fully aware Now actuated by their usual broad and liberal motives the men of Hades wish to meet the views of you ladies to just that extent that your views are based upon a wise selection in turn based upon experience and they have come to me and in so many words have said mister Kidd we wish the women of Hades to see the world We want them to be satisfied We do not like this constantly increasing spirit of unrest We who have seen all the life that we care to see do not ourselves feel equal to the task of showing them about We will pay you liberally if you will take our House boat which they have always been anxious to enter and personally conduct our beloved ones to Paris London and elsewhere Let them see as much of life as they can stand Accord them every privilege Spare no expense only bring them back again to us safe and sound These were their words ladies I asked them why they didn t come along themselves saying that even if they were tired of it all they should make some personal sacrifice to your comfort and they answered reasonably and well that they would be only too glad to do so but that they feared they might unconsciously seem to exert a repressing influence upon you We want them to feel absolutely free Captain Kidd said they and if we are along they may not feel so The answer was convincing ladies and I accepted the commission But we knew nothing of all this interposed Elizabeth The subject was not broached to us by our husbands brothers fiances or fathers My brother Sir Walter Raleigh Cleopatra chuckled Brother Brother s good she said Well that s what he is retorted Elizabeth quickly I promised to be a sister to him and I m going to keep my word That s the kind of a queen I am I was about to remark Elizabeth added turning to the captain that my brother Sir Walter Raleigh never even hinted at any such plan and usually he asked my advice in matters of so great importance That is easily accounted for madame retorted Kidd Sir Walter intended this as a little surprise for you that is all The arrangements were all placed in his hands and it was he who bound us all to secrecy None of the ladies were to be informed of it It does not sound altogether plausible interposed Portia If you ladies do not object I should like to cross examine this ah gentleman Kidd paled visibly He was not prepared for any such trial however he put as good a face on the matter as he could and announced his willingness to answer any questions that he might be asked Shall we put him under oath asked Cleopatra As you please ladies said the pirate A pirate s word is as good as his bond but I ll take an oath if you choose a half dozen of em if need be I fancy we can get along without that said Portia Now Captain Kidd who first proposed this plan Socrates said Kidd unblushingly with a sly glance at Xanthippe What cried Xanthippe My husband propose anything that would contribute to my pleasure or intellectual advancement Bah Your story is transparently false at the outset Nevertheless said Kidd the scheme was proposed by Socrates He said a trip of that kind for Xanthippe would be very restful and health giving For me cried Xanthippe sceptically No madame for him retorted Kidd Ah ho ho That s the way of it eh said Xanthippe flushing to the roots of her hair Very likely You ah you will excuse my doubting your word Captain Kidd a moment since I withdraw my remark and in order to make fullest reparation I beg to assure these ladies that I am now perfectly convinced that you are telling the truth That last observation is just like my husband and when I get back home again if I ever do well ha ha we ll have a merry time that s all And what was ah Bassanio s connection with this affair added Portia hesitatingly He was not informed of it said Kidd archly I am not acquainted with Bassanio my lady but I overheard Sir Walter enjoining upon the others the absolute necessity of keeping the whole affair from Bassanio because he was afraid he would not consent to it Bassanio has a most beautiful wife gentlemen said Sir Walter and he wouldn t think of parting with her under any circumstances therefore let us keep our intentions a secret from him I did not hear whom the gentleman married madame but the others Prince Hamlet the Duke of Buckingham and Louis the Fourteenth all agreed that missus Bassanio was too beautiful a person to be separated from and that it was better therefore to keep Bassanio in the dark as to their little enterprise until it was too late for him to interfere A pink glow of pleasure suffused the lovely countenance of the cross examiner and it did not require a very sharp eye to see that the wily Kidd had completely won her over to his side On the other hand Elizabeth s brow became as corrugated as her ruff and the spirit of the pirate shivered to the core as he turned and gazed upon that glowering face Sir Walter agreed to that did he snapped Elizabeth And yet he was willing to part with ah his sister Well your Majesty began Kidd hesitatingly you see it was this way Sir Walter er did say that but ah he ah but he added that he of course merely judged er this man Bassanio s feelings by his own in parting from his sister Did he say sister cried Elizabeth Well no not in those words shuffled Kidd perceiving quickly wherein his error lay but ah I jumped at the conclusion seeing his intense enthusiasm for the lady s beauty and er intellectual qualities that he referred to you and it is from yourself that I have gained my knowledge as to the fraternal not to say sororal relationship that exists between you That man s a diplomat from Diplomaville muttered Sir Henry Morgan who with Abeuchapeta and Conrad was listening at the port without He is that said Abeuchapeta but he can t last much longer He s perspiring like a pitcher of ice water on a hot day and a spirit of his size and volatile nature can t stand much of that without evaporating If you will observe him closely you will see that his left arm already has vanished into thin air By Jove whispered Conrad that s a fact If they don t let up on him he ll vanish He s getting excessively tenuous about the top of his head All of which was only too true Subjected to a scrutiny which he had little expected the deceitful ambassador of the thieving band was rapidly dissipating and as those without had so fearsomely noted was in imminent danger of complete sublimation which in the case of one possessed of so little elementary purity meant nothing short of annihilation Fortunately for Kidd however his wonderful tact had stemmed the tide of suspicion Elizabeth was satisfied with his explanation and in the minds of at least three of the most influential ladies on board Portia Xanthippe and Elizabeth he had become a creature worthy of credence which meant that he had nothing more to fear I am prepared your Majesty said Elizabeth addressing Cleopatra to accept from this time on the gentleman s word The little that he has already told us is hall marked with truth I should like to ask however one more question and that is how our gentleman friends expected to embark us upon this voyage without letting us into the secret Oh as for that replied Kidd with a deep drawn sigh of relief for he too had noticed the gradual evaporation of his arm and the incipient etherization of his cranium as for that it was simple enough There was to have been a day set apart for ladies day at the club and when you were all on board we were quietly to weigh anchor and start The fact that you had anticipated the day of your own volition was telephoned by my scouts to me at my headquarters and that news was by me transmitted by messenger to Sir Walter at Charon s Glen Island where the long talked of fight between Samson and Goliath was taking place Raleigh immediately replied Good Start at once Paris first Unlimited credit Love to Elizabeth Wherefore ladies he added rising from his chair and walking to the door wherefore you are here and in my care Make yourselves comfortable and with the aid of the fashion papers which you have already received prepare yourselves for the joys that await you With the aid of Madame Recamier and Baedeker s Paris which you will find in the library it will be your own fault if when you arrive there you resemble a great many less fortunate women who don t know what they want With these words Kidd disappeared through the door and fainted in the arms of Sir Henry Morgan The strain upon him had been too great A charming fellow said Portia as the pirate disappeared Most attractive said Elizabeth Handsome too don t you think asked Helen of Troy And truthful beyond peradventure observed Xanthippe as she reflected upon the words the captain had attributed to Socrates I didn t believe him at first but when he told me what my sweet tempered philosopher had said I was convinced He s a sweet child interposed missus Noah fondly One of my favorite grandchildren Which makes it embarrassing for me to say cried Cassandra starting up angrily that he is a base caitiff Had a bomb been dropped in the middle of the room it could not have created a greater sensation than the words of Cassandra What cried several voices at once A caitiff A caitiff with a capital K retorted Cassandra I know that because while he was telling his story I was listening to it with one ear and looking forward into the middle of next week with the other I mean the other eye and I saw Yes you saw cried Cleopatra I saw that he was deceiving us Mark my words ladies he is a base caitiff replied Cassandra a base caitiff What did you see cried Elizabeth excitedly This said Cassandra and she began a narration of future events which I must defer to the next chapter Meanwhile his associates were endeavoring to restore the evaporated portions of the prostrated Kidd s spirit anatomy by the use of a steam atomizer but with indifferent success Kidd s training had not fitted him for an intellectual combat with superior women and he suffered accordingly CHAPTER X A WARNING ACCEPTED It is with no desire to interrupt my friend Cassandra unnecessarily said missus Noah as the prophetess was about to narrate her story that I rise to beg her to remember that as an ancestress of Captain Kidd I hope she will spare a grandmother s feelings if anything in the story she is about to tell is improper to be placed before the young I have been so shocked by the stories of perfidy and baseness generally that have been published of late years that I would interpose a protest while there is yet time if there is a line in Cassandra s story which ought to be withheld from the public a protest based upon my affection for posterity and in the interests of morality everywhere You may rest easy upon that score my dear missus Noah said the prophetess What I have to say would commend itself I am sure even to the ears of a British matron and while it is as complete a demonstration of man s perfidy as ever was it is none the less as harmless a little tale as the Dottie Dimple books or any other more recent study of New England character Thank you for the load your words have lifted from my mind said missus Noah settling back in her chair a satisfied expression upon her gentle countenance I hope you will understand why I spoke and withal why modern literature generally has been so distressful to me When you reflect that the world is satisfied that most of man s criminal instincts are the result of heredity and that mister Noah and I are unable to shift the responsibility for posterity to other shoulders than our own you will understand my position We were about the most domestic old couple that ever lived and when we see the long and varied assortment of crimes that are cropping out everywhere in our descendants it is painful to us to realize what a pair of unconsciously wicked old fogies we must have been We all understand that said Cleopatra kindly and we are all prepared to acquit you of any responsibility for the advanced condition of wickedness to day Man has progressed since your time my dear grandma and the modern improvements in the science of crime are no more attributable to you than the invention of the telephone or the oyster cocktail is attributable to your husband Thank you kindly murmured the old lady and she resumed her knitting upon a phantom tam o shanter which she was making as a Christmas surprise for her husband When Captain Kidd began his story said Cassandra he made one very bad mistake and yet one which was prompted by that courtesy which all men instinctively adopt when addressing women When he entered the room he removed his hat and therein lay his fatal error if he wished to convince me of the truth of his story for with his hat removed I could see the workings of his mind While you ladies were watching his lips or his eyes some of you taking in the gorgeous details of his dress all of you hanging upon his every word I kept my eye fixed firmly upon his imagination and I saw what you did not THAT HE WAS DRAWING WHOLLY UPON THAT How extraordinary cried Elizabeth Yes and fortunate said Cassandra Had I not done so a week hence we should every one of us have been lost in the surging wickedness of the city of Paris But Cassandra said Trilby who was anxious to return once more to the beautiful city by the Seine he told us we were going to Paris Of course he did said Madame Recamier and in so many words Certainly he was not drawing upon his imagination there And one might be lost in a very much worse place put in Marguerite de Valois if indeed it were possible to lose us in Paris at all I fancy that I know enough about Paris to find my way about Humph ejaculated Cassandra What a foolish little thing you are You don t imagine that the Paris of to day is the Paris of your time or even the Paris of that sweet child Trilby s time do you If you do you are very much mistaken I almost wish I had not warned you of your danger and had let you go just to see those eyes of yours open with amazement at the change You d find your Louvre a very different sort of a place from what it used to be my dear lady Those pleasing little windows through which your relations were wont in olden times to indulge in target practice at people who didn t go to their church are now kept closed the galleries which used to swarm with people many of whom ought to have been hanged now swarm with pictures many of which ought not to have been hung the romance which clung about its walls is as much a part of the dead past as yourselves and were you to materialize suddenly therein you would find yourselves jostled and hustled and trodden upon by the curious from other lands with Argus eyes taking in five hundred pictures a minute and traversing those halls at a rate of speed at which Mercury himself would stand aghast But my beloved Tuileries cried Marie Antoinette Has been swallowed up by a play ground for the people my dear said Cassandra gently Paris is no place for us and it is the intention of these men in whose hands we are to take us there and then desert us Can you imagine anything worse than ourselves the phantoms of a glorious romantic past basely deserted in the streets of a wholly strange superficial material city of to day What do you think Elizabeth would be your fate if faint and famished you begged for sustenance at an English door to day and when asked your name and profession were to reply Elizabeth Queen of England Insane asylum said Elizabeth shortly Precisely So in Paris with the rest of us said Cassandra How do you know all this asked Trilby still unconvinced I know it just as you knew how to become a prima donna said Cassandra I am however my own Svengali which is rather preferable to the patent detachable hypnotizer you had I hypnotize myself and direct my mind into the future I was a professional forecaster in the days of ancient Troy and if my revelations had been heeded the Priam family would I doubt not still be doing business at the old stand and mister AEneas would not have grown round shouldered giving his poor father a picky back ride on the opening night of the horse show so graphically depicted by Virgil I never heard about that said Trilby It sounds like a very funny story though Well it wasn t so humorous for some as it was for others said Cassandra with a sly glance at Helen The fact is until you mentioned it yourself it never occurred to me that there was much fun in any portion of the Trojan incident excepting perhaps the delirium tremens of old Laocoon who got no more than he deserved for stealing my thunder I had warned Troy against the Greeks and they all laughed at me and said my eye to the future was strabismatic that the Greeks couldn t get into Troy at all even if they wanted to And then the Greeks made a great wooden horse as a gift for the Trojans and when I turned my X ray gaze upon it I saw that it contained about six brigades of infantry three artillery regiments and sharp shooters by the score It was a sort of military Noah s Ark but I knew that the prejudice against me was so strong that nobody would believe what I told them So I said nothing My prophecies never came true they said failing to observe that my warning as to what would be was in itself the cause of their non fulfilment But desiring to save Troy I sent for Laocoon and told him all about it and he went out and announced it as his own private prophecy and then having tried to drown his conscience in strong waters he fell a victim to the usual serpentine hallucination and everybody said he wasn t sober and therefore unworthy of belief The horse was accepted hauled into the city and that night orders came from hindquarters to the regiments concealed inside to march They marched and next morning Troy had been removed from the map ninety per cent of the Trojans died suddenly and AEneas grabbing up his family in one hand and his gods in the other went yachting for several seasons ultimately settling down in Italy All of this could have been avoided if the Trojans would have taken the hint from my prophecies They preferred however not to do it with the result that to day no one but Helen and myself knows even where Troy was and we ll never tell It is all true said Helen proudly I was the woman who was at the bottom of it all and I can testify that Cassandra always told the truth which is why she was always so unpopular When anything that was unpleasant happened after it was all over she would turn and say sweetly I told you so She was the original I told you so nuisance and of course she had the newspapyruses down on her because she never left them any sensation to spring upon the public If she had only told a fib once in a while the public would have had more confidence in her Thank you for your endorsement said Cassandra with a nod at Helen With such testimony I cannot see how you can refrain from taking my advice in this matter and I tell you ladies that this man Kidd has made his story up out of whole cloth the men of Hades had no more to do with our being here than we had they were as much surprised as we are to find us gone Kidd himself was not aware of our presence and his object in taking us to Paris is to leave us stranded there disembodied spirits vagrant souls with no familiar haunts to haunt no place to rest and nothing before us save perpetual exile in a world that would have no sympathy for us in our misfortune and no belief in our continued existence But what then shall we do cried Ophelia wringing her hands in despair It is a terrible problem said Cleopatra anxiously and yet it does seem as if our woman s instinct ought to show us some way out of our trouble The Committee on Treachery said Delilah has already suggested a chafing dish party with Lucretia Borgia in charge of the lobster Newberg That is true said Lucretia but I find in going through my reticule that my maid for some reason unknown to me has failed to renew my supply of poisons I shall discharge her on my return home for she knows that I never go anywhere without them but that does not help matters at this juncture The sad fact remains that I could prepare a thousand delicacies for these pirates without fatal results You mean immediately fatal do you not suggested Xanthippe I could myself prepare a cake which would in time reduce our captors to a state of absolute dependence but of course the effect is not immediate We might give a musicale and let Trilby sing Ben Bolt to them suggested Marguerite de Valois with a giggle Don t be flippant please said Portia We haven t time to waste on flippant suggestions Perhaps a court martial of these pirates supplemented by a yard arm wouldn t be a bad thing I ll prosecute the case You forget that you are dealing with immortal spirits observed Cleopatra If these creatures were mortals hanging them would be all right and comparatively easy considering that we outnumber them ten to one and have many resources for getting them more or less in our power but they are not They have gone through the refining process of dissolution once and there s an end to that Our only resource is in the line of deception and if we cannot deceive them then we have ceased to be women That is truly said observed Elizabeth And inasmuch as we have already provided ourselves with a suitable committee for the preparation of our plans of a deceptive nature I move as the easiest possible solution of the difficulty for the rest of us that the Committee on Treachery be requested to go at once into executive session with orders not to come out of it until they have suggested a plausible plan of campaign against our abductors We must be rid of them Let the Committee on Treachery say how Second the motion said missus Noah You are a very clear headed young woman Lizzie and your grandmother is proud of you The Committee on Treachery were about to protest but the chair refused to entertain any debate upon the question which was put and carried with a storm of approval Five minutes later a note was handed through the port addressed to Cleopatra which read as follows Dear Madame Six bells has just struck and the officers and crew are hungry Will you and your fair companions company operate with us in our enterprise by having a hearty dinner ready within two hours A speck has appeared on the horizon which betokens a coming storm else we would prepare our supper ourselves As it is we feel that your safety depends on our remaining on deck If there is any beer on the ice we prefer it to tea Two cases will suffice Yours respectfully HENRY MORGAN Bart First Mate Hurrah cried Cleopatra as she read this communication I have an idea Tell the Committee on Treachery to appear before the full meeting at once The committee was summoned and Cleopatra announced her plan of operation and it was unanimously adopted but what it was we shall have to wait for another chapter to learn CHAPTER XI MAROONED When Captain Holmes arrived upon deck he seized his glass and gazing intently through it for a moment perceived that the faithful Shem had not deceived him Flying at half mast from a rude roughly hewn pole set upon a rocky height was the black flag emblem of piracy and as Artemus Ward put it with the second joints reversed It was in very truth a signal of distress I make it a point never to be surprised observed Holmes as he peered through the glass but this beats me I didn t know there was an island of this nature in these latitudes Blackstone go below and pipe Captain Cook on deck Perhaps he knows what island that is You ll have to excuse me Captain Holmes replied the Judge I didn t ship on this voyage as a cabin boy or a messenger boy Therefore I Bonaparte put the Judge in irons interrupted Holmes sternly I expect to be obeyed Judge Blackstone whether you shipped as a Lord Chief Justice or a state room steward When I issue an order it must be obeyed Step lively there Bonaparte Get his honor ironed and summon your marines We may have work to do before night Hamlet pipe Captain Cook on deck Aye aye sir replied Hamlet with alacrity as he made off That s the way to obey orders said Holmes with a scornful glance at Blackstone I was only jesting Captain said the latter paling somewhat That s all right said Holmes taking up his glass again So was I when I ordered you in irons and in order that you may appreciate the full force of the joke I repeat it Bonaparte do your duty In an instant the order was obeyed and the unhappy Judge shortly found himself manacled and alone in the forecastle Meanwhile Captain Cook in response to the commander s order repaired to the deck and scanned the distant coast I can t place it he said It can t be Monte Cristo can it No it can t said the Count who stood hard by My island was in the Mediterranean and even if it dragged anchor it couldn t have got out through the Strait of Gibraltar Perhaps it s Robinson Crusoe s island suggested Doctor Johnson Not it observed De Foe If it is the rest of you will please keep off It s mine and I may want to use it again I ve been having a number of interviews with Crusoe latterly and he s given me a lot of new points which I intend incorporating in a sequel for the Cimmerian Magazine Well in the name of Atlas what island is it then roared Holmes angrily What is the matter with all you learned lubbers that I have brought along on this trip Do you suppose I ve brought you to whistle up favorable winds Not by the beard of the Prophet I brought you to give me information and now when I ask for the name of a simple little island like that in plain sight there s not one of you able so much as to guess at it reasonably The next man I ask for information goes into irons with Judge Blackstone if he doesn t answer me instantly with the information I want Munchausen what island is that Ahem that replied Munchausen trembling as he reflected upon the Captain s threat What Nobody knows what island that is Why you surprise me See here Baron retorted Holmes menacingly I ask you a plain question and I want a plain answer with no evasions to gain time Now it s irons or an answer What island is that It s an island that doesn t appear on any chart Captain Munchausen responded instantly pulling himself together for a mighty effort and it has never been given a name but as you insist upon having one we ll call it Holmes Island in your honor It is not stationary It is a floating island of lava formation and is a menace to every craft that goes to sea I spent a year of my life upon it once and it is more barren than the desert of Sahara because you cannot raise even sand upon it and it is devoid of water of any sort salt or fresh What did you live on during that year asked Holmes eying him narrowly Canned food from wrecks replied the Baron feeling much easier now that he had got a fair start canned food from wrecks commander There is a magnetic property in the upper stratum of this piece of derelict real estate sir which attracts to it every bit of canned substance that is lost overboard in all parts of the world A ship is wrecked say in the Pacific Ocean and ultimately all the loose metal upon her will succumb to the irresistible attraction of this magnetic upper stratum and will find its way to its shores So in any other part of the earth Everything metallic turns up here sooner or later and when you consider that thousands of vessels go down every year vessels which are provisioned with tinned foods only you will begin to comprehend how many millions of pounds of preserved salmon sardines pate de foie gras peaches and so on can be found strewn along its coast Munchausen said Holmes smiling by the blush upon your cheek coupled with an occasional uneasy glance of the eye I know that for once you are standing upon the to you unfamiliar ground of truth and I admire you for it There is nothing to be ashamed of in telling the truth occasionally You are a man after my own heart Come below and have a cocktail Captain Cook take command of the Gehenna during my absence head her straight for Holmes Island and when you discover anything new let me know Bonaparte in honor of Munchausen s remarkable genius I proclaim general amnesty to our prisoners and you may release Blackstone from his dilemma and if you have any tin soldiers among your marines see that they are lashed to the rigging I don t want this electric island of the Baron s to get a grip upon my military force at this juncture With this Holmes followed by Munchausen went below and the two worthies were soon deep in the mysteries of a phantom cocktail while Doctor Johnson and De Foe gazed mournfully out over the ocean at the floating island De Foe said Johnson that ought to be a lesson to you This realism that you tie up to is all right when you are alone with your conscience but when there are great things afoot an imagination and a broad view as to the limitations of truth aren t at all bad You or I might now be drinking that cocktail with Holmes if we d only risen to the opportunity the way Munchausen did That is true said De Foe sadly But I didn t suppose he wanted that kind of information I could have spun a better yarn than that of Munchausen s with my eyes shut I supposed he wanted truth and I gave it I d like to know what has become of the House boat said Raleigh anxiously gazing through the glass at the island I can see old Henry Morgan sitting down there on the rocks with his elbows on his knees and his chin in his hands and Kidd and Abeuchapeta are standing back of him yelling like mad but there isn t a boat in sight Who is that man off to the right dancing a fandango asked Johnson It looks like Conrad but I can t tell He appears to have gone crazy He s got that wild look on his face which betokens insanity We ll have to be careful in our parleyings with these people said Raleigh Anything new asked Holmes returning to the deck smacking his lips in enjoyment of the cocktail No except that we are almost within hailing distance said Cook Then give orders to cast anchor observed Holmes Bonaparte take a crew of picked men ashore and bring those pirates aboard Take the three musketeers with you and don t let Kidd or Morgan give you any back talk If they try any funny business exorcise them Aye aye sir replied Bonaparte and in a moment a boat had been lowered and a sturdy crew of sailors were pulling for the shore As they came within ten feet of it the pirates made a mad dash down the rough rocky hillside and clamored to be saved What s happened to you cried Bonaparte ordering the sailors to back water lest the pirates should too hastily board the boat and swamp her We are marooned replied Kidd and on an island of a volcanic nature There isn t a square inch of it that isn t heated up to one hundred twenty five degrees and seventeen of us have already evaporated Conrad has lost his reason Abeuchapeta has become so tenuous that a child can see through him As for myself I am growing iridescent with anxiety and unless I get off this infernal furnace I ll disappear like a soap bubble For Heaven s sake then General take us off on your own terms We ll accept anything As if in confirmation of Kidd s words six of the pirate crew collapsed and disappeared into thin air and a glance at Abeuchapeta was proof enough of his condition He had become as clear as crystal and had it not been for his rugged outlines he would hardly have been visible even to his fellow spirits As for Kidd he had taken on the aspect of a rainbow and it was patent that his fears for himself were all too well founded Bonaparte embarked the leaders of the band first returning subsequently for the others and repaired with them at once to the Gehenna where they were ushered into the presence of Sherlock Holmes The first question he asked was as to the whereabouts of the House boat That we do not know replied Kidd mournfully gazing downward at the wreck of his former self We came ashore sir early yesterday morning in search of food It appears that when acting in a wholly inexcusable fashion and influenced I confess it by motives of revenge I made off with your club house I neglected to ascertain if it were well stocked with provisions a fatal error for when we endeavored to get supper we discovered that the larder contained but half a bottle of farcie olives two salted almonds and a soda cracker not a luxurious feast for sixty nine pirates and a hundred and eighty three women to sit down to That s all nonsense said Demosthenes The House Committee had provided enough supper for six hundred people in anticipation of the appetite of the members on their return from the fight Of course they did said Confucius and it was a good one too salads salmon glace lobsters every blessed thing a man can t get at home we had and what is more they d been delivered on board I saw to that before I went up the river Then moaned Kidd it is as I suspected We were the victims of base treachery on the part of those women Treachery Well I like that Call it reciprocity said Hamlet dryly We were informed by the ladies that there was nothing for supper save the items I have already referred to said Kidd I see it all now We had tried to make them comfortable and I put myself to some considerable personal inconvenience to make them easy in their minds but they were ungrateful Whatever induced you to take em along with you asked Socrates We didn t want them said Kidd We didn t know they were on board until it was too late to turn back They d broken in and were having the club all to themselves in your absence It served you good and right said Socrates with a laugh Next time you try to take things that don t belong to you maybe you ll be a trifle more careful as to whose property you confiscate But the House boat you haven t told us how you lost her put in Raleigh impatiently Well it was this way said Kidd When in response to our polite request for supper the ladies said there was nothing to eat on board something had to be done for we were all as hungry as bears and we decided to go ashore at the first port and provision Unfortunately the crew got restive and when this floating frying pan loomed into view to keep them good natured we decided to land and see if we could beg borrow or steal some supplies We had to Observations taken with the sextant showed that there was no port within five hundred miles the island looked as if it might be inhabited at least by goats and ashore we went every man of us leaving the House boat safely anchored in the harbor At first we didn t mind the heat and we hunted and hunted and hunted but after three or four hours I began to notice that three of my sailors were shrivelling up and Conrad began to act as if he were daft Hawkins burst right before my eyes Then Abeuchapeta got prismatic around the eyes and began to fade and I noticed a slight iridescence about myself and as for Morgan he had the misfortune to lie down to take a nap in the sun and when he waked up his whole right side had evaporated Then we saw what the trouble was We d struck this lava island and were gradually succumbing to its intense heat We rushed madly back to the harbor to embark and our ship gentlemen and your House boat was slowly but surely disappearing over the horizon and flying from the flag staff at the fore were signals of farewell with an unfeeling P S below to this effect DON T WAIT UP FOR US WE MAY NOT BE BACK UNTIL LATE There was a pause during which Socrates laughed quietly to himself while Abeuchapeta and the one sided Morgan wept silently That gentlemen of the Associated Shades is all I know of the whereabouts of the House boat continued Captain Kidd I have no doubt that the ladies practised a deception to our discomfiture and I must say that I think it was exceedingly clever granting that it was desirable to be rid of us which I don t for we meant well by them and they would have enjoyed themselves But cried Hamlet may they not now be in peril They cannot navigate that ship They got her out of the harbor all right said Kidd And I judged from the figure at the helm that missus Noah had taken charge What kind of a seaman she is I don t know Almighty bad ejaculated Shem turning pale It was she who ran us ashore on Ararat Well wasn t that what you wanted queried Munchausen What we wanted cried Shem Well I guess not You don t want your yacht stranded on a mountain top do you She was a dead loss there whereas if mother hadn t been in such a hurry to get ashore we could have waited a month and landed on the seaboard You might have turned her into a summer hotel suggested Munchausen Well we must up anchor and away said Holmes Our pursuit has merely begun apparently We must overtake this vessel and the question to be answered is where That s easy said Artemus Ward From what Shem says I think we d better look for her in the Himalayas And meanwhile what shall be done with Kidd asked Holmes He ought to be expelled from the club said Johnson We can t expel him because he s not a member replied Raleigh Then elect him suggested Ward What on earth for growled Johnson So that we can expel him said Ward And while Boswell s hero was trying to get the value of this notion through his head the others repaired to the deck and the Gehenna was soon under way once more Meanwhile Captain Kidd and his fellows were put in irons and stowed away in the forecastle alongside of the water cask in which Shylock lay in hiding CHAPTER XII THE ESCAPE AND THE END If there was anxiety on board of the Gehenna as to the condition and whereabouts of the House boat there was by no means less uneasiness upon that vessel itself Cleopatra s scheme for ridding herself and her abducted sisters of the pirates had worked to a charm but having worked thus a new and hitherto undreamed of problem full of perplexities bearing upon their immediate safety now confronted them The sole representative of a seafaring family on board was missus Noah and it did not require much time to see that her knowledge as to navigation was of an extremely primitive order limited indeed to the science of floating When the last pirate had disappeared behind the rocks of Holmes Island and all was in readiness for action the good old lady who had hitherto been as calm and unruffled as a child began to get red in the face and to bustle about in a manner which betrayed considerable perturbation of spirit Now missus Noah said Cleopatra as peeping out from the billiard room window she saw Morgan disappearing in the distance the coast is clear and I resign my position of chairman to you We place the vessel in your hands and ourselves subject to your orders You are in command What do you wish us to do Very well replied missus Noah putting down her knitting and starting for the deck I m not certain but I think the first thing to do is to get her moving Do you know I ve never discovered whether this boat was a steamboat or a sailing vessel Does anybody know I think it has a naphtha tank and a propeller said Elizabeth although I don t know It seems to me my brother Raleigh told me they d had a naphtha engine put in last winter after the freshet when the House boat was carried ten miles down the river and had to be towed back at enormous expense They put it in so that if she were carried away again she could get back of her own power That s unfortunate said missus Noah because I don t know anything about these new fangled notions If there s any one here who knows anything about naphtha engines I wish they d speak I m of the opinion said Portia that I can study out the theory of it in a short while Very well then said missus Noah you can do it I ll appoint you engineer and give you all your orders now right away in advance Set her going and keep her going and don t stop without a written order signed by me We might as well be very careful and have everything done properly and it might happen that in the excitement of our trip you would misunderstand my spoken orders and make a fatal error Therefore pay no attention to unwritten orders That will do for you for the present Xanthippe you may take Ophelia and Madame Recamier and ten other ladies and every morning before breakfast swab the larboard deck Cassandra Tuesdays you will devote to polishing the brasses in the dining room and the balance of your time I wish you to expend in dusting the bric a brac Dido you always were strong at building fires I ll make you chief stoker You will also assist Lucretia Borgia in the kitchen Inasmuch as the latter s maid has neglected to supply her with the usual line of poisons I think we can safely entrust to Lucretia s hands the responsibilities of the culinary department I m perfectly willing to do anything I can said Lucretia but I must confess that I don t approve of your methods of commanding a ship A ship s captain isn t a domestic martinet as you are setting out to be We didn t appoint you housekeeper Now my child said missus Noah firmly I do not wish any words If I hear any more impudence from you I ll put you ashore without a reference and the rest of you I would warn in all kindness that I will not tolerate insubordination You may all of you have one night of the week and alternate Sundays off but your work must be done The regimen I am adopting is precisely that in vogue on the Ark only I didn t have the help I have now and things got into very bad shape We were out forty days and while the food was poor and the service execrable we never lost a life The boat gave a slight tremor Hurrah cried Elizabeth clapping her hands with glee we are off I will repair to the deck and get our bearings said missus Noah putting her shawl over her shoulders Meantime Cleopatra I appoint you first mate See that things are tidied up a bit here before I return Have the windows washed and to morrow I want all the rugs and carpets taken up and shaken Portia meanwhile had discovered the naphtha engine and after experimenting several times with the various levers and stop cocks had finally managed to move one of them in such a way as to set the engine going and the wheel began to revolve Are we going all right she cried from below I am afraid not said the gallant commander The wheel is roiling up the water at a great rate but we don t seem to be going ahead very fast in fact we re simply moving round and round as though we were on a pivot I m afraid we re aground amidships said Xanthippe gazing over the side of the House boat anxiously She certainly acts that way like a merry go round Well there s something wrong said missus Noah and we ve got to hurry and find out what it is or those men will be back and we shall be as badly off as ever Maybe this has something to do with it observed missus Lot pointing to the anchor rope It looks to me as if those horrid men had tied us fast That s just what it is snapped missus Noah They guessed our plan and have fastened us to a pole or something but I imagine we can untie it Portia who had come on deck gave a short little laugh Why of course we don t move she said we are anchored What s that queried missus Noah We never had an experience like that on the Ark Portia explained the science of the anchor What nonsense ejaculated missus Noah How can we get away from it We ve got to pull it up said Portia Order all hands on deck and have it pulled up It can t be done and if it could I wouldn t have it said missus Noah indignantly The idea Lifting heavy pieces of iron my dear Portia is not a woman s work Send for Delilah and let her cut the rope with her scissors It would take her a week to cut a hawser like that said Elizabeth who had been investigating It would be more to the purpose I think to chop it in two with an axe Very well replied missus Noah satisfied I don t care how it is done as long as it is done quickly It would never do for us to be recaptured now The suggestion of Elizabeth was carried out and the queen herself cut the hawser with six well directed strokes of the axe You ARE an expert with it aren t you smiled Cleopatra I am indeed replied Elizabeth grimly I had it suspended over my head for so long a time before I got to the throne that I couldn t help familiarizing myself with some of its possibilities Ah cried missus Noah as the vessel began to move I begin to feel easier It looks now as if we were really off It seems to me though said Cleopatra gazing forward that we are going backward Oh well what if we are said missus Noah We did that on the Ark half the time It doesn t make any difference which way we are going as long as we go does it Why of course it does cried Elizabeth What can you be thinking of People who walk backward are in great danger of running into other people Why not the same with ships It seems to me it s a very dangerous piece of business sailing backward Oh nonsense snapped missus Noah You are as timid as a zebra During the Flood we sailed days and days and days going backward It didn t make a particle of difference how we went it was as safe one way as another and we got just as far away in the end Our main object now is to get away from the pirates and that s what we are doing Don t get emotional Lizzie and remember too that I am in charge If I think the boat ought to go sideways sideways she shall go If you don t like it it is still not too late to put you ashore The threat calmed Elizabeth somewhat and she was satisfied and all went well with them even if Portia had started the propeller revolving reverse fashion so that the House boat was as Elizabeth had said backing her way through the ocean The day passed and by slow degrees the island and the marooned pirates faded from view and the night came on and with it a dense fog We re going to have a nasty night I am afraid said Xanthippe looking anxiously out of the port No doubt said missus Noah pleasantly I m sorry for those who have to be out in it That s what I was thinking about observed Xanthippe It s going to be very hard on us keeping watch Watch for what demanded missus Noah looking over the tops of her glasses at Xanthippe Why surely you are going to have lookouts stationed on deck said Elizabeth Not at all said missus Noah Perfectly absurd We never did it on the Ark and it isn t necessary now I want you all to go to bed at ten o clock I don t think the night air is good for you Besides it isn t proper for a woman to be out after dark whether she s new or not But my dear missus Noah expostulated Cleopatra what will become of the ship I guess she ll float through the night whether we are on deck or not said the commander The Ark did why not this Now girls these new fangled yachting notions are all nonsense It s night and there s a fog as thick as a stone wall all about us If there were a hundred of you upon deck with ten eyes apiece you couldn t see anything You might much better be in bed As your captain chaperon and grandmother I command you to stay below But who is to steer queried Xanthippe What s the use of steering until we can see where to steer to demanded missus Noah I certainly don t intend to bother with that tiller until some reason for doing it arises We haven t any place to steer to yet we don t know where we are going Now my dear children be reasonable and don t worry me I ve had a very hard day of it and I feel my responsibilities keenly Just let me manage and we ll come out all right I ve had more experience than any of you and if A terrible crash interrupted the old lady s remarks The House boat shivered and shook careened way to one side and as quickly righted and stood still A mad rush up the gangway followed and in a moment a hundred and eighty three pale faced trembling women stood upon the deck gazing with horror at a great helpless hulk ten feet to the rear fastened by broken ropes and odd pieces of rigging to the stern posts of the House boat sinking slowly but surely into the sea It was the Gehenna The House boat had run her down and her last hour had come but thanks to the stanchness of her build and wonderful beam the floating club house had withstood the shock of the impact and now rode the waters as gracefully as ever Portia was the first to realize the extent of the catastrophe and in a short while chairs and life preservers and tables everything that could float had been tossed into the sea to the struggling immortals therein On board the Gehenna those who had not cast themselves into the waters under the cool direction of Holmes and Bonaparte calmly lowered the boats and in a short while were not only able to felicitate themselves upon their safety but had likewise the good fortune to rescue their more impetuous brethren who had preferred to swim for it Ultimately all were brought aboard the House boat in safety and the men in Hades were once more reunited to their wives daughters sisters and fiancees and Elizabeth had the satisfaction of once more saving the life of Raleigh by throwing him her ruff as she had done a year or so previously when she and her brother had been upset in the swift current of the river Styx Order and happiness being restored Holmes took command of the House boat and soon navigated her safely back into her old time berth The Gehenna went to the bottom and was never seen again and when the roll was called it was found that all who had set out upon her had returned in safety save Shylock Kidd Sir Henry Morgan and Abeuchapeta but even they were not lost for five weeks later these four worthies were found early one morning drifting slowly up the river Styx gazing anxiously out from the top of a water cask and yelling lustily for help And here endeth the chronicle of the pursuit of the good old House boat Back to her moorings the even tenor of her ways was once more resumed but with one slight difference The ladies became eligible for membership and availing themselves of the privilege began to think less and less of the advantages of being men and to rejoice that after all they were women and even Xanthippe and Socrates after that night of peril reconciled their differences and no longer quarrel as to which is the more entitled to wear the toga of authority It has become for them a divided skirt As for Kidd and his fellows they have never recovered from the effects of their fearful though short exile upon Holmes Island and are but shadows of their former shades whereas mister Sherlock Holmes has so endeared himself to his new found friends that he is quite as popular with them as he is with us who have yet to cross the dark river and be subjected to the scrutiny of the Committee on Membership at the House boat on the Styx Even Hawkshaw has been able to detect his genius End of Project Gutenberg s The Pursuit of the House Boat by John Bangs
