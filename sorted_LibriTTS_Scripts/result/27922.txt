2531_156718_000009_000000	train-clean-360	All the way there David had saved this moment for himself struggling not to peek until the proper time came 
2531_156718_000009_000001	train-clean-360	When the car finally stopped the rest of them got out stiffly and went into the new house 
2531_156724_000012_000001	train-clean-360	But 
2531_156718_000009_000002	train-clean-360	But David walked slowly into the back yard with his eyes fixed on the ground 
none	none	For a whole minute he stood there not daring to look up 
2531_156718_000009_000004	train-clean-360	Then he took a deep breath clenched his hands tightly and lifted his head 
none	none	There it was as Dad had described it but infinitely more grand 
2531_156718_000010_000001	train-clean-360	It swept upward from the valley floor beautifully shaped and soaring so tall that its misty blue peak could surely talk face to face with the stars 
none	none	To David who had never seen a mountain before the sight was almost too much to bear 
2531_156718_000010_000003	train-clean-360	He felt so tight and shivery inside that he didn t know whether he wanted to laugh or cry or both 
none	none	And the really wonderful thing about the mountain was the way it looked at him He was certain that it was smiling at him like an old friend who had been waiting for years to see him again 
2531_156718_000010_000006	train-clean-360	And when he closed his eyes he seemed to hear a voice which whispered Come along then and climb 
2531_156718_000011_000000	train-clean-360	It would be so easy to go 
2531_156718_000011_000001	train-clean-360	The back yard was hedged in with part of the hedge growing right across the toes of the mountain but there was a hole in the privet large enough to crawl through 
2531_156718_000011_000002	train-clean-360	And just beyond the hedge the mountainside awaited him going up and up in one smooth sweep until the green and tawny faded into hazy heights of rock 
2531_156718_000011_000003	train-clean-360	It was waiting for him 
2531_156718_000011_000004	train-clean-360	 Come and climb it whispered come and climb 
2531_156718_000012_000000	train-clean-360	But there was a great deal to do first 
none	none	They were going to move into the new house 
2531_156718_000012_000002	train-clean-360	The moving van was standing out in front the car must be unloaded 
none	none	David would be needed to carry things 
2531_156718_000012_000004	train-clean-360	Regretfully he waved his hand at the peak and whispered It shouldn t take long I ll be back as soon as I can Then he went around to the front door to see what could be done about speeding things up 
none	none	Illustration 
2531_156718_000014_000000	train-clean-360	Inside everything was in confusion 
2531_156718_000014_000001	train-clean-360	Dad was pushing chairs and tables around in an aimless way 
2531_156718_000014_000002	train-clean-360	Mother was saying They ll all have to go out again we forgot to put down the rug first Aunt Amy was making short dashes between the kitchen and the dining room muttering to herself 
none	none	And Beckie was roaring in her crib because it was time for her bottle 
2531_156718_000014_000004	train-clean-360	David asked Can I do anything hoping that the answer would be no 
2531_156718_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 C mere Aunt Amy said grabbing him by the arm 
2531_156718_000015_000001	train-clean-360	 Help me look for that ironing board 
2531_156718_000016_000000	train-clean-360	When the ironing board was finally located Mother had something for him to do 
2531_156718_000016_000001	train-clean-360	And when he was finished with that Dad called for his help 
2531_156718_000016_000002	train-clean-360	So the afternoon wore on without letup and also without any signs of progress in their moving 
2531_156718_000016_000003	train-clean-360	When David finally got a chance to sneak out for a breathing spell he felt his heart sink 
none	none	Somehow in all the rush and confusion the afternoon had disappeared 
2531_156718_000016_000005	train-clean-360	Already the evening sun was throwing shadows across the side of the mountain and touching its peak with a ruddy blaze 
2531_156720_000052_000002	train-clean-360	ready 
none	none	the evening sun was throwing shadows across the side of the mountain and touching its peak with a ruddy blaze 
2531_156718_000016_000006	train-clean-360	It was too late now 
2531_156718_000016_000007	train-clean-360	He would have to wait until morning before he could climb 
2531_156718_000017_000000	train-clean-360	As he gazed up miserably at the glowing summit he thought he saw a tiny speck soar out from it in a brief circle 
2531_156718_000017_000001	train-clean-360	Was it a bird of some sort or just one of those dots that swim before your eyes when you stare too long at the sky 
2531_156718_000017_000002	train-clean-360	It almost seemed like the mountain waving its hand as if to say that it was quite all right for him to wait until morning 
none	none	He felt better then and returned more cheerfully to the moving 
2531_156718_000018_000000	train-clean-360	It was long after dark before the moving van drove away 
2531_156718_000018_000001	train-clean-360	Beckie crooned happily over her bottle and the rest of them gathered in the kitchen for a late supper of sandwiches and canned soup 
2531_156718_000018_000002	train-clean-360	But David could not eat until he had found the courage to ask one question 
2531_156718_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 May I climb the mountain tomorrow 
2531_156718_000020_000000	train-clean-360	Aunt Amy muttered something about landslides which were firmly fixed in her mind as the fate of people who climbed mountains 
2531_156718_000020_000001	train-clean-360	But Dad said I don t see why not do you and looked to Mother for agreement 
2531_156718_000021_000000	train-clean-360	Mother said Well be very careful in a doubtful tone and that was that 
2531_156724_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Well 
none	none	be very careful in a doubtful tone and that was that 
2531_156718_000022_000000	train-clean-360	You never know what you will find when you climb a mountain even if you have climbed them before which of course David never had Looking up from the foot of the mountain he had thought that it was a smooth slope from bottom to top 
2531_156718_000022_000001	train-clean-360	But he was discovering as he climbed that it was not smooth at all but very much broken up 
2531_156718_000022_000002	train-clean-360	There were terraces ledges knolls ravines and embankments one after another 
2531_156718_000022_000003	train-clean-360	The exciting part of it was that each feature concealed the ones above it 
2531_156718_000022_000004	train-clean-360	At the top of a rise would be an outcropping of strangely colored rock invisible from below 
none	none	Beyond the outcropping a small stand of aspens would quiver in the breeze their quicksilver leaves hiding a tiny meadow on the slope behind 
2531_156718_000022_000006	train-clean-360	And when the meadow had been discovered there would be a something else beyond 
2531_156718_000022_000007	train-clean-360	He was a real explorer now 
2531_156718_000022_000008	train-clean-360	When he got to the top he thought he would build a little tower of stones the way explorers always do 
none	none	But at the end of two hours steady climbing he was ready to admit that he would never reach the peak that day It still rose above his head seeming as far distant as ever 
2531_156718_000023_000002	train-clean-360	But he did not care now 
none	none	It had been a glorious climb and the distance he had already covered was a considerable one 
2531_156718_000023_000004	train-clean-360	He looked back 
none	none	The town looked like a model of a town with little toy houses and different colored roofs among the trees that made a darker patch on the pattern of the valley floor The mountains on the other side of the valley seemed like blue clouds stretching out over the edge of the world 
2531_156718_000023_000007	train-clean-360	Even the peak could not give him a better view than this 
none	none	David gazed up the face of a scarp which rose like a cliff above him a smooth bare wall of rock that had halted his climb 
2531_156718_000024_000001	train-clean-360	Halfway up the scarp was a dark horizontal line of bushes something like a hedge 
none	none	Apparently there was a ledge or shelf there and he decided to climb up to it before he returned home 
2531_156718_000024_000003	train-clean-360	To scale the rock face itself was impossible however there were no hand or foot holds 
none	none	So he turned and made his way through the grass until he reached the end of the bare stone 
2531_156718_000024_000005	train-clean-360	Then he started upward again 
none	none	It was hard work 
2531_156718_000024_000007	train-clean-360	Vines clutched at his feet and the close set bushes seemed unwilling to let him pass 
2531_156718_000024_000008	train-clean-360	He had one nasty slip which might have been his last if he had not grabbed a tough clump of weeds at the crucial instant 
2531_156718_000025_000000	train-clean-360	But oh it was worth it 
2531_156724_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 oh 
none	none	it was worth it He felt like shouting when at last he reached the ledge 
2531_156718_000025_000002	train-clean-360	Truly it was an enchanted place 
none	none	It was a long level strip of ground several yards wide carpeted with short grass and dandelions Bushes grew along most of the outer edge The inner edge was bounded by a second scarp a wall of red stone with sparkling points of light imbedded in its smooth surface 
2531_156718_000026_000000	train-clean-360	David threw himself on the grass and rolled in it 
2531_156718_000026_000001	train-clean-360	It was warm and soft and sweet smelling it soothed away the hurt of his aching muscles and the sting of his scratches 
none	none	He rolled over on his back and cushioned his head in his hands The sky seemed to be slipping along overhead like a broad blue river The breeze ruffled his hair and whispered the bushes murmured and gossiped to each other Even the sunlight seemed to hum to him as it laid warm hands on his face But there was another sound which now and then rose above these murmurs 
2531_156718_000027_000001	train-clean-360	Then it would fade and be drowned out by the breeze 
none	none	Hard to say why but it just did not seem to fit there 
2531_156718_000027_000003	train-clean-360	David propped himself up on his elbows and listened more intently 
none	none	The sound faded he had been imagining it No he had not been imagining it there it was again 
2531_156718_000027_000006	train-clean-360	He sat up 
2531_156718_000027_000007	train-clean-360	Now he noticed that the ledge was divided by a thicket which grew from the inner side to the outer 
2531_156724_000055_000003	train-clean-360	The noise 
2531_156718_000027_000008	train-clean-360	The noise whatever it was came from the other side of the thicket 
2531_156718_000028_000000	train-clean-360	David s curiosity was aroused but it occurred to him that it might be wise to be cautious 
2531_156718_000028_000001	train-clean-360	The noise did not sound dangerous but well he had never been up a mountain before and there was no telling what he might find 
2531_156718_000028_000002	train-clean-360	He dropped into a crouch and crept silently up to the tangle of bushes 
2531_156718_000028_000003	train-clean-360	His heart began to pound and he swallowed to relieve the dryness in his throat 
none	none	The noise was much more distinct now and it sounded like like
2531_156720_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 yes 
none	none	not only sounded like but was someone talking to himself 
2531_156718_000029_000000	train-clean-360	Who could it possibly be 
2531_156718_000029_000001	train-clean-360	Well there was only one way to find out 
2531_156718_000030_000000	train-clean-360	He dropped down on his stomach and carefully began to worm his way under the thicket 
none	none	The branches grew very low and the ground was full of lumps and knobs which dug into him with every movement There were vines too and some prickly things like thistles which had to be pushed out of the way without allowing their leaves to rustle He progressed by inches pushing with his toes pulling with his finger tips wriggling with the rest of his body At last he could see light breaking through the foliage in front of him he was nearing the other side A bunch of leaves hung before his face He hesitated then pushed them aside gently slowly and peered out He thought his heart would stop Illustration two In Which David Meets the Phoenix and There Is a Change in Plans Illustration There stood an enormous bird David had been to the zoo and at home he had a book of birds with colored pictures He knew the more common large birds of the world the ostrich the condor the albatross eagles cranes storks But this bird Its shape was like that of an eagle but stouter Its neck had the length and elegant curve of a swan s neck Its head was again like an eagle s with a hooked bird of prey beak but the expression in its brown eyes was mild The long wings were blunt at the tips the tail was short and broad The legs feathered halfway down ended in taloned feet An iridescent sheen sparkled on its plumage reflecting sunlight from the scarlet crest the golden neck and back the breast of silver the sapphire wings and tail Its size alone would have been enough to take David s breath away He could have stood beneath the arch of that neck with room to spare But the most astonishing thing was that the bird had an open book on the ground and was apparently trying to learn part of it by heart Vivo vives vive the bird read very slowly and distinctly staring hard at the book Vivimos vivis viven That is simple enough you blockhead Now then without looking It cleared its throat looked away from the book and repeated in a rapid mutter Vivo vives vive vi ah vivi oh dear what is the matter with me Here the temptation to peek overcame it for an instant and its head wavered But it said No no in a firm tone looked carefully the other way and began once more Vivo vives vive quite correct so far Ah vi ah Oh dear these verbs Where was I Oh yes Vivo David s head reeled as he watched this amazing performance There was no need to pinch himself to see if he were dreaming he was perfectly wide awake Everything else around him was behaving in a normal way The mountain was solid beneath him the sunlight streamed down as before Yet there was the bird unmistakably before him undeniably studying its book and speaking to itself David s mind caught hold of a phrase and repeated it over and over again What on earth What on earth But of course there was no answer to that question And he might have lain hidden there all day staring out at the bird and marveling had it not been for a bee which came droning into the thicket straight for him He had a horror of bees ever since he had once bumped into a hive by mistake When he heard that dread sound approaching his whole body broke into a sweat All thought of the bird was immediately driven from his head He could tell from the noise that it was one of those big black and yellow fuzzy bees the ones with the nasty dispositions Perhaps the thought paralyzed him perhaps he was lying on its nest On it came buzzing and blundering through the leaves Suddenly it was upon him so close that he could feel the tiny breeze stirred up by its wings All self control vanished He beat at it wildly with his hands burst out of the thicket like an explosion and smashed full tilt into the bird before he could stop himself With a piercing squawk the bird shot into the air flipped over and came fluttering down facing him talons outstretched hooked beak open eyes a glare Completely terrified David turned and bolted for the thicket He managed to thrash halfway through when a vine trapped his feet He pitched forward shielding his face with his arms and was caught up short by a dead branch snagging his shirt He was stuck This was the end He closed his eyes and waited too numb with fear to think or cry out Nothing happened Slowly he turned his head around The bird although it still glared menacingly seemed undecided whether to attack or flee What may I ask are you doing here it said at last in a severe voice I I I was taking a walk David said faintly I m awfully sorry if I bothered you or anything You should not have come up here at all the bird snapped Illustration Well I m really sorry But there was a bee in the bush here I I didn t mean to The fright had been too much Tears started in David s eyes and his lip began to tremble The bird seemed reassured for its manner visibly softened It lowered and folded its wings and the glare faded from its eyes I d go away David mumbled apologetically only I m stuck He rubbed his eyes on his sleeve The bird looked at his dismal face and began to fidget awkwardly There there it said I had no intention of I am afraid that I Stuck did you say Very easily mended my dear fellow Merely a question of Here let me look It crashed through the thicket to where David was caught and thrust its head down through the branches Its muffled voice came floating up Take heart There seems to be
2531_156724_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 aha 
none	none	just so One moment please bit of vine there we are There was a snapping sound from below and David s foot was released He unstuck the snag from his shirt pushed his way out of the thicket and sat down weakly on the grass Whew At least the bird was not going to harm him It seemed to be quite a kindly creature really He had just frightened it and made it angry by bursting out of the bushes so suddenly He heard a flailing in the thicket followed by the bird s anxious voice Hello Are you still there Yes What There were more sounds of struggle This is rather awkward I the fact is I am afraid that I am stuck myself Could you Yes of course said David He smiled to himself a little shakily and re entered the thicket When he had disentangled the bird the two of them sat down on the grass and looked at each other They hesitated not quite sure
2531_156724_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 how 
none	none	to begin I trust said the bird at last that you are not of a scientific turn of mind
2531_156720_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t know 
none	none	said David I m interested in things if that s what you mean No it is not There is a great deal of difference between the interest shown by normal people and the obsessive interest of scientists You are not I hope acquainted with any scientists No Ah said the bird with a relieved sigh Everything is quite all right then I do hope that you will forgive my behavior I am not usually so rude The fact is that you gave me quite a horrible start Oh I m sorry I frightened you Frightened my dear fellow said the bird testily I am never frightened I do not know the meaning of the word What I mean is David said quickly that you frightened me This seemed to pacify the bird and David to heighten the good impression added Golly you looked fierce The bird smiled complacently I can rise to a terrifying ferocity when aroused A noble strain of fighting blood courses through my veins Not that I go out of my way to seek quarrels you understand On the contrary Peaceful could well describe my general attitude Meditative I am usually to be found Thinking I have a powerful intellect No doubt you have noticed the stamp of genius on my brow David supposed that the bird meant its scarlet crest and he nodded That s one of the first things I noticed about you Indeed cried the bird delightedly You are certainly more alert than most But as I was saying I am usually to be found Thinking The first condition of Thinking is solitude And that I fear is a desideratum most difficult of realization I beg your pardon People explained the bird do not leave you alone
2531_156724_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh said David 
none	none	He flushed thinking that the words had been aimed at him and began to get up But the bird signaled him to remain where he was I do not mean you my dear fellow I assure you that I am delighted to make your acquaintance It is all the others Do you know that I have spent the greater part of my life being pursued I was chased out of Egypt like a common game bird Out of the mountains of Greece too The hills of Lebanon the desert of Africa the Arabian wilds no matter where I fled people would come prying and peering and sneaking after me I have tried Tibet China and the steppes of Siberia with the same result At last I heard of a region where there was peace where the inhabitants let each other alone Here I thought I should Pardon me for interrupting Where Why here to be brief said the bird waving its wing toward the valley Here I thought I should be able to breathe At my age one likes a little quiet Would you believe that I am close to five hundred years old Golly said David You don t look it The bird gave a pleased laugh My

none	none	physical condition does conceal my years At any rate I settled here in the hope of being left alone But do you think I was safe David seeing that he was supposed to answer no shook his head Quite right sighed the bird I was not I had been here no more than three months when a Scientist was hot on my trail A most disagreeable fellow always sneaking about with binoculars a camera and I fear a gun That is why you startled me for an instant I thought you were he Oh David cried I m awfully sorry I didn t bother you on purpose It s just that I never saw a mountain before so I climbed up here to see what one looked like You climbed up here Yes Climbed said the bird looking very thoughtful Climbed I might have known It proves you see that the same thing could be done again by someone older and stronger A very grave point Oh I see said David You mean the Precisely The Scientist He is I fear very persistent I first noticed him over there the bird waved its wing toward the opposite side of the valley so I removed to this location But he will undoubtedly continue his pursuit The bad penny always turns up It will not be long before the sharp scientific nose is again quivering in my direction Oh dear that s terrible Your sympathy touches me said the bird huskily It is most unusual to find someone who understands But have no fear for me I am taking steps I am preparing Imagine his disappointment when he arrives here and finds me flown from the nest I am to be brief leaving Do you see this book Yes said David I heard you reading it but I couldn t understand it Is it magic No my boy it is Spanish I have chosen a little spot chilly but isolated in the Andes Mountains South America you know And of course one must be prepared I am learning Spanish so that I shall be able to make my way about in South America I must admit my extreme reluctance to depart I have become very fond of this ledge It is exactly suited to my needs ideal climate magnificent view They fell into a lengthy silence The bird gazed sadly out over the valley and David rested his chin in his hands and thought The mystery was clearing up The bird s presence on the mountain and the fact that it had been reading a book were explained And so natural was its speech that David found himself accepting it as nothing unusual The thing that worried him now was that the bird would soon leave Here they had only just met and already the promise of a most interesting friendship was dissolving The bird had taken time to talk to him and explain things to him as though he were an equal And although he did not understand many of the long words it used he felt pleased at being spoken to as though he did understand And the bird knew all about faraway countries had visited them and lived in them and had adventures in them for almost five hundred years Oh there were so many things David wanted to know and ask about But the bird was leaving If only he could persuade it to stay even for a short while He could try anyhow after all the bird had said itself that it did not want to go Bird He stopped and flushed It was hard to put into words Your servant my boy Well I I don t believe I know your name David stammered unable to get the real question out Ah forgive me cried the bird jumping up Permit me the honor of presenting myself I daresay my name is familiar to you celebrated as it is in song and story I am the one and only the Unique Phoenix And the Phoenix bowed deeply Very glad to meet you said David I m David Delighted my dear fellow An honor and a pleasure They shook hand and wing solemnly Now as you were saying Well Phoenix I was just thinking David stammered It s too bad I mean couldn t you it would be nice if we Well do you really have to go to South America It would be nice if you d stay a while until the Scientist shows up anyway and I like talking with you His face burned It seemed like a lot to ask The Phoenix harrumphed several times in its throat and shuffled its feet Really I cannot tell you how how much you well really such a delightful request Ah harrumph Perhaps it can be arranged Oh Phoenix David threw his arms around the bird s neck and then unable to restrain himself any longer turned a somersault on the grass But for the present it seems to be getting late said the Phoenix We shall talk it over some other time and decide Golly it is late I hadn t noticed Well I ll have to go or they ll worry about me at home But I can come up and see you tomorrow can t I
2531_156720_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course my boy 
none	none	In the bustle of morning in the hush of noon in the ah to be brief at any time And I ll bring you some cookies if you like Ah said the Phoenix closing its eyes Sugar cookies by any chance it asked faintly David noticed the feathers of its throat jumping up and down with rapid swallowing motions I ll ask Aunt Amy to make some tonight
2531_156724_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Ah splendid my boy 
none	none	Splendid Shall we say not more than ah that is not less than ah fifteen All right Phoenix My Aunt Amy keeps a big jar full of cookies and I can have as many as I like The Phoenix took David s arm and together they strolled to the other end of the ledge Now don t mention this to anyone but there is an old goat trail down this side It is somewhat grown over but eyes as sharp as yours should have no trouble with it It will make your travels up and down easier Another thing I trust you will not make known our rendezvous Our what You will not tell anyone that I am here Oh no I won t say a word Well I ll see you tomorrow Yes As the French so cleverly say it ah well to be brief good by my boy Until tomorrow then David waved his hand found the goat trail and started down He was too happy even to whistle so he contented himself with running whenever he found a level place And when he reached home he stood on his hands in the back yard for two whole seconds Illustration three In Which It Is Decided that David Should Have an Education and an Experiment Is Made Illustration 
2531_156720_000003_000000	train-clean-360	Next day it took less than an hour to reach the ledge and David was sure that he could shorten the time even more when he was familiar with the goat trail 
2531_156720_000004_000000	train-clean-360	The Phoenix was not in sight when he arrived and for an instant David was stricken with fright 
none	none	Had the bird gone in spite of its promise But no he heard a reassuring noise 
2531_156720_000004_000002	train-clean-360	It came from the thicket and it sounded very much like a snore 
2531_156720_000005_000000	train-clean-360	David smiled to himself and shouted Hello Phoenix 
2531_156720_000006_000000	train-clean-360	There was a thrashing sound in the thicket and the Phoenix appeared looking very rumpled and yawning behind its wing 
none	none	Greetings my boy it cried A splendid morning Then the Phoenix caught sight of the paper bag in David s hand and swallowed in a suggestive way 
2531_156720_000008_000000	train-clean-360	David thrust the bag of cookies behind his back 
2531_156720_000008_000001	train-clean-360	 Now Phoenix he said firmly you have to promise me you won t go away to South America 
none	none	You said last night that it could be arranged so let s arrange it right now Until we do not one 
2531_156720_000009_000000	train-clean-360	The Phoenix drew itself up indignantly 
none	none	My very dear fellow it said you wound me 
2531_156720_000009_000002	train-clean-360	You cut me to the quick 
none	none	I will not be bribed I 
2531_156720_000009_000004	train-clean-360	It stopped and swallowed again 
2531_156720_000009_000005	train-clean-360	 Oh well it continued more mildly one does not fight fate does one 
none	none	I suppose under these circumstances I must accept It s settled then David cried joyfully 
2531_156720_000011_000000	train-clean-360	So they sat down on the grass together and for a long time nothing was heard but sounds of munching 
2531_156720_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 My boy said the Phoenix at last brushing the crumbs from its chest I take a modest pride in my way with words but nothing in the language can do these ah baked poems justice 
none	none	Words fail me
2531_156720_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 I m glad you like them David said politely 
2531_156720_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 And now my boy continued the Phoenix as it settled back comfortably I have been thinking 
2531_156720_000014_000001	train-clean-360	Yesterday you showed an intelligent interest in my problems and asked intelligent questions You did not scoff as others might have done 
2531_156720_000014_000002	train-clean-360	You have very rare qualities 
none	none	David flushed and mumbled denials
2531_156720_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Do not be so modest my boy 
2531_156720_000016_000001	train-clean-360	I speak the truth 
2531_156720_000016_000002	train-clean-360	It came to me that such a mind as yours having these qualities should be further cultivated and refined 
2531_156720_000016_000003	train-clean-360	And I should be avoiding my clear cut duty if I did not take this task in hand myself 
2531_156720_000016_000004	train-clean-360	Of course I suppose some attempt to educate you has already been made has it not 
2531_156720_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Well I go to school if that s what you mean 
none	none	Not now though because it s summer vacation
2531_156720_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 And what do they teach you there 
2531_156720_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh reading and writing and arithmetic and things like that 
2531_156720_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Aha said the Phoenix triumphantly 
2531_156720_000020_000001	train-clean-360	 Just as I suspected a classical education 
2531_156720_000020_000002	train-clean-360	Understand me I have nothing against a classical education as such 
2531_156720_000020_000003	train-clean-360	I realize that mathematics Greek and Latin are excellent for the discipline of the mind 
2531_156720_000020_000004	train-clean-360	But in the broad view a classical education is not a true education 
2531_156720_000020_000005	train-clean-360	Life is real life is earnest 
none	none	One must face it with a practical education 
2531_156720_000020_000007	train-clean-360	The problems of Life my dear fellow classical education completely ignores them 
2531_156720_000020_000008	train-clean-360	For example how do you tell a true Unicorn from a false one 
2531_156720_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 I I don t know 
2531_156720_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 I thought not 
2531_156720_000022_000001	train-clean-360	Where do you find the Philosopher s Stone 
none	none	I don t know Well then I shall ask a simple one 
2531_156720_000024_000001	train-clean-360	What is the first rule of defense when attacked by a Chimera 
none	none	David squirmed uncomfortably
2531_156720_000025_000001	train-clean-360	 I m afraid I don t know that either he said in a small voice 
2531_156720_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 There you are cried the Phoenix 
2531_156720_000026_000001	train-clean-360	 You do not have a true practical education you are not ready for Life 
none	none	I my boy am going to take your education in hand Oh said David
2531_156720_000027_000001	train-clean-360	 Do you mean are you going to give me lessons Through his mind flashed a picture of the Phoenix with spectacles on its beak and a ruler in its wing writing out sentences on a blackboard 
2531_156720_000027_000002	train-clean-360	The thought gave him a sinking feeling 
2531_156720_000027_000003	train-clean-360	After all it was summer and summer was supposed to be vacation time 
none	none	And what an education it will be the Phoenix went on ignoring his question
2531_156720_000028_000001	train-clean-360	 Absolutely without equal 
2531_156720_000028_000002	train-clean-360	The full benefit of my vast knowledge plus a number of trips to 
none	none	Oh traveling said David suddenly feeling much better
2531_156720_000029_000001	train-clean-360	 That s different 
2531_156720_000029_000002	train-clean-360	Oh Phoenix that ll be wonderful 
2531_156720_000029_000003	train-clean-360	Where will we go 
none	none	Everywhere my boy said the Phoenix with an airy wave of its wing To all corners of the earth 
2531_156720_000030_000001	train-clean-360	We shall visit my friends and acquaintances 
2531_156720_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh do you have 
none	none	Of course my boy I am nothing if not a good mixer My acquaintances to mention but a few include Fauns Dragons Unicorns Trolls Gryffins Gryffons Gryffens Excuse me David interrupted
2531_156720_000033_000001	train-clean-360	 What were those last three please 
2531_156720_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 Gryffins explained the Phoenix are the small reddish friendly ones 
2531_156720_000034_000001	train-clean-360	Gryffons are the quick tempered proud ones 
none	none	Gryffens ah well the most anyone can say for them is that they are harmless 
2531_156720_000034_000003	train-clean-360	They are very stupid 
2531_156720_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 I see said David doubtfully 
2531_156720_000035_000001	train-clean-360	 What do they look like 
none	none	Each looks like the others my boy except that some are bigger and some are smaller 
2531_156720_000036_000001	train-clean-360	But to continue Sea Monsters Leprechauns Rocs Gnomes Elves Basilisks Nymphs ah and many others 
none	none	All are of the Better Sort since as I have many times truly observed one is known by the company one keeps 
2531_156720_000036_000003	train-clean-360	And your education will cost you nothing 
2531_156720_000040_000001	train-clean-360	your education will 
none	none	cost you nothing Of course it would be agreeable if you could supply me with cookies from time to time
2531_156720_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 As many as you want Phoenix 
2531_156720_000037_000001	train-clean-360	Will we go to Africa 
none	none	Naturally my boy 
2531_156720_000038_000001	train-clean-360	Your education will include 
none	none	And Egypt And China 
2531_156720_000039_000002	train-clean-360	And Arabia 
none	none	Yes Your education will
2531_156720_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh Phoenix Phoenix David jumped up and began to caper while the Phoenix beamed 
2531_156720_000041_000001	train-clean-360	But suddenly he stopped 
2531_156720_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 How are we going to travel Phoenix 
none	none	I have wings my boy
2531_156720_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes but I don t 
2531_156720_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 Do not be so dense my dear fellow 
2531_156720_000045_000001	train-clean-360	I shall carry you on my back of course 
2531_156720_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 on my back 
none	none	of course Oh said David weakly on your on your back 
2531_156720_000046_000001	train-clean-360	Are you sure that isn t there some other I mean can you do it 
2531_156720_000047_000000	train-clean-360	The Phoenix drew itself up to its full height 
2531_156720_000047_000001	train-clean-360	 I am hurt yes deeply hurt by your lack of faith 
none	none	My magnificent build should make it evident that I am an exceedingly powerful flyer In the heyday of my youth I could fly around the world in five hours But come along 
2531_156720_000047_000005	train-clean-360	I shall give you proof positive 
2531_156720_000048_000000	train-clean-360	David reluctantly followed the Phoenix to a spot on the edge of the shelf where there was a gap in the bushes 
2531_156720_000048_000001	train-clean-360	He glanced over the brink The sheer face of the scarp fell away beneath them plunging down to the tiny trees and rocks below 
2531_156720_000048_000002	train-clean-360	He stepped back quickly with a shudder 
2531_156720_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 Let s let s do it tomorrow he quavered 
none	none	Nonsense said the Phoenix firmly
2531_156720_000050_000001	train-clean-360	 No time like the present 
none	none	Now then up on my back H h how am I going to sit On my back Quite so now your arms around my neck your legs behind my wings please there we are Ready
2531_156720_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 No said David faintly 
none	none	Splendid 
2531_156720_000054_000001	train-clean-360	The proof is to be demonstrated the to be brief we are off 
2531_156720_000055_000000	train-clean-360	The great wings were outstretched 
none	none	David gulped clutched the Phoenix s neck tightly and shut his eyes 
2531_156720_000055_000002	train-clean-360	He felt a hopping sensation then a long sickening downward swoop that seemed to leave his stomach far behind 
2531_156720_000055_000003	train-clean-360	A tremendous rush of air snatched at his shirt 
2531_156720_000055_000004	train-clean-360	He opened his eyes and choked with fright 
none	none	The ground below was rushing up to meet them swaying and revolving Something was terribly wrong 
2531_156720_000055_000007	train-clean-360	The Phoenix was breathing in hoarse gasps its wings were pounding the air frantically 
none	none	Now they had turned back 
2531_156720_000055_000009	train-clean-360	The scarp loomed before them solid and blank 
2531_156720_000055_000010	train-clean-360	Above them high above them was the ledge 
2531_156720_000055_000011	train-clean-360	It looked as though they would not get back to it 
2531_156720_000056_000000	train-clean-360	Up up up 
2531_156720_000056_000001	train-clean-360	They crawled through the air 
2531_156720_000056_000002	train-clean-360	The wings flapped wildly faster and faster 
2531_156720_000056_000003	train-clean-360	They were gaining slipping back gaining again 
2531_156720_000056_000004	train-clean-360	The Phoenix sobbed as it stretched its neck in the last effort Fifty feet twenty feet ten 
none	none	With a tremendous surge of its wings the Phoenix managed to get one claw over the edge and to seize the branch of a bush in its beak 
2531_156720_000056_000006	train-clean-360	David s legs slipped from the bird s back 
2531_156720_000056_000007	train-clean-360	He dangled over the abyss from the outstretched neck and prayed 
2531_156720_000056_000008	train-clean-360	The bush saved them 
none	none	They scrabbled up over the edge tottered there for an instant and dropped on the grass For a long time they lay gasping and trembling 
2531_156720_000058_000000	train-clean-360	At last the Phoenix weakly raised its head 
none	none	Puff well my boy puff puff whew very narrow squeak 
2531_156720_000058_000002	train-clean-360	I puff 
none	none	Illustration David could not answer 
2531_156720_000060_000001	train-clean-360	The earth reeled under him and would not stop no matter how tightly he clutched the grass 
2531_156720_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 Puff I repeat I am puff an exceedingly powerful flyer 
none	none	There are few birds none I daresay who puff could have done even this much 
2531_156720_000061_000002	train-clean-360	The truth of the matter is that you are a lot puff heavier than you look 
2531_156720_000061_000003	train-clean-360	I hope you are not being overfed at home 
none	none	I I don t know said David wondering whether or not he was going to be sick
2531_156720_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 Well my course is clear said the Phoenix firmly 
2531_156720_000063_000001	train-clean-360	 I must practice Setting up exercises roadwork and what not 
2531_156720_000063_000002	train-clean-360	Rigorous diet 
2531_156720_000063_000003	train-clean-360	Lots of sleep 
none	none	Regular hours 
2531_156720_000063_000005	train-clean-360	Courage my dear fellow 
2531_156720_000063_000006	train-clean-360	We shall do it yet 
none	none	And so for the following week the Phoenix practiced Every morning David climbed up to the ledge bringing sandwiches for himself cookies for the Phoenix and a wet towel Then while he kept count the Phoenix did setting up exercises 
2531_156720_000065_000002	train-clean-360	After this the bird would jog trot up and down the ledge and practice jumping 
2531_156720_000065_000003	train-clean-360	Then there would be a fifteen minute rest and refreshment period 
none	none	And when that was over the Phoenix would launch itself into the air 
2531_156720_000065_000005	train-clean-360	This was the part David liked best 
2531_156720_000065_000006	train-clean-360	It was a magnificent sight 
2531_156720_000065_000007	train-clean-360	The Phoenix dashed back and forth at top speed wheeled in circles shot straight up like a rocket plunged hovered looped rolled soared fluttered 
2531_156720_000065_000008	train-clean-360	Now and then it would swoop back to the ledge beside David and wipe the sweat from its brow 
2531_156720_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 I trust you see signs of progress my boy 
2531_156720_000067_000000	train-clean-360	David would wrap the wet towel around the Phoenix s neck 
2531_156720_000067_000001	train-clean-360	 You re doing better and better Phoenix 
none	none	I especially like that part where you twist over on your back and loop and plunge all at the same time
2531_156720_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 I do perform that rather well don t I 
none	none	It is not easy 
2531_156720_000068_000002	train-clean-360	But just the thing for acquiring ouch muscle tone

2531_156720_000070_000000	train-clean-360	At the end of the week the Phoenix after a brilliant display of acrobatics landed on the ledge clasped its wings behind its back and looked solemnly at David

none	none	four In Which David and the Phoenix Go To Visit the Gryffins and a Great Danger Is Narrowly Averted Illustration A chill raced up and down David s spine as he got to his feet Do do you think a week s practice is enough Absolutely my dear fellow I am now in the very pink of condition Not that I was ever out of condition mind you It was merely that I ah well to be brief my boy I am now ready Yes but well you remember the last time Yes Look here if it will make you feel better suppose we have a trial flight along the ledge Well all right David got up as before on the Phoenix s back The Phoenix spread its wings and hopped into the air They glided easily down the length of the ledge clearing the thicket in the middle by a good two feet There you are my boy said the bird proudly as they landed at the other end Shall we go Let s go said David as bravely as he could They were in the air again Once more he felt that rush of wind against his face and heard the pounding of wings But this time there was no giddy downward swoop He breathed again and opened his eyes The world was falling away and everything on it was growing smaller by the second The valley could be cradled in two hands the mountains on either side looked like wrinkles in gray cloth Now he could see plains in the distance and little silver threads of rivers As he looked the whole world began to revolve slowly The Phoenix was soaring in a wide circle Well my boy it called over its shoulder whom shall we visit first It s really up to you Phoenix David shouted back but how about the the Biffens or Whiffens or whatever you called them You mean the Gryffins Gryffons and Gryffens my boy Very well We shall visit the Gryffins only however It is best to leave the others alone The Phoenix swung around and began to fly toward the morning sun with such tremendous speed that David had to crouch down to avoid being blown off The wind screamed past his ears tore at his shirt and hair and made his eyes brim over with tears It was cold but he was too excited to care Below them plains rivers forests and cities rushed across the face of the earth This is wonderful Phoenix David shouted The Phoenix s reply was not clear normal speed air stream prime days of my youth were the only words David caught but he could tell from the tone that the Phoenix was pleased The view below was not to last long Within half an hour they had run into a heavy overcast and for a long time it was like flying through very wet cold cotton David glanced down hoping to see the fog thin out Suddenly he caught sight of a black object rocketing up toward them Before he could call out a warning the thing hurtled by so close that its backwash very nearly knocked him from the bird s back The Phoenix reduced speed and the black object after banking in a wide curve came cruising up alongside David was amazed to see that it was a pale but beautiful lady dressed all in black sitting on a broom Hello Phoenix she cried in a teasing voice I haven t seen you in ever so long Illustration Good morning I am sure the Phoenix replied stiffly staring straight ahead Phoenix the lady continued coaxingly I m awfully bored Won t you race me Please Idle hands find mischief to do said the Phoenix severely We are making good use of our time and I suggest that you do the same Don t be so stuffy Phoenix She pouted Come and race with me I ve got a new broom and I want to see how good it is Please No said the Phoenix sharply Oh all right for you she said tossing her head You just don t dare because you know I ll beat your tail feathers off And she shot back into the mist below Indeed the Phoenix snorted Beat my tail feathers off Ha Is she a Witch David asked Yes my boy and a shocking example of the decline of the younger generation She will come to no good end believe me Tail feathers indeed Just then they burst out of the clouds and into the hot sunlight Below them the land was wild and desolate a vast rolling plain covered for the most part with dry tawny grass Here and there were groves of trees drooping beneath the sun The Phoenix still snorting indignantly to itself dropped to within a hundred feet of the ground They began to soar back and forth Can you see anything my boy David had never seen a Gryffin of course so he was not sure what to look for But he caught sight of something lying in the shade of a bush and pointed it out to the Phoenix Ah quite so the Phoenix said doubtfully It does not look like a but we can take a closer look They landed and walked toward the bush In its shadow sprawled a very untidy animal Its tail and hindquarters were exactly like those of a panther its chest and forelegs were like a hawk s and it had pointed wings Burrs matted its dusty fur Its claws were shabby and split and numerous black flies were crawling over its haunches The bush trembled with its snoring Bah We are wasting our time here my boy This is a Gryffen A disgusting brute isn t it And the Phoenix sniffed disapprovingly Maybe if we wake it up David suggested it could tell us where the other ones live Next to impossible For one thing a cannon could not awaken the beast For another thing it would not even if awake be able to tell us anything You simply cannot imagine the stupidity of these brutes Well let s try it anyway David said Very well my boy But it will be a complete waste of time The Phoenix shrugged its shoulders stepped up to the Gryffen and kicked it violently Phoenix David cried in alarm Don t hurt it No fear said the Phoenix delivering another lusty kick One simply cannot damage a sleeping Gryffen Give me a hand my boy David took hold of the Gryffen s wing and the Phoenix seized its tail For the next ten minutes they kicked and pulled and pounded shouting HEY and WAKE UP at the top of their lungs It was hot work and David finally admitted to himself that the Phoenix had been right But before he could say so the Phoenix completely lost its temper and savagely bit the Gryffen s tail That did it The Gryffen opened one eye halfway and said Unffniph GET UP the Phoenix bellowed The Gryffen struggled into a sitting position and yawned a tremendous and noisy yawn Then it squinted blearily at David and murmured What day is it Illustration Wednesday David said Could you please tell us Oh Wednesday said the Gryffen It thought about this for a while mumbling Wednesday Wednesday to itself It lifted one leg as if to scratch the fly bites changed its mind in mid gesture and dropped the leg again Oh Wednesday it said at last So it isn t Saturday No said David What we want to know is Not Saturday said the Gryffen sinking down to the ground with a huge sigh of relief Ah Come back on Saturday Saturday afternoon I generally get up on Saturday in the afternoon The words faded into a snore There you are my dear fellow said the Phoenix Just as I said Oaf Boor A very annoying animal said David angrily I agree my boy But the Gryffins are different I assure you Now let me see Where should we look There they come David cried suddenly Look And indeed a number of winged creatures were loping down a hillside toward them Good heavens the Phoenix shouted Those are the ones we do not want to meet On my back quick What are they David gasped as he threw himself on the bird s back Gryffons The Phoenix rushed along the ground a few feet and sprang into the air But it was too late The foremost Gryffons with powerful strokes of their wings shot up to meet them The Phoenix swerved sharply They missed the snapping beak of the first Gryffon by half an inch and dodged the second only to smash into a third David was stunned by the blow and the fall When he regained consciousness he found himself in the tight grip of two Gryffons The Phoenix was struggling feebly with another and still more were crowding around them screaming like hawks They looked like the sleeping Gryffen but were as large as ponies Their eyes were yellow and unblinking and their tails twitched like an angry cat s Their smell like the lion house in the zoo made David feel faint Well Phoenix said the largest Gryffon coldly you know the Rule I believe The Phoenix smiled weakly and cleared its throat Ah there Gryffon it said unsteadily Fancy meeting you here Ah ah rule What rule Rule twenty six said the Gryffon No human being shall be allowed to enter the Oh that rule said the Phoenix with a careless laugh I thought everyone knew that the Council of nineteen thirty five had changed it Can it be that you have not yet heard That won t do Phoenix You have also heard of course of the penalty for breaking the Rule which you must suffer along with this human boy Now one moment my dear Gryffon I ah Death The Phoenix quailed and David s legs went limp under him But they had no chance to plead with the Gryffons Their captors formed two lines one on each side of them and at a scream of command from the leader all began to march The Gryffon that had been holding the Phoenix winked horribly at David and made a throat cutting gesture with its wing Courage my boy the Phoenix whispered It is always darkest before dawn Presently they reached a hillside David and the Phoenix were marched up to a cave and thrown in Two of the Gryffons sat down at the entrance to guard them while the others went off to consider the best method of carrying out the penalty David was terribly frightened now but he did not want to let the Phoenix know it In a voice which trembled a little he asked What are we going to do The Phoenix frowned Do not be downcast my boy My brain is equal to any occasion I shall Think Silence please And the Phoenix covering its eyes with one wing Thought To keep himself occupied David explored the cave But there was nothing to see The cave was small and bare He tested the walls thoroughly to see if there were any places where they might dig their way out There were none His feet raised a cloud of fine dust which got into his eyes and nose and made him sneeze violently Discouraged he went back to the Phoenix and sat down There was a long silence Gradually an idea came to David It started as a small faint thought at the back of his mind wavered began to grow and expand and fill out became bigger and clearer and better and Phoenix cried David jumping to his feet My boy my very dear boy said the Phoenix its voice breaking with emotion I have Thought I have Pondered I have well to be brief it is no use Stiff upper lip my boy We are Doomed Phoenix I Let this be a lesson to you my boy even though it be your last one Fools rush in where angels fear to tread Ah who could have said in the golden days of my youth that I should come to such an end Oh miserable bird Oh unhappy boy Phoenix But we can show them how to die my boy We still have that the last magnificent gesture Let those who have lived wisely and well show that they can die in the same way I hope I am to go first so that you may have an example to follow Phoenix My boy Listen please And David whispered in the Phoenix s ear The plan had seemed like a good one while it was still in his mind but put into words it sounded a little too simple As he whispered David began to feel more and more foolish so that finally he stopped altogether I I guess it s really kind of silly he stammered But the Phoenix was looking at him with hope and admiration in its eyes My very dear chap it said solemnly I salute you I humbly await your signal Do you really think it will work My boy it must it can it shall Proceed Poor as the plan now seemed to David he prepared to carry it out Holding his breath so as not to sneeze again he scooped up as much dust as he could hold in two hands Then he took his position on one side of the cave nodded the Phoenix toward the other and glanced out to see if the guardian Gryffons were looking They were not Now he whispered The cave rocked with their uproar David screamed at the top of his voice and kicked the walls The Phoenix let out a series of ear splitting whistles and squawks and beat its wings frantically Echoes bounced from wall to wall The two Gryffons came rushing into the cave adding to the racket with their shrieking Now David shouted and he flung the double handful of dust into the Gryffons faces Instantly they were all choking and sneezing in the thick cloud He plunged between the legs of the two Gryffons who in the confusion began to bite and tear savagely at each other David and the Phoenix burst out of the cave together The other Gryffons aroused by the noise were bounding toward them David flung himself on the Phoenix s back and shouted Fly and sneezed From somewhere behind him a set of talons snatched out and ripped through the back of his shirt He kicked blindly and felt his foot crunch into something which shrieked Fly Phoenix he sobbed The Phoenix was already in the air and needed no encouragement They heard raucous cries and the thunder of wings behind them David looked back over his shoulder The Gryffons were rising from the ground in pursuit their legs drawn up under them and their wings beating Faster he screamed Illustration You have seen nothing in the way of flying until now my boy the Phoenix shouted back Watch this Its wings were two blurs slicing through the air and roaring like kettledrums The ground below streamed backwards David looked back again The Gryffons were falling into the distance Their cries were getting fainter Now they looked like a flock of starlings now like a cluster of flies now like gnats And then they had faded out of sight and David and the Phoenix were streaking over the grassland alone Ten minutes later they reached a shore and landed They flopped on the sand panting And David suddenly feeling very faint closed his eyes and put his head between his knees After they had got their breath the Phoenix patted David on the shoulder and said huskily I congratulate you my boy Your plan was magnificent precisely what I should have done had I thought of it first Needless to say we shall not go on looking for the Gryffins But now you know exactly what they are like midway in size between the Gryffens and Gryffons and reddish in color Most amiable souls willing to do anything for anyone It is hard to believe that they are all related But enough my boy Let us go home As soon as they reached the ledge the Phoenix put David down and prepared to take off again Where are you going Phoenix David asked Some business to attend to my boy Muttering under its breath something that sounded like tail feathers indeed the Phoenix soared off And David stiff and sore and thoroughly tired started down the mountainside for home five In Which the Scientist Arrives in Pursuit of the Phoenix and There Are Alarums and Excursions by Night Illustration The lights downstairs were all on when David got home and as soon as he opened the front door he could tell that they had company He shouted I m home and sneezed The dust from the Gryffons cave still clung to him tickling his nose Well here he is at last said Dad s voice Come on in David Then as David walked into the living room Good heavens Son what s happened to you Your back David Mother said in a horrified voice Your poor back What happened to you Illustration David felt himself The back of his shirt was ripped to tatters and there were three lines of caked blood across his shoulders He remembered now it was the Gryffon that had tried to grab him as he and the Phoenix made their escape But he had promised the Phoenix to keep its secret He stammered I I had an accident And dust all over you Mother went on Well said David desperately it was a dusty accident It seems to have been very dusty indeed said a third voice There was a loud sneeze David s father jumped up You gave me such a shock when you came in that I almost forgot David We have a guest And he introduced David to a very tall thin man with a bald head His face and neck were burnt red by the sun and he had on a pair of thick glasses which made his pale eyes look immense For some reason David took an instant dislike to him but he shook hands politely and said How do you do David eh said the man Well well Are you a good boy David Of all the stupid questions in the world that was the one David hated most He clenched his teeth and looked the other way David dear said Mother with an awkward laugh I think you d better go upstairs and wash and change When David came into the living room again the guest was talking excitedly completely unknown to man he was saying It s the discovery of the age My name will be famous if I succeed in my plans How fascinating Mother said And to think of it happening right here And it s huge the guest said simply huge And brilliantly colored For a scientist like myself it s more than fascinating David was listening now Scientist Scientist His heart missed a beat and he choked Oh no it couldn t be the Scientist Or could it David here spends all his time up on the mountain his father said Maybe he s seen it The guest turned his big pale unpleasant eyes on David Well David he said maybe you can help me Now have you seen anything unusual on the mountain Unusual said David unsteadily There was a pain in his chest from the pounding of his heart Yes David the guest went on unusual So unusual that you couldn t miss it a very large bird with bright plumage The floor under David seemed to rock It was true then it was horribly true This was the Scientist who had been chasing the Phoenix This was their enemy Bird David dodged Wh wh why there are lots of birds up there Sparrows and meadow larks and and sparrows But nothing like a huge bird with bright feathers Well he would have to tell a lie After all it was for the Phoenix s sake No said David Ah said the Scientist But his cold eyes bored into David s for another instant plainly saying I m not fooled young man It s odd he continued that no one has seen it But I have no doubt it s somewhere here I am going to begin my search as soon as my equipment gets here Tell us about it said Mother politely Well I discovered it on the other side of the valley you know said the Scientist eagerly Quite by accident I was really looking for another species Now birds you know have fixed habits 
2531_156724_000028_000001	train-clean-360	If you know those habits you can predict just what they will do at any time 
none	none	This particular bird was a daytime creature so I tried to watch it between dawn and dusk But it seemed to have a mind of its own you might almost say an intelligence It avoided me in a very clever way and it avoided my traps also Uncanny So after several weeks I decided to shoot it if I got the chance Then suddenly it disappeared but I m certain it came over to this side of the valley There was no escape from the subject during dinner The Scientist could think and talk of nothing else He described the merits of deadfalls snares steel traps and birdlime He asked which they thought would make the best bait a rabbit a beefsteak a live lamb or carrion He told them all about the new high powered long range rifle which he had ordered And he vowed to them all that he would not rest until the bird was either caught or killed for the advancement of human learning David listened with horror The dinner before him went untouched His only thought was that now he would have to warn the Phoenix as soon as possible The Phoenix would go to South America after all and his education would end before it had even started All because of this hateful man He fought to hold back his tears Dinner was over at last David mumbled his excuses and ducked out of the dining room but Aunt Amy seized him firmly just as he thought he had got away Bedtime for you David she said firmly Oh Aunt Amy please I ve got to Upstairs young man You ve had enough gallivanting around for one day You re all worn out I m not said David struggling I feel fine Look I just have to It was useless She marched him upstairs to his room and stood in the doorway until he had undressed and put on his pajamas and got into bed Now she said you go to sleep The mountain will still be there in the morning unless there s a landslide Good night And she turned out the light and shut the door This was awful He could not sneak downstairs because the stairs could be seen from the living room He could not climb out of his window because a rose arbor was directly beneath it and he would be ripped by the thorns And Mother always came in to say good night before she went to bed If he was not there when she came in tonight there would be a lot of unpleasant explaining to do The only thing then was to wait until the Scientist went home and everyone was in bed It was a maddening wait The Scientist s voice went on and on like the drone of an electric fan interrupted only by an occasional murmur from Mother or Dad For a while David sat in bed twisting the sheets in his hands then he got up and paced the room in his bare feet It seemed to him that three or four whole nighttimes had passed before he finally heard all three voices raised and talking at once The Scientist was going Now they were saying good by at the front door now the door was being closed now there were footsteps on the stairs He jumped into bed just before Mother put her head in and said Good night dear David murmured pretending to be half asleep His door closed again The light switches snapped and there was silence He waited another half hour to make sure everyone was asleep As quickly and silently as he could he pulled on his clothes crept out of his room and slid cautiously down the bannister In the back yard he put on his shoes dived through the hedge and started to race up the mountainside Fortunately there was a nearly full moon and no clouds in the sky But even with this light it was not easy to keep to the trail Several times he lost his way so that the trip took much longer than usual But he found the ledge at last climbed over the final difficult rock and sat down to catch his breath When he could speak he called softly Phoenix There was no answer Phoenix He pushed through the thicket to the other side of the ledge Phoenix The Phoenix was gone The tears that had been stopped up all evening could be held no longer David dropped to the ground leaned his forehead against a rock and let them go He had just remembered As soon as they had come back from the Gryffon adventure the Phoenix had flown off on some sort of business And it had not said when it would return The tears cleared David s mind and made him feel better Now what He began to think If he stayed on the ledge all night they might find out at home and make a terrible fuss But if he did not warn the Phoenix before morning the Scientist might creep up while the bird was resting and trap it or shoot it So he would have to warn the Phoenix and return home And the only way to do both these things was to write the Phoenix a note But he had neither paper nor pencil A fine mess he had made of everything Now he would have to go all the way back home write the note come all the way back up to the ledge and then go home again David trudged down the mountainside in a very low mood Now that he had a definite plan to work on his fear was gone but he felt that he had been pretty stupid to rush off without thinking of everything first In his mind he could hear the Phoenix saying Look before you leap my boy and other wise words of advice And he had cried too Lucky that no one had been there to see that As he approached the house he was surprised to see all the lights ablaze and to hear his name being called Oh oh he thought they ve found out I ve gone Here I am he shouted opening the door What s the matter It was a strange sight which met him inside Dad in his gray pajamas was waving a revolver and making fierce noises Mother looking frightened had a shoe in one hand Aunt Amy with her hair in rags was also well armed with a big cast iron frying pan Beckie was howling upstairs David Mother cried Are you all right Where have you been Did he hurt you Who said David I m all right What s the matter The burglar said Mother excitedly He put his head in the window and said pssssst I tell you burglars don t say pssssst Dad said They try to make as little noise as possible Just let me catch him doing it again he added waving his pistol Running around on that mountain at all hours of the night Aunt Amy grumbled with burglars and I don t know what all loose in town And then we found that you were gone and we thought he had stolen you Mother went on Where have you been I couldn t sleep said David So I went for a walk Well thank heavens you re safe said Mother Hankering after that mountain all night Aunt Amy muttered As if he wasn t up there all day Look here Son said Dad What do you know about this Honestly Dad said David I couldn t sleep There s nothing wrong with that I can t help it if I can t sleep So I took a walk There s nothing wrong with Oh all right all right his father said I suppose it s just a coincidence Let s all get back to sleep And David the next time you can t sleep try counting sheep Gradually the house calmed down Beckie stopped wailing Dad put away his gun good nights were said the lights were turned off David knew that it would be at least an hour before he dared to move again and he would have to be doubly careful this time And he was a little nervous himself now about that burglar What if he should meet him when he went out again He tried to forget about that by thinking of what he would put in the note for the Phoenix He had got as far as Dear Phoenix and was wondering how you spelled Phoenix when there came a swish and a thump at his window followed by a cautious whisper Pssssst David felt his scalp prickle Wh wh who s that he quavered Is that you my boy whispered a familiar guarded voice Ah thank heavens And the Phoenix crawled through the window Weak with relief David snapped on the bedside light The Phoenix presented a shocking sight Its face was drawn with fatigue and it looked rather draggled Its back sagged its wings drooped to the floor and it walked with a limp Illustration Oh Phoenix Phoenix David whispered He jumped to support the bird before it collapsed entirely Ah thank you my boy the Phoenix murmured Your bed I presume May I Thank you The springs creaked under its weight as the Phoenix gingerly lay down What a night my boy what a night it sighed weakly closing its eyes Oh Phoenix what happened Can I do anything for you David whispered A damp cooling cloth upon my forehead would be welcome my boy murmured the Phoenix Also a bit of nourishment David slid down the bannister got a handful of cookies and a glass of milk and dampened a dish towel When he returned the Phoenix was fast asleep Phoenix he whispered wake up Here s your The Phoenix awoke with a violent start and stared wildly around the room Trapped it muttered making a frenzied effort to get off the bed Not so loud David whispered sharply It s me Understanding dawned in the Phoenix s eyes and it eased itself back with a sigh Ah you my boy You gave me quite a fright I thought But here the Phoenix caught sight of the milk and cookies and sat up again Ambrosia it sighed reverently And nectar You are a prince my dear fellow And the Phoenix reached out eagerly Now Phoenix David whispered as he wrapped the wet towel around the Phoenix s head what s happened Ah that feels heavenly my boy Munch munch What has happened Munch munch Gulp I was insulted I accepted a challenge and I brilliantly maintained my honor Let that be a lesson to you my boy death before dishonor Yes in spite of my age I But Phoenix what happened To be brief then my boy for brevity is the soul of wit although I am not trying to be witty now I am simply too worn out Brevity ah where was I I think you were telling me what happened to you tonight David said Ah yes quite so Well I raced the Witch to put it quite simply Oh Phoenix Did you win She said that she would beat my tail feathers off did she not Behold my dear fellow every tail feather intact Good for you Phoenix How did it go I found her somewhere over Scotland and accepted her challenge We jockeyed about for starting positions and she insulted me by offering me a handicap which of course I refused For several hundred miles it was nip and tuck as it were Then over Luxembourg I put all my energies into a magnificent sprint and won the race by three and a half broom lengths She claimed a foul and went off in a fit of sulks of course I never saw a Witch who was a good loser And I well the fact is my boy that I am not as young as I used to be I simply crawled home Oh you poor Phoenix But you won though Good for you Phoenix I m proud of you I didn t like her at all There you are I had to win for both of us Now as I wended my weary way homeward I realized that I should be too tired to go traveling tomorrow So I decided to tell you in case you should want to do something else during the day But I did not know which house was yours I had to pick one at random I thrust my head in a window and uttered a cautious pssssst Imagine my dismay when I was answered by a piercing scream I had to beat a hasty and undignified retreat into a garage until all was peaceful again Then I did the same thing at the next house and the next with the same results The Phoenix sighed Would you believe it my boy this is the fifth house I tried But I knew I was on the right track when I heard them calling for you Oh so it was you said David You almost frightened Mother to death She thought you were a burglar My dear fellow I am really sorry for having caused any misunderstanding or fright said the Phoenix apologetically It was just that I wanted to tell you of my victory that is to tell you that I should be indisposed tomorrow Then David recalled that he had something to say too The shock of remembering was such that he blurted out the news without thinking of softening the blow Phoenix listen The Scientist is here The Phoenix sat up in bed with a jerk and David barely suppressed its startled exclamation by clamping a hand over its beak It s not so bad yet he whispered hurriedly because he s not sure where you are and he has to wait for his equipment to get here But oh Phoenix now I suppose you ll go to South America after all and I won t have any more education The Phoenix leaped to its feet and struck a defiant pose My boy it said angrily you are mistaken I refuse to be chased around any longer Even the lowly worm turns Am I a mouse or am I the Phoenix If that insufferable man wishes to pursue me further if he cannot mind his own business then by Jove we shall meet him face to face and FIGHT TO THE FINISH Its voice which had been getting louder and louder ended in an indignant squawk its battle cry as it explained later David s warning ssh was too late They heard rapid footsteps and the sound of light switches snapping Quick David said Out the window With a hasty Farewell my boy the Phoenix plunged headlong toward the window and tripped over the sill There was a resounding crash outside as the bird landed on the rose arbor a brief but furious thrashing and muttering and then the receding flurry of wings Dad burst into the room with his revolver followed by Mother and Aunt Amy with two frying pans this time He stuck his head in the window and said pssssst at me David cried A big dark shape in the window This time Dad telephoned the police In no time at all three carloads of weary policemen were swarming over the house and yard with guns and flashlights drawn It was the fifth or was it the sixth call they had received from the neighborhood that night they explained There followed an hour of questions arguments and theories during which everyone became very excited Everyone that is except David although he acted excited to avoid suspicion But he was happy He had warned the Phoenix the Phoenix was going to stay and there was nothing to worry about until tomorrow six In Which the Phoenix Has a Plan and David and the Phoenix Call On a Sea Monster Illustration Well you re in all the papers this morning Phoenix said David as he sat down beside the reclining bird next morning They don t know who you are but they re all talking about what happened last night They call you the Whispering Burglar The police are pretty worried My dear chap said the Phoenix apologetically let me repeat my sincere regrets for causing alarm It was not my desire to the police did you say Have they discovered any clues No said David reassuringly They can t find a thing They think the Whispering Burglar climbed up a ladder to say pssssst into the upstairs windows Only they can t find the ladder They call it the Missing Mystery Clue The Phoenix gazed at the sky and mused In all the papers you say Well Fame at last although hardly the kind I had expected What a pity that there can be no photographs with the story Imagine a picture of me on the front page A profile perhaps or would a full length shot be more effective Or both let us say with I know you d look very handsome Phoenix David interrupted but what we should be thinking about is the Scientist What are we going to do Oh that said the Phoenix I was coming to that my boy The battle is already half won I have a Plan Good for you Phoenix What is it Aha said the Phoenix with a mysterious smile All will unfold in time Rest assured that the Plan is brilliant In one stroke of genius it solves everything Tactics my boy Napoleon had nothing on me But what is it Phoenix Tut my boy said the Phoenix in a maddening way Control your impatience You will see Now we shall have to buy some things so we shall need money Let me see Several of the Leprechauns have large pots of gold No I fear they would not part with so much as a penny Tightfisted my dear fellow you never saw such misers Hmmm Well there are the Dragons of course they guard heaps of treasure in caves But no they are excellent chaps in most respects but frightfully stuffy about loans and gifts No The Djinn No his money is all tied up in Arabian oil speculation Aha Why didn t I think of that before The Sea Monster of course Do Sea Monsters have money asked David No but the Sea Monster should know where pirate treasure is buried quite in its nautical line We shall visit the Monster my boy Tomorrow of course I could not fly a foot today to save my life My muscles are killing me Oh poor Phoenix David said But he was so excited that he could not feel much pity Pirate treasure They were going to dig for pirate treasure We shall need a spade I trust you will arrange for it my boy Of course Phoenix said David jumping to his feet I ll get everything ready right away Don t move till I get back Impossible my boy The Phoenix groaned as it shifted into a more comfortable position David raced home to collect the necessary things for the trip Remembering how cold it had been last time he took his leather jacket out of the closet and a pair of gloves and a scarf For the Phoenix he borrowed a bottle of liniment and took all the cookies from the cooky jar And he picked the shortest of three spades in the garage During the rest of the day he massaged the Phoenix s back and wings with the liniment He was exploding with curiosity about the Plan of course But the Phoenix would only smile its smuggest smile and tell him to wait and see wait and see which almost drove David mad Tomorrow took its time the way it always does when you are anxious to see it arrive but it finally came And David found himself with the spade held tightly under one arm his jacket zipped up to his chin gloves on and scarf knotted all ready to go To the west this time said the Phoenix as David got up on its back This is the Monster s Pacific season you know Ready my boy Splendid We are off Over the mountains and desert they sped over the shore out across the ocean For a long time they hurtled through a huge blue loneliness dark blue below lighter blue above Once they passed over a ship a pencil dot trailing a pin scratch of white Another time they startled a high flying albatross which gave a frightened squawk and plunged down out of sight with folded wings Aside from that there was nothing to see until they reached the islands The Phoenix slowed down to a glide and dropped lower These are the coral atolls of the Pacific my boy it called over its shoulder That lake in the center of each island is called the lagoon David was enchanted by the atolls They were made of tiny islets strung together like the beads of a necklace And the colors The dark blue of the sea became lighter around the islands melting from sapphire to turquoise to jade The atolls were ringed with dazzling white surf and beach and they all had cool green swaths of palm trees and underbrush And each lagoon also had its varying shades of blue like the outer sea I fear we may have trouble my boy said the Phoenix as they scanned the empty beaches The Monster shifts about from island to island to avoid discovery We shall just have to search And search they did atoll after atoll until at the end of an hour they were rewarded David suddenly spotted a dark object stretched out on the beach of a lagoon and at the same time the Phoenix said Aha triumphantly They began to spiral down The Sea Monster was immense Its body could have filled the living room at home Its neck was twenty feet long and so was its tail which ended in a barbed point It had huge seal like flippers and its polished brown hide was made up of scales as big as dinner plates Wake up Monster The Phoenix cried We The next instant they were lost in a cloud of flying sand and spray through which could be heard a prodigious splash When it had cleared they found themselves alone on the beach The only sign of the Sea Monster was a great furrow in the sand which led down to the agitated water Golly that was fast David marveled as they shook the sand from themselves Do you think it ll come back Phoenix Of course my boy Curiosity if nothing else will bring it up again In the meantime we might as well sit down and wait They sat down and waited David took off his jacket For fifteen minutes they heard nothing but the murmuring of the surf and the rustling clatter of palm fronds At last there was a slight splashing noise from the lagoon There David whispered pointing Thirty feet offshore an ear was being thrust cautiously above the rippled surface It twitched once or twice then pointed quiveringly in their direction Come out Monster the Phoenix shouted It is I the Phoenix The Sea Monster s head appeared slowly followed by several yards of neck It peered at them short sightedly weaving its head from side to side to get a better view David saw that it had two short straight horns just in front of its ears eyes that were soft and cowlike and a most expressive set of whiskers The whiskers were now at a doubtful half mast angle Ah Phoenix said the Sea Monster at last in a mild voice Can t you remember to wake me a bit more gently I thought you were Come on out said the Phoenix firmly and stop looking like a lost sheep Uh what about uh that said the Sea Monster hesitantly pointing one ear at David This said the Phoenix is David He is getting an education I assure you that he will not bite The Sea Monster swam toward them heaved itself out of the water and offered its huge flipper for David to shake Illustration Sorry I rushed off like that it said The trouble is I ve had such a bad case of war nerves Why sometimes I jump out of my skin at nothing at all Were you in the war David asked Ah was I sighed the Sea Monster It flopped down comfortably on its belly curled its tail around its front flippers and sighed again But David noticed that its whiskers had perked up to a quite cheerful angle The Sea Monster was obviously delighted to have someone listen to its troubles Yes it said heaving a third sigh I was From the very beginning much against my will Guns all over the place Terrible Did they shoot you David asked horrified Well at me anyway I m thankful to say they never hit me but there were some pretty near misses All the oceans were simply packed with ships I couldn t lift my head out of water without bringing down a perfect rain of shells and bullets The intelligent thing in that case the Phoenix broke in with a sniff would have been to stay under water Thank you Phoenix said the Sea Monster dryly But I do like to breathe now and then Anyway I wasn t safe even under water They d drop depth charges on me One ship even launched a torpedo at me How awful said David Tut my boy said the Phoenix I have no doubt our friend is stretching the truth shamelessly You need not look so smug Monster You were not the only one in the war I have gone through anti aircraft fire a number of times Some of it was very severe In fact once I Once I had the whole North Atlantic fleet after me the Sea Monster interrupted proudly And I remember the Franco Prussian War said the Phoenix Which I daresay you do not Well uh no I don t There you are the Phoenix crowed The Sea Monster looking rather ruffled pointedly turned from the Phoenix and said to David What should you like to do David David suddenly remembered what they had come for and the excitement rushed back into his heart He opened his mouth to cry We want to dig for treasure and then stopped short Asking for money he knew was an impolite thing to do especially from someone you had only just met And there was no telling how the Sea Monster might feel about people nosing around for its treasure So he looked at the Phoenix and waited for it to speak The Phoenix caught David s glance cleared its throat several times and looked apologetically at the Sea Monster Monster old chap it said soothingly I am deeply sorry for having doubted you just now Deeply sorry Quite all right said the Sea Monster stiffly Yes the Phoenix continued we both know that you have passed through perilous times through dangers which I must confess would have left me a shattered wreck The Sea Monster sighed sadly but its whiskers were beginning to rise again The Monster bears up very well under this fearful strain don t you think so my boy A splendid example for the rest of us Magnificent The Sea Monster s whiskers were quivering with pleasure Monster old chap old friend you were never one to let a boon companion down If I have said it once I have said it a hundred times The Sea Monster I have said the Sea Monster is the helpful sort Mention the words Staunch Friend I have said and immediately the Sea Monster comes to mind The Phoenix reached up one wing and began to pat the Sea Monster s flipper Monster old chum we ah we Well the plain fact is that we ah we have need of such a trifling matter here the Phoenix gave a careless laugh that I should not really bring it up at all Ah we need a bit of money Oh said the Sea Monster Its whiskers sagged Now please do not be offended Monster said the Phoenix hastily After all you have no need for the treasure and it does absolutely no good buried under the ground It doesn t do any harm there either said the Sea Monster Really Phoenix I never thought you Monster said the Phoenix solemnly this is a matter of life or death Life or death ha Please Monster said David It really is life or death because the Scientist is chasing the Phoenix and the Phoenix has a plan to escape him and we need some money to carry out the plan so the Scientist can t hurt the Phoenix A few small coins will do added the Phoenix with a winning smile A louis d or for example or some pieces of eight After which you may bury the rest again Please Monster David begged The Monster looked at David and at the Phoenix and then at David again and then at the lagoon It sighed a very doubtful sigh Oh all right it said reluctantly But for goodness sake don t go telling anyone where you found it Of course not said the Phoenix And David leaped up and shouted Hooray and grabbed the spade and his jacket The stuff is on the next island said the Sea Monster I can swim over with you two on my back This way please we have to leave from the outer beach The Sea Monster was a magnificent swimmer Its neck cut through the water like the stem of a Viking ship and it left a frothing wake behind Every once in a while it would plunge its head into the water and come up with a fish which it would swallow whole Should you like some breakfast David said the Sea Monster Illustration No thank you David answered but you go right ahead Phoenix he added what are you doing The Phoenix which had been walking up and down with its wings clasped behind its back stopped and gazed over the sea Pacing the quarter deck my boy Scanning the horizon That is what one usually does at sea I believe You ll be wanting us to call you Admiral next said the Sea Monster acidly They steamed on Twenty minutes and seventy six large breakfast fish later they sighted the island a little smudge on the horizon dead ahead Land ho a voice croaked Thank heavens David turned in surprise The Phoenix was no longer pacing the quarter deck and scanning the horizon It was sitting limply with its head down and a glassy stare in its eyes Illustration You had better hurry up David said to the Sea Monster I think the Phoenix is seasick Am not the Phoenix gasped Merely ulp temporary The Sea Monster turned and smiled sweetly at the Phoenix You ll get used to it in no time Admiral When they landed however the Phoenix recovered rapidly and even began to put on a slight nautical swagger The Sea Monster humped off down the beach followed eagerly by the two treasure hunters In a few minutes it came to a halt and sniffed the sand very carefully swinging its head snakelike to and fro It settled on one spot sniffed it thoroughly felt the sand with its whiskers and then solemnly announced Here Ahoy me hearties the Phoenix shouted Turn to and stand by to splice the main brace Steady as she goes mates David needed no encouragement from anyone He began to dig furiously Flashing in the sun the spade bit into the beach and coarse white sand spurted in all directions The Phoenix was quite as excited as David It danced around the deepening hole with eyes asparkle shouting such piratical terms as Shiver me timbers Strike your colors and Give em no quarter lads Suddenly it began to beat time with its wing and to sing in a raucous voice Cut the King s throat and take the King s gold Heave ho bullies for Panama There s plenty of loot for the lad who is bold Heave away bullies for Panama You re flat on that last note said the Sea Monster My dear Monster I have perfect pitch Oh yes you have perfect sea legs too Well ah How are you coming along my boy Any signs of treasure David did not hear In fact he heard nothing from the first crunch of the spade onward His education was now richer by this fact once you start out after treasure you can think of nothing else until it is found The sun was beating hotly on him little rivulets of sweat poured down his face and arms his muscles ached blisters were beginning to form on his hands Heedless of all he dug on He had settled into the rhythm of it now and nothing could distract him Tell you what s a good thing for seasickness said the Sea Monster slyly You take a Pretending not to hear the Phoenix stood first on one leg and then on the other and stared into the sky David dug tirelessly Suddenly the spade grated on something solid and they all jumped David shouted Here it is and shoveled up sand frantically The Phoenix danced around the hole also shouting Even the Sea Monster arched its neck to get a better view They could see a brass ring crusted with verdigris fastened to a partly exposed piece of wood The sand flew Now they could see studded strips of metal bound to the wood and a rusty padlock And in a few minutes a whole chest with slanting sides and a curved lid and tarnished brass hinges was uncovered David threw the spade on the beach seized the brass handle and tugged It came off in his hand Illustration Here let me said the Sea Monster David got out of the hole and the Sea Monster worked one flipper carefully under the chest Look out it said and heaved its flipper up The chest shot into the air tumbled down end over end and split wide open on the beach David gasped A dazzling sparkling heap spilled out on the sand There were heaps of gold and silver coins the silver black with tarnish but the gold still bright There were pearls rubies diamonds beryls emeralds opals sapphires amethysts And bracelets necklaces pendants sunbursts brooches rings pins combs buckles lockets buttons crucifixes And carved pieces of jade and ivory and coral and jet And coronets crowns tiaras arm bands And jeweled daggers picture frames vases silver knives and forks and spoons sugar bowls platters goblets For an hour they examined the treasure David fairly wallowed in it exclaiming Look at this one or Oh how beautiful or just Golly The Phoenix muttered such things as King s ransom and Wealth of the Indies The Sea Monster was not interested in the treasure but kept glancing nervously out to sea At last the Phoenix said Well my boy I think we had better make our choice Three or four coins should do it The Sea Monster gave a relieved sigh Let s get the rest of it underground right away You have no idea what trouble it can cause The choice was difficult There were so many coins all of them with queer writing and heads of unknown gods and kings David finally picked out four gold pieces and tied them up in his handkerchief Then the Sea Monster swept the rest of the treasure into the hole They all pushed sand in on top of it and jumped on the mound till it was level with the rest of the beach The Phoenix turned to the Sea Monster and said solemnly Monster old fellow I knew you would not fail us You stood forth in our hour of need and we shall not forget And David echoed Thank you Monster The Sea Monster ducked its head and blushed A wave of fiery red started at its nose traveled rapidly back over its ears down its neck along the body and fanned out to the tips of its flippers and the extreme end of the barb in its tail Even its whiskers turned pink Well uh glad to help uh nothing to it really it mumbled Then it turned abruptly galloped down to the sea plunged into the surf and was gone seven In Which the Phoenix s Plan Is Carried Out and There Are More Alarums and Excursions in the Night Illustration
2531_156724_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 Now my boy said the Phoenix when they got back to the ledge that afternoon are the shops still open 
2531_156724_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 I think they re open till six said David shaking the sand out of his shoes 
2531_156724_000005_000001	train-clean-360	 Are we going to buy something 
2531_156724_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 Precisely my boy 
2531_156724_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Precisely my boy 
2531_156724_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 Precisely my boy 
2531_156724_000006_000001	train-clean-360	A hardware store should have what we need 
2531_156724_000006_000002	train-clean-360	Now you will take our gold and purchase the following And the Phoenix listed the things it wanted and told David which to bring to the ledge and which to leave below 
2531_156724_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 and a hatchet the Phoenix concluded 
2531_156724_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 We have one at home already said David 
none	none	Now listen Phoenix can t you tell me what all this is for 
2531_156724_000008_000002	train-clean-360	What are we going to do with it 
none	none	My boy the feline s existence was terminated as a direct result of its inquisitiveness
2531_156724_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 What did you say 
2531_156724_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Curiosity killed the cat explained the Phoenix 
none	none	Oh But
2531_156724_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Now run along my boy 
2531_156724_000013_000001	train-clean-360	A very important Thought has just come to me I must Meditate a while The Phoenix glanced at the thicket and hid a yawn behind one wing 
none	none	Oh all right said David I ll see you in the morning then It wasn t until he got home that he thought of something 
2531_156724_000015_000001	train-clean-360	He couldn t spend pirate gold pieces or even show them to anyone without being asked a lot of embarrassing questions 
2531_156724_000015_000002	train-clean-360	What to do 
none	none	Ask Dad or Mother or Aunt Amy to lend him some money 
2531_156724_000015_000004	train-clean-360	More embarrassing questions Well he would have to rob his bank 
2531_156724_000015_000005	train-clean-360	But wait why hadn t he remembered 
2531_156724_000015_000006	train-clean-360	Just before they had moved Uncle Charles had given him a ten dollar bill as a farewell present 
2531_156724_000015_000007	train-clean-360	He had been saving it for a model airplane but the excitement of the last few days had driven it completely out of his mind 
2531_156724_000015_000008	train-clean-360	Of course the Phoenix s Plan was more important than any model plane could be 
none	none	So he kept the gold pieces tied up in his handkerchief and took his ten dollars to a hardware store where he bought what the Phoenix wanted a coil of rope an electric door bell a pushbutton and one hundred feet of insulated wire 
2531_156724_000016_000001	train-clean-360	Then he brought the package home hid it behind the woodpile in the garage and sat down to think Wire bell pushbutton 
2531_156724_000016_000002	train-clean-360	What could the Phoenix possibly want with them 
2531_156724_000016_000003	train-clean-360	And what was the rope for 
2531_156724_000016_000004	train-clean-360	And the hatchet 
2531_156724_000016_000005	train-clean-360	The more he puzzled over it the more confused he became and finally he just gave up There was only one thing he was sure about whatever the Plan was they would have to carry it out as soon as possible 
2531_156724_000016_000006	train-clean-360	Two days had passed since the Scientist had shown up 
none	none	The new gun he had ordered might arrive at any time now 
2531_156724_000016_000008	train-clean-360	Perhaps even today when they had been digging up the pirate treasure the Scientist had got his new rifle and had started to hunt through the mountains 
2531_156724_000017_000000	train-clean-360	The thought gave David a creepy feeling on the back of his neck 
2531_156724_000017_000001	train-clean-360	They certainly would have to hurry 
2531_156724_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Early next morning David climbed up to the ledge bringing with him the coil of rope and the hatchet 
2531_156724_000018_000001	train-clean-360	As an afterthought he had added a paper bag full of cookies 
2531_156724_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Here s the stuff Phoenix he called out as he stepped onto the ledge 
none	none	Where are you 
2531_156724_000020_000000	train-clean-360	There was a crash from the thicket as though someone had jumped up in it suddenly and the Phoenix stumbled out rubbing its eyes 
none	none	Ah splendid my boy Yes 
2531_156724_000021_000002	train-clean-360	I was just ah Thinking 
2531_156724_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Phoenix said David I m not going to ask you again what your Plan is because I know you ll tell me when it s time 
none	none	But whatever it is we d better do it right now 
2531_156724_000022_000002	train-clean-360	The Scientist may show up any minute 
none	none	Precisely my boy 
2531_156724_000023_000001	train-clean-360	Never put off until tomorrow what can be done today 
2531_156724_000023_000002	train-clean-360	One of my favorite proverbs 
2531_156724_000023_000003	train-clean-360	We shall begin immediately 
none	none	Here the Phoenix caught sight of the bag in David s hand and added hastily But of course we must not forget that first things come first
2531_156724_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 You might have brought more said the Phoenix fifteen minutes later 
none	none	There weren t any more in the jar David said
2531_156724_000025_000001	train-clean-360	 Phoenix please tell me what we re going to do 
none	none	I don t care if curiosity did kill the cat 
2531_156724_000025_000003	train-clean-360	I ve been thinking about the rope and wire and bell all night and I can t make heads or tails out of it 
2531_156724_000026_000000	train-clean-360	The Phoenix gave a pleased laugh 
2531_156724_000026_000001	train-clean-360	 Of course you cannot my boy 
2531_156724_000026_000002	train-clean-360	The Plan is far too profound for you to guess what it is 
none	none	But set your mind at rest 
2531_156724_000026_000004	train-clean-360	I shall now explain the rope and hatchet 
2531_156724_000027_000000	train-clean-360	David leaned forward eagerly 
2531_156724_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Now scientists you know have fixed habits 
none	none	If you know those habits you can predict just what they will do at any time 
2531_156724_000028_000002	train-clean-360	Our particular Scientist is a daytime creature that is to say he comes at dawn and goes at dusk 
2531_156724_000028_000003	train-clean-360	His invariable habit my boy 
none	none	Well There you are my boy said the Phoenix triumphantly We shall sleep during the day and continue your education at night Oh said David 
2531_156724_000031_000001	train-clean-360	He thought about this a while then asked But suppose the Scientist comes up on the ledge during the day and catches you asleep 
none	none	Aha 
2531_156724_000032_000001	train-clean-360	That is where the rope and hatchet come in 
2531_156724_000032_000002	train-clean-360	Never fear my boy I thought of that also 
2531_156724_000032_000003	train-clean-360	We are going to construct a snare at each end of the ledge 
none	none	How
2531_156724_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 Hand me that twig my boy The Phoenix took the twig found a bare spot of earth and sketched a picture 
2531_156724_000034_000001	train-clean-360	 First we find a sapling and clear the branches from it with the hatchet like this 
2531_156724_000034_000002	train-clean-360	Next we get a stake cut a notch in it and drive it into the ground so 
2531_156724_000034_000003	train-clean-360	The sapling is bent down to it and fitted into the notch which holds it down 
none	none	You see my boy 
2531_156724_000034_000005	train-clean-360	Now we make a noose so from a piece of rope tie it to the end of the sapling and spread the loop out on the path this way 
2531_156724_000034_000006	train-clean-360	The whole snare is hidden under grass and leaves The Phoenix beamed and flung out its wings in a dramatic gesture 
2531_156724_000034_000007	train-clean-360	 Just picture it my dear chap 
2531_156724_000034_000008	train-clean-360	The Scientist smiling evilly as he skulks along the path 
2531_156724_000034_000009	train-clean-360	The unwary footstep 
2531_156724_000034_000010	train-clean-360	The sapling jarred out of the notch springing upward 
none	none	The tightened noose 
2531_156724_000034_000012	train-clean-360	And our archenemy dangling by the foot in mid air completely at our mercy Magnificent 
2531_156724_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Golly Phoenix said David that s pretty clever 
none	none	Clever my boy 
2531_156724_000036_000001	train-clean-360	Better to say a stroke of genius Only I Phoenix could have thought of it 
2531_156724_000036_000002	train-clean-360	And consider the poetic justice of it 
2531_156724_000036_000003	train-clean-360	This is exactly the sort of trap that the Scientist once set for me 
2531_156724_000036_000004	train-clean-360	Well shall we begin 
none	none	Illustration The Phoenix had made the snares sound delightfully simple but they soon discovered that the job was harder than it sounded 
2531_156724_000038_000001	train-clean-360	First they had to find the right kind of sapling springy and strong 
2531_156724_000038_000002	train-clean-360	The sapling had to be in the right place one by the goat trail the other at the far end of the ledge 
2531_156724_000038_000003	train-clean-360	When they had been chosen David had to shinny up them to lop off their branches 
none	none	That was a very awkward business the saplings swayed and trembled under his weight and he could only use one hand for the hatchet 
2531_156724_000038_000005	train-clean-360	Then he had to make two stakes from stout hard wood cut a notch at one end and drive them into the ground with the flat of the hatchet 
none	none	But the hardest part was trying to bend the sapling down to the stake and fitting it into the notch It took the weight of both of them to bring the sapling to the ground If they got the slightest bit off balance it would spring up again Once David fell off the sapling went swish back into the air flinging the astonished Phoenix thirty feet up the mountainside It was not until afternoon when the sun had turned ruddy and shadows were beginning to stretch dark fingers across the land that they finished the job 
2531_156724_000039_000001	train-clean-360	But at last the saplings were set in the notches the nooses were formed and fastened on 
2531_156724_000039_000002	train-clean-360	Grass and leaves were strewn over the snares chips hewn branches and other evidences of their work were removed 
2531_156724_000039_000003	train-clean-360	They sat down and looked proudly at each other 
2531_156724_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 My boy said the Phoenix I have had a wide and sometimes painful experience with traps so you may believe me when I say that these are among the best I have seen 
none	none	We have done well
2531_156724_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 They re sure strong enough David agreed flexing his fingers to take the stiffness out of them 
2531_156724_000041_000001	train-clean-360	 But what are we going to do if the Scientist does get caught in one 
none	none	We shall burn that bridge when we reach it my boy 
2531_156724_000042_000001	train-clean-360	Now do you have the pliers wire cutters and screw driver below 
2531_156724_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes they re down in the cellar 
none	none	What are we going to do with them Phoenix
2531_156724_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Patience patience 
2531_156724_000044_000001	train-clean-360	You will be told when the time comes 
2531_156724_000044_000002	train-clean-360	I shall meet you tonight after dark as soon as it is safe for me to come down 
none	none	I trust you will have everything ready Are you coming down Precisely my boy 
2531_156724_000046_000001	train-clean-360	A risk I admit but a necessary one 
2531_156724_000046_000002	train-clean-360	There is a hedge at the back of your house is there not 
none	none	Splendid 
2531_156724_000046_000004	train-clean-360	You may await me there 
none	none	David sitting in the shadow of the hedge jumped when he heard the Phoenix s quiet Good evening my boy
2531_156724_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Phoenix he whispered how did you do it 
none	none	Golly I didn t see you at all and it isn t even dark yet
2531_156724_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 I have been hunted long enough my boy to have learned a few tricks It is merely a matter of gliding close to the ground selecting the best shadows and keeping a sharp lookout 
2531_156724_000049_000001	train-clean-360	Well let us get on with the Plan 
2531_156724_000049_000002	train-clean-360	Have you the tools here 
2531_156724_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes here they are 
none	none	Splendid 
2531_156724_000051_000001	train-clean-360	Now my boy since we must continue your education during the night it is necessary that we have some way of getting in touch with each other 
none	none	If you climb the mountainside in the dark you may unwittingly fall into our own snare It is far easier for me to come down than it is for you to go up and under cover of darkness I can do it quite safely 
2531_156724_000051_000004	train-clean-360	The question now is how will you know when I have arrived 
2531_156724_000051_000005	train-clean-360	That my boy is the nub or crux of the situation 
none	none	A difficult problem you will admit 
2531_156724_000051_000007	train-clean-360	But I have worked out the solution 
none	none	The Phoenix lowered its voice impressively
2531_156724_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 My boy we are going to install this bell in your room and the pushbutton on the base of that telephone pole 
2531_156724_000053_000001	train-clean-360	When I arrive here at night I shall press the button to let you know that I am ready to go A magnificent idea isn t it 
2531_156724_000054_000000	train-clean-360	It did not seem very practical to David 
2531_156724_000054_000001	train-clean-360	 Well Phoenix that s a good idea he said carefully 
2531_156724_000054_000002	train-clean-360	 But how are we going to hide the wires And what about the noise of the bell 
2531_156724_000055_000001	train-clean-360	the wires 
none	none	And what about the noise of the bell
2531_156724_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 Nothing to it my boy 
none	none	The wires 
2531_156724_000055_000002	train-clean-360	There are wires between your house and the telephone pole already one more would not be noticed 
none	none	The noise 
2531_156724_000055_000004	train-clean-360	You have a pillow on your bed under which the bell can be muffled 
2531_156724_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes that s true It still sounded impractical 
2531_156724_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 Just imagine it the Phoenix continued enthusiastically 
2531_156724_000057_000001	train-clean-360	 Perhaps later we can install another bell at this end 
2531_156724_000057_000002	train-clean-360	Then we could learn Morse code and send messages to each other 
2531_156724_000057_000003	train-clean-360	Exactly like a private telephone line 
2531_156724_000058_000000	train-clean-360	Put in this way the idea had a certain appeal and David found himself warming to it 
2531_156724_000058_000001	train-clean-360	But there was another thing to consider 
2531_156724_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 How about electricity Phoenix 
2531_156724_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 Look above you my boy 
2531_156724_000060_000001	train-clean-360	The telephone pole is simply loaded down with power lines waiting to be tapped 
2531_156724_000061_000000	train-clean-360	The Phoenix was evidently set on carrying out the Plan and David did not want to wear out the bird s patience with more objections And well why not 
none	none	There should be no harm in trying it out anyway 
2531_156724_000062_000000	train-clean-360	They gathered up the tools and walked along the hedge to the telephone pole which was in one corner of the yard 
none	none	The Phoenix began to uncoil the wire while David gazed up doubtfully at the shadowy maze of lines and insulators on the cross arms
2531_156724_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 Electricity said the Phoenix thoughtfully is a complicated and profound subject 
2531_156724_000063_000001	train-clean-360	There are amperes and there are volts and there are kilowatt hours 
2531_156724_000063_000002	train-clean-360	I might also mention positive and negative and ah all that sort of thing 
2531_156724_000063_000003	train-clean-360	Most profound 
2531_156724_000063_000004	train-clean-360	Perhaps I had better investigate up there 
2531_156724_000063_000005	train-clean-360	Screw driver please 
2531_156724_000064_000000	train-clean-360	The Phoenix took the screw driver in one claw and flew up to the top of the pole 
2531_156724_000064_000001	train-clean-360	David could hear the creak of the lines under the Phoenix s weight and the rattling of the screw driver against the porcelain insulators 
none	none	For some minutes the Phoenix investigated clicking and scraping about and muttering Quite so and There we are Then it fluttered down again and rubbed its wings together The whole situation up there is a lot simpler than I thought it would be my boy 
2531_156724_000065_000001	train-clean-360	The power lines merely come up to the pole on one side pass through the insulators and go away from the pole on the other side 
2531_156724_000065_000002	train-clean-360	Child s play 
2531_156724_000065_000003	train-clean-360	The covering on the lines is rather tough however 
2531_156724_000065_000004	train-clean-360	We shall have to use the wire cutters 
2531_156724_000066_000000	train-clean-360	The Phoenix returned to the top of the pole with the cutters and worked on the wires for five more minutes 
none	none	Bits of debris began to shower down on the hedge 
2531_156724_000066_000002	train-clean-360	One of the wires vibrated on a low note like a slack guitar string 
2531_156724_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 We must not forget the difference between alternating and direct current my boy said the Phoenix as it flew down again 
2531_156724_000067_000001	train-clean-360	 An important problem that 
2531_156724_000067_000002	train-clean-360	Where is our wire 
none	none	Ah there we are 
2531_156724_000067_000004	train-clean-360	The pliers please 
2531_156724_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 Do you need any help up there David asked 
2531_156724_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 No everything is coming along beautifully thank you 
2531_156724_000069_000001	train-clean-360	I shall have everything finished in a flash 
2531_156724_000070_000000	train-clean-360	Trailing one end of the wire in its beak the Phoenix flew up into the darkness once more 
2531_156724_000070_000001	train-clean-360	The tinkering sounds began again and a spurt of falling debris rattled in the leaves of the hedge 
2531_156724_000071_000000	train-clean-360	Suddenly it happened 
2531_156724_000071_000001	train-clean-360	There was a terrific burst of blue light a sharp squawk from the Phoenix and a shower of sparks 
2531_156724_000071_000002	train-clean-360	Another blue flash blazed up 
2531_156724_000071_000003	train-clean-360	The lights in the house and down the whole street flickered and went out 
2531_156724_000071_000004	train-clean-360	In the blackness which followed each stage of the Phoenix s descent could be heard as clearly as cannon shots the twanging and snapping as it tumbled through the wires a drawn out squawk and the flop of wings in the air below the crash into the hedge the jarring thud against the ground 
2531_156724_000071_000005	train-clean-360	Broken wires began to sputter ominously and fire out sparks 
2531_156724_000071_000006	train-clean-360	A smell of singed feathers and burning rubber filled the air 
none	none	Illustration 
2531_156724_000073_000000	train-clean-360	By the light of the sparks David saw the Phoenix staggering to its feet 
2531_156724_000073_000001	train-clean-360	He jumped to the bird s side but the Phoenix waved him away with its wing 
2531_156724_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 Quick my boy it gasped 
2531_156724_000074_000001	train-clean-360	 We must make a strategic retreat 
none	none	Meet me on the ledge in the morning Ouch The Phoenix beat at the smoldering sparks in its tail and flew off leaving a trail of acrid smoke hanging in the air 
2531_156724_000075_000000	train-clean-360	David had the presence of mind to gather up all the tools the wire bell and pushbutton and one of the Phoenix s feathers which had been torn out during the fall 
2531_156724_000075_000001	train-clean-360	He slipped through a cellar window hid the equipment under a stack of old boxes and ran noisily up the stairs into the kitchen 
2531_156724_000076_000000	train-clean-360	 Hey he shouted 
2531_156724_000076_000001	train-clean-360	 The lights are out 
2531_156724_000077_000000	train-clean-360	 Is that you dear came Mother s anxious voice from the dining room 
2531_156724_000078_000000	train-clean-360	 The telephone s dead Dad shouted from the hall 
2531_156724_000079_000000	train-clean-360	Aunt Amy came bumping down the stairs with a candle 
none	none	It s that burglar she cried
2531_156724_000079_000002	train-clean-360	 Turning out all the lights so he can murder us in our beds 
2531_156724_000080_000000	train-clean-360	 Look David shouted the line s broken in our back yard 
2531_156724_000081_000000	train-clean-360	They could hear the wailing of sirens now 
2531_156724_000081_000001	train-clean-360	Fire trucks repair trucks and police cars pulled up in front of the house 
2531_156724_000081_000002	train-clean-360	Everyone in the block turned out to see what had happened 
2531_156724_000081_000003	train-clean-360	It took the repair men an hour to untangle the wires and fix them 
2531_156724_000081_000004	train-clean-360	And all the time policemen were going through the crowd asking questions and writing things down in their notebooks 
none	none	They were looking rather haggard David thought eight In Which David and the Phoenix Visit a Banshee and a Surprise Is Planted in the Enemy s Camp Illustration Next day Mother asked David to help her straighten out the garden which had been trampled by the repair men so he could not go to see the Phoenix until after lunch But when that was finished he rushed up the mountainside as fast as he could wondering all the way what he and the Phoenix were going to do now The ledge was empty when he got there He shouted Phoenix and listened Hel l lp came a faint answering cry from the other end of the ledge David jumped through the thicket A pitiful sight met his eyes There was the Phoenix dangling by one foot from the snare its wings feebly struggling and its free foot clawing the air The feathers of its wings and tail were singed Great beads of sweat rolled from its forehead into a puddle on the ground below The snared foot was blue and swollen Get me down gasped the Phoenix weakly David took a running leap at the sapling which broke under the sudden increase of weight and the two of them crashed to the ground He unfastened the noose and dragged the Phoenix to the shadiest softest spot on the ledge Hoist with my own petard said the Phoenix bitterly Rub my foot will you Oh dear oh dear oh dear Hurts What happened David asked as he rubbed the swollen foot How long have you been caught Missed my way in the dark said the Phoenix wiping its brow Thought I was on the other side of the ledge and landed right on that fool trap Hung there all night and all morning Thought you would never come my boy Oh dear oh dear what a horrible experience My tail was still on fire when I landed too I fully expected to be burned to a crisp A large tear rolled down the Phoenix s beak David murmured soothing words and continued to chafe the Phoenix s foot Does it feel any better now The feeling is coming back my boy said the Phoenix gritting its beak Ouch All pins and needles It flexed its toes gingerly Rub a bit more please Gently The swelling began to go down With a handful of damp grass David soothed the marks left by the noose That stupid Electric Company the Phoenix suddenly burst out Putting everyone in danger with a short circuited power line Let this be a lesson to you my boy Anything worth doing is worth doing well They will hear from us believe me We shall write them a stiff complaint Well Phoenix said David hopefully we can set the snare again if we can find another good sapling and we still have the other one so we re pretty well protected And why couldn t we meet every night by the hedge the way we did last night The bell was a good idea but we could get along without it The Phoenix sighed I suppose you are right my boy There is no use crying over spilt milk One must set one s jaw and good heavens my boy Duck The Phoenix threw itself to the ground and wildly motioned to David to do the same He flattened himself out beside the bird and said What is it Phoenix Down the mountainside whispered the Phoenix Look Do not stick your head over too far David wormed his way to the edge peered down and gasped Below him on the grassy slope at the foot of the scarp was a figure clad in khaki It was the Scientist Do you think he saw us the Phoenix whispered I don t think so David whispered back He s looking off to the left Oh Phoenix what if he comes up here What ll we do Listen hissed the Phoenix run down there Talk to him lead him away distract his attention anything Only be quick All right The Phoenix melted into the thicket and David jumped to his feet As he dashed down the trail his brain whirled with questions What should he do What could he say How could he lead the Scientist away Where would the Phoenix go In his haste he forgot one important thing His foot tripped over the pile of grass and leaves on the trail The released sapling sprang upward the noose tightened with a cruel jerk around his ankle and he was snatched into the air As the blood rushed to his head he lost control of himself and began to struggle wildly and shout at the top of his voice The flat dry voice of the Scientist drifted to him as if through a long tunnel What s all this What are you doing here Who set this snare Get me down David choked Please A hand seized him by the scruff of the neck A knife flashed through the air and cut the rope David landed on his feet but his legs gave way and he dropped to his knees He felt dizzy as the blood rushed away from his head again The Scientist tilted his sun helmet back and said Well well David in a disagreeable tone His eyes narrowed behind the spectacles What is this snare doing here David struggled to his feet and clutched a bush for support Thank you for cutting me down he said The cold blue eyes found David s and held them in a hypnotic stare What is this trap doing here Who set it I I was coming down the trail and and I was caught in it David stammered You are avoiding my question young man said the Scientist Who set this snare Answer me There was a brilliant flash of gold and blue in the sunlight the whistle of feathers cleaving the air the sharp thwock of fisted talons striking The Scientist pitched forward with a surprised grunt and lay still across the trail and the Phoenix executing a flip in the air to check its speed settled down beside David View halloo it shouted excitedly Yoicks and Tallyho Did you see that stoop my boy By Jove the best trained falcon could not have done better Believe me I have been saving that blow for a long time By Jove what a magnificent stoop I think I shall take up Scientist hunting as a regular thing Thank goodness Phoenix David exclaimed Another minute and you would ve been too late But I hope you haven t hurt him very much Nonsense my boy said the Phoenix A head so stuffed with scientific fact cannot be injured He will come to in a short while The Phoenix lifted the Scientist s sun helmet and examined the back of his head A large lump is developing my boy A most pleasant sight I fear the sun helmet is now useless crushed like an eggshell And the Phoenix smiled proudly Illustration Well I hope it isn t serious David said doubtfully Anyway we ll have to do something Precisely my boy But I think we should have a drink first The Phoenix detached a canteen from the Scientist s belt and took a deep swig Ah delicious Our friend is well prepared my boy And indeed the Scientist had all sorts of things with him a hand ax a sheath knife a compass a camera binoculars a stop watch notebooks and pencils a coil of rope maps There was also a packet of sandwiches which the Phoenix opened and began to eat Now listen Phoenix we have to do something Quite right my boy the Phoenix mumbled with its mouth full Have a sandwich spoils of war peanut butter very nourishing The fact is that I have just thought of another plan which cannot fail Have we any money left Yes four gold pieces Why Splendid Now my boy I shall leave you When the Scientist wakes up you will help him down to wherever he lives Find out where his room is I shall meet you by the hedge at midnight Be sure you have the gold pieces with you All right What are we Sure you will not have a sandwich No thank you What are we Very well Farewell then my boy Till midnight David poured what was left in the canteen over the Scientist s head and fanned him with a notebook Presently the man stirred and groaned Then he sat up and muttered What hit me Can you stand up yet David said Too dazed to ask any more questions the Scientist got up groaning put on his broken spectacles collected his scattered equipment and leaned on David The two of them proceeded slowly down the trail together frequently sitting down to rest The Scientist murmured the name of his hotel and pointed out the direction Townspeople stared at them as they passed but no one stopped them or asked questions and they reached the hotel without further incident They entered the lobby and the Scientist sank into a chair Let me help you to your room said David In a few minutes the Scientist got up again and they took the elevator to the fourth floor David closely watched the direction they were going and when they came into the Scientist s room he looked quickly through the window There was a fire escape just outside He had the information now fourth floor west side fire escape by window The Scientist eased himself onto the bed with a groan Then he turned to David and said severely There s something strange about all this and I intend to get to the bottom of it You ll be hearing from me young man All right said David closing the door And you ll be hearing from us he added in an undertone if I know the Phoenix Flying at night was colder than flying by day but it was more thrilling too They whistled through an immense blackness Stars glittered overhead and quicksilver patches of moonlight and shadow flashed across the clouds below They were going to Ireland but why David did not know The Phoenix was playing its wait and see game again In an hour or so they shot out over the edge of the cloud mass and David could see a rocky coast below dark and cold in the half light The Phoenix began to slant down toward it and presently they landed in a little meadow One side of the meadow ran down to a bog filled with reeds and on the other side was a gloomy wood Everything was dark and indistinct but David thought he could tell why the Phoenix had called this the Emerald Isle The grass beneath their feet was the thickest he had ever felt He touched a boulder and found it furry with moss With the wood and the reed choked bog the whole place would be rich with various greens in the daylight Just then they saw a little man approaching them from the wood He was three feet tall dressed all in green and had a long white beard When he reached them he raised his cap politely and said Good evenin to you A fine evening to you my good Leprechaun said the Phoenix Could you kindly tell us Will you have a cigar the Leprechaun interrupted With a surprised Thank you very much the Phoenix took the cigar bit off the end and popped it into its beak The Leprechaun lighted it and the Phoenix puffed away Stick o gum lad said the Leprechaun to David holding out a pack Why yes thank you said David He took the stick of gum from the pack and was immediately sorry for it The stick was made of wood and had a small wire spring like a mouse trap which snapped down on his finger and made him yelp with pain At the same instant the Phoenix s cigar exploded knocking the startled bird backwards into a bush Haw haw haw shouted the Leprechaun rolling on the ground and holding his sides Haw haw haw In a trice the Phoenix had pounced on the Leprechaun and pinned him to the ground Let him up said David furiously I ll punch his head for him I think my boy said the Phoenix coldly that I shall carry the creature up into the clouds and drop him Or should we take him back with us and hand him over to the Scientist Now don t take offense Your Honor said the Leprechaun I thought you d look at it as kind o comic Exceedingly comic said the Phoenix severely I am quite overcome with mirth and merriment But perhaps perhaps I shall let you off lightly if you tell us where the Banshee lives The the Banshee of Mare s Nest Wood The same Speak A new light of respect and fear came into the Leprechaun s eyes She s a terror she is What ll you be wanting None of your business roared the Phoenix Where is she The Leprechaun had begun to tremble Follow the path yonder through the wood until you reach the cave Your Honor You re not friends o hers are you You ll not be telling on me I m real sorry for those jokes Your Honor The Leprechaun s fright was so genuine now that the Phoenix relented and let him go The little creature dashed off like a rabbit into the bog Let that be a lesson to you my boy said the Phoenix Beware the Leprechaun bearing gifts But I wonder why the thought of the Banshee frightened him so They followed the path until they came to the mouth of a cave under a heap of rocks The Phoenix plunged in and David nervously followed The cave turned out to be a long passageway which led after several turns into a chamber From the ceiling of this rocky vault hung an electric light bulb which glared feebly through drifts of smoke All around the walls were wooden boxes stacked up to make shelves and cupboards These were filled with an astonishing array of objects bottles vials alembics retorts test tubes decanters cages boxes jars pots skulls books snake skins wands waxen images pins and needles locks of hair crystal balls playing cards dice witch hazel forks tails of animals spices bottles of ink in several colors clay pipes a small brass scale compasses measuring cups a piggy bank which squealed off and on in a peevish way balls of string and ribbons a pile of magazines called The Warlock Weekly a broken ukulele little heaps of powder colored stones candle ends some potted cacti and an enormous cash register In the middle of the chamber a little hideous crone in a Mother Hubbard crouched over a saucepan stirring it with a wooden spoon The saucepan was resting in the coals of an open fire and smoke and steam together spread out in a murky foul smelling fog The crone peered at them over the top of her spectacles and cackled Come in come in dearies I ll be with you as soon as ever I finish this brew The Phoenix who had been gazing around the chamber in surprise said My dear Banshee since when have you taken up witchcraft This is most unexpected Ah tis the Phoenix exclaimed the hag peering at them again Well fancy that now Och you may well ask and I ll be telling you Tis a poor life being a Banshee long hours and not so much as sixpence in it for a full night s work and I got that sick of it So I changed me trade Sure you ll never make a go of it they told me and at your age they says and once you ve got your station in life they says there s no changing it It s in the prime of me life I am says I and I ll not be changing me mind for all your cackling says I and if certain mouths don t shut up says I I ll cast spells that ll make certain people wish they were dead That set them back on their heels you may be sure Well twas the best decision of me life The money pours in like sorrows to a widow and I ll be retiring within the year to live out my days like a proper queen Then the Banshee caught sight of David and hobbled over to him peering into his frightened eyes Ah the wee darling she crooned the plump little mannikin What a broth he d make to be sure She pinched his arm and he started back in terror So firm and plump to make the mouth water Sell him to me Phoenix Nonsense said the Phoenix sharply What we desire At this instant the contents of the saucepan began to hiss and bubble Whoops dearies the brew is boiling shrieked the Banshee and she hobbled back to the fire to resume her work She looked in a recipe book stirred clapped her hands sang hair raising incantations in a quavery voice and added a pinch of salt and sulfur She sprinkled spices from a shaker waved her wand popped in a dead toad and fanned up the fire with an ostrich plume Illustration Now for the hard part she said grinning at them toothlessly She measured out a spoonful of green powder weighed it in the scales and flung it into the saucepan There was a loud explosion A huge blast of steam flared out and engulfed them When it had cleared they saw the Banshee tilting the saucepan over a small bottle One ruby drop of fluid fell into the bottle It darted forth rays of light as it fell and tinkled like a silver coin rolling down flights of marble steps Illustration The Banshee corked the bottle and held it up proudly to the light Will you look at that now she crooned The finest ever I brewed Ah the mystic droplet Some swain will be buying that now and putting it in a lassie s cup o tea and she ll be pining away for love of him before the day s out She put the bottle on the shelf pasted a label on it and turned to them with a businesslike air Now dearies what ll you be wanting Philtres Poison I ve a special today only five shillings a vial A spell What about your fortunes one shilling if seen in the crystal ball one and six if read from the palm A hex I ve the finest in six counties A ticket to the Walpurgis Night Ball We want a Wail said the Phoenix And we shall accept nothing but the best and loudest you have Ah a Banshee s Wail is it cried the hag You ve come to the right shop dearies to be sure Now let me see She hobbled to a shelf which contained a row of boxes ran her finger along them stopped at one and took it down Here we are key of C sharp two minutes long only five shillings threepence No no said the Phoenix A larger one We have something more than mice to frighten A bigger one Och here s a lovely one now five minutes long ascending scale with a sob at the end guaranteed to scare a statue Yours for ten and six I call that a real bargain now Bah said the Phoenix impatiently Enough of these squeaks We want a real Wail my dear Banshee such a Wail as never before was heard on the face of this earth And stop this babbling about shillings and pence We are prepared to pay in gold The Phoenix took the four pieces of gold from David and carelessly tossed them into the air The Banshee s eyes flew wide open and she twirled herself around like a top Och the sweet music of its tinkling she exclaimed The lovely sheen of light upon it There s a sight for eyes used to naught but silver Ah but dearies I ve no Wail worth four pieces of gold I ll have to make one up special She hobbled rapidly around the chamber until she had found a box as large as a bird cage and an ear trumpet She opened the box shook it to make sure it was empty and put in two heads of cabbage Such monstrous appetites these Wails do have she explained She fastened the lid carefully with a catch lock and inserted the ear trumpet in a hole in one side of the box Then she disappeared through a sound proof door which they had not seen before on account of the smoke Fifteen minutes later the Banshee came out with the box plugging up the hole in its side with a bit of wax She was pale and trembling and beads of sweat covered her face She smiled weakly at them seized an earthen ware jug and drained it in one gulp The color began to return to her face Wsssht she gasped wiping her brow with the sleeve of her Mother Hubbard Ah dearies that was the effort of me life Tis a Wail to make one burst with pride though I do say it meself Thirteen minutes long by the clock with a range of ten octaves Twould frighten the Old Nick himself Splendid said the Phoenix The fact is I sometimes suspect that that is precisely with whom we are dealing at home The light suddenly dawned on David Phoenix he cried I bet we re going to give the Wail to the Scientist Precisely my boy The Phoenix beamed Oh golly golly golly David sang as he danced around And I ll guarantee it dearies the Banshee cackled One hundred per cent satisfaction or your money back Defeat and confusion to the enemy the Phoenix shouted giving the special squawk which was its battle cry The Banshee received her gold The Phoenix told David for goodness sake not to drop the box or let the lid pop open or they would regret it to their dying day David hearing the rustle of the Wail as it ravenously attacked the cabbages inside the box assured the Phoenix that he would be careful The Banshee said Ah Phoenix do sell the laddie to me but her tone was more teasing than serious and they all laughed Good bys were said all round and David and the Phoenix left The last thing they heard as they felt their way up the dark passage was the happy cackling of the Banshee and the clang of the cash register They got back to the hotel before dawn and very carefully crept down the fire escape into the Scientist s room They put the box on the bedside table stuck out their tongues at the sleeping Scientist and crept out again Then they went home the Phoenix to the ledge and David to bed where he fell asleep instantly The Wail was wildly successful The Scientist released it from its box at seven o clock in the morning People living in the hotel thought the world had come to its end The rest of the town wondered if it was a riot or an earthquake or both with three steam calliopes thrown in for good measure David who lived twelve blocks from the hotel stirred in his sleep and dreamed he was riding a fire engine Even the Phoenix claimed later that a kind of moan was borne on the breeze all the way up to the ledge The hotel burst into activity like a kicked anthill People poured down the fire escapes shot out through the doors lowered themselves into the street with ropes of knotted blankets Others barricaded themselves in their rooms by piling furniture against the doors and windows One guest found his way to the cellar and hid in an ash can for two days The manager crawled into the office safe and locked the door without even bothering to remember that he was the only one who knew the combination The telephone exchange was jammed as calls flooded in to mobilize the Boy Scouts the Red Cross the Salvation Army the National Guard and the Volunteer Flood Control Association When the Wail finally died out which was not until seven thirty because it had devoured both cabbages during the night and had grown to more than twice its original size the police entered the hotel in force armed to the eyebrows They found nothing At the end of a three hour search the Chief handed in his resignation As for the Scientist he disappeared completely A farmer living three miles out of town said he saw a man dressed in a nightshirt and head bandage running down the valley road The farmer guessed the man s speed to be thirty five miles an hour But he added there was such a cloud of dust being raised that he could not see very well It might have been fifty miles an hour he said No one doubted him Illustration nine In Which David and the Phoenix Call On a Faun and a Lovely Afternoon Comes to a Strange End Illustration The Phoenix was dead tired And no wonder all in one week it had escaped from Gryffons raced with a Witch made round trip flights to the Pacific Isles and Ireland been caught in a snare got burned by a short circuit and been knocked down by an exploding cigar Even a bird as strong as the Phoenix cannot do all these things without needing a rest So the traveling part of David s education was stopped for a while to let the Phoenix recover The days went by pleasantly on the ledge Summer was at its height The sun fell on them with just the right amount of warmth as they lolled on the grass The air was filled with a lazy murmuring Listen the murmuring seemed to say don t talk don t think close your eyes and listen Below them the whole valley danced and wavered in the heat waves so that it seemed to be under water There were long lazy conversations that began nowhere and ended nowhere the wonderful kind in which you say whatever comes to your head without fear of being misunderstood because what you say has little importance anyway The Phoenix told of the times and adventures it had had Of the forgotten corners of the world where life went on as it had from the beginning and of friends who lived there Of Trolls who mined metal from the earth and made from it wondrous machines which whirred and clattered and clanked and did absolutely nothing The best kind of machine after all my boy since they injure no one and there is nothing to worry about when they break down Of Unicorns Excellent chaps but so frightfully melancholy which shone white in the sun and tossed their ivory horns like rapiers Of a Dragon who having no treasure to guard got together a pathetic heap of colored pebbles in its cave And really he came to believe in time that they were absolutely priceless and went about with a worried frown of responsibility on his brow David in turn told the Phoenix about the games he used to play when he lived in the flat country and all about school and Mother and Dad and Aunt Amy and Beckie He could not help laughing now and then over the Scientist s defeat But whenever this came up the Phoenix would shake its head with a kind of sad wisdom My boy there are certain things such as head colds and forgetting where you have left your keys which are inevitable and I am afraid that the Scientist is too Oh Phoenix you don t think he ll come back do you Yes my boy I do I can see the whole train of events He will recover from his fright He will be curious about the Wail and will return to investigate it Once here he will remember us and we shall have to take him into account once more Oh Do you think it ll happen soon Oh no my boy nothing to worry about for the time being But we must remember that it will happen some day Yes I guess you re right I think he s hateful I cannot disagree with you there my boy Of course I have no doubt that in general the advancement of science is all to the good Knowledge is power But on days like this I sometimes wonder Does it not seem to you that the highest aim in life at the moment is to enjoy the sunlight and allow others to do the same You re right Phoenix but then you always are I was just thinking the same thing It s funny I mean well you know Why can t people leave other people alone and and well just enjoy themselves and lie in the sun and listen to the wind That is the way of the world my boy Getting and spending and all that sort of thing But come Why should we worry over the follies of the rest of the world A day like this was made for living not thinking Begone dull care And they would forget the Scientist and watch a pair of butterflies chase each other instead But one day the Phoenix suddenly stood up with a startled expression on its face My dear chap it exclaimed I have just remembered Tomorrow What about tomorrow Why my boy tomorrow another century rounds its mark To be brief tomorrow is my birthday My five hundredth birthday Well congratulations Phoenix Thank you my boy Five hundred Destiny Have I mentioned before my boy that I have a magnificent destiny No What is it Phoenix I well it is strange my boy but I do not know but that it is magnificent no one can doubt Do I have one too Of course my boy We all do David was glad of that He did not know exactly what a destiny was however and he tried to think of how one would look But the only picture which came to his mind was that of a small mousy creature his destiny looking up in admiration to a splendid thing of flame and gold dazzling to the eyes the Phoenix s mysterious destiny He said We ll have to do something special tomorrow to celebrate Phoenix The Phoenix looked thoughtful I think we had better do whatever we are going to do today it said Well we can do something today and tomorrow then said David After all a birthday only comes once a year and it seems a shame to spend only one day on it Especially when it s a five hundredth birthday Tomorrow said the Phoenix doubtfully I have a strange feeling my boy for once I find myself unable to explain most odd most odd five hundredth birthday Ah well it went on more cheerfully I shall undoubtedly remember later The pressing question is what shall we do now David got up thought for a while and suddenly flung his arms wide Oh Phoenix he cried it s such a beautiful day I wish it could go on forever Couldn t we go somewhere somewhere where we oh I don t know I can t explain it Anywhere you say Phoenix The Phoenix looked at him for a long time I think I understand my boy Yes How about one of the forgotten places I told you about Should you like to meet a Faun It was a green valley completely enclosed by the barren mountains which towered above it At one end a waterfall hung on the face of a cliff a misty thread pouring into a rainbow arched pool A brook serpentined through fields and groves of trees There were flocks of sheep and goats in the fields Here and there were strange ruins of marble and red granite columns peristyles benches carved with lions heads and pedestals They landed in a little glade and David got down in silent wonderment The very stillness of the air was enchanted The grass dappled with sun and shadow wore a mantle of flowers Clouds of butterflies sprang up at their approach and swirled about them To their right stood two broken columns half hidden beneath a wild tangle of vine and clusters of purple grapes Beyond was the forest dark and cool and silent with shafts of sunlight in it like golden spears pinning the forest floor to earth There was no breeze And as David stood there scarcely daring to breathe they heard the sound of shepherd pipes coming from the edge of the wood It was a minor tune but somehow lilting too with the rippling of water in it and the laughter of birds flying high and the whisper of reeds as they bend together by the edge of streams and the gaiety of crickets by night and the pouring of summer rain The piping died away and the Phoenix beckoned to the spellbound David Together they walked across the glade leaving behind them a wake of swirling butterflies An immense oak stood at the edge of the forest At its foot on a bed of moss sat the Faun He was the same size as David From the waist down he was covered with shaggy hair like a goat s and instead of feet he had cloven hooves The hair on his head was black and curly and tumbled around small pointed ears and a pair of short horns His eyes were slanted slightly upward and he had a pointed chin and a snub nose The Faun waved his pipes saucily at the Phoenix and gave a wry smile Hullo Phoenix Back again to honor us with your wit and wisdom What gems of advice have you got for us now My dear Faun said the Phoenix stiffly I have brought my friend David who is acquiring an education We The Faun smiled at David Want to race he said Sure said David Where to One moment harrumphed the Phoenix What we Down to that pedestal and back said the Faun All right Wait till I tie my shoe The Phoenix harrumphed again This is all very well in its place but we should Ready said the Faun One two three go Illustration They dashed for the stone marker It was an even race until they reached the pedestal but there David tried to turn without slowing down slipped on the grass and went sprawling on his hands and knees The Faun knew better He sprang at the pedestal with both hooves bounced from it like a spring and began to race back to the oak But then he too fell tripping over a vine and David shot past him and touched the oak one jump ahead of him shouting First They sat down on the moss panting The Faun said You can really run I m sorry you fell Well you fell too so that makes us even said David They looked at each other and for some reason burst out laughing They rolled around on the moss and laughed until tears came while the Phoenix fidgeted in reproachful silence When they had calmed down a little the Faun said Can you dance No said David I wish I could though The educational value of dancing is practically nil the Phoenix began severely I advise Sure you can dance said the Faun Listen He brought the pipes to his lips and began to play And much to his surprise and delight David found himself dancing as though he had never done anything else in his life The wonderful thing was that he did not have to think about what he was doing the music was doing it all for him He saw that even the Phoenix was shuffling around in time to the piping and looking very embarrassed about it too There said the Faun when they had finished you can dance and very well Even old Phoenix can dance Suddenly he jumped up and cried Let s go come on and started to run David followed not knowing where they were going and not caring The Phoenix came after them half running and half flying to keep up They raced across the glade through a stand of trees and out into the meadow beyond There they came to a bank of daisies and threw themselves into the middle of it and began to pelt each other with blossoms The Phoenix finally caught up in the spirit of it collected a huge bunch while they were wrestling flew suddenly over them and drowned them beneath a deluge of flowers Near by was the stream They splashed in the shallows skipped pebbles over the surface and dug a harbor with two dikes in the sandy part of the shore The Faun showed David how to build little boats of reeds and the Phoenix made them sail by blowing up a wind with its wings They had a tree climbing contest which David won because his feet were better than hooves for standing on branches But the Faun won the jumping contest because of the tremendous spring in his legs They came out even in the handstand somersault and skin the cat contest And the Phoenix won when they played skip rope with a piece of vine because it could hover in the air with its wings while the vine swished over and under They had fun with the sheep and goats too The Faun made the animals dance and caper to a tune from his pipes and showed David how to ride on the rams You crept up very quietly from behind jumped suddenly on their backs got a quick grip around their necks and away in a rush It was almost as good as flying except that you got jolted off sooner or later Then watch out it took some quick dodging to escape the horns of the angry rams They left the goats alone because of their sharper horns and the wicked look in their eyes I know where some pictures are said the Faun Come on And he led them to a kind of glade ringed with shattered columns The ground there was covered with moss and drifts of leaves They each got a stick to clear away the debris and uncovered a beautiful mosaic pavement It was made of bits of colored stone and tile which were arranged to make pictures There were scenes of youths treading out wine minstrels with lyres gods with curly hair and a beast which was half man and half horse There were maidens dancing to flute and drums hunters battling with boars and lions warriors clashing with sword and shield and spear There were series of pictures telling stories of wonders and adventures in far distant lands voyages wars conquests The Faun proudly pointed out a picture of other Fauns dancing with Nymphs The Phoenix gazed very thoughtfully at some scenes of a bird building and sitting in a nest of flames But the last pictures of this story had been broken up by roots so they could not see how it ended When they came to the end of the valley where the rainbow arched over the pool David told them of the pot of gold which is supposed to be at the foot of rainbows They looked for it but without success because the rainbow disappeared whenever they got too close to it So David and the Faun contented themselves with jumping into the pool and ducking each other and making bubbly noises while the Phoenix who could not swim stood on the shore and beamed at them They picked ferns from under the waterfall and made wreaths and garlands which they threw at the Phoenix s head like quoits The Faun showed them a certain place to shout from if you wanted to hear an echo The Phoenix shouted A stitch in time saves nine and the echo dolorously answered A switch is fine for crime Wet and tired from splashing in the pool they stretched out in the sun to dry A grapevine grew near them and they gorged themselves on the fruit smearing their faces and hands with purple And David closed his eyes and thought Now I m having a dream and so is the Phoenix We re all dreaming the same thing and living in the dream and I wish oh I wish none of us will ever wake up But he had just opened his eyes again when the Faun leaped to his feet and cried Listen and flicked his pointed ears forward like a cat David stood up and said in a puzzled voice I don t hear anything He noticed that the Phoenix had also got up and was listening uncomfortably to whatever it was Listen Oh listen cried the Faun There was a joyous light in his eyes as he leaned forward with his lips slightly parted straining toward the mysterious silence Suddenly he shouted I m coming I m coming and dashed off into the wood Good heavens muttered the Phoenix I had forgotten about this Let us go home my boy A strange uncontrollable trembling had seized David s legs He still could hear nothing but some feeling some hint of an unknown tremendous event hung quivering in the air about them and sent little electric thrills racing up and down his whole body Oh Phoenix what is it what is it he whispered I think we had best be going my boy said the Phoenix anxiously Come along Phoenix But he heard it now It came whispering toward them the sound of pipes caroling pipes such as the Faun had played but greater as an organ is greater than a flute The wild sweet sound rose and fell swelled like a full choir diminished into one soprano voice that pierced David through and through caressing and tugging calling Come come run run Phoenix David cried Oh Phoenix listen listen Run run the pipes whispered Let us go home my boy said the Phoenix warningly Come come cried the pipes They could be resisted no longer In a transport of joy David shouted I m coming and raced away toward the sound There was nothing in his mind now nothing in the whole world but a desire to be near those pipes He must run like the winds leap and shout roll in the grass throw himself down flowered slopes follow that magic music wherever it should lead He fled blindly through the wood heedless of the branches which whipped his face and the thorns which tore at his legs The pipes were calling more loudly now Run run faster faster Then the Phoenix plunged to earth in front of him threw out both wings and shouted Stop Let me go Phoenix David cried Let me by I want to run I must run He made a desperate effort to push past the outstretched wings But the Phoenix flung him to the ground picked him up before he could kick once and threw him on its back Then they were flying at full speed dodging through gaps in the branches and between close set trunks with leaves and twigs slashing them from every side They burst out of the wood and sped over a meadow David saw below them a huge Faun like figure pacing majestically across the sward A flaming wreath encircled its brow garlands of flowers hung from its arms and shoulders and those enchanted pipes were lifted to its lips Around the cloven hooves and trailing out behind danced a multitude of creatures lambs and kids gamboling goats and rams tossing their horns foxes furry waves of squirrels rabbits kicking up their heels Fauns and Nymphs rollicking frogs and crickets and serpents Above them flew birds and butterflies and beetles and bats in swirling clouds Full voiced the glorious pipes sang Come come run run Follow leap and dance adore and obey Run oh run heed me before all passes Follow before it is too late too late too late Illustration And David in a delirium of desire shouted I m coming and jumped from the Phoenix s back For an instant as he fell through the air he thought he would succeed in joining the dancing throng But the Phoenix plunging after him falconwise with folded wings seized his collar in its talons and snatched him up from the very arms of the Faun who had recognized him and called his name as he fell Up toward the cloudless sky they soared David cried pleaded pommeled the Phoenix with his fists The Phoenix ignored his struggling and continued to climb with tremendous wing strokes Up and up and up The piping grew fainter in the distance its magic weakened The enchanted dancers diminished into specks the valley fell away until it was only a green splash nestled among the jagged peaks And David burst into tears and then wondered why he was crying and tried to remember and could not The trembling left his body and he dangled limply His eyes closed ten In Which a Five Hundredth Birthday Is Celebrated and the Phoenix Bows to Tradition Illustration That s funny said David rubbing his eyes and looking around in a puzzled way Where are we Phoenix Home is the sailor home from the hill the Phoenix said And the hunter home from the sea Or is it the other way around At any rate we are home my boy And so they were Weren t we playing with a Faun just now Quite so But there was something else David said Something Didn t somebody say Follow before it is too late or something like that Did we follow I can t remember No my boy By the time one hears that it is already too late Oh Too late for what he wondered Oh well He sighed and fell to daydreaming A cough from the Phoenix brought him back Beg your pardon I have never seen you so thoughtful my boy However I believe I know what you are thinking about It is a difficult problem is it not Yes I was just thinking what you could get me for a birthday present interrupted the Phoenix Am I not correct David who had not even given this a thought until now flushed Aha said the Phoenix triumphantly Just as I thought Believe me my dear fellow when you have been around as long as I have you can read the minds of your friends as easily as a book Now the problem of what to give is a hard one at any time but the problem of what to give for a five hundredth birthday is even harder A monogrammed ash tray I do not receive cigars often enough to make that practical A hand knitted sweater It would not fit they never do A gold plated watch chain I have no watch No the best idea would be to get me something which I can use Certainly Phoenix David stammered What do you want then Ah We have reached the kernel of the problem And the answer my boy is this cinnamon Cinnamon Precisely Also a box of matches the kind that strike anywhere you know Well all right It doesn t sound like much of a present but if that s what you really want What are you going to do with them Phoenix I mean if you don t mind my asking The plain fact is my boy said the Phoenix doubtfully the plain fact is well I do not know Odd But something tells me I shall need them Well it will come to me in the morning no doubt And then of course I shall be very glad to have them on hand All right cinnamon and matches then And I ll get some no I won t tell you that It ll be a surprise A surprise Splendid my boy You could not I suppose drop me a small hint No But of course not one hint and my powerful Intellect could guess everything and then the surprise would be spoiled Well until tomorrow then Illustration That evening David shut himself in his room and robbed his bank It was a squat cast iron box with A Penny Saved Is A Penny Earned in raised letters on one side The only way to open it was to smash it with a crowbar but it could be emptied It had to be tilted just so with a knife blade in the slot to catch the coins and guide them out This is what David did with a bread knife borrowed from the kitchen It was a slow uncertain job and one coin he guessed it was a dime by the way it rattled never did come out But the rest which included his change from Uncle Charles s present would be enough Early next morning he went to the store and bought three large boxes of stick cinnamon two cans of powdered cinnamon and a huge box of matches For the surprise he got a whole quart of strawberry ice cream with a piece of dry ice to keep it from melting He wanted to buy a cake too and candles but there was not enough money left Then he remembered that a new batch of cookies had been baked at home yesterday which would have to do instead He wrapped the cinnamon and matches up in a neat package with white paper tied it in a blue ribbon and wrote on it To Feenix Happy five hundred Birthday from David Then he took all the cookies from the jar borrowed two plates and spoons put everything into a large paper bag and set out for the Phoenix s ledge He was surprised to find the Phoenix working busily in the middle of a wide place on the ledge Apparently the bird had been at it all night for a huge pile of sticks and brush had been heaped up on the ground and shaped roughly like a nest Right now the Phoenix was struggling with a small log trying to get it on the pile Hello Phoenix Happy birthday Ah there my boy Thank you very much Could you kindly give me a hand with this log They heaved and grunted the piece of wood to the top of the pile and David said What s this for Phoenix This my boy is a pyre A bit untidy around the edges but nonetheless a pyre Oh said David What s that Well a pyre you know a sort of fire as it were Oh fire I thought you said oh yes Fire Isn t it awfully warm for a fire The weather is unusually tropical said the Phoenix cocking one eye toward the sun This fire however is necessary but I shall explain later Meanwhile if you will just aid me with this branch And for the next fifteen minutes they worked over the heap adding to it and shaping it up David kept his thoughts to himself He could see that the Phoenix knew what it was doing so everything must be all right By the way my boy said the Phoenix casually when they had finished my prediction was correct I knew it would be The inevitable has occurred What are you talking about Phoenix The Scientist my boy He is in our midst once more David clutched a branch in the heap and said Oh Phoenix in a frightened voice Now my dear fellow there is no cause for alarm He is not nearby at present I sent him back Sent him back How Nothing to it my boy said the Phoenix smugly He was up at the crack of dawn toiling with typical stupidity in full sight on the slope below He was making a blind of green branches to hide in while he spies on me Really the childishness of his efforts To think for a minute he could fool me with such tricks Well I waited until he had gone down the slope to cut more greenery and when his back was turned I slipped down to the blind and took his binoculars But Phoenix what did you want with his binoculars I did not want his binoculars my boy but he did His language when he discovered the loss was simply frightful I could hear it all the way up here Of course he had to return to town for another pair But he ll be back Precisely my boy But he will have something to keep him busy when he returns I took the liberty of destroying his blind That will hold him But it won t hold him long Phoenix We ve got to think of something else Now your whole birthday is spoiled On the contrary my boy it will hold him long enough Now please do not ask me why you must take my word for it and I shall explain later And my birthday is not spoiled I am looking forward with a great deal of pleasure to the surprise which you promised me Come let us enjoy it whatever it is and forget the Scientist Well are you sure about the Scientist Absolutely The Phoenix was so positive that David began to feel better He picked up the paper bag and said Well it isn t much of a surprise really just a birthday party And your present But I think the present should come after the party don t you Quite so my boy But I shall leave the management of the whole affair in your capable hands All right said David Now you ll have to turn around Phoenix and not look while I m getting it ready The Phoenix obediently turned around clasping its wings behind its back and tried hard not to peek David set the party things out on the grass ice cream in the middle the cookies in a ring around it plates on either side and spoons beside the plates He set the Phoenix s present off to one side where it could be reached when they had finished All right Phoenix you can turn around now The Phoenix took a long look at everything and said huskily My dear chap this is quite the nicest moment of my life How can I possibly thank you They sat down in their places David passed the cookies and served the ice cream and said that as far as he was concerned this was the best birthday party he had ever been to And the Phoenix said Quite so my boy but might I make so bold as to ask why And David answered Well the reason is that usually during birthday parties you have to play stupid games like pin the tail on the donkey and button button who has the button in spite of the fact that eating good things is the real reason for having a party as everybody knows And the Phoenix said Precisely my boy but people have somehow lost the main idea of the thing When you come right down to it ice cream is the basis of any sensible party and everything else is a waste of time And David said Yes Phoenix but don t forget cake and cookies and candy and nuts and things They re not as good as ice cream but they re not a complete waste of time either And the Phoenix said Of course not my dear fellow they are important too And speaking of ice cream have you noticed that while chocolate is very good and vanilla enjoys great popularity still there is nothing like strawberry And David said Yes you re right rather sadly because the Phoenix was eating most of it At last the ice cream carton was empty and all the cookies were gone They both sighed regretfully and brushed away the crumbs And the Phoenix looked hopefully at the present David had brought Happy birthday Phoenix David said and he handed the gift over with a little bow Thank you my boy thank you The Phoenix opened the package eagerly and gave a pleased cry Just what I wanted my dear chap I m glad you like it David said Do you know yet what it s for Can you really use it for something The Phoenix suddenly stopped smiling and looked at David with a strange expression on its face an expression David had never seen there before A vague dread swept through him and he faltered Phoenix you do know what it s for What is it Tell me Well my boy well the fact is yes I do know It came to me this morning while I was constructing the ah nest here I am afraid it will be a bit hard to explain The cinnamon ah the cinnamon well cinnamon branches are what I should really have But Phoenix what s it for Behold my boy The Phoenix opened the boxes and spread the cinnamon sticks on the nest Then it took the cans and sprinkled the cinnamon powder over the top and sides of the heap until the whole nest was a brick dust red There we are my boy said the Phoenix sadly The traditional cinnamon pyre of the Phoenix celebrated in song and story And with the third mention of the word pyre David s legs went weak and something seemed to catch in his throat He remembered now where he had heard that word before It was in his book of explorers and it meant it meant Phoenix he choked wh wh who is the pyre for For myself said the Phoenix Phoenix Now I implore you please oh dear I knew it would be difficult to explain Look at me my boy David did as he was told although his eyes were filled with tears and he could not see through the blur Now said the Phoenix gently the fact is that I have besides my unusually acute Intellect an Instinct This Instinct told me that it was my birthday today It also told me to build this nest of cinnamon Now it tells me that I must make this nest my pyre because that is what the Phoenix does at the end of five hundred years Now please my boy I admit it does not appear to be a very joyful way of celebrating but it must be done This is the traditional end of the Phoenix my boy and we cannot ignore the tradition no matter what our feelings may be Do you see No David cried Please Phoenix don t do it It s horrible I won t let you do it But I must my dear chap I cannot help it This is what it means to be the Phoenix Nothing can stop the tradition Please my boy do not take on so It is not in the least horrible I assure you My Instinct tells me so You said you were going to give me an education David sobbed You said we would see you said and we ve only been on four adventures you never told me about this I am terribly sorry my boy I could not tell you about it because I did not know about it until now As for your education it is a pity to have it cut short in this way I had great plans But consider you have had four adventures which no one else in the whole world has had And besides my boy we shall see each other again I do not know how or where but I am positive of it The Phoenix flicked a tear from its eye with the tip of one wing while with the other it patted David awkwardly on the shoulder Don t go Phoenix please don t go I must my boy Here permit me to present you with a small token ouch of our friendship Dimly through his tears David saw the Phoenix pluck the longest bluest feather from its tail and he felt it being pressed into his hand Good by David said the Phoenix gruffly David could stand it no longer He turned and rushed blindly from the Phoenix blundered into the thicket and dropped to the ground with his head buried in his arms Behind him he heard the sticks snapping as the Phoenix mounted its pyre A match rasped against the box The first tongue of flame sizzled in the branches David pressed his hands over his ears to shut out the sound but he could feel the heat of the flames as they sprang up And the noise would not be shut out It grew and grew popping crackling roaring until it seemed to fill the world Perhaps he fainted Or perhaps from numbness he slipped into a kind of deep sleep Whichever it was he returned to consciousness again suddenly His hands had slipped from his ears and a sound had brought him back He lifted his head and listened The fire had burnt itself out now The only noise was the hiss and pop of dying embers But these sounds were too gentle to have awakened him it must have been something else Yes it was a voice He could hear it quite plainly now There were angry shouts coming from somewhere below the ledge Carefully avoiding the sight of the pyre David crawled to the edge and glanced over Far down on the slope at the foot of the scarp was a tiny figure dancing and bellowing with rage The Scientist had returned and discovered the ruins of his blind David watched him dully No need to worry about him any more How harmless he looked now even ridiculous David turned away He noticed then that he was holding something in his hand something soft and heavy As he lifted it to look more closely it flashed in the sunlight It was the feather the Phoenix had given him the tail feather Tail feather But the Phoenix s tail had been a sapphire blue The feather in his hand was of the purest palest gold There was a slight stir behind him In spite of himself he glanced at the remains of the pyre His mouth dropped open In the middle of the white ashes and glowing coals there was movement Something within was struggling up toward the top The noises grew stronger and more definite Charred sticks were being snapped ashes kicked aside embers pushed out of the way Now like a plant thrusting its way out of the soil there appeared something pale and glittering which nodded in the breeze Little tongues of flame it seemed licking out into the air No not flames A crest of golden feathers A heave from below lifted the ashes in the center of the pile a fine cloud of flakes swirled up into the breeze there was a flash of sunlight glinting on brilliant plumage And from the ruins of the pyre stepped forth a magnificent bird It was the Phoenix it must be the Phoenix But it was a new and different Phoenix It was young and wild with a fierce amber eye its crest was tall and proud its body the slim muscular body of a hunter its wings narrow and long and pointed like a falcon s the great beak and talons razor sharp and curving And all of it from crest to talons was a burnished gold that reflected the sun in a thousand dazzling lights The bird stretched its wings shook the ash from its tail and began to preen itself Every movement was like the flash of a silent explosion Phoenix David whispered Phoenix The bird started turned toward him looked at him for an instant with wild fearless eyes then continued its preening Suddenly it stopped and cocked its head as if listening to something Then David heard it too a shout down the mountainside louder and clearer now excited and jubilant He shivered and looked down The Scientist was tearing up the goat trail as fast as his long legs would carry him and he was waving a rifle Phoenix David cried Fly Fly Phoenix The bird looked at the Scientist then at David its glance curious but without understanding Paralyzed with fear David remained on his knees as the Scientist reached an open place and threw the gun up to his shoulder The bullet went whining by with an ugly hornet noise and the report of the gun echoed along the scarp Illustration Fly Phoenix David sobbed A second bullet snarled at the bird and spattered out little chips of rock from the inner wall of the ledge Oh fly fly David jumped up and flung himself between the bird and the Scientist It s me he cried It s David The bird gazed at him closely and a light flickered in its eye as though the name had reached out and almost but not quite touched an ancient memory Hesitantly it stretched forth one wing and with the tip of it lightly brushed David s forehead leaving there a mark that burned coolly Get away from that bird you little idiot the Scientist shrieked GET AWAY David ignored him Fly Phoenix he cried and he pushed the bird toward the edge Understanding dawned in the amber eyes at last The bird with one clear defiant cry leaped to an out jutting boulder The golden wings spread the golden neck curved back the golden talons pushed against the rock The bird launched itself into the air and soared out over the valley sparkling flashing shimmering a flame large as a sunburst a meteor a diamond a star diminishing at last to a speck of gold dust which glimmered twice in the distance before it was gone altogether The Author Edward Ormondroyd When Edward Ormondroyd was about thirteen his family moved from Pennsylvania to Ann Arbor Michigan He and a friend began to read Arthur Ransome s boating stories and inspired by the adventures of the Swallows built their own fourteen foot sailboat and tried to re create that English magic on the Huron River In nineteen forty three he graduated from high school and joined the Navy Destroyer Escort four hundred nineteen was his home for the next two years When the war was over she looked in on China and Korea and came home She did show me San Francisco Bay at dusk One look convinced me that I would like to live by it and I have ever since After the war mister Ormondroyd went to the University of California at Berkeley He graduated in nineteen fifty one and since then has been busy writing sailing as able seaman aboard a tanker and working as a bookstore clerk and machine tender He lives in Berkeley California He is married and has one son It was while mister Ormondroyd was at college that David and the Phoenix first intruded into his consciousness One day when I was walking across campus I had a sudden vision of a large and pompous bird diving out of a window tripping on the sill and falling into a rose arbor below I had to explain to myself why the poor bird was in such a situation in the first place and what became of it afterwards The result of my investigation was DAVID AND THE PHOENIX David and the Phoenix Edward Ormondroyd Illustrated by Joan Raysor David knew that one should be prepared for anything when one climbs a mountain but he never dreamed what he would find that June morning on the mountain ledge There stood an enormous bird with a head like an eagle a neck like a swan and a scarlet crest The most astonishing thing was that the bird had an open book on the ground and was reading from it This was David s first sight of the fabulous Phoenix and the beginning of a pleasant and profitable partnership The Phoenix found a great deal lacking in David s education he flunked questions like How do you tell a true from a false Unicorn and undertook to supplement it with a practical education an education that would be a preparation for Life The education had to be combined with offensive and defensive measures against a Scientist who was bent on capturing the Phoenix but the two projects together involved exciting and hilarious adventures for boy and bird A wonderful read aloud book adventurous and very funny with much of the magic as well as the humor of the fantastic Follett Publishing Company New York
