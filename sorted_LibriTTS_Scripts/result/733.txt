Edward Gibbon With notes by the reverend H H Milman Volume three Chapter XXVII Civil Wars Reign Of Theodosius Part I Death Of Gratian Ruin Of Arianism saint Ambrose First Civil War Against Maximus Character Administration And Penance Of Theodosius Death Of Valentinian II Second Civil War Against Eugenius Death Of Theodosius The fame of Gratian before he had accomplished the twentieth year of his age was equal to that of the most celebrated princes His gentle and amiable disposition endeared him to his private friends the graceful affability of his manners engaged the affection of the people the men of letters who enjoyed the liberality acknowledged the taste and eloquence of their sovereign his valor and dexterity in arms were equally applauded by the soldiers and the clergy considered the humble piety of Gratian as the first and most useful of his virtues The victory of Colmar had delivered the West from a formidable invasion and the grateful provinces of the East ascribed the merits of Theodosius to the author of his greatness and of the public safety Gratian survived those memorable events only four or five years but he survived his reputation and before he fell a victim to rebellion he had lost in a great measure the respect and confidence of the Roman world The remarkable alteration of his character or conduct may not be imputed to the arts of flattery which had besieged the son of Valentinian from his infancy nor to the headstrong passions which the that gentle youth appears to have escaped A more attentive view of the life of Gratian may perhaps suggest the true cause of the disappointment of the public hopes His apparent virtues instead of being the hardy productions of experience and adversity were the premature and artificial fruits of a royal education The anxious tenderness of his father was continually employed to bestow on him those advantages which he might perhaps esteem the more highly as he himself had been deprived of them and the most skilful masters of every science and of every art had labored to form the mind and body of the young prince one The knowledge which they painfully communicated was displayed with ostentation and celebrated with lavish praise His soft and tractable disposition received the fair impression of their judicious precepts and the absence of passion might easily be mistaken for the strength of reason His preceptors gradually rose to the rank and consequence of ministers of state two and as they wisely dissembled their secret authority he seemed to act with firmness with propriety and with judgment on the most important occasions of his life and reign But the influence of this elaborate instruction did not penetrate beyond the surface and the skilful preceptors who so accurately guided the steps of their royal pupil could not infuse into his feeble and indolent character the vigorous and independent principle of action which renders the laborious pursuit of glory essentially necessary to the happiness and almost to the existence of the hero As soon as time and accident had removed those faithful counsellors from the throne the emperor of the West insensibly descended to the level of his natural genius abandoned the reins of government to the ambitious hands which were stretched forwards to grasp them and amused his leisure with the most frivolous gratifications A public sale of favor and injustice was instituted both in the court and in the provinces by the worthless delegates of his power whose merit it was made sacrilege to question three The conscience of the credulous prince was directed by saints and bishops four who procured an Imperial edict to punish as a capital offence the violation the neglect or even the ignorance of the divine law five Among the various arts which had exercised the youth of Gratian he had applied himself with singular inclination and success to manage the horse to draw the bow and to dart the javelin and these qualifications which might be useful to a soldier were prostituted to the viler purposes of hunting Large parks were enclosed for the Imperial pleasures and plentifully stocked with every species of wild beasts and Gratian neglected the duties and even the dignity of his rank to consume whole days in the vain display of his dexterity and boldness in the chase The pride and wish of the Roman emperor to excel in an art in which he might be surpassed by the meanest of his slaves reminded the numerous spectators of the examples of Nero and Commodus but the chaste and temperate Gratian was a stranger to their monstrous vices and his hands were stained only with the blood of animals six The behavior of Gratian which degraded his character in the eyes of mankind could not have disturbed the security of his reign if the army had not been provoked to resent their peculiar injuries As long as the young emperor was guided by the instructions of his masters he professed himself the friend and pupil of the soldiers many of his hours were spent in the familiar conversation of the camp and the health the comforts the rewards the honors of his faithful troops appeared to be the objects of his attentive concern But after Gratian more freely indulged his prevailing taste for hunting and shooting he naturally connected himself with the most dexterous ministers of his favorite amusement A body of the Alani was received into the military and domestic service of the palace and the admirable skill which they were accustomed to display in the unbounded plains of Scythia was exercised on a more narrow theatre in the parks and enclosures of Gaul Gratian admired the talents and customs of these favorite guards to whom alone he intrusted the defence of his person and as if he meant to insult the public opinion he frequently showed himself to the soldiers and people with the dress and arms the long bow the sounding quiver and the fur garments of a Scythian warrior The unworthy spectacle of a Roman prince who had renounced the dress and manners of his country filled the minds of the legions with grief and indignation seven Even the Germans so strong and formidable in the armies of the empire affected to disdain the strange and horrid appearance of the savages of the North who in the space of a few years had wandered from the banks of the Volga to those of the Seine A loud and licentious murmur was echoed through the camps and garrisons of the West and as the mild indolence of Gratian neglected to extinguish the first symptoms of discontent the want of love and respect was not supplied by the influence of fear But the subversion of an established government is always a work of some real and of much apparent difficulty and the throne of Gratian was protected by the sanctions of custom law religion and the nice balance of the civil and military powers which had been established by the policy of Constantine It is not very important to inquire from what cause the revolt of Britain was produced Accident is commonly the parent of disorder the seeds of rebellion happened to fall on a soil which was supposed to be more fruitful than any other in tyrants and usurpers eight the legions of that sequestered island had been long famous for a spirit of presumption and arrogance nine and the name of Maximus was proclaimed by the tumultuary but unanimous voice both of the soldiers and of the provincials The emperor or the rebel for this title was not yet ascertained by fortune was a native of Spain the countryman the fellow soldier and the rival of Theodosius whose elevation he had not seen without some emotions of envy and resentment the events of his life had long since fixed him in Britain and I should not be unwilling to find some evidence for the marriage which he is said to have contracted with the daughter of a wealthy lord of Caernarvonshire ten But this provincial rank might justly be considered as a state of exile and obscurity and if Maximus had obtained any civil or military office he was not invested with the authority either of governor or general eleven His abilities and even his integrity are acknowledged by the partial writers of the age and the merit must indeed have been conspicuous that could extort such a confession in favor of the vanquished enemy of Theodosius The discontent of Maximus might incline him to censure the conduct of his sovereign and to encourage perhaps without any views of ambition the murmurs of the troops But in the midst of the tumult he artfully or modestly refused to ascend the throne and some credit appears to have been given to his own positive declaration that he was compelled to accept the dangerous present of the Imperial purple twelve Footnote one Valentinian was less attentive to the religion of his son since he intrusted the education of Gratian to Ausonius a professed Pagan Mem de l Academie des Inscriptions tom xv p one hundred twenty five

Footnote twelve Sulpicius Severus Dialog ii seven Orosius l vii c thirty four p five hundred fifty six They both acknowledge Sulpicius had been his subject his innocence and merit It is singular enough that Maximus should be less favorably treated by Zosimus the partial adversary of his rival But there was danger likewise in refusing the empire and from the moment that Maximus had violated his allegiance to his lawful sovereign he could not hope to reign or even to live if he confined his moderate ambition within the narrow limits of Britain He boldly and wisely resolved to prevent the designs of Gratian the youth of the island crowded to his standard and he invaded Gaul with a fleet and army which were long afterwards remembered as the emigration of a considerable part of the British nation thirteen The emperor in his peaceful residence of Paris was alarmed by their hostile approach and the darts which he idly wasted on lions and bears might have been employed more honorably against the rebels But his feeble efforts announced his degenerate spirit and desperate situation and deprived him of the resources which he still might have found in the support of his subjects and allies The armies of Gaul instead of opposing the march of Maximus received him with joyful and loyal acclamations and the shame of the desertion was transferred from the people to the prince The troops whose station more immediately attached them to the service of the palace abandoned the standard of Gratian the first time that it was displayed in the neighborhood of Paris The emperor of the West fled towards Lyons with a train of only three hundred horse and in the cities along the road where he hoped to find refuge or at least a passage he was taught by cruel experience that every gate is shut against the unfortunate Yet he might still have reached in safety the dominions of his brother and soon have returned with the forces of Italy and the East if he had not suffered himself to be fatally deceived by the perfidious governor of the Lyonnese province Gratian was amused by protestations of doubtful fidelity and the hopes of a support which could not be effectual till the arrival of Andragathius the general of the cavalry of Maximus put an end to his suspense That resolute officer executed without remorse the orders or the intention of the usurper Gratian as he rose from supper was delivered into the hands of the assassin and his body was denied to the pious and pressing entreaties of his brother Valentinian fourteen The death of the emperor was followed by that of his powerful general Mellobaudes the king of the Franks who maintained to the last moment of his life the ambiguous reputation which is the just recompense of obscure and subtle policy fifteen These executions might be necessary to the public safety but the successful usurper whose power was acknowledged by all the provinces of the West had the merit and the satisfaction of boasting that except those who had perished by the chance of war his triumph was not stained by the blood of the Romans sixteen Footnote thirteen Archbishop Usher Antiquat Britan Eccles p one hundred seven one hundred eight has diligently collected the legends of the island and the continent The whole emigration consisted of thirty thousand soldiers and one hundred thousand

murdered by the Huns But the plebeian sisters have been defrauded of their equal honors and what is still harder John Trithemius presumes to mention the children of these British virgins Footnote

orator Theodosius bestows reluctant and therefore weighty praise on his clemency Si cui ille pro ceteris sceleribus suis minus crudelis fuisse videtur Panegyr Vet xii twenty eight The events of this revolution had passed in such rapid succession that it would have been impossible for Theodosius to march to the relief of his benefactor before he received the intelligence of his defeat and death During the season of sincere grief or ostentatious mourning the Eastern emperor was interrupted by the arrival of the principal chamberlain of Maximus and the choice of a venerable old man for an office which was usually exercised by eunuchs announced to the court of Constantinople the gravity and temperance of the British usurper The ambassador condescended to justify or excuse the conduct of his master and to protest in specious language that the murder of Gratian had been perpetrated without his knowledge or consent by the precipitate zeal of the soldiers But he proceeded in a firm and equal tone to offer Theodosius the alternative of peace or war The speech of the ambassador concluded with a spirited declaration that although Maximus as a Roman and as the father of his people would choose rather to employ his forces in the common defence of the republic he was armed and prepared if his friendship should be rejected to dispute in a field of battle the empire of the world An immediate and peremptory answer was required but it was extremely difficult for Theodosius to satisfy on this important occasion either the feelings of his own mind or the expectations of the public The imperious voice of honor and gratitude called aloud for revenge From the liberality of Gratian he had received the Imperial diadem his patience would encourage the odious suspicion that he was more deeply sensible of former injuries than of recent obligations and if he accepted the friendship he must seem to share the guilt of the assassin Even the principles of justice and the interest of society would receive a fatal blow from the impunity of Maximus and the example of successful usurpation would tend to dissolve the artificial fabric of government and once more to replunge the empire in the crimes and calamities of the preceding age But as the sentiments of gratitude and honor should invariably regulate the conduct of an individual they may be overbalanced in the mind of a sovereign by the sense of superior duties and the maxims both of justice and humanity must permit the escape of an atrocious criminal if an innocent people would be involved in the consequences of his punishment The assassin of Gratian had usurped but he actually possessed the most warlike provinces of the empire the East was exhausted by the misfortunes and even by the success of the Gothic war and it was seriously to be apprehended that after the vital strength of the republic had been wasted in a doubtful and destructive contest the feeble conqueror would remain an easy prey to the Barbarians of the North These weighty considerations engaged Theodosius to dissemble his resentment and to accept the alliance of the tyrant But he stipulated that Maximus should content himself with the possession of the countries beyond the Alps The brother of Gratian was confirmed and secured in the sovereignty of Italy Africa and the Western Illyricum and some honorable conditions were inserted in the treaty to protect the memory and the laws of the deceased emperor seventeen According to the custom of the age the images of the three Imperial colleagues were exhibited to the veneration of the people nor should it be lightly supposed that in the moment of a solemn reconciliation Theodosius secretly cherished the intention of perfidy and revenge eighteen Footnote seventeen Ambrose mentions the laws of Gratian quas non abrogavit hostia tom ii epist xvii p eight hundred twenty seven Footnote eighteen Zosimus l iv p two hundred fifty one two hundred fifty two We may disclaim his odious suspicions but we cannot reject the treaty of peace which the friends of Theodosius have absolutely forgotten or slightly mentioned The contempt of Gratian for the Roman soldiers had exposed him to the fatal effects of their resentment His profound veneration for the Christian clergy was rewarded by the applause and gratitude of a powerful order which has claimed in every age the privilege of dispensing honors both on earth and in heaven nineteen The orthodox bishops bewailed his death and their own irreparable loss but they were soon comforted by the discovery that Gratian had committed the sceptre of the East to the hands of a prince whose humble faith and fervent zeal were supported by the spirit and abilities of a more vigorous character Among the benefactors of the church the fame of Constantine has been rivalled by the glory of Theodosius If Constantine had the advantage of erecting the standard of the cross the emulation of his successor assumed the merit of subduing the Arian heresy and of abolishing the worship of idols in the Roman world Theodosius was the first of the emperors baptized in the true faith of the Trinity Although he was born of a Christian family the maxims or at least the practice of the age encouraged him to delay the ceremony of his initiation till he was admonished of the danger of delay by the serious illness which threatened his life towards the end of the first year of his reign Before he again took the field against the Goths he received the sacrament of baptism twenty from Acholius the orthodox bishop of Thessalonica twenty one and as the emperor ascended from the holy font still glowing with the warm feelings of regeneration he dictated a solemn edict which proclaimed his own faith and prescribed the religion of his subjects It is our pleasure such is the Imperial style that all the nations which are governed by our clemency and moderation should steadfastly adhere to the religion which was taught by saint Peter to the Romans which faithful tradition has preserved and which is now professed by the pontiff Damasus and by Peter bishop of Alexandria a man of apostolic holiness According to the discipline of the apostles and the doctrine of the gospel let us believe the sole deity of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost under an equal majesty and a pious Trinity We authorize the followers of this doctrine to assume the title of Catholic Christians and as we judge that all others are extravagant madmen we brand them with the infamous name of Heretics and declare that their conventicles shall no longer usurp the respectable appellation of churches Besides the condemnation of divine justice they must expect to suffer the severe penalties which our authority guided by heavenly wisdom shall think proper to inflict upon them twenty two The faith of a soldier is commonly the fruit of instruction rather than of inquiry but as the emperor always fixed his eyes on the visible landmarks of orthodoxy which he had so prudently constituted his religious opinions were never affected by the specious texts the subtle arguments and the ambiguous creeds of the Arian doctors Once indeed he expressed a faint inclination to converse with the eloquent and learned Eunomius who lived in retirement at a small distance from Constantinople But the dangerous interview was prevented by the prayers of the empress Flaccilla who trembled for the salvation of her husband and the mind of Theodosius was confirmed by a theological argument adapted to the rudest capacity He had lately bestowed on his eldest son Arcadius the name and honors of Augustus and the two princes were seated on a stately throne to receive the homage of their subjects A bishop Amphilochius of Iconium approached the throne and after saluting with due reverence the person of his sovereign he accosted the royal youth with the same familiar tenderness which he might have used towards a plebeian child Provoked by this insolent behavior the monarch gave orders that the rustic priest should be instantly driven from his presence But while the guards were forcing him to the door the dexterous polemic had time to execute his design by exclaiming with a loud voice Such is the treatment O emperor which the King of heaven has prepared for those impious men who affect to worship the Father but refuse to acknowledge the equal majesty of his divine Son Theodosius immediately embraced the bishop of Iconium and never forgot the important lesson which he had received from this dramatic parable twenty

baptism of Theodosius see Sozomen l vii c four Socrates l v c six and Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom v p seven hundred twenty eight Footnote twenty one Ascolius or Acholius was honored by the

Tillemont is displeased Mem Eccles tom vi p six hundred twenty seven six hundred twenty eight with the terms of rustic bishop obscure city Yet I must take leave to think that both Amphilochius and Iconium were objects of inconsiderable magnitude in the Roman empire Chapter XXVII Civil Wars Reign Of Theodosius Part II Constantinople was the principal seat and fortress of Arianism and in a long interval of forty years twenty four the faith of the princes and prelates who reigned in the capital of the East was rejected in the purer schools of Rome and Alexandria The archiepiscopal throne of Macedonius which had been polluted with so much Christian blood was successively filled by Eudoxus and Damophilus Their diocese enjoyed a free importation of vice and error from every province of the empire the eager pursuit of religious controversy afforded a new occupation to the busy idleness of the metropolis and we may credit the assertion of an intelligent observer who describes with some pleasantry the effects of their loquacious zeal This city says he is full of mechanics and slaves who are all of them profound theologians and preach in the shops and in the streets If you desire a man to change a piece of silver he informs you wherein the Son differs from the Father if you ask the price of a loaf you are told by way of reply that the Son is inferior to the Father and if you inquire whether the bath is ready the answer is that the Son was made out of nothing twenty five The heretics of various denominations subsisted in peace under the protection of the Arians of Constantinople who endeavored to secure the attachment of those obscure sectaries while they abused with unrelenting severity the victory which they had obtained over the followers of the council of Nice During the partial reigns of Constantius and Valens the feeble remnant of the Homoousians was deprived of the public and private exercise of their religion and it has been observed in pathetic language that the scattered flock was left without a shepherd to wander on the mountains or to be devoured by rapacious wolves twenty six But as their zeal instead of being subdued derived strength and vigor from oppression they seized the first moments of imperfect freedom which they had acquired by the death of Valens to form themselves into a regular congregation under the conduct of an episcopal pastor Two natives of Cappadocia Basil and Gregory Nazianzen twenty seven were distinguished above all their contemporaries twenty eight by the rare union of profane eloquence and of orthodox piety These orators who might sometimes be compared by themselves and by the public to the most celebrated of the ancient Greeks were united by the ties of the strictest friendship They had cultivated with equal ardor the same liberal studies in the schools of Athens they had retired with equal devotion to the same solitude in the deserts of Pontus and every spark of emulation or envy appeared to be totally extinguished in the holy and ingenuous breasts of Gregory and Basil But the exaltation of Basil from a private life to the archiepiscopal throne of Caesarea discovered to the world and perhaps to himself the pride of his character and the first favor which he condescended to bestow on his friend was received and perhaps was intended as a cruel insult twenty nine Instead of employing the superior talents of Gregory in some useful and conspicuous station the haughty prelate selected among the fifty bishoprics of his extensive province the wretched village of Sasima thirty without water without verdure without society situate at the junction of three highways and frequented only by the incessant passage of rude and clamorous wagoners Gregory submitted with reluctance to this humiliating exile he was ordained bishop of Sasima but he solemnly protests that he never consummated his spiritual marriage with this disgusting bride He afterwards consented to undertake the government of his native church of Nazianzus thirty one of which his father had been bishop above five and forty years But as he was still conscious that he deserved another audience and another theatre he accepted with no unworthy ambition the honorable invitation which was addressed to him from the orthodox party of Constantinople On his arrival in the capital Gregory was entertained in the house of a pious and charitable kinsman the most spacious room was consecrated to the uses of religious worship and the name of Anastasia was chosen to express the resurrection of the Nicene faith This private conventicle was afterwards converted into a magnificent church and the credulity of the succeeding age was prepared to believe the miracles and visions which attested the presence or at least the protection of the Mother of God thirty two The pulpit of the Anastasia was the scene of the labors and triumphs of Gregory Nazianzen and in the space of two years he experienced all the spiritual adventures which constitute the prosperous or adverse fortunes of a missionary thirty three The Arians who were provoked by the boldness of his enterprise represented his doctrine as if he had preached three distinct and equal Deities and the devout populace was excited to suppress by violence and tumult the irregular assemblies of the Athanasian heretics From the cathedral of saint Sophia there issued a motley crowd of common beggars who had forfeited their claim to pity of monks who had the appearance of goats or satyrs and of women more terrible than so many Jezebels The doors of the Anastasia were broke open much mischief was perpetrated or attempted with sticks stones and firebrands and as a man lost his life in the affray Gregory who was summoned the next morning before the magistrate had the satisfaction of supposing that he publicly confessed the name of Christ After he was delivered from the fear and danger of a foreign enemy his infant church was disgraced and distracted by intestine faction A stranger who assumed the name of Maximus thirty four and the cloak of a Cynic philosopher insinuated himself into the confidence of Gregory deceived and abused his favorable opinion and forming a secret connection with some bishops of Egypt attempted by a clandestine ordination to supplant his patron in the episcopal seat of Constantinople These mortifications might sometimes tempt the Cappadocian missionary to regret his obscure solitude But his fatigues were rewarded by the daily increase of his fame and his congregation and he enjoyed the pleasure of observing that the greater part of his numerous audience retired from his sermons satisfied with the eloquence of the preacher thirty five or dissatisfied with the manifold imperfections of their faith and practice thirty six Footnote twenty four Sozomen l vii c v Socrates l v c seven Marcellin in Chron The account of forty years must be dated from the election or intrusion of Eusebius who wisely exchanged the bishopric of Nicomedia for the throne of Constantinople Footnote twenty five See Jortin s Remarks on Ecclesiastical History vol iv p seventy one The thirty third Oration of Gregory Nazianzen affords indeed some similar ideas even some still more ridiculous but I have not yet found the words of this remarkable passage which I allege on the faith of a correct and liberal scholar Footnote twenty six See the thirty second Oration of Gregory Nazianzen and the account of his own life which he has composed in eighteen hundred iambics Yet every physician is prone to

conversation with his auditor saint Jerom tom i Epist ad Nepotian p fourteen that the preacher understood the true value of popular applause Footnote thirty six Lachrymae auditorum laudes tuae sint is the lively and judicious advice of saint Jerom The Catholics of Constantinople were animated with joyful confidence by the baptism and edict of Theodosius and they impatiently waited the effects of his gracious promise Their hopes were speedily accomplished and the emperor as soon as he had finished the operations of the campaign made his public entry into the capital at the head of a victorious army The next day after his arrival he summoned Damophilus to his presence and offered that Arian prelate the hard alternative of subscribing the Nicene creed or of instantly resigning to the orthodox believers the use and possession of the episcopal palace the cathedral of saint Sophia and all the churches of Constantinople The zeal of Damophilus which in a Catholic saint would have been justly applauded embraced without hesitation a life of poverty and exile thirty seven and his removal was immediately followed by the purification of the Imperial city The Arians might complain with some appearance of justice that an inconsiderable congregation of sectaries should usurp the hundred churches which they were insufficient to fill whilst the far greater part of the people was cruelly excluded from every place of religious worship Theodosius was still inexorable but as the angels who protected the Catholic cause were only visible to the eyes of faith he prudently reenforced those heavenly legions with the more effectual aid of temporal and carnal weapons and the church of saint Sophia was occupied by a large body of the Imperial guards If the mind of Gregory was susceptible of pride he must have felt a very lively satisfaction when the emperor conducted him through the streets in solemn triumph and with his own hand respectfully placed him on the archiepiscopal throne of Constantinople But the saint who had not subdued the imperfections of human virtue was deeply affected by the mortifying consideration that his entrance into the fold was that of a wolf rather than of a shepherd that the glittering arms which surrounded his person were necessary for his safety and that he alone was the object of the imprecations of a great party whom as men and citizens it was impossible for him to despise He beheld the innumerable multitude of either sex and of every age who crowded the streets the windows and the roofs of the houses he heard the tumultuous voice of rage grief astonishment and despair and Gregory fairly confesses that on the memorable day of his installation the capital of the East wore the appearance of a city taken by storm and in the hands of a Barbarian conqueror thirty eight About six weeks afterwards Theodosius declared his resolution of expelling from all the churches of his dominions the bishops and their clergy who should obstinately refuse to believe or at least to profess the doctrine of the council of Nice His lieutenant Sapor was armed with the ample powers of a general law a special commission and a military force thirty nine and this ecclesiastical revolution was conducted with so much discretion and vigor that the religion of the emperor was established without tumult or bloodshed in all the provinces of the East The writings of the Arians if they had been permitted to exist forty would perhaps contain the lamentable story of the persecution which afflicted the church under the reign of the impious Theodosius and the sufferings of their holy confessors might claim the pity of the disinterested reader Yet there is reason to imagine that the violence of zeal and revenge was in some measure eluded by the want of resistance and that in their adversity the Arians displayed much less firmness than had been exerted by the orthodox party under the reigns of Constantius and Valens The moral character and conduct of the hostile sects appear to have been governed by the same common principles of nature and religion but a very material circumstance may be discovered which tended to distinguish the degrees of their theological faith Both parties in the schools as well as in the temples acknowledged and worshipped the divine majesty of Christ and as we are always prone to impute our own sentiments and passions to the Deity it would be deemed more prudent and respectful to exaggerate than to circumscribe the adorable perfections of the Son of God The disciple of Athanasius exulted in the proud confidence that he had entitled himself to the divine favor while the follower of Arius must have been tormented by the secret apprehension that he was guilty perhaps of an unpardonable offence by the scanty praise and parsimonious honors which he bestowed on the Judge of the World The opinions of Arianism might satisfy a cold and speculative mind but the doctrine of the Nicene creed most powerfully recommended by the merits of faith and devotion was much better adapted to become popular and successful in a believing age Footnote thirty seven Socrates l v c seven and Sozomen l vii c five relate the evangelical words and actions of Damophilus without a word of approbation He considered says Socrates that it is difficult to resist the powerful but it was easy and would have been profitable to

important commission of Sapor which Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom v p seven hundred twenty eight judiciously removes from the reign of Gratian to that of Theodosius Footnote forty I do not reckon Philostorgius though he mentions l ix c nineteen the explosion of Damophilus The Eunomian historian has been carefully strained through an orthodox sieve The hope that truth and wisdom would be found in the assemblies of the orthodox clergy induced the emperor to convene at Constantinople a synod of one hundred and fifty bishops who proceeded without much difficulty or delay to complete the theological system which had been established in the council of Nice The vehement disputes of the fourth century had been chiefly employed on the nature of the Son of God and the various opinions which were embraced concerning the Second were extended and transferred by a natural analogy to the Third person of the Trinity forty one Yet it was found or it was thought necessary by the victorious adversaries of Arianism to explain the ambiguous language of some respectable doctors to confirm the faith of the Catholics and to condemn an unpopular and inconsistent sect of Macedonians who freely admitted that the Son was consubstantial to the Father while they were fearful of seeming to acknowledge the existence of Three Gods A final and unanimous sentence was pronounced to ratify the equal Deity of the Holy Ghost the mysterious doctrine has been received by all the nations and all the churches of the Christian world and their grateful reverence has assigned to the bishops of Theodosius the second rank among the general councils forty two Their knowledge of religious truth may have been preserved by tradition or it may have been communicated by inspiration but the sober evidence of history will not allow much weight to the personal authority of the Fathers of Constantinople In an age when the ecclesiastics had scandalously degenerated from the model of apostolic purity the most worthless and corrupt were always the most eager to frequent and disturb the episcopal assemblies The conflict and fermentation of so many opposite interests and tempers inflamed the passions of the bishops and their ruling passions were the love of gold and the love of dispute Many of the same prelates who now applauded the orthodox piety of Theodosius had repeatedly changed with prudent flexibility their creeds and opinions and in the various revolutions of the church and state the religion of their sovereign was the rule of their obsequious faith When the emperor suspended his prevailing influence the turbulent synod was blindly impelled by the absurd or selfish motives of pride hatred or resentment The death of Meletius which happened at the council of Constantinople presented the most favorable opportunity of terminating the schism of Antioch by suffering his aged rival Paulinus peaceably to end his days in the episcopal chair The faith and virtues of Paulinus were unblemished But his cause was supported by the Western churches and the bishops of the synod resolved to perpetuate the mischiefs of discord by the hasty ordination of a perjured candidate forty three rather than to betray the imagined dignity of the East which had been illustrated by the birth and death of the Son of God Such unjust and disorderly proceedings forced the gravest members of the assembly to dissent and to secede and the clamorous majority which remained masters of the field of battle could be compared only to wasps or magpies to a flight of cranes or to a flock of geese

suspicion may possibly arise that so unfavorable a picture of ecclesiastical synods has been drawn by the partial hand of some obstinate heretic or some malicious infidel But the name of the sincere historian who has conveyed this instructive lesson to the knowledge of posterity must silence the impotent murmurs of superstition and bigotry He was one of the most pious and eloquent bishops of the age a saint and a doctor of the church the scourge of Arianism and the pillar of the orthodox faith a distinguished member of the council of Constantinople in which after the death of Meletius he exercised the functions of president in a word Gregory Nazianzen himself The harsh and ungenerous treatment which he experienced forty five instead of derogating from the truth of his evidence affords an additional proof of the spirit which actuated the deliberations of the synod Their unanimous suffrage had confirmed the pretensions which the bishop of Constantinople derived from the choice of the people and the approbation of the emperor But Gregory soon became the victim of malice and envy The bishops of the East his strenuous adherents provoked by his moderation in the affairs of Antioch abandoned him without support to the adverse faction of the Egyptians who disputed the validity of his election and rigorously asserted the obsolete canon that prohibited the licentious practice of episcopal translations The pride or the humility of Gregory prompted him to decline a contest which might have been imputed to ambition and avarice and he publicly offered not without some mixture of indignation to renounce the government of a church which had been restored and almost created by his labors His resignation was accepted by the synod and by the emperor with more readiness than he seems to have expected At the time when he might have hoped to enjoy the fruits of his victory his episcopal throne was filled by the senator Nectarius and the new archbishop accidentally recommended by his easy temper and venerable aspect was obliged to delay the ceremony of his consecration till he had previously despatched the rites of his baptism forty six After this remarkable experience of the ingratitude of princes and prelates Gregory retired once more to his obscure solitude of Cappadocia where he employed the remainder of his life about eight years in the exercises of poetry and devotion The title of Saint has been added to his name but the tenderness of his heart forty seven and the elegance of his genius reflect a more pleasing lustre on the memory of Gregory Nazianzen Footnote forty five See Gregory tom ii de Vita sua p twenty eight thirty one The fourteenth twenty seventh and thirty second Orations were pronounced in the several stages of this business The

pour tous ceux qu il y mele et surtout pour Theodose qu il vaut mieux travailler a le detruire qu a le soutenir an admirable canon of criticism Footnote forty seven I can only be understood to mean that such was his natural temper when it was not hardened or inflamed by religious zeal From his retirement he exhorts Nectarius to prosecute the heretics of Constantinople It was not enough that Theodosius had suppressed the insolent reign of Arianism or that he had abundantly revenged the injuries which the Catholics sustained from the zeal of Constantius and Valens The orthodox emperor considered every heretic as a rebel against the supreme powers of heaven and of earth and each of those powers might exercise their peculiar jurisdiction over the soul and body of the guilty The decrees of the council of Constantinople had ascertained the true standard of the faith and the ecclesiastics who governed the conscience of Theodosius suggested the most effectual methods of persecution In the space of fifteen years he promulgated at least fifteen severe edicts against the heretics forty eight more especially against those who rejected the doctrine of the Trinity and to deprive them of every hope of escape he sternly enacted that if any laws or rescripts should be alleged in their favor the judges should consider them as the illegal productions either of fraud or forgery The penal statutes were directed against the ministers the assemblies and the persons of the heretics and the passions of the legislator were expressed in the language of declamation and invective I The heretical teachers who usurped the sacred titles of Bishops or Presbyters were not only excluded from the privileges and emoluments so liberally granted to the orthodox clergy but they were exposed to the heavy penalties of exile and confiscation if they presumed to preach the doctrine or to practise the rites of their accursed sects A fine of ten pounds of gold above four hundred pounds sterling was imposed on every person who should dare to confer or receive or promote an heretical ordination and it was reasonably expected that if the race of pastors could be extinguished their helpless flocks would be compelled by ignorance and hunger to return within the pale of the Catholic church II The rigorous prohibition of conventicles was carefully extended to every possible circumstance in which the heretics could assemble with the intention of worshipping God and Christ according to the dictates of their conscience Their religious meetings whether public or secret by day or by night in cities or in the country were equally proscribed by the edicts of Theodosius and the building or ground which had been used for that illegal purpose was forfeited to the Imperial domain III It was supposed that the error of the heretics could proceed only from the obstinate temper of their minds and that such a temper was a fit object of censure and punishment The anathemas of the church were fortified by a sort of civil excommunication which separated them from their fellow citizens by a peculiar brand of infamy and this declaration of the supreme magistrate tended to justify or at least to excuse the insults of a fanatic populace The sectaries were gradually disqualified from the possession of honorable or lucrative employments and Theodosius was satisfied with his own justice when he decreed that as the Eunomians distinguished the nature of the Son from that of the Father they should be incapable of making their wills or of receiving any advantage from testamentary donations The guilt of the Manichaean heresy was esteemed of such magnitude that it could be expiated only by the death of the offender and the same capital punishment was inflicted on the Audians or Quartodecimans forty nine who should dare to perpetrate the atrocious crime of celebrating on an improper day the festival of Easter Every Roman might exercise the right of public accusation but the office of Inquisitors of the Faith a name so deservedly abhorred was first instituted under the reign of Theodosius Yet we are assured that the execution of his penal edicts was seldom enforced and that the pious emperor appeared less desirous to punish than to reclaim or terrify his refractory subjects fifty Footnote forty eight See the Theodosian Code l xvi tit v leg six

but the practice of it in the fullest extent was reserved for his rival and colleague Maximus the first among the Christian princes who shed the blood of his Christian subjects on account of their religious opinions The cause of the Priscillianists fifty one a recent sect of heretics who disturbed the provinces of Spain was transferred by appeal from the synod of Bordeaux to the Imperial consistory of Treves and by the sentence of the Praetorian praefect seven persons were tortured condemned and executed The first of these was Priscillian fifty two himself bishop of Avila in Spain who adorned the advantages of birth and fortune by the accomplishments of eloquence and learning Two presbyters and two deacons accompanied their beloved master in his death which they esteemed as a glorious martyrdom and the number of religious victims was completed by the execution of Latronian a poet who rivalled the fame of the ancients and of Euchrocia a noble matron of Bordeaux the widow of the orator Delphidius fifty four Two bishops who had embraced the sentiments of Priscillian were condemned to a distant and dreary exile fifty five and some indulgence was shown to the meaner criminals who assumed the merit of an early repentance If any credit could be allowed to confessions extorted by fear or pain and to vague reports the offspring of malice and credulity the heresy of the Priscillianists would be found to include the various abominations of magic of impiety and of lewdness fifty six Priscillian who wandered about the world in the company of his spiritual sisters was accused of praying stark naked in the midst of the congregation and it was confidently asserted that the effects of his criminal intercourse with the daughter of Euchrocia had been suppressed by means still more odious and criminal But an accurate or rather a candid inquiry will discover that if the Priscillianists violated the laws of nature it was not by the licentiousness but by the austerity of their lives They absolutely condemned the use of the marriage bed and the peace of families was often disturbed by indiscreet separations They enjoyed or recommended a total abstinence from all anima food and their continual prayers fasts and vigils inculcated a rule of strict and perfect devotion The speculative tenets of the sect concerning the person of Christ and the nature of the human soul were derived from the Gnostic and Manichaean system and this vain philosophy which had been transported from Egypt to Spain was ill adapted to the grosser spirits of the West The obscure disciples of Priscillian suffered languished and gradually disappeared his tenets were rejected by the clergy and people but his death was the subject of a long and vehement controversy while some arraigned and others applauded the justice of his sentence It is with pleasure that we can observe the humane inconsistency of the most illustrious saints and bishops Ambrose of Milan fifty seven and Martin of Tours fifty eight who on this occasion asserted the cause of toleration They pitied the unhappy men who had been executed at Treves they refused to hold communion with their episcopal murderers and if Martin deviated from that generous resolution his motives were laudable and his repentance was exemplary The bishops of Tours and Milan pronounced without hesitation the eternal damnation of heretics but they were surprised and shocked by the bloody image of their temporal death and the honest feelings of nature resisted the artificial prejudices of theology The humanity of Ambrose and Martin was confirmed by the scandalous irregularity of the proceedings against Priscillian and his adherents The civil and ecclesiastical ministers had transgressed the limits of their respective provinces The secular judge had presumed to receive an appeal and to pronounce a definitive sentence in a matter of faith and episcopal jurisdiction The bishops had disgraced themselves by exercising the functions of accusers in a criminal prosecution The cruelty of Ithacius fifty nine who beheld the tortures and solicited the death of the heretics provoked the just indignation of mankind and the vices of that profligate bishop were admitted as a proof that his zeal was instigated by the sordid motives of interest Since the death of Priscillian the rude attempts of persecution have been refined and methodized in the holy office which assigns their distinct parts to the ecclesiastical and secular powers The devoted victim is regularly delivered by the priest to the magistrate and by the magistrate to the executioner and the inexorable sentence of the church which declares the spiritual guilt of the offender is expressed in the mild language of pity and intercession Footnote fifty one See the Sacred History of Sulpicius Severus l ii p four hundred thirty seven four hundred fifty two edit Ludg Bat sixteen forty seven a correct and original writer

distinguished by the talents of an eloquent preacher the reputation of miraculous gifts added weight and dignity to the monastic virtues of Martin of Tours sixty but the palm of episcopal vigor and ability was justly claimed by the intrepid Ambrose sixty one He was descended from a noble family of Romans his father had exercised the important office of Praetorian praefect of Gaul and the son after passing through the studies of a liberal education attained in the regular gradation of civil honors the station of consular of Liguria a province which included the Imperial residence of Milan At the age of thirty four and before he had received the sacrament of baptism Ambrose to his own surprise and to that of the world was suddenly transformed from a governor to an archbishop Without the least mixture as it is said of art or intrigue the whole body of the people unanimously saluted him with the episcopal title the concord and perseverance of their acclamations were ascribed to a praeternatural impulse and the reluctant magistrate was compelled to undertake a spiritual office for which he was not prepared by the habits and occupations of his former life But the active force of his genius soon qualified him to exercise with zeal and prudence the duties of his ecclesiastical jurisdiction and while he cheerfully renounced the vain and splendid trappings of temporal greatness he condescended for the good of the church to direct the conscience of the emperors and to control the administration of the empire Gratian loved and revered him as a father and the elaborate treatise on the faith of the Trinity was designed for the instruction of the young prince After his tragic death at a time when the empress Justina trembled for her own safety and for that of her son Valentinian the archbishop of Milan was despatched on two different embassies to the court of Treves He exercised with equal firmness and dexterity the powers of his spiritual and political characters and perhaps contributed by his authority and eloquence to check the ambition of Maximus and to protect the peace of Italy sixty two Ambrose had devoted his life and his abilities to the service of the church Wealth was the object of his contempt he had renounced his private patrimony and he sold without hesitation the consecrated plate for the redemption of captives The clergy and people of Milan were attached to their archbishop and he deserved the esteem without soliciting the favor or apprehending the displeasure of his feeble sovereigns Footnote sixty The Life of saint Martin and the Dialogues concerning his miracles contain facts adapted to the grossest barbarism in a style not unworthy of the Augustan age So natural is the alliance between good taste and good sense that I am

Tillemont Mem Eccles tom x p seventy eight three hundred six and the Benedictine editors p xxxi lxiii have labored with their usual diligence Footnote sixty two Ambrose himself tom ii Epist xxiv p eight hundred eighty eight eight hundred ninety one gives the emperor a very spirited account of his own embassy The government of Italy and of the young emperor naturally devolved to his mother Justina a woman of beauty and spirit but who in the midst of an orthodox people had the misfortune of professing the Arian heresy which she endeavored to instil into the mind of her son Justina was persuaded that a Roman emperor might claim in his own dominions the public exercise of his religion and she proposed to the archbishop as a moderate and reasonable concession that he should resign the use of a single church either in the city or the suburbs of Milan But the conduct of Ambrose was governed by very different principles sixty three The palaces of the earth might indeed belong to Caesar but the churches were the houses of God and within the limits of his diocese he himself as the lawful successor of the apostles was the only minister of God The privileges of Christianity temporal as well as spiritual were confined to the true believers and the mind of Ambrose was satisfied that his own theological opinions were the standard of truth and orthodoxy The archbishop who refused to hold any conference or negotiation with the instruments of Satan declared with modest firmness his resolution to die a martyr rather than to yield to the impious sacrilege and Justina who resented the refusal as an act of insolence and rebellion hastily determined to exert the Imperial prerogative of her son As she desired to perform her public devotions on the approaching festival of Easter Ambrose was ordered to appear before the council He obeyed the summons with the respect of a faithful subject but he was followed without his consent by an innumerable people they pressed with impetuous zeal against the gates of the palace and the affrighted ministers of Valentinian instead of pronouncing a sentence of exile on the archbishop of Milan humbly requested that he would interpose his authority to protect the person of the emperor and to restore the tranquility of the capital But the promises which Ambrose received and communicated were soon violated by a perfidious court and during six of the most solemn days which Christian piety had set apart for the exercise of religion the city was agitated by the irregular convulsions of tumult and fanaticism The officers of the household were directed to prepare first the Portian and afterwards the new Basilica for the immediate reception of the emperor and his mother The splendid canopy and hangings of the royal seat were arranged in the customary manner but it was found necessary to defend them by a strong guard from the insults of the populace The Arian ecclesiastics who ventured to show themselves in the streets were exposed to the most imminent danger of their lives and Ambrose enjoyed the merit and reputation of rescuing his personal enemies from the hands of the enraged multitude Footnote sixty three His own representation of his principles and conduct tom ii Epist xx xxi xxii p eight hundred fifty two eight hundred eighty is one of the curious monuments of ecclesiastical antiquity It contains two letters to his sister Marcellina with a petition to Valentinian and the sermon de Basilicis non madendis But while he labored to restrain the effects of their zeal the pathetic vehemence of his sermons continually inflamed the angry and seditious temper of the people of Milan The characters of Eve of the wife of Job of Jezebel of Herodias were indecently applied to the mother of the emperor and her desire to obtain a church for the Arians was compared to the most cruel persecutions which Christianity had endured under the reign of Paganism The measures of the court served only to expose the magnitude of the evil A fine of two hundred pounds of gold was imposed on the corporate body of merchants and manufacturers an order was signified in the name of the emperor to all the officers and inferior servants of the courts of justice that during the continuance of the public disorders they should strictly confine themselves to their houses and the ministers of Valentinian imprudently confessed that the most respectable part of the citizens of Milan was attached to the cause of their archbishop He was again solicited to restore peace to his country by timely compliance with the will of his sovereign The reply of Ambrose was couched in the most humble and respectful terms which might however be interpreted as a serious declaration of civil war His life and fortune were in the hands of the emperor but he would never betray the church of Christ or degrade the dignity of the episcopal character In such a cause he was prepared to suffer whatever the malice of the daemon could inflict and he only wished to die in the presence of his faithful flock and at the foot of the altar he had not contributed to excite but it was in the power of God alone to appease the rage of the people he deprecated the scenes of blood and confusion which were likely to ensue and it was his fervent prayer that he might not survive to behold the ruin of a flourishing city and perhaps the desolation of all Italy sixty four The obstinate bigotry of Justina would have endangered the empire of her son if in this contest with the church and people of Milan she could have depended on the active obedience of the troops of the palace A large body of Goths had marched to occupy the Basilica which was the object of the dispute and it might be expected from the Arian principles and barbarous manners of these foreign mercenaries that they would not entertain any scruples in the execution of the most sanguinary orders They were encountered on the sacred threshold by the archbishop who thundering against them a sentence of excommunication asked them in the tone of a father and a master whether it was to invade the house of God that they had implored the hospitable protection of the republic The suspense of the Barbarians allowed some hours for a more effectual negotiation and the empress was persuaded by the advice of her wisest counsellors to leave the Catholics in possession of all the churches of Milan and to dissemble till a more convenient season her intentions of revenge The mother of Valentinian could never forgive the triumph of Ambrose and the royal youth uttered a passionate exclamation that his own servants were ready to betray him into the hands of an insolent priest Footnote sixty four Retz had a similar message from the queen to request that he would appease the tumult of Paris It was no longer in his power c A quoi j ajoutai tout ce que vous pouvez vous imaginer de respect de douleur de regret et de soumission c Memoires tom i p one hundred forty Certainly I do not compare either the causes or the men yet the coadjutor himself had some idea p eighty four of imitating saint Ambrose The laws of the empire some of which were inscribed with the name of Valentinian still condemned the Arian heresy and seemed to excuse the resistance of the Catholics By the influence of Justina an edict of toleration was promulgated in all the provinces which were subject to the court of Milan the free exercise of their religion was granted to those who professed the faith of Rimini and the emperor declared that all persons who should infringe this sacred and salutary constitution should be capitally punished as the enemies of the public peace sixty five The character and language of the archbishop of Milan may justify the suspicion that his conduct soon afforded a reasonable ground or at least a specious pretence to the Arian ministers who watched the opportunity of surprising him in some act of disobedience to a law which he strangely represents as a law of blood and tyranny A sentence of easy and honorable banishment was pronounced which enjoined Ambrose to depart from Milan without delay whilst it permitted him to choose the place of his exile and the number of his companions But the authority of the saints who have preached and practised the maxims of passive loyalty appeared to Ambrose of less moment than the extreme and pressing danger of the church He boldly refused to obey and his refusal was supported by the unanimous consent of his faithful people sixty six They guarded by turns the person of their archbishop the gates of the cathedral and the episcopal palace were strongly secured and the Imperial troops who had formed the blockade were unwilling to risk the attack of that impregnable fortress The numerous poor who had been relieved by the liberality of Ambrose embraced the fair occasion of signalizing their zeal and gratitude and as the patience of the multitude might have been exhausted by the length and uniformity of nocturnal vigils he prudently introduced into the church of Milan the useful institution of a loud and regular psalmody While he maintained this arduous contest he was instructed by a dream to open the earth in a place where the remains of two martyrs Gervasius and Protasius sixty seven had been deposited above three hundred years Immediately under the pavement of the church two perfect skeletons were found sixty eight with the heads separated from their bodies and a plentiful effusion of blood The holy relics were presented in solemn pomp to the veneration of the people and every circumstance of this fortunate discovery was admirably adapted to promote the designs of Ambrose The bones of the martyrs their blood their garments were supposed to contain a healing power and the praeternatural influence was communicated to the most distant objects without losing any part of its original virtue The extraordinary cure of a blind man sixty nine and the reluctant confessions of several daemoniacs appeared to justify the faith and sanctity of Ambrose and the truth of those miracles is attested by Ambrose himself by his secretary Paulinus and by his proselyte the celebrated Augustin who at that time professed the art of rhetoric in Milan The reason of the present age may possibly approve the incredulity of Justina and her Arian court who derided the theatrical representations which were exhibited by the contrivance and at the expense of the archbishop seventy Their effect however on the minds of the people was rapid and irresistible and the feeble sovereign of Italy found himself unable to contend with the favorite of Heaven The powers likewise of the earth interposed in the defence of Ambrose the disinterested advice of Theodosius was the genuine result of piety and friendship and the mask of religious zeal concealed the hostile and ambitious designs of the tyrant of Gaul seventy one Footnote sixty five

capriciously rejects that of Maximus though it is attested by Prosper Sozomen and Theodoret The reign of Maximus might have ended in peace and prosperity could he have contented himself with the possession of three ample countries which now constitute the three most flourishing kingdoms of modern Europe But the aspiring usurper whose sordid ambition was not dignified by the love of glory and of arms considered his actual forces as the instruments only of his future greatness and his success was the immediate cause of his destruction The wealth which he extorted seventy two from the oppressed provinces of Gaul Spain and Britain was employed in levying and maintaining a formidable army of Barbarians collected for the most part from the fiercest nations of Germany The conquest of Italy was the object of his hopes and preparations and he secretly meditated the ruin of an innocent youth whose government was abhorred and despised by his Catholic subjects But as Maximus wished to occupy without resistance the passes of the Alps he received with perfidious smiles Domninus of Syria the ambassador of Valentinian and pressed him to accept the aid of a considerable body of troops for the service of a Pannonian war The penetration of Ambrose had discovered the snares of an enemy under the professions of friendship seventy three but the Syrian Domninus was corrupted or deceived by the liberal favor of the court of Treves and the council of Milan obstinately rejected the suspicion of danger with a blind confidence which was the effect not of courage but of fear The march of the auxiliaries was guided by the ambassador and they were admitted without distrust into the fortresses of the Alps But the crafty tyrant followed with hasty and silent footsteps in the rear and as he diligently intercepted all intelligence of his motions the gleam of armor and the dust excited by the troops of cavalry first announced the hostile approach of a stranger to the gates of Milan In this extremity Justina and her son might accuse their own imprudence and the perfidious arts of Maximus but they wanted time and force and resolution to stand against the Gauls and Germans either in the field or within the walls of a large and disaffected city Flight was their only hope Aquileia their only refuge and as Maximus now displayed his genuine character the brother of Gratian might expect the same fate from the hands of the same assassin Maximus entered Milan in triumph and if the wise archbishop refused a dangerous and criminal connection with the usurper he might indirectly contribute to the success of his arms by inculcating from the pulpit the duty of resignation rather than that of resistance seventy four The unfortunate Justina reached Aquileia in safety but she distrusted the strength of the fortifications she dreaded the event of a siege and she resolved to implore the protection of the great Theodosius whose power and virtue were celebrated in all the countries of the West A vessel was secretly provided to transport the Imperial family they embarked with precipitation in one of the obscure harbors of Venetia or Istria traversed the whole extent of the Adriatic and Ionian Seas turned the extreme promontory of Peloponnesus and after a long but successful navigation reposed themselves in the port of Thessalonica All the subjects of Valentinian deserted the cause of a prince who by his abdication had absolved them from the duty of allegiance and if the little city of Aemona on the verge of Italy had not presumed to stop the career of his inglorious victory Maximus would have obtained without a struggle the sole possession of the Western empire Footnote seventy two The modest censure of Sulpicius Dialog iii fifteen inflicts a much

reasons did not proceed from contempt or indifference as he speedily made a visit to that city accompanied by the greatest part of his court and senate After the first tender expressions of friendship and sympathy the pious emperor of the East gently admonished Justina that the guilt of heresy was sometimes punished in this world as well as in the next and that the public profession of the Nicene faith would be the most efficacious step to promote the restoration of her son by the satisfaction which it must occasion both on earth and in heaven The momentous question of peace or war was referred by Theodosius to the deliberation of his council and the arguments which might be alleged on the side of honor and justice had acquired since the death of Gratian a considerable degree of additional weight The persecution of the Imperial family to which Theodosius himself had been indebted for his fortune was now aggravated by recent and repeated injuries Neither oaths nor treaties could restrain the boundless ambition of Maximus and the delay of vigorous and decisive measures instead of prolonging the blessings of peace would expose the Eastern empire to the danger of a hostile invasion The Barbarians who had passed the Danube had lately assumed the character of soldiers and subjects but their native fierceness was yet untamed and the operations of a war which would exercise their valor and diminish their numbers might tend to relieve the provinces from an intolerable oppression Notwithstanding these specious and solid reasons which were approved by a majority of the council Theodosius still hesitated whether he should draw the sword in a contest which could no longer admit any terms of reconciliation and his magnanimous character was not disgraced by the apprehensions which he felt for the safety of his infant sons and the welfare of his exhausted people In this moment of anxious doubt while the fate of the Roman world depended on the resolution of a single man the charms of the princess Galla most powerfully pleaded the cause of her brother Valentinian seventy five The heart of Theodosius wa softened by the tears of beauty his affections were insensibly engaged by the graces of youth and innocence the art of Justina managed and directed the impulse of passion and the celebration of the royal nuptials was the assurance and signal of the civil war The unfeeling critics who consider every amorous weakness as an indelible stain on the memory of a great and orthodox emperor are inclined on this occasion to dispute the suspicious evidence of the historian Zosimus For my own part I shall frankly confess that I am willing to find or even to seek in the revolutions of the world some traces of the mild and tender sentiments of domestic life and amidst the crowd of fierce and ambitious conquerors I can distinguish with peculiar complacency a gentle hero who may be supposed to receive his armor from the hands of love The alliance of the Persian king was secured by the faith of treaties the martial Barbarians were persuaded to follow the standard or to respect the frontiers of an active and liberal monarch and the dominions of Theodosius from the Euphrates to the Adriatic resounded with the preparations of war both by land and sea The skilful disposition of the forces of the East seemed to multiply their numbers and distracted the attention of Maximus He had reason to fear that a chosen body of troops under the command of the intrepid Arbogastes would direct their march along the banks of the Danube and boldly penetrate through the Rhaetian provinces into the centre of Gaul A powerful fleet was equipped in the harbors of Greece and Epirus with an apparent design that as soon as the passage had been opened by a naval victory Valentinian and his mother should land in Italy proceed without delay to Rome and occupy the majestic seat of religion and empire In the mean while Theodosius himself advanced at the head of a brave and disciplined army to encounter his unworthy rival who after the siege of Aemona seven thousand five hundred eleven had fixed his camp in the neighborhood of Siscia a city of Pannonia strongly fortified by the broad and rapid stream of the Save Footnote seventy five The flight of Valentinian and the love of Theodosius for his sister are related by Zosimus l iv p two

Reign Of Theodosius Part IV The veterans who still remembered the long resistance and successive resources of the tyrant Magnentius might prepare themselves for the labors of three bloody campaigns But the contest with his successor who like him had usurped the throne of the West was easily decided in the term of two months seventy six and within the space of two hundred miles The superior genius of the emperor of the East might prevail over the feeble Maximus who in this important crisis showed himself destitute of military skill or personal courage but the abilities of Theodosius were seconded by the advantage which he possessed of a numerous and active cavalry The Huns the Alani and after their example the Goths themselves were formed into squadrons of archers who fought on horseback and confounded the steady valor of the Gauls and Germans by the rapid motions of a Tartar war After the fatigue of a long march in the heat of summer they spurred their foaming horses into the waters of the Save swam the river in the presence of the enemy and instantly charged and routed the troops who guarded the high ground on the opposite side Marcellinus the tyrant s brother advanced to support them with the select cohorts which were considered as the hope and strength of the army The action which had been interrupted by the approach of night was renewed in the morning and after a sharp conflict the surviving remnant of the bravest soldiers of Maximus threw down their arms at the feet of the conqueror Without suspending his march to receive the loyal acclamations of the citizens of Aemona Theodosius pressed forwards to terminate the war by the death or captivity of his rival who fled before him with the diligence of fear From the summit of the Julian Alps he descended with such incredible speed into the plain of Italy that he reached Aquileia on the evening of the first day and Maximus who found himself encompassed on all sides had scarcely time to shut the gates of the city But the gates could not long resist the effort of a victorious enemy and the despair the disaffection the indifference of the soldiers and people hastened the downfall of the wretched Maximus He was dragged from his throne rudely stripped of the Imperial ornaments the robe the diadem and the purple slippers and conducted like a malefactor to the camp and presence of Theodosius at a place about three miles from Aquileia The behavior of the emperor was not intended to insult and he showed disposition to pity and forgive the tyrant of the West who had never been his personal enemy and was now become the object of his contempt Our sympathy is the most forcibly excited by the misfortunes to which we are exposed and the spectacle of a proud competitor now prostrate at his feet could not fail of producing very serious and solemn thoughts in the mind of the victorious emperor But the feeble emotion of involuntary pity was checked by his regard for public justice and the memory of Gratian and he abandoned the victim to the pious zeal of the soldiers who drew him out of the Imperial presence and instantly separated his head from his body The intelligence of his defeat and death was received with sincere or well dissembled joy his son Victor on whom he had conferred the title of Augustus died by the order perhaps by the hand of the bold Arbogastes and all the military plans of Theodosius were successfully executed When he had thus terminated the civil war with less difficulty and bloodshed than he might naturally expect he employed the winter months of his residence at Milan to restore the state of the afflicted provinces and early in the spring he made after the example of Constantine and Constantius his triumphal entry into the ancient capital of the Roman empire seventy seven Footnote seventy six See Godefroy s Chronology of the Laws Cod Theodos tom l p cxix Footnote seventy seven Besides the hints which may be gathered from chronicles and

without reluctance seventy eight and posterity will confess that the character of Theodosius seventy nine might furnish the subject of a sincere and ample panegyric The wisdom of his laws and the success of his arms rendered his administration respectable in the eyes both of his subjects and of his enemies He loved and practised the virtues of domestic life which seldom hold their residence in the palaces of kings Theodosius was chaste and temperate he enjoyed without excess the sensual and social pleasures of the table and the warmth of his amorous passions was never diverted from their lawful objects The proud titles of Imperial greatness were adorned by the tender names of a faithful husband an indulgent father his uncle was raised by his affectionate esteem to the rank of a second parent Theodosius embraced as his own the children of his brother and sister and the expressions of his regard were extended to the most distant and obscure branches of his numerous kindred His familiar friends were judiciously selected from among those persons who in the equal intercourse of private life had appeared before his eyes without a mask the consciousness of personal and superior merit enabled him to despise the accidental distinction of the purple and he proved by his conduct that he had forgotten all the injuries while he most gratefully remembered all the favors and services which he had received before he ascended the throne of the Roman empire The serious or lively tone of his conversation was adapted to the age the rank or the character of his subjects whom he admitted into his society and the affability of his manners displayed the image of his mind Theodosius respected the simplicity of the good and virtuous every art every talent of a useful or even of an innocent nature was rewarded by his judicious liberality and except the heretics whom he persecuted with implacable hatred the diffusive circle of his benevolence was circumscribed only by the limits of the human race The government of a mighty empire may assuredly suffice to occupy the time and the abilities of a mortal yet the diligent prince without aspiring to the unsuitable reputation of profound learning always reserved some moments of his leisure for the instructive amusement of reading History which enlarged his experience was his favorite study The annals of Rome in the long period of eleven hundred years presented him with a various and splendid picture of human life and it has been particularly observed that whenever he perused the cruel acts of Cinna of Marius or of Sylla he warmly expressed his generous detestation of those enemies of humanity and freedom His disinterested opinion of past events was usefully applied as the rule of his own actions and Theodosius has deserved the singular commendation that his virtues always seemed to expand with his fortune the season of his prosperity was that of his moderation and his clemency appeared the most conspicuous after the danger and success of a civil war The Moorish guards of the tyrant had been massacred in the first heat of the victory and a small number of the most obnoxious criminals suffered the punishment of the law But the emperor showed himself much more attentive to relieve the innocent than to chastise the guilty The oppressed subjects of the West who would have deemed themselves happy in the restoration of their lands were astonished to receive a sum of money equivalent to their losses and the liberality of the conqueror supported the aged mother and educated the orphan daughters of Maximus eighty A character thus accomplished might almost excuse the extravagant supposition of the orator Pacatus that if the elder Brutus could be permitted to revisit the earth the stern republican would abjure at the feet of Theodosius his hatred of kings and ingenuously confess that such a monarch was the most faithful guardian of the happiness and dignity of the Roman people eighty

exalting the father above the son Footnote eighty Ambros tom ii Epist xl p fifty five Pacatus from the want of skill or of courage omits this glorious circumstance Footnote eighty one Pacat in Panegyr Vet xii twenty Yet the piercing eye of the founder of the republic must have discerned two essential imperfections which might perhaps have abated his recent love of despostism The virtuous mind of Theodosius was often relaxed by indolence eighty two and it was sometimes inflamed by passion eighty three In the pursuit of an important object his active courage was capable of the most vigorous exertions but as soon as the design was accomplished or the danger was surmounted the hero sunk into inglorious repose and forgetful that the time of a prince is the property of his people resigned himself to the enjoyment of the innocent but trifling pleasures of a luxurious court The natural disposition of Theodosius was hasty and choleric and in a station where none could resist and few would dissuade the fatal consequence of his resentment the humane monarch was justly alarmed by the consciousness of his infirmity and of his power It was the constant study of his life to suppress or regulate the intemperate sallies of passion and the success of his efforts enhanced the merit of his clemency But the painful virtue which claims the merit of victory is exposed to the danger of defeat and the reign of a wise and merciful prince was polluted by an act of cruelty which would stain the annals of Nero or Domitian Within the space of three years the inconsistent historian of Theodosius must relate the generous pardon of the citizens of Antioch and the inhuman massacre of the people of Thessalonica Footnote eighty two Zosimus l iv p two hundred seventy one two hundred

misericordiam si quis stimulet in magis exsuscitas ut eum revocare vix possis tom ii Epist li p nine hundred ninety eight Theodosius Claud in iv honorable two hundred sixty six c exhorts his son to moderate his anger The lively impatience of the inhabitants of Antioch was never satisfied with their own situation or with the character and conduct of their successive sovereigns The Arian subjects of Theodosius deplored the loss of their churches and as three rival bishops disputed the throne of Antioch the sentence which decided their pretensions excited the murmurs of the two unsuccessful congregations The exigencies of the Gothic war and the inevitable expense that accompanied the conclusion of the peace had constrained the emperor to aggravate the weight of the public impositions and the provinces of Asia as they had not been involved in the distress were the less inclined to contribute to the relief of Europe The auspicious period now approached of the tenth year of his reign a festival more grateful to the soldiers who received a liberal donative than to the subjects whose voluntary offerings had been long since converted into an extraordinary and oppressive burden The edicts of taxation interrupted the repose and pleasures of Antioch and the tribunal of the magistrate was besieged by a suppliant crowd who in pathetic but at first in respectful language solicited the redress of their grievances They were gradually incensed by the pride of their haughty rulers who treated their complaints as a criminal resistance their satirical wit degenerated into sharp and angry invectives and from the subordinate powers of government the invectives of the people insensibly rose to attack the sacred character of the emperor himself Their fury provoked by a feeble opposition discharged itself on the images of the Imperial family which were erected as objects of public veneration in the most conspicuous places of the city The statues of Theodosius of his father of his wife Flaccilla of his two sons Arcadius and Honorius were insolently thrown down from their pedestals broken in pieces or dragged with contempt through the streets and the indignities which were offered to the representations of Imperial majesty sufficiently declared the impious and treasonable wishes of the populace The tumult was almost immediately suppressed by the arrival of a body of archers and Antioch had leisure to reflect on the nature and consequences of her crime eighty four According to the duty of his office the governor of the province despatched a faithful narrative of the whole transaction while the trembling citizens intrusted the confession of their crime and the assurances of their repentance to the zeal of Flavian their bishop and to the eloquence of the senator Hilarius the friend and most probably the disciple of Libanius whose genius on this melancholy occasion was not useless to his country eighty five But the two capitals Antioch and Constantinople were separated by the distance of eight hundred miles and notwithstanding the diligence of the Imperial posts the guilty city was severely punished by a long and dreadful interval of suspense Every rumor agitated the hopes and fears of the Antiochians and they heard with terror that their sovereign exasperated by the insult which had been offered to his own statues and more especially to those of his beloved wife had resolved to level with the ground the offending city and to massacre without distinction of age or sex the criminal inhabitants eighty six many of whom were actually driven by their apprehensions to seek a refuge in the mountains of Syria and the adjacent desert At length twenty four days after the sedition the general Hellebicus and Caesarius master of the offices declared the will of the emperor and the sentence of Antioch That proud capital was degraded from the rank of a city and the metropolis of the East stripped of its lands its privileges and its revenues was subjected under the humiliating denomination of a village to the jurisdiction of Laodicea eighty seven The baths the Circus and the theatres were shut and that every source of plenty and pleasure might at the same time be intercepted the distribution of corn was abolished by the severe instructions of Theodosius His commissioners then proceeded to inquire into the guilt of individuals of those who had perpetrated and of those who had not prevented the destruction of the sacred statues The tribunal of Hellebicus and Caesarius encompassed with armed soldiers was erected in the midst of the Forum The noblest and most wealthy of the citizens of Antioch appeared before them in chains the examination was assisted by the use of torture and their sentence was pronounced or suspended according to the judgment of these extraordinary magistrates The houses of the criminals were exposed to sale their wives and children were suddenly reduced from affluence and luxury to the most abject distress and a bloody execution was expected to conclude the horrors of the day eighty eight which the preacher of Antioch the eloquent Chrysostom has represented as a lively image of the last and universal judgment of the world But the ministers of Theodosius performed with reluctance the cruel task which had been assigned them they dropped a gentle tear over the calamities of the people and they listened with reverence to the pressing solicitations of the monks and hermits who descended in swarms from the mountains eighty nine Hellebicus and Caesarius were persuaded to suspend the execution of their sentence and it was agreed that the former should remain at Antioch while the latter returned with all possible speed to Constantinople and presumed once more to consult the will of his sovereign The resentment of Theodosius had already subsided the deputies of the people both the bishop and the orator had obtained a favorable audience and the reproaches of the emperor were the complaints of injured friendship rather than the stern menaces of pride and power A free and general pardon was granted to the city and citizens of Antioch the prison doors were thrown open the senators who despaired of their lives recovered the possession of their houses and estates and the capital of the East was restored to the enjoyment of her ancient dignity and splendor Theodosius condescended to praise the senate of Constantinople who had generously interceded for their distressed brethren he rewarded the eloquence of Hilarius with the government of Palestine and dismissed the bishop of Antioch with the warmest expressions of his respect and gratitude A thousand new statues arose to the clemency of Theodosius the applause of his subjects was ratified by the approbation of his own heart and the emperor confessed that if the exercise of justice is the most important duty the indulgence of mercy is the most exquisite pleasure of a sovereign ninety Footnote eighty four The Christians and Pagans agreed in believing that the sedition of Antioch was excited by the daemons A gigantic woman says Sozomen l vii c twenty three paraded the streets with a scourge in her hand An

seven two hundred twenty four had read him with pious curiosity and diligence The sedition of Thessalonica is ascribed to a more shameful cause and was productive of much more dreadful consequences That great city the metropolis of all the Illyrian provinces had been protected from the dangers of the Gothic war by strong fortifications and a numerous garrison Botheric the general of those troops and as it should seem from his name a Barbarian had among his slaves a beautiful boy who excited the impure desires of one of the charioteers of the Circus The insolent and brutal lover was thrown into prison by the order of Botheric and he sternly rejected the importunate clamors of the multitude who on the day of the public games lamented the absence of their favorite and considered the skill of a charioteer as an object of more importance than his virtue The resentment of the people was imbittered by some previous disputes and as the strength of the garrison had been drawn away for the service of the Italian war the feeble remnant whose numbers were reduced by desertion could not save the unhappy general from their licentious fury Botheric and several of his principal officers were inhumanly murdered their mangled bodies were dragged about the streets and the emperor who then resided at Milan was surprised by the intelligence of the audacious and wanton cruelty of the people of Thessalonica The sentence of a dispassionate judge would have inflicted a severe punishment on the authors of the crime and the merit of Botheric might contribute to exasperate the grief and indignation of his master The fiery and choleric temper of Theodosius was impatient of the dilatory forms of a judicial inquiry and he hastily resolved that the blood of his lieutenant should be expiated by the blood of the guilty people Yet his mind still fluctuated between the counsels of clemency and of revenge the zeal of the bishops had almost extorted from the reluctant emperor the promise of a general pardon his passion was again inflamed by the flattering suggestions of his minister Rufinus and after Theodosius had despatched the messengers of death he attempted when it was too late to prevent the execution of his orders The punishment of a Roman city was blindly committed to the undistinguishing sword of the Barbarians and the hostile preparations were concerted with the dark and perfidious artifice of an illegal conspiracy The people of Thessalonica were treacherously invited in the name of their sovereign to the games of the Circus and such was their insatiate avidity for those amusements that every consideration of fear or suspicion was disregarded by the numerous spectators As soon as the assembly was complete the soldiers who had secretly been posted round the Circus received the signal not of the races but of a general massacre The promiscuous carnage continued three hours without discrimination of strangers or natives of age or sex of innocence or guilt the most moderate accounts state the number of the slain at seven thousand and it is affirmed by some writers that more than fifteen thousand victims were sacrificed to the names of Botheric A foreign merchant who had probably no concern in his murder offered his own life and all his wealth to supply the place of one of his two sons but while the father hesitated with equal tenderness while he was doubtful to choose and unwilling to condemn the soldiers determined his suspense by plunging their daggers at the same moment into the breasts of the defenceless youths The apology of the assassins that they were obliged to produce the prescribed number of heads serves only to increase by an appearance of order and design the horrors of the massacre which was executed by the commands of Theodosius The guilt of the emperor is aggravated by his long and frequent residence at Thessalonica The situation of the unfortunate city the aspect of the streets and buildings the dress and faces of the inhabitants were familiar and even present to his imagination and Theodosius possessed a quick and lively sense of the existence of the people whom he destroyed ninety one Footnote ninety one The original evidence of Ambrose tom ii Epist li p nine hundred ninety eight Augustin de Civitat Dei v twenty six and Paulinus in Vit Ambros c twenty four is delivered in vague expressions of horror and pity It is illustrated by the subsequent and unequal testimonies of Sozomen l vii c twenty five Theodoret l v c seventeen Theophanes Chronograph p sixty two Cedrenus p three hundred seventeen and Zonaras tom ii l xiii p thirty four Zosimus alone the partial enemy of Theodosius most unaccountably passes over in silence the worst of his actions The respectful attachment of the emperor for the orthodox clergy had disposed him to love and admire the character of Ambrose who united all the episcopal virtues in the most eminent degree The friends and ministers of Theodosius imitated the example of their sovereign and he observed with more surprise than displeasure that all his secret counsels were immediately communicated to the archbishop who acted from the laudable persuasion that every measure of civil government may have some connection with the glory of God and the interest of the true religion The monks and populace of Callinicum nine thousand one hundred eleven an obscure town on the frontier of Persia excited by their own fanaticism and by that of their bishop had tumultuously burnt a conventicle of the Valentinians and a synagogue of the Jews The seditious prelate was condemned by the magistrate of the province either to rebuild the synagogue or to repay the damage and this moderate sentence was confirmed by the emperor But it was not confirmed by the archbishop of Milan ninety two He dictated an epistle of censure and reproach more suitable perhaps if the emperor had received the mark of circumcision and renounced the faith of his baptism Ambrose considers the toleration of the Jewish as the persecution of the Christian religion boldly declares that he himself and every true believer would eagerly dispute with the bishop of Callinicum the merit of the deed and the crown of martyrdom and laments in the most pathetic terms that the execution of the sentence would be fatal to the fame and salvation of Theodosius As this private admonition did not produce an immediate effect the archbishop from his pulpit ninety three publicly addressed the emperor on his throne ninety four nor would he consent to offer the oblation of the altar till he had obtained from Theodosius a solemn and positive declaration which secured the impunity of the bishop and monks of Callinicum The recantation of Theodosius was sincere ninety

woman who washed and anointed the feet of Christ But the peroration is direct and personal Footnote ninety four Hodie Episcope de me proposuisti Ambrose modestly confessed it but he sternly reprimanded Timasius general of the horse and foot who had presumed to say that the monks of Callinicum deserved punishment Footnote ninety five Yet five years afterwards when Theodosius was absent from his spiritual guide he tolerated the Jews and condemned the destruction of their synagogues Cod Theodos l xvi tit viii leg nine with Godefroy s Commentary tom vi p two hundred twenty five When Ambrose was informed of the massacre of Thessalonica his mind was filled with horror and anguish He retired into the country to indulge his grief and to avoid the presence of Theodosius But as the archbishop was satisfied that a timid silence would render him the accomplice of his guilt he represented in a private letter the enormity of the crime which could only be effaced by the tears of penitence The episcopal vigor of Ambrose was tempered by prudence and he contented himself with signifying ninety six an indirect sort of excommunication by the assurance that he had been warned in a vision not to offer the oblation in the name or in the presence of Theodosius and by the advice that he would confine himself to the use of prayer without presuming to approach the altar of Christ or to receive the holy eucharist with those hands that were still polluted with the blood of an innocent people The emperor was deeply affected by his own reproaches and by those of his spiritual father and after he had bewailed the mischievous and irreparable consequences of his rash fury he proceeded in the accustomed manner to perform his devotions in the great church of Milan He was stopped in the porch by the archbishop who in the tone and language of an ambassador of Heaven declared to his sovereign that private contrition was not sufficient to atone for a public fault or to appease the justice of the offended Deity Theodosius humbly represented that if he had contracted the guilt of homicide David the man after God s own heart had been guilty not only of murder but of adultery You have imitated David in his crime imitate then his repentance was the reply of the undaunted Ambrose The rigorous conditions of peace and pardon were accepted and the public penance of the emperor Theodosius has been recorded as one of the most honorable events in the annals of the church According to the mildest rules of ecclesiastical discipline which were established in the fourth century the crime of homicide was expiated by the penitence of twenty years ninety seven and as it was impossible in the period of human life to purge the accumulated guilt of the massacre of Thessalonica the murderer should have been excluded from the holy communion till the hour of his death But the archbishop consulting the maxims of religious policy granted some indulgence to the rank of his illustrious penitent who humbled in the dust the pride of the diadem and the public edification might be admitted as a weighty reason to abridge the duration of his punishment It was sufficient that the emperor of the Romans stripped of the ensigns of royalty should appear in a mournful and suppliant posture and that in the midst of the church of Milan he should humbly solicit with sighs and tears the pardon of his sins ninety eight In this spiritual cure Ambrose employed the various methods of mildness and severity After a delay of about eight months Theodosius was restored to the communion of the faithful and the edict which interposes a salutary interval of thirty days between the sentence and the execution may be accepted as the worthy fruits of his repentance ninety nine Posterity has applauded the virtuous firmness of the archbishop and the example of Theodosius may prove the beneficial influence of those principles which could force a monarch exalted above the apprehension of human punishment to respect the laws and ministers of an invisible Judge The prince says Montesquieu who is actuated by the hopes and fears of religion may be compared to a lion docile only to the voice and tractable to the hand of his keeper one hundred The motions of the royal animal will therefore depend on the inclination and interest of the man who has acquired such dangerous authority over him and the priest who holds in his hands the conscience of a king may inflame or moderate his sanguinary passions The cause of humanity and that of persecution have been asserted by the same Ambrose with equal energy and with equal success Footnote ninety six Ambros tom ii Epist li p nine hundred ninety seven ten oh one His epistle is a miserable rhapsody on a noble subject

possession of Theodosius He derived from the choice of Gratian his honorable title to the provinces of the East he had acquired the West by the right of conquest and the three years which he spent in Italy were usefully employed to restore the authority of the laws and to correct the abuses which had prevailed with impunity under the usurpation of Maximus and the minority of Valentinian The name of Valentinian was regularly inserted in the public acts but the tender age and doubtful faith of the son of Justina appeared to require the prudent care of an orthodox guardian and his specious ambition might have excluded the unfortunate youth without a struggle and almost without a murmur from the administration and even from the inheritance of the empire If Theodosius had consulted the rigid maxims of interest and policy his conduct would have been justified by his friends but the generosity of his behavior on this memorable occasion has extorted the applause of his most inveterate enemies He seated Valentinian on the throne of Milan and without stipulating any present or future advantages restored him to the absolute dominion of all the provinces from which he had been driven by the arms of Maximus To the restitution of his ample patrimony Theodosius added the free and generous gift of the countries beyond the Alps which his successful valor had recovered from the assassin of Gratian one hundred one Satisfied with the glory which he had acquired by revenging the death of his benefactor and delivering the West from the yoke of tyranny the emperor returned from Milan to Constantinople and in the peaceful possession of the East insensibly relapsed into his former habits of luxury and indolence Theodosius discharged his obligation to the brother he indulged his conjugal tenderness to the sister of Valentinian and posterity which admires the pure and singular glory of his elevation must applaud his unrivalled generosity in the use of victory Footnote one

Justina did not long survive her return to Italy and though she beheld the triumph of Theodosius she was not allowed to influence the government of her son one hundred two The pernicious attachment to the Arian sect which Valentinian had imbibed from her example and instructions was soon erased by the lessons of a more orthodox education His growing zeal for the faith of Nice and his filial reverence for the character and authority of Ambrose disposed the Catholics to entertain the most favorable opinion of the virtues of the young emperor of the West one hundred three They applauded his chastity and temperance his contempt of pleasure his application to business and his tender affection for his two sisters which could not however seduce his impartial equity to pronounce an unjust sentence against the meanest of his subjects But this amiable youth before he had accomplished the twentieth year of his age was oppressed by domestic treason and the empire was again involved in the horrors of a civil war Arbogastes one hundred four a gallant soldier of the nation of the Franks held the second rank in the service of Gratian On the death of his master he joined the standard of Theodosius contributed by his valor and military conduct to the destruction of the tyrant and was appointed after the victory master general of the armies of Gaul His real merit and apparent fidelity had gained the confidence both of the prince and people his boundless liberality corrupted the allegiance of the troops and whilst he was universally esteemed as the pillar of the state the bold and crafty Barbarian was secretly determined either to rule or to ruin the empire of the West The important commands of the army were distributed among the Franks the creatures of Arbogastes were promoted to all the honors and offices of the civil government the progress of the conspiracy removed every faithful servant from the presence of Valentinian and the emperor without power and without intelligence insensibly sunk into the precarious and dependent condition of a captive one hundred five The indignation which he expressed though it might arise only from the rash and impatient temper of youth may be candidly ascribed to the generous spirit of a prince who felt that he was not unworthy to reign He secretly invited the archbishop of Milan to undertake the office of a mediator as the pledge of his sincerity and the guardian of his safety He contrived to apprise the emperor of the East of his helpless situation and he declared that unless Theodosius could speedily march to his assistance he must attempt to escape from the palace or rather prison of Vienna in Gaul where he had imprudently fixed his residence in the midst of the hostile faction But the hopes of relief were distant and doubtful and as every day furnished some new provocation the emperor without strength or counsel too hastily resolved to risk an immediate contest with his powerful general He received Arbogastes on the throne and as the count approached with some appearance of respect delivered to him a paper which dismissed him from all his employments My authority replied Arbogastes with insulting coolness does not depend on the smile or the frown of a monarch and he contemptuously threw the paper on the ground The indignant monarch snatched at the sword of one of the guards which he struggled to draw from its scabbard and it was not without some degree of violence that he was prevented from using the deadly weapon against his enemy or against himself A few days after this extraordinary quarrel in which he had exposed his resentment and his weakness the unfortunate Valentinian was found strangled in his apartment and some pains were employed to disguise the manifest guilt of Arbogastes and to persuade the world that the death of the young emperor had been the voluntary effect of his own despair one hundred six His body was conducted with decent pomp to the sepulchre of Milan and the archbishop pronounced a funeral oration to commemorate his virtues and his misfortunes one hundred seven On this occasion the humanity of Ambrose tempted him to make a singular breach in his theological system and to comfort the weeping sisters of Valentinian by the firm assurance that their pious brother though he had not received the sacrament of baptism was

the success of his ambitious designs and the provincials in whose breast every sentiment of patriotism or loyalty was extinguished expected with tame resignation the unknown master whom the choice of a Frank might place on the Imperial throne But some remains of pride and prejudice still opposed the elevation of Arbogastes himself and the judicious Barbarian thought it more advisable to reign under the name of some dependent Roman He bestowed the purple on the rhetorician Eugenius one hundred nine whom he had already raised from the place of his domestic secretary to the rank of master of the offices In the course both of his private and public service the count had always approved the attachment and abilities of Eugenius his learning and eloquence supported by the gravity of his manners recommended him to the esteem of the people and the reluctance with which he seemed to ascend the throne may inspire a favorable prejudice of his virtue and moderation The ambassadors of the new emperor were immediately despatched to the court of Theodosius to communicate with affected grief the unfortunate accident of the death of Valentinian and without mentioning the name of Arbogastes to request that the monarch of the East would embrace as his lawful colleague the respectable citizen who had obtained the unanimous suffrage of the armies and provinces of the West one hundred ten Theodosius was justly provoked that the perfidy of a Barbarian should have destroyed in a moment the labors and the fruit of his former victory and he was excited by the tears of his beloved wife one hundred eleven to revenge the fate of her unhappy brother and once more to assert by arms the violated majesty of the throne But as the second conquest of the West was a task of difficulty and danger he dismissed with splendid presents and an ambiguous answer the ambassadors of Eugenius and almost two years were consumed in the preparations of the civil war Before he formed any decisive resolution the pious emperor was anxious to discover the will of Heaven and as the progress of Christianity had silenced the oracles of Delphi and Dodona he consulted an Egyptian monk who possessed in the opinion of the age the gift of miracles and the knowledge of futurity Eutropius one of the favorite eunuchs of the palace of Constantinople embarked for Alexandria from whence he sailed up the Nile as far as the city of Lycopolis or of Wolves in the remote province of Thebais one hundred twelve In the neighborhood of that city and on the summit of a lofty mountain the holy John one hundred thirteen had constructed with his own hands an humble cell in which he had dwelt above fifty years without opening his door without seeing the face of a woman and without tasting any food that had been prepared by fire or any human art Five days of the week he spent in prayer and meditation but on Saturdays and Sundays he regularly opened a small window and gave audience to the crowd of suppliants who successively flowed from every part of the Christian world The eunuch of Theodosius approached the window with respectful steps proposed his questions concerning the event of the civil war and soon returned with a favorable oracle which animated the courage of the emperor by the assurance of a bloody but infallible victory one hundred fourteen The accomplishment of the prediction was forwarded by all the means that human prudence could supply The industry of the two master generals Stilicho and Timasius was directed to recruit the numbers and to revive the discipline of the Roman legions The formidable troops of Barbarians marched under the ensigns of their national chieftains The Iberian the Arab and the Goth who gazed on each other with mutual astonishment were enlisted in

Maximus how dangerous it might prove to extend the line of defence against a skilful antagonist who was free to press or to suspend to contract or to multiply his various methods of attack one hundred sixteen Arbogastes fixed his station on the confines of Italy the troops of Theodosius were permitted to occupy without resistance the provinces of Pannonia as far as the foot of the Julian Alps and even the passes of the mountains were negligently or perhaps artfully abandoned to the bold invader He descended from the hills and beheld with some astonishment the formidable camp of the Gauls and Germans that covered with arms and tents the open country which extends to the walls of Aquileia and the banks of the Frigidus one hundred seventeen or Cold River one hundred eighteen This narrow theatre of the war circumscribed by the Alps and the Adriatic did not allow much room for the operations of military skill the spirit of Arbogastes would have disdained a pardon his guilt extinguished the hope of a negotiation and Theodosius was impatient to satisfy his glory and revenge by the chastisement of the assassins of Valentinian Without weighing the natural and artificial obstacles that opposed his efforts the emperor of the East immediately attacked the fortifications of his rivals assigned the post of honorable danger to the Goths and cherished a secret wish that the bloody conflict might diminish the pride and numbers of the conquerors Ten thousand of those auxiliaries and Bacurius general of the Iberians died bravely on the field of battle But the victory was not purchased by their blood the Gauls maintained their advantage and the approach of night protected the disorderly flight or retreat of the troops of Theodosius The emperor retired to the adjacent hills where he passed a disconsolate night without sleep without provisions and without hopes one hundred nineteen except that strong assurance which under the most desperate circumstances the independent mind may derive from the contempt of fortune and of life The triumph of Eugenius was celebrated by the insolent and dissolute joy of his camp whilst the active and vigilant Arbogastes secretly detached a considerable body of troops to occupy the passes of the mountains and to encompass the rear of the Eastern army The dawn of day discovered to the eyes of Theodosius the extent and the extremity of his danger but his apprehensions were soon dispelled by a friendly message from the leaders of those troops who expressed their inclination to desert the standard of the tyrant The honorable and lucrative rewards which they stipulated as the price of their perfidy were granted without hesitation and as ink and paper could not easily be procured the emperor subscribed on his own tablets the ratification of the treaty The spirit of his soldiers was revived by this seasonable reenforcement and they again marched with confidence to surprise the camp of a tyrant whose principal officers appeared to distrust either the justice or the success of his arms In the heat of the battle a violent tempest one hundred twenty such as is often felt among the Alps suddenly arose from the East The army of Theodosius was sheltered by their position from the impetuosity of the wind which blew a cloud of dust in the faces of the enemy disordered their ranks wrested their weapons from their hands and diverted or repelled their ineffectual javelins This accidental advantage was skilfully improved the violence of the storm was magnified by the superstitious terrors of the Gauls and they yielded without shame to the invisible powers of heaven who seemed to militate on the side of the pious emperor His victory was decisive and the deaths of his two rivals were distinguished only by the difference of their characters The rhetorician Eugenius who had almost acquired the dominion of the world was reduced to implore the mercy of the conqueror and the unrelenting soldiers separated his head from his body as he lay prostrate at the feet of Theodosius Arbogastes after the loss of a battle in which he had discharged the duties of a soldier and a general wandered several days among the mountains But when he was convinced that his cause was desperate and his escape impracticable the intrepid Barbarian imitated the example of the ancient Romans and turned his sword against his own breast The fate of the empire was determined in a narrow corner of Italy and the legitimate successor of the house of Valentinian embraced the archbishop of Milan and graciously received the submission of the provinces of the West Those provinces were involved in the guilt of rebellion while the inflexible courage of Ambrose alone had resisted the claims of successful usurpation With a manly freedom which might have been fatal to any other subject the archbishop rejected the gifts of Eugenius twelve oh one declined his correspondence and withdrew himself from Milan to avoid the odious presence of a tyrant whose downfall he predicted in discreet and ambiguous language The merit of Ambrose was applauded by the conqueror who secured the attachment of the people by

his future reign and the age of the emperor which did not exceed fifty years seemed to extend the prospect of the public felicity His death only four months after his victory was considered by the people as an unforeseen and fatal event which destroyed in a moment the hopes of the rising generation But the indulgence of ease and luxury had secretly nourished the principles of disease one hundred twenty two The strength of Theodosius was unable to support the sudden and violent transition from the palace to the camp and the increasing symptoms of a dropsy announced the speedy dissolution of the emperor The opinion and perhaps the interest of the public had confirmed the division of the Eastern and Western empires and the two royal youths Arcadius and Honorius who had already obtained from the tenderness of their father the title of Augustus were destined to fill the thrones of Constantinople and of Rome Those princes were not permitted to share the danger and glory of the civil war one hundred twenty three but as soon as Theodosius had triumphed over his unworthy rivals he called his younger son Honorius to enjoy the fruits of the victory and to receive the sceptre of the West from the hands of his dying father The arrival of Honorius at Milan was welcomed by a splendid exhibition of the games of the Circus and the emperor though he was oppressed by the weight of his disorder contributed by his presence to the public joy But the remains of his strength were exhausted by the painful effort which he made to assist at the spectacles of the morning Honorius supplied during the rest of the day the place of his father and the great Theodosius expired in the ensuing night Notwithstanding the recent animosities of a civil war his death was universally lamented The Barbarians whom he had vanquished and the churchmen by whom he had been subdued celebrated with loud and sincere applause the qualities of the deceased emperor which appeared the most valuable in their eyes The Romans were terrified by the impending dangers of a feeble and divided administration and every disgraceful moment of the unfortunate reigns of Arcadius and

the act of cruelty and the habits of indolence which tarnished the glory of one of the greatest of the Roman princes An historian perpetually adverse to the fame of Theodosius has exaggerated his vices and their pernicious effects he boldly asserts that every rank of subjects imitated the effeminate manners of their sovereign and that every species of corruption polluted the course of public and private life and that the feeble restraints of order and decency were insufficient to resist the progress of that degenerate spirit which sacrifices without a blush the consideration of duty and interest to the base indulgence of sloth and appetite one hundred twenty four The complaints of contemporary writers who deplore the increase of luxury and depravation of manners are commonly expressive of their peculiar temper and situation There are few observers who possess a clear and comprehensive view of the revolutions of society and who are capable of discovering the nice and secret springs of action which impel in the same uniform direction the blind and capricious passions of a multitude of individuals If it can be affirmed with any degree of truth that the luxury of the Romans was more shameless and dissolute in the reign of Theodosius than in the age of Constantine perhaps or of Augustus the alteration cannot be ascribed to any beneficial improvements which had gradually increased the stock of national riches A long period of calamity or decay must have checked the industry and diminished the wealth of the people and their profuse luxury must have been the result of that indolent despair which enjoys the present hour and declines the thoughts of futurity The uncertain condition of their property discouraged the subjects of Theodosius from engaging in those useful and laborious undertakings which require an immediate expense and promise a slow and distant advantage The frequent examples of ruin and desolation tempted them not to spare the remains of a patrimony which might every hour become the prey of the rapacious Goth And the mad prodigality which prevails in the confusion of a shipwreck or a siege may serve to explain the progress of luxury amidst the misfortunes and terrors of a sinking nation Footnote one hundred twenty four Zosimus l iv p two hundred forty four The effeminate luxury which infected the manners of courts and cities had instilled a secret and destructive poison into the camps of the legions and their degeneracy has been marked by the pen of a military writer who had accurately studied the genuine and ancient principles of Roman discipline It is the just and important observation of Vegetius that the infantry was invariably covered with defensive armor from the foundation of the city to the reign of the emperor Gratian The relaxation of discipline and the disuse of exercise rendered the soldiers less able and less willing to support the fatigues of the service they complained of the weight of the armor which they seldom wore and they successively obtained the permission of laying aside both their cuirasses and their helmets The heavy weapons of their ancestors the short sword and the formidable pilum which had subdued the world insensibly dropped from their feeble hands As the use of the shield is incompatible with that of the bow they reluctantly marched into the field condemned to suffer either the pain of wounds or the ignominy of flight and always disposed to prefer the more shameful alternative The cavalry of the Goths the Huns and the Alani had felt the benefits and adopted the use of defensive armor and as they excelled in the management of missile weapons they easily overwhelmed the naked and trembling legions whose heads and breasts were exposed without defence to the arrows of the Barbarians The loss of armies the destruction of cities and the dishonor of the Roman name ineffectually solicited the successors of Gratian to restore the helmets and the cuirasses of the infantry The enervated soldiers abandoned their own and the public defence and their pusillanimous indolence may be considered as the immediate cause of the downfall of the empire one hundred twenty five Footnote one hundred twenty five Vegetius de Re Militari l i c ten The series of calamities which he marks compel us to believe that the Hero to whom he dedicates his book is the last and most inglorious of the Valentinians Chapter XXVIII Destruction Of Paganism Part I Final Destruction Of Paganism Introduction Of The Worship Of Saints And Relics Among The Christians The ruin of Paganism in the age of Theodosius is perhaps the only example of the total extirpation of any ancient and popular superstition and may therefore deserve to be considered as a singular event in the history of the human mind The Christians more especially the clergy had impatiently supported the prudent delays of Constantine and the equal toleration of the elder Valentinian nor could they deem their conquest perfect or secure as long as their adversaries were permitted to exist The influence which Ambrose and his brethren had acquired over the youth of Gratian and the piety of Theodosius was employed to infuse the maxims of persecution into the breasts of their Imperial proselytes Two specious principles of religious jurisprudence were established from whence they deduced a direct and rigorous conclusion against the subjects of the empire who still adhered to the ceremonies of their ancestors that the magistrate is in some measure guilty of the crimes which he neglects to prohibit or to punish and that the idolatrous worship of fabulous deities and real daemons is the most abominable crime against the supreme majesty of the Creator The laws of Moses and the examples of Jewish history one were hastily perhaps erroneously applied by the clergy to the mild and universal reign of Christianity two The zeal of the emperors was excited to vindicate their own honor and that of the Deity and the temples of the Roman world were subverted about sixty years after the conversion of Constantine Footnote one saint Ambrose tom ii de Obit Theodos p twelve oh eight expressly praises and

limits these intolerant laws by the temporal reign of Jehovah over the Jews The attempt is laudable From the age of Numa to the reign of Gratian the Romans preserved the regular succession of the several colleges of the sacerdotal order three Fifteen Pontiffs exercised their supreme jurisdiction over all things and persons that were consecrated to the service of the gods and the various questions which perpetually arose in a loose and traditionary system were submitted to the judgment of their holy tribunal Fifteen grave and learned Augurs observed the face of the heavens and prescribed the actions of heroes according to the flight of birds Fifteen keepers of the Sibylline books their name of Quindecemvirs was derived from their number occasionally consulted the history of future and as it should seem of contingent events Six Vestals devoted their virginity to the guard of the sacred fire and of the unknown pledges of the duration of Rome which no mortal had been suffered to behold with impunity four Seven Epulos prepared the table of the gods conducted the solemn procession and regulated the ceremonies of the annual festival The three Flamens of Jupiter of Mars and of Quirinus were considered as the peculiar ministers of the three most powerful deities who watched over the fate of Rome and of the universe The King of the Sacrifices represented the person of Numa and of his successors in the religious functions which could be performed only by royal hands The confraternities of the Salians the Lupercals c practised such rites as might extort a smile of contempt from every reasonable man with a lively confidence of recommending themselves to the favor of the immortal gods The authority which the Roman priests had formerly obtained in the counsels of the republic was gradually abolished by the establishment of monarchy and the removal of the seat of empire But the dignity of their sacred character was still protected by the laws and manners of their country and they still continued more especially the college of pontiffs to exercise in the capital and sometimes in the provinces the rights of their ecclesiastical and civil jurisdiction Their robes of purple chariotz of state and sumptuous entertainments attracted the admiration of the people and they received from the consecrated lands and the public revenue an ample stipend which liberally supported the splendor of the priesthood and all the expenses of the religious worship of the state As the service of the altar was not incompatible with the command of armies the Romans after their consulships and triumphs aspired to the place of pontiff or of augur the seats of Cicero five and Pompey were filled in the fourth century by the most illustrious members of the senate and the dignity of their birth reflected additional splendor on their sacerdotal character The fifteen priests who composed the college of pontiffs enjoyed a more distinguished rank as the companions of their sovereign and the Christian emperors condescended to accept the robe and ensigns which were appropriated to the office of supreme pontiff But when Gratian ascended the throne more scrupulous or more enlightened he sternly rejected those profane symbols six applied to the service of the state or of the church the revenues of the priests and vestals abolished their honors and immunities and dissolved the ancient fabric of Roman superstition which was supported by the opinions and habits of eleven hundred years Paganism was still the constitutional religion of the senate The hall or temple in which they assembled was adorned by the statue and altar of Victory seven a majestic female standing on a globe with flowing garments expanded wings and a crown of laurel in her outstretched hand eight The senators were sworn on the altar of the goddess to observe the laws of the emperor and of the empire and a solemn offering of wine and incense was the ordinary prelude of their public deliberations The removal of this ancient monument was the only injury which Constantius had offered to the superstition of the Romans The altar of Victory was again restored by Julian tolerated by Valentinian and once more banished from the senate by the zeal of Gratian ten But the emperor yet spared the statues of the gods which were exposed to the public veneration four hundred and twenty four temples or chapels still remained to satisfy the devotion of the people and in every quarter of Rome the delicacy of the Christians was offended by the fumes of idolatrous sacrifice

eight hundred twenty five deplores the public scandals of Rome which continually offended the eyes the ears and the nostrils of the faithful But the Christians formed the least numerous party in the senate of Rome twelve and it was only by their absence that they could express their dissent from the legal though profane acts of a Pagan majority In that assembly the dying embers of freedom were for a moment revived and inflamed by the breath of fanaticism Four respectable deputations were successively voted to the Imperial court thirteen to represent the grievances of the priesthood and the senate and to solicit the restoration of the altar of Victory The conduct of this important business was intrusted to the eloquent Symmachus fourteen a wealthy and noble senator who united the sacred characters of pontiff and augur with the civil dignities of proconsul of Africa and praefect of the city The breast of Symmachus was animated by the warmest zeal for the cause of expiring Paganism and his religious antagonists lamented the abuse of his genius and the inefficacy of his moral virtues fifteen The orator whose petition is extant to the emperor Valentinian was conscious of the difficulty and danger of the office which he had assumed He cautiously avoids every topic which might appear to reflect on the religion of his sovereign humbly declares that prayers and entreaties are his only arms and artfully draws his arguments from the schools of rhetoric rather than from those of philosophy Symmachus endeavors to seduce the imagination of a young prince by displaying the attributes of the goddess of victory he insinuates that the confiscation of the revenues which were consecrated to the service of the gods was a measure unworthy of his liberal and disinterested character and he maintains that the Roman sacrifices would be deprived of their force and energy if they were no longer celebrated at the expense as well as in the name of the republic Even scepticism is made to supply an apology for superstition The great and incomprehensible secret of the universe eludes the inquiry of man Where reason cannot instruct custom may be permitted to guide and every nation seems to consult the dictates of prudence by a faithful attachment to those rites and opinions which have received the sanction of ages If those ages have been crowned with glory and prosperity if the devout people have frequently obtained the blessings which they have solicited at the altars of the gods it must appear still more advisable to persist in the same salutary practice and not to risk the unknown perils that may attend any rash innovations The test of antiquity and success was applied with singular advantage to the religion of Numa and Rome herself the celestial genius that presided over the fates of the city is introduced by the orator to plead her own cause before the tribunal of the emperors Most excellent princes says the venerable matron fathers of your country pity and respect my age which has hitherto flowed in an uninterrupted course of piety Since I do not repent permit me to continue in the practice of my ancient rites Since I am born free allow me to enjoy

He justly derides the absurd reverence for antiquity which could only tend to discourage the improvements of art and to replunge the human race into their original barbarism From thence gradually rising to a more lofty and theological tone he pronounces that Christianity alone is the doctrine of truth and salvation and that every mode of Polytheism conducts its deluded votaries through the paths of error to the abyss of eternal perdition seventeen Arguments like these when they were suggested by a favorite bishop had power to prevent the restoration of the altar of Victory but the same arguments fell with much more energy and effect from the mouth of a conqueror and the gods of antiquity were dragged in triumph at the chariot wheels of Theodosius eighteen In a full meeting of the senate the emperor proposed according to the forms of the republic the important question Whether the worship of Jupiter or that of Christ should be the religion of the Romans eighteen eleven The liberty of suffrages which he affected to allow was destroyed by the hopes and fears that his presence inspired and the arbitrary exile of Symmachus was a recent admonition that it might be dangerous to oppose the wishes of the monarch On a regular division of the senate Jupiter was condemned and degraded by the sense of a very large majority and it is rather surprising that any members should be found bold enough to declare by their speeches and votes that they were still attached to the interest of an abdicated deity nineteen The hasty conversion of the senate must be attributed either to supernatural or to sordid motives and many of these reluctant proselytes betrayed on every favorable occasion their secret disposition to throw aside the mask of odious dissimulation But they were gradually fixed in the new religion as the cause of the ancient became more hopeless they yielded to the authority of the emperor to the fashion of the times and to the entreaties of their wives and children twenty who were instigated and governed by the clergy of Rome and the monks of the East The edifying example of the Anician family was soon imitated by the rest of the nobility the Bassi the Paullini the Gracchi embraced the Christian religion and the luminaries of the world the venerable assembly of Catos such are the high flown expressions of Prudentius were impatient to strip themselves of their pontifical garment to cast the skin of the old serpent to assume the snowy robes of baptismal innocence and to humble the pride of the consular fasces before tombs of the martyrs twenty one The citizens who subsisted by their own industry and the populace who were supported by the public liberality filled the churches of the Lateran and Vatican with an incessant throng of devout proselytes The decrees of the senate which proscribed the worship of idols were ratified by the general consent of the Romans twenty two the splendor of the Capitol was defaced and the solitary temples were abandoned to ruin and contempt twenty three Rome submitted to the yoke of the Gospel and the vanquished provinces had not yet lost their reverence for the name and authority of Rome twenty three eleven Footnote seventeen See Ambrose tom ii Epist xvii xviii p eight hundred twenty five eight hundred thirty three The former of these epistles is a short caution the latter is a formal reply of the petition or libel of Symmachus The same ideas are more copiously expressed in the poetry if it may deserve that name of Prudentius who composed his two books against Symmachus A D four hundred four while that senator was still alive It is whimsical enough that Montesquieu Considerations c c xix tom iii p four hundred eighty seven should overlook the two professed antagonists of Symmachus and amuse himself with descanting on the more remote and indirect confutations of Orosius saint Augustin and Salvian Footnote eighteen See Prudentius in Symmach l i five hundred forty five c

eighty eight questions altogether the truth of this statement It is very remarkable that Zosimus and Prudentius concur in asserting the fact of the question being solemnly deliberated by the senate though with directly opposite results Zosimus declares that the majority of the assembly adhered to the ancient religion of Rome Gibbon has adopted the authority of Prudentius who as a Latin writer though a poet deserves more credit than the Greek historian Both concur in placing this scene after the second triumph of Theodosius but it has been almost demonstrated and Gibbon see the preceding note seems to have acknowledged this by Pagi and Tillemont that Theodosius did not visit Rome after the defeat of Eugenius M Beugnot urges with much force the improbability that the Christian emperor would submit such a question to the senate whose authority was nearly obsolete except on one occasion which was almost hailed as an epoch in the restoration of her ancient privileges The silence of Ambrose and of Jerom on an event so striking and redounding so much to the honor of Christianity is of considerable weight M Beugnot would ascribe the whole scene to the poetic imagination of Prudentius but I must observe that however Prudentius is sometimes elevated by the grandeur of his subject to vivid and eloquent language this flight of invention would be so much bolder and more vigorous than usual with this poet that I cannot but suppose there must have been some foundation for the story though it may have been exaggerated by the poet or misrepresented by the historian M Footnote nineteen Prudentius after proving that the sense of the senate is declared by a legal majority proceeds to say six hundred nine c Adspice quam pleno subsellia nostra Senatu Decernant infame

have been sufficient to convert even Jupiter himself an extraordinary proselyted tom i ad Laetam p fifty four Footnote twenty one Exultare Patres videas pulcherrima mundi Lumina Conciliumque senum

desolation of the Capitol and the other temples of Rome tom i p fifty four tom ii p ninety five Footnote twenty three eleven M Beugnot is more correct in his general estimate of the measures enforced by Theodosius for the abolition of Paganism He seized according to Zosimus the funds bestowed by the public for the expense of sacrifices The public sacrifices ceased not because they were positively prohibited but because the public treasury would no longer bear the expense The public and the private sacrifices in the provinces which were not under the same regulations with those of the capital continued to take place In Rome itself many pagan ceremonies which were without sacrifice remained in full force The gods therefore were invoked the temples were frequented the pontificates inscribed according to ancient usage among the family titles of honor and it cannot be asserted that idolatry was completely destroyed by Theodosius See Beugnot p four hundred ninety one M Chapter XXVIII Destruction Of Paganism Part II The filial piety of the emperors themselves engaged them to proceed with some caution and tenderness in the reformation of the eternal city Those absolute monarchs acted with less regard to the prejudices of the provincials The pious labor which had been suspended near twenty years since the death of Constantius twenty four was vigorously resumed and finally accomplished by the zeal of Theodosius Whilst that warlike prince yet struggled with the Goths not for the glory but for the safety of the republic he ventured to offend a considerable party of his subjects by some acts which might perhaps secure the protection of Heaven but which must seem rash and unseasonable in the eye of human prudence The success of his first experiments against the Pagans encouraged the pious emperor to reiterate and enforce his edicts of proscription the same laws which had been originally published in the provinces of the East were applied after the defeat of Maximus to the whole extent of the Western empire and every victory of the orthodox Theodosius contributed to the triumph of the Christian and Catholic faith twenty five He attacked superstition in her most vital part by prohibiting the use of sacrifices which he declared to be criminal as well as infamous and if the terms of his edicts more strictly condemned the impious curiosity which examined the entrails of the victim twenty six every subsequent explanation tended to involve in the same guilt the general practice of immolation which essentially constituted the religion of the Pagans As the temples had been erected for the purpose of sacrifice it was the duty of a benevolent prince to remove from his subjects the dangerous temptation of offending against the laws which he had enacted A special commission was granted to Cynegius the Praetorian praefect of the East and afterwards to the counts Jovius and Gaudentius two officers of distinguished rank in the West by which they were directed to shut the temples to seize or destroy the instruments of idolatry to abolish the privileges of the priests and to confiscate the consecrated property for the benefit of the emperor of the church or of the army twenty seven Here the desolation might have stopped and the naked edifices which were no longer employed in the service of idolatry might have been protected from the destructive rage of fanaticism Many of those temples were the most splendid and beautiful monuments of Grecian architecture and the emperor himself was interested not to deface the splendor of his own cities or to diminish the value of his own possessions Those stately edifices might be suffered to remain as so many lasting trophies of the victory of Christ In the decline of the arts they might be usefully converted into magazines manufactures or places of public assembly and perhaps when the walls of the temple had been sufficiently purified by holy rites the worship of the true Deity might be allowed to expiate the ancient guilt of idolatry But as long as they subsisted the Pagans fondly cherished the secret hope that an auspicious revolution a second Julian might again restore the altars of the gods and the earnestness with which they addressed their unavailing prayers to the throne twenty eight increased the zeal of the Christian reformers to extirpate without mercy the root of superstition The laws of the emperors exhibit some symptoms of a milder disposition twenty nine but their cold and languid efforts were insufficient to stem the torrent of enthusiasm and rapine which was conducted or rather impelled by the spiritual rulers of the church In Gaul the holy Martin bishop of Tours thirty marched at the head of his faithful monks to destroy the idols the temples and the consecrated trees of his extensive diocese and in the execution of this arduous task the prudent reader will judge whether Martin was supported by the aid of miraculous powers or of carnal weapons In Syria the divine and excellent Marcellus thirty one as he is styled by Theodoret a bishop animated with apostolic fervor resolved to level with the ground the stately temples within the diocese of Apamea His attack was resisted by the skill and solidity with which the temple of Jupiter had been constructed The building was seated on an eminence on each of the four sides the lofty roof was supported by fifteen massy columns sixteen feet in circumference and the large stone of which they were composed were firmly cemented with lead and iron The force of the strongest and sharpest tools had been tried without effect It was found necessary to undermine the foundations of the columns which fell down as soon as the temporary wooden props had been consumed with fire and the difficulties of the enterprise are described under the allegory of a black daemon who retarded though he could not defeat the operations of the Christian engineers Elated with victory Marcellus took the field in person against the powers of darkness a numerous troop of soldiers and gladiators marched under the episcopal banner and he successively attacked the villages and country temples of the diocese of Apamea Whenever any resistance or danger was apprehended the champion of the faith whose lameness would not allow him either to fight or fly placed himself at a convenient distance beyond the reach of darts But this prudence was the occasion of his death he was surprised and slain by a body of exasperated rustics and the synod of the province pronounced without hesitation that the holy Marcellus had sacrificed his life in the cause of God In the support of this cause the monks who rushed with tumultuous fury from the desert distinguished themselves by their zeal and diligence They deserved the enmity of the Pagans and some of them might deserve the reproaches of avarice and intemperance of avarice which they gratified with holy plunder and of intemperance which they indulged at the expense of the people who foolishly admired their tattered garments loud psalmody and artificial paleness thirty two A small number of temples was protected by the fears the venality the taste or the prudence of the civil and ecclesiastical governors The temple of the Celestial Venus at Carthage whose sacred precincts formed a circumference of two miles was judiciously converted into a Christian church thirty three and a similar consecration has preserved inviolate the majestic dome of the Pantheon at Rome thirty four But in almost every province of the Roman world an army of fanatics without authority and without discipline invaded the peaceful inhabitants and the ruin of the fairest structures of antiquity still displays the ravages of those Barbarians who alone had time and inclination to execute such laborious destruction Footnote twenty four Libanius Orat pro Templis p ten Genev sixteen thirty four published by James Godefroy and now extremely scarce accuses Valentinian and Valens

hundred years after the reign of Theodosius In this wide and various prospect of devastation the spectator may distinguish the ruins of the temple of Serapis at Alexandria thirty five Serapis does not appear to have been one of the native gods or monsters who sprung from the fruitful soil of superstitious Egypt thirty six The first of the Ptolemies had been commanded by a dream to import the mysterious stranger from the coast of Pontus where he had been long adored by the inhabitants of Sinope but his attributes and his reign were so imperfectly understood that it became a subject of dispute whether he represented the bright orb of day or the gloomy monarch of the subterraneous regions thirty seven The Egyptians who were obstinately devoted to the religion of their fathers refused to admit this foreign deity within the walls of their cities thirty eight But the obsequious priests who were seduced by the liberality of the Ptolemies submitted without resistance to the power of the god of Pontus an honorable and domestic genealogy was provided and this fortunate usurper was introduced into the throne and bed of Osiris thirty nine the husband of Isis and the celestial monarch of Egypt Alexandria which claimed his peculiar protection gloried in the name of the city of Serapis His temple forty which rivalled the pride and magnificence of the Capitol was erected on the spacious summit of an artificial mount raised one hundred steps above the level of the adjacent parts of the city and the interior cavity was strongly supported by arches and distributed into vaults and subterraneous apartments The consecrated buildings were surrounded by a quadrangular portico the stately halls and exquisite statues displayed the triumph of the arts and the treasures of ancient learning were preserved in the famous Alexandrian library which had arisen with new splendor from its ashes forty one After the edicts of Theodosius had severely prohibited the sacrifices of the Pagans they were still tolerated in the city and temple of Serapis and this singular indulgence was imprudently ascribed to the superstitious terrors of the Christians themselves as if they had feared

excited by the honors of Serapis and the insults which he offered to an ancient temple of Bacchus four thousand four hundred eleven convinced the Pagans that he meditated a more important and dangerous enterprise In the tumultuous capital of Egypt the slightest provocation was sufficient to inflame a civil war The votaries of Serapis whose strength and numbers were much inferior to those of their antagonists rose in arms at the instigation of the philosopher Olympius forty five who exhorted them to die in the defence of the altars of the gods These Pagan fanatics fortified themselves in the temple or rather fortress of Serapis repelled the besiegers by daring sallies and a resolute defence and by the inhuman cruelties which they exercised on their Christian prisoners obtained the last consolation of despair The efforts of the prudent magistrate were usefully exerted for the establishment of a truce till the answer of Theodosius should determine the fate of Serapis The two parties assembled without arms in the principal square and the Imperial rescript was publicly read But when a sentence of destruction against the idols of Alexandria was pronounced the Christians set up a shout of joy and exultation whilst the unfortunate Pagans whose fury had given way to consternation retired with hasty and silent steps and eluded by their flight or obscurity the resentment of their enemies Theophilus proceeded to demolish the temple of Serapis without any other difficulties than those which he found in the weight and solidity of the materials but these obstacles proved so insuperable that he was obliged to leave the foundations and to content himself with reducing the edifice itself to a heap of rubbish a part of which was soon afterwards cleared away to make room for a church erected in honor of the Christian martyrs The valuable library of Alexandria was pillaged or destroyed and near twenty years afterwards the appearance of the empty shelves excited the regret and indignation of every spectator whose mind was not totally darkened by religious prejudice forty six The compositions of ancient genius so many of which have irretrievably perished might surely have been excepted from the wreck of idolatry for the amusement and instruction of succeeding ages and either the zeal or the avarice of the archbishop forty seven might have been satiated with the rich spoils which were the reward of his victory While the images and vases of gold and silver were carefully melted and those of a less valuable metal were contemptuously broken and cast into the streets Theophilus labored to expose the frauds and vices of the ministers of the idols their dexterity in the management of the loadstone their secret methods of introducing a human actor into a hollow statue four thousand seven hundred eleven and their scandalous abuse of the confidence of devout husbands and unsuspecting females forty eight Charges like these may seem to deserve some degree of credit as they are not repugnant to the crafty and interested spirit of superstition But the same spirit is equally prone to the base practice of insulting and calumniating a fallen enemy and our belief is naturally checked by the reflection that it is much less difficult to invent a fictitious story than to support a practical fraud The colossal statue of Serapis forty nine was involved in the ruin of his temple and religion A great number of plates of different metals artificially joined together composed the majestic figure of the deity who touched on either side the walls of the sanctuary The aspect of Serapis his sitting posture and the sceptre which he bore in his left hand were extremely similar to the ordinary representations of Jupiter He was distinguished from Jupiter by the basket or bushel which was placed on his head and by the emblematic monster which he held in his right hand the head and body of a serpent branching into three tails which were again terminated by the triple heads of a dog a lion and a wolf It was confidently affirmed that if any impious hand should dare to violate the majesty of the god the heavens and the earth would instantly return to their original chaos An intrepid soldier animated by zeal and armed with a weighty battle axe ascended the ladder and even the Christian multitude expected with some anxiety the event of the combat fifty He aimed a vigorous stroke against the cheek of Serapis the cheek fell to the ground the thunder was still silent and both the heavens and the earth continued to preserve their accustomed order and tranquillity The victorious soldier repeated his blows the huge idol was overthrown and broken in pieces and the limbs of Serapis were ignominiously dragged through the streets of Alexandria His mangled carcass was burnt in the Amphitheatre amidst the shouts of the populace and many persons attributed their conversion to this discovery of the impotence of their tutelar deity The popular modes of religion that propose any visible and material objects of worship have the advantage of adapting and familiarizing themselves to the senses of mankind but this advantage is counterbalanced by the various and inevitable accidents to which the faith of the idolater is exposed It is scarcely possible that in every disposition of mind he should preserve his implicit reverence for the idols or the relics which the naked eye and the profane hand are unable to distinguish from the most common productions of art or nature and if in the hour of danger their secret and miraculous virtue does not operate for their own preservation he scorns the vain apologies of his priests and justly derides the object and the folly of his superstitious attachment fifty one After the fall of Serapis some hopes were still entertained by the Pagans that the Nile would refuse his annual supply to the impious masters of Egypt and the extraordinary delay of the inundation seemed to announce the displeasure of the river god But this delay was soon compensated by the rapid swell of the waters They suddenly rose to such an unusual height as to comfort the discontented party with the pleasing expectation of a deluge till the peaceful river again subsided to the well known and fertilizing level of sixteen cubits or about thirty English feet fifty two Footnote forty three We may choose between the date of

sacrifices had been severely prohibited The inhabitants of the country whose conduct was less opposed to the eye of malicious curiosity disguised their religious under the appearance of convivial meetings On the days of solemn festivals they assembled in great numbers under the spreading shade of some consecrated trees sheep and oxen were slaughtered and roasted and this rural entertainment was sanctified by the use of incense and by the hymns which were sung in honor of the gods But it was alleged that as no part of the animal was made a burnt offering as no altar was provided to receive the blood and as the previous oblation of salt cakes and the concluding ceremony of libations were carefully omitted these festal meetings did not involve the guests in the guilt or penalty of an illegal sacrifice fifty three Whatever might be the truth of the facts or the merit of the distinction fifty four these vain pretences were swept away by the last edict of Theodosius which inflicted a deadly wound on the superstition of the Pagans fifty five five thousand five hundred eleven This prohibitory law is expressed in the most absolute and comprehensive terms It is our will and pleasure says the emperor that none of our subjects whether magistrates or private citizens however exalted or however humble may be their rank and condition shall presume in any city or in any place to worship an inanimate idol by the sacrifice of a guiltless victim The act of sacrificing and the practice of divination by the entrails of the victim are declared without any regard to the object of the inquiry a crime of high treason against the state which can be expiated only by the death of the guilty The rites of Pagan superstition which might seem less bloody and atrocious are abolished as highly injurious to the truth and honor of religion luminaries garlands frankincense and libations of wine are specially enumerated and condemned and the harmless claims of the domestic genius of the household gods are included in this rigorous proscription The use of any of these profane and illegal ceremonies subjects the offender to the forfeiture of the house or estate where they have been performed and if he has artfully chosen the property of another for the scene of his impiety he is compelled to discharge without delay a heavy fine of twenty five pounds of gold or more than one thousand pounds sterling A fine not less considerable is imposed on the connivance of the secret enemies of religion who shall neglect the duty of their respective stations either to reveal or to punish the guilt of idolatry Such was the persecuting spirit of the laws of Theodosius which were repeatedly enforced by his sons and grandsons with the loud and unanimous applause of the

heathen landowners and Zeno of Verona still later reproves the apathy of the Christian proprietors in conniving at this abuse Compare Neander ii p one hundred sixty nine M Beugnot shows that this was the case throughout the north and centre of Italy and in Sicily But neither of these authors has adverted to one fact which must have tended greatly to retard the progress of Christianity in these quarters It was still chiefly a slave population which cultivated the soil and however in the towns the better class of Christians might be eager to communicate the blessed liberty of the gospel to this class of mankind however their condition could not but be silently ameliorated by the humanizing influence of Christianity yet on the whole no doubt the servile class would be the least fitted to receive the gospel and its general propagation among them would be embarrassed by many peculiar difficulties The rural population was probably not entirely converted before the general establishment of the monastic institutions Compare Quarterly Review of Beugnot vol lvii p fifty two M Footnote fifty six Such a charge should not be lightly made but it may surely be justified by the authority of

from Chrysostom against all violent means of propagating Christianity M Chapter XXVIII Destruction Of Paganism Part III In the cruel reigns of Decius and Dioclesian Christianity had been proscribed as a revolt from the ancient and hereditary religion of the empire and the unjust suspicions which were entertained of a dark and dangerous faction were in some measure countenanced by the inseparable union and rapid conquests of the Catholic church But the same excuses of fear and ignorance cannot be applied to the Christian emperors who violated the precepts of humanity and of the Gospel The experience of ages had betrayed the weakness as well as folly of Paganism the light of reason and of faith had already exposed to the greatest part of mankind the vanity of idols and the declining sect which still adhered to their worship might have been permitted to enjoy in peace and obscurity the religious costumes of their ancestors Had the Pagans been animated by the undaunted zeal which possessed the minds of the primitive believers the triumph of the Church must have been stained with blood and the martyrs of Jupiter and Apollo might have embraced the glorious opportunity of devoting their lives and fortunes at the foot of their altars But such obstinate zeal was not congenial to the loose and careless temper of Polytheism The violent and repeated strokes of the orthodox princes were broken by the soft and yielding substance against which they were directed and the ready obedience of the Pagans protected them from the pains and penalties of the Theodosian Code fifty seven Instead of asserting that the authority of the gods was superior to that of the emperor they desisted with a plaintive murmur from the use of those sacred rites which their sovereign had condemned If they were sometimes tempted by a sally of passion or by the hopes of concealment to indulge their favorite superstition their humble repentance disarmed the severity of the Christian magistrate and they seldom refused to atone for their rashness by submitting with some secret reluctance to the yoke of the Gospel The churches were filled with the increasing multitude of these unworthy proselytes who had conformed from temporal motives to the reigning religion and whilst they devoutly imitated the postures and recited the prayers of the faithful they satisfied their conscience by the silent and sincere invocation of the gods of antiquity fifty eight If the Pagans wanted patience to suffer they wanted spirit to resist and the scattered myriads who deplored the ruin of the temples yielded without a contest to the fortune of their adversaries The disorderly opposition fifty nine of the peasants of Syria and the populace of Alexandria to the rage of private fanaticism was silenced by the name and authority of the emperor The Pagans of the West without contributing to the elevation of Eugenius disgraced by their partial attachment the cause and character of the usurper The clergy vehemently exclaimed that he aggravated the crime of rebellion by the guilt of apostasy that by his permission the altar of victory was again restored and that the idolatrous symbols of Jupiter and Hercules were displayed in the field against the invincible standard of the cross But the vain hopes of the Pagans were soon annihilated by the defeat of Eugenius and they were left exposed to the resentment of the conqueror who labored to deserve the favor of Heaven by the extirpation of idolatry sixty Footnote fifty seven Orosius l vii c twenty eight p five hundred thirty

or of death and the eloquent Libanius has praised the moderation of a prince who never enacted by any positive law that all his subjects should immediately embrace and practise the religion of their sovereign sixty one The profession of Christianity was not made an essential qualification for the enjoyment of the civil rights of society nor were any peculiar hardships imposed on the sectaries who credulously received the fables of Ovid and obstinately rejected the miracles of the Gospel The palace the schools the army and the senate were filled with declared and devout Pagans they obtained without distinction the civil and military honors of the empire six thousand one hundred eleven Theodosius distinguished his liberal regard for virtue and genius by the consular dignity which he bestowed on Symmachus sixty two and by the personal friendship which he expressed to Libanius sixty three and the two eloquent apologists of Paganism were never required either to change or to dissemble their religious opinions The Pagans were indulged in the most licentious freedom of speech and writing the historical and philosophic remains of Eunapius Zosimus sixty four and the fanatic teachers of the school of Plato betray the most furious animosity and contain the sharpest invectives against the sentiments and conduct of their victorious adversaries If these audacious libels were publicly known we must applaud the good sense of the Christian princes who viewed with a smile of contempt the last struggles of superstition and despair sixty five But the Imperial laws which prohibited the sacrifices and ceremonies of Paganism were rigidly executed and every hour contributed to destroy the influence of a religion which was supported by custom rather than by argument The devotion or the poet or the philosopher may be secretly nourished by prayer meditation and study but the exercise of public worship appears to be the only solid foundation of the religious sentiments of the people which derive their force from imitation and habit The interruption of that public exercise may consummate in the period of a few years the important work of a national revolution The memory of theological opinions cannot long be preserved without the artificial helps of priests of temples and of books sixty six The ignorant vulgar whose minds are still agitated by the blind hopes and terrors of superstition will be soon persuaded by their superiors to direct their vows to the reigning deities of the age and will insensibly imbibe an ardent zeal for the support and propagation of the new doctrine which spiritual hunger at first compelled them to accept The generation that arose in the world after the promulgation of the Imperial laws was attracted within the pale of the Catholic church and so rapid yet so gentle was the fall of Paganism that only twenty eight years after the death of Theodosius the faint and minute vestiges were no longer visible to the eye of the legislator sixty seven Footnote sixty one Libanius suggests the form of a persecuting edict which Theodosius might enact pro Templis p thirty two a rash joke and a dangerous experiment Some princes would have taken his advice Footnote six thousand one hundred eleven The most remarkable instance of this at a much later period occurs in the person of Merobaudes a general and a poet who flourished

industry and sagacity of Niebuhr In one passage Merobaudes in the genuine heathen spirit attributes the ruin of the empire to the abolition of Paganism and almost renews the old accusation of Atheism against Christianity He impersonates some deity probably Discord who summons Bellona to take arms for the destruction of Rome and in a strain of fierce irony recommends to her other fatal measures to

night They relate in solemn and pathetic strains that the temples were converted into sepulchres and that the holy places which had been adorned by the statues of the gods were basely polluted by the relics of Christian martyrs The monks a race of filthy animals to whom Eunapius is tempted to refuse the name of men are the authors of the new worship which in the place of those deities who are conceived by the understanding has substituted the meanest and most contemptible slaves The heads salted and pickled of those infamous malefactors who for the multitude of their crimes have suffered a just and ignominious death their bodies still marked by the impression of the lash and the scars of those tortures which were inflicted by the sentence of the magistrate such continues Eunapius are the gods which the earth produces in our days such are the martyrs the supreme arbitrators of our prayers and petitions to the Deity whose tombs are now consecrated as the objects of the veneration of the people sixty eight Without approving the malice it is natural enough to share the surprise of the sophist the spectator of a revolution which raised those obscure victims of the laws of Rome to the rank of celestial and invisible protectors of the Roman empire The grateful respect of the Christians for the martyrs of the faith was exalted by time and victory into religious adoration and the most illustrious of the saints and prophets were deservedly associated to the honors of the martyrs One hundred and fifty years after the glorious deaths of saint Peter and saint Paul the Vatican and the Ostian road were distinguished by the tombs or rather by the trophies of those spiritual heroes sixty nine In the age which followed the conversion of Constantine the emperors the consuls and the generals of armies devoutly visited the sepulchres of a tentmaker and a fisherman seventy and their venerable bones were deposited under the altars of Christ on which the bishops of the royal city continually offered the unbloody sacrifice seventy one The new capital of the Eastern world unable to produce any ancient and domestic trophies was enriched by the spoils of dependent provinces The bodies of saint Andrew saint Luke and saint Timothy had reposed near three hundred years in the obscure graves from whence they were transported in solemn pomp to the church of the apostles which the magnificence of Constantine had founded on the banks of the Thracian Bosphorus seventy two About fifty years afterwards the same banks were honored by the presence of Samuel the judge and prophet of the people of Israel His ashes deposited in a golden vase and covered with a silken veil were delivered by the bishops into each other s hands The relics of Samuel were received by the people with the same joy and reverence which they would have shown to the living prophet the highways from Palestine to the gates of Constantinople were filled with an uninterrupted procession and the emperor Arcadius himself at the head of the most illustrious members of the clergy and senate advanced to meet his extraordinary guest who had always deserved and claimed the homage of kings seventy three The example of Rome and Constantinople confirmed the faith and discipline of the Catholic world The honors of the saints and martyrs after a feeble and ineffectual murmur of profane reason seventy four were universally established and in the age of Ambrose and Jerom something was still deemed wanting to the sanctity of a Christian church till it had been consecrated by some portion of holy relics

Jerom and Vigilantius and saint Augustin s account of the miracles of saint Stephen may speedily gain some idea of the spirit of the Fathers In the long period of twelve hundred years which elapsed between the reign of Constantine and the reformation of Luther the worship of saints and relics corrupted the pure and perfect simplicity of the Christian model and some symptoms of degeneracy may be observed even in the first generations which adopted and cherished this pernicious innovation I The satisfactory experience that the relics of saints were more valuable than gold or precious stones seventy five stimulated the clergy to multiply the treasures of the church Without much regard for truth or probability they invented names for skeletons and actions for names The fame of the apostles and of the holy men who had imitated their virtues was darkened by religious fiction To the invincible band of genuine and primitive martyrs they added myriads of imaginary heroes who had never existed except in the fancy of crafty or credulous legendaries and there is reason to suspect that Tours might not be the only diocese in which the bones of a malefactor were adored instead of those of a saint seventy six A superstitious practice which tended to increase the temptations of fraud and credulity insensibly extinguished the light of history and of reason in the Christian world Footnote seventy five M de Beausobre Hist du Manicheisme tom ii p six hundred forty eight has applied a worldly sense to the pious observation of the clergy of Smyrna who carefully preserved the relics of saint Polycarp the martyr Footnote seventy six Martin of Tours see his Life c eight by Sulpicius Severus extorted this confession from the mouth of the dead man The error is allowed to be natural the discovery is supposed to be miraculous Which of the two was likely to happen most frequently II But the progress of superstition would have been much less rapid and victorious if the faith of the people had not been assisted by the seasonable aid of visions and miracles to ascertain the authenticity and virtue of the most suspicious relics In the reign of the younger Theodosius Lucian seventy seven a presbyter of Jerusalem and the ecclesiastical minister of the village of Caphargamala about twenty miles from the city related a very singular dream which to remove his doubts had been repeated on three successive Saturdays A venerable figure stood before him in the silence of the night with a long beard a white robe and a gold rod announced himself by the name of Gamaliel and revealed to the astonished presbyter that his own corpse with the bodies of his son Abibas his friend Nicodemus and the illustrious Stephen the first martyr of the Christian faith were secretly buried in the adjacent field He added with some impatience that it was time to release himself and his companions from their obscure prison that their appearance would be salutary to a distressed world and that they had made choice of Lucian to inform the bishop of Jerusalem of their situation and their wishes The doubts and difficulties which still retarded this important discovery were successively removed by new visions and the ground was opened by the bishop in the presence of an innumerable multitude The coffins of Gamaliel of his son and of his friend were found in regular order but when the fourth coffin which contained the remains of Stephen was shown to the light the earth trembled and an odor such as that of paradise was smelt which instantly cured the various diseases of seventy three of the assistants The companions of Stephen were left in their peaceful residence of Caphargamala but the relics of the first martyr were transported in solemn procession to a church constructed in their honor on Mount Sion and the minute particles of those relics a drop of blood seventy eight or the scrapings of a bone were acknowledged in almost every province of the Roman world to possess a divine and miraculous virtue The grave and learned Augustin seventy nine whose understanding scarcely admits the excuse of credulity has attested the innumerable prodigies which were performed in Africa by the relics of saint Stephen and this marvellous narrative is inserted in the elaborate work of the City of God which the bishop of Hippo designed as a solid and immortal proof of the truth of Christianity Augustin solemnly declares that he has selected those miracles only which were publicly certified by the persons who were either the objects or the spectators of the power of the martyr Many prodigies were omitted or forgotten and Hippo had been less favorably treated than the other cities of the province And yet the bishop enumerates above seventy miracles of which three were resurrections from the dead in the space of two years and within the limits of his own diocese eighty If we enlarge our view to all the dioceses and all the saints of the Christian world it will not be easy to calculate the fables and the errors which issued from this inexhaustible source But we may surely be allowed to observe that a miracle in that age of superstition and credulity lost its name and its merit since it could scarcely be considered as a deviation from the ordinary and established laws of nature Footnote seventy seven Lucian composed in Greek his original narrative which has been translated by Avitus and published by Baronius Annal Eccles A D four hundred fifteen No seven sixteen The Benedictine editors of saint Augustin have given at the end of the work de Civitate

tom vii p two hundred forty nine has preserved a Gallic or a Spanish proverb Whoever pretends to have read all the miracles of saint Stephen he lies III The innumerable miracles of which the tombs of the martyrs were the perpetual theatre revealed to the pious believer the actual state and constitution of the invisible world and his religious speculations appeared to be founded on the firm basis of fact and experience Whatever might be the condition of vulgar souls in the long interval between the dissolution and the resurrection of their bodies it was evident that the superior spirits of the saints and martyrs did not consume that portion of their existence in silent and inglorious sleep eighty one It was evident without presuming to determine the place of their habitation or the nature of their felicity that they enjoyed the lively and active consciousness of their happiness their virtue and their powers and that they had already secured the possession of their eternal reward The enlargement of their intellectual faculties surpassed the measure of the human imagination since it was proved by experience that they were capable of hearing and understanding the various petitions of their numerous votaries who in the same moment of time but in the most distant parts of the world invoked the name and assistance of Stephen or of Martin eighty two The confidence of their petitioners was founded on the persuasion that the saints who reigned with Christ cast an eye of pity upon earth that they were warmly interested in the prosperity of the Catholic Church and that the individuals who imitated the example of their faith and piety were the peculiar and favorite objects of their most tender regard Sometimes indeed their friendship might be influenced by considerations of a less exalted kind they viewed with partial affection the places which had been consecrated by their birth their residence their death their burial or the possession of their relics The meaner passions of pride avarice and revenge may be deemed unworthy of a celestial breast yet the saints themselves condescended to testify their grateful approbation of the liberality of their votaries and the sharpest bolts of punishment were hurled against those impious wretches who violated their magnificent shrines or disbelieved their supernatural power eighty three Atrocious indeed must have been the guilt and strange would have been the scepticism of those men if they had obstinately resisted the proofs of a divine agency which the elements the whole range of the animal creation and even the subtle and invisible operations of the human mind were compelled to obey eighty four The immediate and almost instantaneous effects that were supposed to follow the prayer or the offence satisfied the Christians of the ample measure of favor and authority which the saints enjoyed in the presence of the Supreme God and it seemed almost superfluous to inquire whether they were continually obliged to intercede before the throne of grace or whether they might not be permitted to exercise according to the dictates of their benevolence and justice the delegated powers of their subordinate ministry The imagination which had been raised by a painful effort to the contemplation and worship of the Universal Cause eagerly embraced such inferior objects of adoration as were more proportioned to its gross conceptions and imperfect faculties The sublime and simple theology of the primitive Christians was gradually corrupted and the Monarchy of heaven already clouded by metaphysical subtleties was degraded by the introduction of a popular mythology which tended to restore the reign of polytheism eighty five Footnote eighty one Burnet de Statu Mortuorum p fifty six eighty four collects the opinions of the Fathers as far as they assert the sleep or repose of human souls till the day of judgment He afterwards exposes p ninety one c the inconveniences which must arise if they possessed a

thirty four observes like a philosopher the natural flux and reflux of polytheism and theism IV As the objects of religion were gradually reduced to the standard of the imagination the rites and ceremonies were introduced that seemed most powerfully to affect the senses of the vulgar If in the beginning of the fifth century eighty six Tertullian or Lactantius eighty seven had been suddenly raised from the dead to assist at the festival of some popular saint or martyr eighty eight they would have gazed with astonishment and indignation on the profane spectacle which had succeeded to the pure and spiritual worship of a Christian congregation As soon as the doors of the church were thrown open they must have been offended by the smoke of incense the perfume of flowers and the glare of lamps and tapers which diffused at noonday a gaudy superfluous and in their opinion a sacrilegious light If they approached the balustrade of the altar they made their way through the prostrate crowd consisting for the most part of strangers and pilgrims who resorted to the city on the vigil of the feast and who already felt the strong intoxication of fanaticism and perhaps of wine Their devout kisses were imprinted on the walls and pavement of the sacred edifice and their fervent prayers were directed whatever might be the language of their church to the bones the blood or the ashes of the saint which were usually concealed by a linen or silken veil from the eyes of the vulgar The Christians frequented the tombs of the martyrs in the hope of obtaining from their powerful intercession every sort of spiritual but more especially of temporal blessings They implored the preservation of their health or the cure of their infirmities the fruitfulness of their barren wives or the safety and happiness of their children Whenever they undertook any distant or dangerous journey they requested that the holy martyrs would be their guides and protectors on the road and if they returned without having experienced any misfortune they again hastened to the tombs of the martyrs to celebrate with grateful thanksgivings their obligations to the memory and relics of those heavenly patrons The walls were hung round with symbols of the favors which they had received eyes and hands and feet of gold and silver and edifying pictures which could not long escape the abuse of indiscreet or idolatrous devotion represented the image the attributes and the miracles of the tutelar saint The same uniform original spirit of superstition might suggest in the most distant ages and countries the same methods of deceiving the credulity and of affecting the senses of mankind eighty nine but it must ingenuously be confessed that the ministers of the Catholic church imitated the profane model which they were impatient to destroy The most respectable bishops had persuaded themselves that the ignorant rustics would more cheerfully renounce the superstitions of Paganism if they found some resemblance some compensation in the bosom of Christianity The religion of Constantine achieved in less than a century the final conquest of the Roman empire but the victors themselves were insensibly

XXIX Division Of Roman Empire Between Sons Of Theodosius Part I Final Division Of The Roman Empire Between The Sons Of Theodosius Reign Of Arcadius And Honorius Administration Of Rufinus And Stilicho Revolt And Defeat Of Gildo In Africa The genius of Rome expired with Theodosius the last of the successors of Augustus and Constantine who appeared in the field at the head of their armies and whose authority was universally acknowledged throughout the whole extent of the empire The memory of his virtues still continued however to protect the feeble and inexperienced youth of his two sons After the death of their father Arcadius and Honorius were saluted by the unanimous consent of mankind as the lawful emperors of the East and of the West and the oath of fidelity was eagerly taken by every order of the state the senates of old and new Rome the clergy the magistrates the soldiers and the people Arcadius who was then about eighteen years of age was born in Spain in the humble habitation of a private family But he received a princely education in the palace of Constantinople and his inglorious life was spent in that peaceful and splendid seat of royalty from whence he appeared to reign over the provinces of Thrace Asia Minor Syria and Egypt from the Lower Danube to the confines of Persia and Aethiopia His younger brother Honorius assumed in the eleventh year of his age the nominal government of Italy Africa Gaul Spain and Britain and the troops which guarded the frontiers of his kingdom were opposed on one side to the Caledonians and on the other to the Moors The great and martial praefecture of Illyricum was divided between the two princes the defence and possession of the provinces of Noricum Pannonia and Dalmatia still belonged to the Western empire but the two large dioceses of Dacia and Macedonia which Gratian had intrusted to the valor of Theodosius were forever united to the empire of the East The boundary in Europe was not very different from the line which now separates the Germans and the Turks and the respective advantages of territory riches populousness and military strength were fairly balanced and compensated in this final and permanent division of the Roman empire The hereditary sceptre of the sons of Theodosius appeared to be the gift of nature and of their father the generals and ministers had been accustomed to adore the majesty of the royal infants and the army and people were not admonished of their rights and of their power by the dangerous example of a recent election The gradual discovery of the weakness of Arcadius and Honorius and the repeated calamities of their reign were not sufficient to obliterate the deep and early impressions of loyalty The subjects of Rome who still reverenced the persons or rather the names of their sovereigns beheld with equal abhorrence the rebels who opposed and the ministers who abused the authority of the throne Theodosius had tarnished the glory of his reign by the elevation of Rufinus an odious favorite who in an age of civil and religious faction has deserved from every party the imputation of every crime The strong impulse of ambition and avarice one had urged Rufinus to abandon his native country an obscure corner of Gaul two to advance his fortune in the capital of the East the talent of bold and ready elocution three qualified him to succeed in the lucrative profession of the law and his success in that profession was a regular step to the most honorable and important employments of the state He was raised by just degrees to the station of master of the offices In the exercise of his various functions so essentially connected with the whole system of civil government he acquired the confidence of a monarch who soon discovered his diligence and capacity in business and who long remained ignorant of the pride the malice and the covetousness of his disposition These vices were concealed beneath the mask of profound dissimulation four his passions were subservient only to the passions of his master yet in the horrid massacre of Thessalonica the cruel Rufinus inflamed the fury without imitating the repentance of Theodosius The minister who viewed with proud indifference the rest of mankind never forgave the appearance of an injury and his personal enemies had forfeited in his opinion the merit of all public services Promotus the master general of the infantry had saved the empire from the invasion of the Ostrogoths but he indignantly supported the preeminence of a rival whose character and profession he despised and in the midst of a public council the impatient soldier was provoked to chastise with a blow the indecent pride of the favorite This act of violence was represented to the emperor as an insult which it was incumbent on his dignity to resent The disgrace and exile of Promotus were signified by a peremptory order to repair without delay to a military station on the banks of the Danube and the death of that general though he was slain in a skirmish with the Barbarians was imputed to the perfidious arts of Rufinus five The sacrifice of a hero gratified his revenge the honors of the consulship elated his vanity but his power was still imperfect and precarious as long as the important posts of praefect of the East and of praefect of Constantinople were filled by Tatian six and his son Proculus whose united authority balanced for some time the ambition and favor of the master of the offices The two praefects were accused of rapine and corruption in the administration of the laws and finances For the trial of these illustrious offenders the emperor constituted a special commission several judges were named to share the guilt and reproach of injustice but the right of pronouncing sentence was reserved to the president alone and that president was Rufinus himself The father stripped of the praefecture of the East was thrown into a dungeon but the son conscious that few ministers can be found innocent where an enemy is their judge had secretly escaped and Rufinus must have been satisfied with the least obnoxious victim if despotism had not condescended to employ the basest and most ungenerous artifice The prosecution was conducted with an appearance of equity and moderation which flattered Tatian with the hope of a favorable event his confidence was fortified by the solemn assurances and perfidious oaths of the president who presumed to interpose the sacred name of Theodosius himself and the unhappy father was at last persuaded to recall by a private letter the fugitive Proculus He was instantly seized examined condemned and beheaded in one of the suburbs of Constantinople with a precipitation which disappointed the clemency of the emperor Without respecting the misfortunes of a consular senator the cruel judges of Tatian compelled him to behold the execution of his son the fatal cord was fastened round his own neck but in the moment when he expected and perhaps desired the relief of a speedy death he was permitted to consume the miserable remnant of his old age in poverty and exile seven The punishment of the two praefects might perhaps be excused by the exceptionable parts of their own conduct the enmity of Rufinus might be palliated by the jealous and unsociable nature of ambition But he indulged a spirit of revenge equally repugnant to prudence and to justice when he degraded their native country of Lycia from the rank of Roman provinces stigmatized a guiltless people with a mark of ignominy and declared that the countrymen of Tatian and Proculus should forever remain incapable of holding any employment of honor or advantage under the Imperial government eight The new praefect of the East for Rufinus instantly succeeded to the vacant honors of his adversary was not diverted however by the most criminal pursuits from the performance of the religious duties which in that age were considered as the most essential to salvation In the suburb of Chalcedon surnamed the Oak he had built a magnificent villa to which he devoutly added a stately church consecrated to the apostles saint Peter and saint Paul and continually sanctified by the prayers and penance of a regular society of monks A numerous and almost general synod of the bishops of the Eastern empire was summoned to celebrate at the same time the dedication of the church and the baptism of the founder This double ceremony was performed with extraordinary pomp and when Rufinus was purified in the holy font from all the sins that he had hitherto committed a venerable

performed a conspicuous part The character of Theodosius imposed on his minister the task of hypocrisy which disguised and sometimes restrained the abuse of power and Rufinus was apprehensive of disturbing the indolent slumber of a prince still capable of exerting the abilities and the virtue which had raised him to the throne ten But the absence and soon afterwards the death of the emperor confirmed the absolute authority of Rufinus over the person and dominions of Arcadius a feeble youth whom the imperious praefect considered as his pupil rather than his sovereign Regardless of the public opinion he indulged his passions without remorse and without resistance and his malignant and rapacious spirit rejected every passion that might have contributed to his own glory or the happiness of the people His avarice eleven which seems to have prevailed in his corrupt mind over every other sentiment attracted the wealth of the East by the various arts of partial and general extortion oppressive taxes scandalous bribery immoderate fines unjust confiscations forced or fictitious testaments by which the tyrant despoiled of their lawful inheritance the children of strangers or enemies and the public sale of justice as well as of favor which he instituted in the palace of Constantinople The ambitious candidate eagerly solicited at the expense of the fairest part of his patrimony the honors and emoluments of some provincial government the lives and fortunes of the unhappy people were abandoned to the most liberal purchaser and the public discontent was sometimes appeased by the sacrifice of an unpopular criminal whose punishment was profitable only to the praefect of the East his accomplice and his judge If avarice were not the blindest of the human passions the motives of Rufinus might excite our curiosity and we might be tempted to inquire with what view he violated every principle of humanity and justice to accumulate those immense treasures which he could not spend without folly nor possess without danger Perhaps he vainly imagined that he labored for the interest of an only daughter on whom he intended to bestow his royal pupil and the august rank of Empress of the East Perhaps he deceived himself by the opinion that his avarice was the instrument of his ambition He aspired to place his fortune on a secure and independent basis which should no longer depend on the caprice of the young emperor yet he neglected to conciliate the hearts of the soldiers and people by the liberal distribution of those riches which he had acquired with so much toil and with so much guilt The extreme parsimony of Rufinus left him only the reproach and envy of ill gotten wealth his dependants served him without attachment the universal hatred of mankind was repressed only by the influence of servile fear The fate of Lucian proclaimed to the East that the praefect whose industry was much abated in the despatch of ordinary business was active and indefatigable in the pursuit of revenge Lucian the son of the praefect Florentius the oppressor of Gaul and the enemy of Julian had employed a considerable part of his inheritance the fruit of rapine and corruption to purchase the friendship of Rufinus and the high office of Count of the East But the new magistrate imprudently departed from the maxims of the court and of the times disgraced his benefactor by the contrast of a virtuous and temperate administration and presumed to refuse an act of injustice which might have tended to the profit of the emperor s uncle Arcadius was easily persuaded to resent the supposed insult and the praefect of the East resolved to execute in person the cruel vengeance which he meditated against this ungrateful delegate of his power He performed with incessant speed the journey of seven or eight hundred miles from Constantinople to Antioch entered the capital of Syria at the dead of night and spread universal consternation among a people ignorant of his design but not ignorant of his character The Count of the fifteen provinces of the East was dragged like the vilest malefactor before the arbitrary tribunal of Rufinus Notwithstanding the clearest evidence of his integrity which was not impeached even by the voice of an accuser Lucian was condemned almost with out a trial to suffer a cruel and ignominious punishment The ministers of the tyrant by the orders and in the presence of their master beat him on the neck with leather thongs armed at the extremities with lead and when he fainted under the violence of the pain he was removed in a close litter to conceal his dying agonies from the eyes of the indignant city No sooner had Rufinus perpetrated this inhuman act the sole object of his expedition than he returned amidst the deep and silent curses of a trembling people from Antioch to Constantinople and his diligence was accelerated by the hope of accomplishing without delay the nuptials of his daughter with the emperor of the East twelve Footnote ten Montesquieu Esprit des Loix l xii c twelve praises one of the laws of Theodosius addressed to the praefect Rufinus l ix tit iv leg unic to discourage the

in Rufin i two hundred forty one is again explained by the circumstantial narrative of Zosimus l v p two hundred eighty eight two hundred eighty nine But Rufinus soon experienced that a prudent minister should constantly secure his royal captive by the strong though invisible chain of habit and that the merit and much more easily the favor of the absent are obliterated in a short time from the mind of a weak and capricious sovereign While the praefect satiated his revenge at Antioch a secret conspiracy of the favorite eunuchs directed by the great chamberlain Eutropius undermined his power in the palace of Constantinople They discovered that Arcadius was not inclined to love the daughter of Rufinus who had been chosen without his consent for his bride and they contrived to substitute in her place the fair Eudoxia the daughter of Bauto thirteen a general of the Franks in the service of Rome and who was educated since the death of her father in the family of the sons of Promotus The young emperor whose chastity had been strictly guarded by the pious care of his tutor Arsenius fourteen eagerly listened to the artful and flattering descriptions of the charms of Eudoxia he gazed with impatient ardor on her picture and he understood the necessity of concealing his amorous designs from the knowledge of a minister who was so deeply interested to oppose the consummation of his happiness Soon after the return of Rufinus the approaching ceremony of the royal nuptials was announced to the people of Constantinople who prepared to celebrate with false and hollow acclamations the fortune of his daughter A splendid train of eunuchs and officers issued in hymeneal pomp from the gates of the palace bearing aloft the diadem the robes and the inestimable ornaments of the future empress The solemn procession passed through the streets of the city which were adorned with garlands and filled with spectators but when it reached the house of the sons of Promotus the principal eunuch respectfully entered the mansion invested the fair Eudoxia with the Imperial robes and conducted her in triumph to the palace and bed of Arcadius fifteen The secrecy and success with which this conspiracy against Rufinus had been conducted imprinted a mark of indelible ridicule on the character of a minister who had suffered himself to be deceived in a post where the arts of deceit and dissimulation constitute the most distinguished merit He considered with a mixture of indignation and fear the victory of an aspiring eunuch who had secretly captivated the favor of his sovereign and the disgrace of his daughter whose interest was inseparably connected with his own wounded the tenderness or at least the pride of Rufinus At the moment when he flattered himself that he should become the father of a line of kings a foreign maid who had been educated in the house of his implacable enemies was introduced into the Imperial bed and Eudoxia soon displayed a superiority of sense and spirit to improve the ascendant which her beauty must acquire over the mind of a fond and youthful husband The emperor would soon be instructed to hate to fear and to destroy the powerful subject whom he had injured and the consciousness of guilt deprived Rufinus of every hope either of safety or comfort in the retirement of a private life But he still possessed the most effectual means of defending his dignity and perhaps of oppressing his enemies The praefect still exercised an uncontrolled authority over the civil and military government of the East and his treasures if he could resolve to use them might be employed to procure proper instruments for the execution of the blackest designs that pride ambition and revenge could suggest to a desperate statesman The character of Rufinus seemed to justify the accusations that he conspired against the person of his sovereign to seat himself on the vacant throne and that he had secretly invited the Huns and the Goths to invade the provinces of the empire and to increase the public confusion The subtle praefect whose life had been spent in the intrigues of the palace opposed with equal arms the artful measures of the eunuch Eutropius but the timid soul of Rufinus was astonished by the hostile approach of a more formidable rival of the great Stilicho the general or rather the master of the empire of the West

Chronicle of Marcellinus Claudian in Rufin ii seven one hundred paints in lively colors the distress and guilt of the praefect The celestial gift which Achilles obtained and Alexander envied of a poet worthy to celebrate the actions of heroes has been enjoyed by Stilicho in a much higher degree than might have been expected from the declining state of genius and of art The muse of Claudian seventeen devoted to his service was always prepared to stigmatize his adversaries Rufinus or Eutropius with eternal infamy or to paint in the most splendid colors the victories and virtues of a powerful benefactor In the review of a period indifferently supplied with authentic materials we cannot refuse to illustrate the annals of Honorius from the invectives or the panegyrics of a contemporary writer but as Claudian appears to have indulged the most ample privilege of a poet and a courtier some criticism will be requisite to translate the language of fiction or exaggeration into the truth and simplicity of historic prose His silence concerning the family of Stilicho may be admitted as a proof that his patron was neither able nor desirous to boast of a long series of illustrious progenitors and the slight mention of his father an officer of Barbarian cavalry in the service of Valens seems to countenance the assertion that the general who so long commanded the armies of Rome was descended from the savage and perfidious race of the Vandals eighteen If Stilicho had not possessed the external advantages of strength and stature the most flattering bard in the presence of so many thousand spectators would have hesitated to affirm that he surpassed the measure of the demi gods of antiquity and that whenever he moved with lofty steps through the streets of the capital the astonished crowd made room for the stranger who displayed in a private condition the awful majesty of a hero From his earliest youth he embraced the profession of arms his prudence and valor were soon distinguished in the field the horsemen and archers of the East admired his superior dexterity and in each degree of his military promotions the public judgment always prevented and approved the choice of the sovereign He was named by Theodosius to ratify a solemn treaty with the monarch of Persia he supported during that important embassy the dignity of the Roman name and after he return to Constantinople his merit was rewarded by an intimate and honorable alliance with the Imperial family Theodosius had been prompted by a pious motive of fraternal affection to adopt for his own the daughter of his brother Honorius the beauty and accomplishments of Serena nineteen were universally admired by the obsequious court and Stilicho obtained the preference over a crowd of rivals who ambitiously disputed the hand of the princess and the favor of her adopted father twenty The assurance that the husband of Serena would be faithful to the throne which he was permitted to approach engaged the emperor to exalt the fortunes and to employ the abilities of the sagacious and intrepid Stilicho He rose through the successive steps of master of the horse and count of the domestics to the supreme rank of master general of all the cavalry and infantry of the Roman or at least of the Western empire twenty one and his enemies confessed that he invariably disdained to barter for gold the rewards of merit or to defraud the soldiers of the pay and gratifications which they deserved or claimed from the liberality of the state twenty two The valor and conduct which he afterwards displayed in the defence of Italy against the arms of Alaric and Radagaisus may justify the fame of his early achievements and in an age less attentive to the laws of honor or of pride the Roman generals might yield the preeminence of rank to the ascendant of superior genius twenty three He lamented and revenged the murder of Promotus his rival and his friend and the massacre of many thousands of the flying Bastarnae is represented by the poet as a bloody sacrifice which the Roman Achilles offered to the manes of another Patroclus The virtues and victories of Stilicho deserved the hatred of Rufinus and the arts of calumny might have been successful if the tender and vigilant Serena had not protected her husband against his domestic foes whilst he vanquished in the field the enemies of the empire twenty four Theodosius continued to support an unworthy minister to whose diligence he delegated the government of the palace and of the East but when he marched against the tyrant Eugenius he associated his faithful general to the labors and glories of the civil war and in the last moments of his life the dying monarch recommended to Stilicho the care of his sons and of the republic twenty five The ambition and the abilities of Stilicho were not unequal to the important trust and he claimed the guardianship of the two empires during the minority of Arcadius and Honorius twenty six The first measure of his administration or rather of his reign displayed to the nations the vigor and activity of a spirit worthy to command He passed the Alps in the depth of winter descended the stream of the Rhine from the fortress of Basil to the marshes of Batavia reviewed the state of the garrisons repressed the enterprises of the Germans and after establishing along the banks a firm and honorable peace returned with incredible speed to the palace of Milan twenty seven The person and court of Honorius were subject to the master general of the West and the armies and provinces of Europe obeyed without hesitation a regular authority which was exercised in the name of their young sovereign Two rivals only remained to dispute the claims and to provoke the vengeance of Stilicho Within the limits of Africa Gildo the Moor maintained a proud and dangerous independence and the minister of Constantinople asserted his equal reign over the emperor and the empire of the East Footnote seventeen Stilicho directly or indirectly is the perpetual theme of Claudian The youth and private life of the hero are vaguely expressed in the poem on his first

important object of the inheritance consisted of the numerous legions cohorts and squadrons of Romans or Barbarians whom the event of the civil war had united under the standard of Theodosius The various multitudes of Europe and Asia exasperated by recent animosities were overawed by the authority of a single man and the rigid discipline of Stilicho protected the lands of the citizens from the rapine of the licentious soldier twenty nine Anxious however and impatient to relieve Italy from the presence of this formidable host which could be useful only on the frontiers of the empire he listened to the just requisition of the minister of Arcadius declared his intention of reconducting in person the troops of the East and dexterously employed the rumor of a Gothic tumult to conceal his private designs of ambition and revenge thirty The guilty soul of Rufinus was alarmed by the approach of a warrior and a rival whose enmity he deserved he computed with increasing terror the narrow space of his life and greatness and as the last hope of safety he interposed the authority of the emperor Arcadius Stilicho who appears to have directed his march along the sea coast of the Adriatic was not far distant from the city of Thessalonica when he received a peremptory message to recall the troops of the East and to declare that his nearer approach would be considered by the Byzantine court as an act of hostility The prompt and unexpected obedience of the general of the West convinced the vulgar of his loyalty and moderation and as he had already engaged the affection of the Eastern troops he recommended to their zeal the execution of his bloody design which might be accomplished in his absence with less danger perhaps and with less reproach Stilicho left the command of the troops of the East to Gainas the Goth on whose fidelity he firmly relied with an assurance at least that the hardy Barbarians would never be diverted from his purpose by any consideration of fear or remorse The soldiers were easily persuaded to punish the enemy of Stilicho and of Rome and such was the general hatred which Rufinus had excited that the fatal secret communicated to thousands was faithfully preserved during the long march from Thessalonica to the gates of Constantinople As soon as they had resolved his death they condescended to flatter his pride the ambitious praefect was seduced to believe that those powerful auxiliaries might be tempted to place the diadem on his head and the treasures which he distributed with a tardy and reluctant hand were accepted by the indignant multitude as an insult rather than as a gift At the distance of a mile from the capital in the field of Mars before the palace of Hebdomon the troops halted and the emperor as well as his minister advanced according to ancient custom respectfully to salute the power which supported their throne As Rufinus passed along the ranks and disguised with studied courtesy his innate haughtiness the wings insensibly wheeled from the right and left and enclosed the devoted victim within the circle of their arms Before he could reflect on the danger of his situation Gainas gave the signal of death a daring and forward soldier plunged his sword into the breast of the guilty praefect and Rufinus fell groaned and expired at the feet of the affrighted emperor If the agonies of a moment could expiate the crimes of a whole life or if the outrages inflicted on a breathless corpse could be the object of pity our humanity might perhaps be affected by the horrid circumstances which accompanied the murder of Rufinus His mangled body was abandoned to the brutal fury of the populace of either sex who hastened in crowds from every quarter of the city to trample on the remains of the haughty minister at whose frown they had so lately trembled His right hand was cut off and carried through the streets of Constantinople in cruel mockery to extort contributions for the avaricious tyrant whose head was publicly exposed borne aloft on the point of a long lance thirty one According to the savage maxims of the Greek republics his innocent family would have shared the punishment of his

Vitae Patrum p seven hundred seventy nine nine hundred seventy seven The servile poet of Stilicho applauds with ferocious joy this horrid deed which in the execution perhaps of justice violated every law of nature and society profaned the majesty of the prince and renewed the dangerous examples of military license The contemplation of the universal order and harmony had satisfied Claudian of the existence of the Deity but the prosperous impunity of vice appeared to contradict his moral attributes and the fate of Rufinus was the only event which could dispel the religious doubts of the poet thirty three Such an act might vindicate the honor of Providence but it did not much contribute to the happiness of the people In less than three months they were informed of the maxims of the new administration by a singular edict which established the exclusive right of the treasury over the spoils of Rufinus and silenced under heavy penalties the presumptuous claims of the subjects of the Eastern empire who had been injured by his rapacious tyranny thirty four Even Stilicho did not derive from the murder of his rival the fruit which he had proposed and though he gratified his revenge his ambition was disappointed Under the name of a favorite the weakness of Arcadius required a master but he naturally preferred the obsequious arts of the eunuch Eutropius who had obtained his domestic confidence and the emperor contemplated with terror and aversion the stern genius of a foreign warrior Till they were divided by the jealousy of power the sword of Gainas and the charms of Eudoxia supported the favor of the great chamberlain of the palace the perfidious Goth who was appointed master general of the East betrayed without scruple the interest of his benefactor and the same troops who had so lately massacred the enemy of Stilicho were engaged to support against him the independence of the throne of Constantinople The favorites of Arcadius fomented a secret and irreconcilable war against a formidable hero who aspired to govern and to defend the two empires of Rome and the two sons of Theodosius They incessantly labored by dark and treacherous machinations to deprive him of the esteem of the prince the respect of the people and the friendship of the Barbarians The life of Stilicho was repeatedly attempted by the dagger of hired assassins and a decree was obtained from the senate of Constantinople to declare him an enemy of the republic and to confiscate his ample possessions in the provinces of the East At a time when the only hope of delaying the ruin of the Roman name depended on the firm union and reciprocal aid of all the nations to whom it had been gradually communicated the subjects of Arcadius and Honorius were instructed by their respective masters to view each other in a foreign and even hostile light to rejoice in their mutual calamities and to embrace as their faithful allies the Barbarians whom they excited to invade the territories of their countrymen thirty five The natives of Italy affected to despise the servile and effeminate Greeks of Byzantium who presumed to imitate the dress and to usurp the dignity of Roman senators thirty six and the Greeks had not yet forgot the sentiments of hatred and contempt which their polished ancestors had so long entertained for the rude inhabitants of the West The distinction

persisting to force the inclinations of a prince and people who rejected his government wisely abandoned Arcadius to his unworthy favorites and his reluctance to involve the two empires in a civil war displayed the moderation of a minister who had so often signalized his military spirit and abilities But if Stilicho had any longer endured the revolt of Africa he would have betrayed the security of the capital and the majesty of the Western emperor to the capricious insolence of a Moorish rebel Gildo thirty seven the brother of the tyrant Firmus had preserved and obtained as the reward of his apparent fidelity the immense patrimony which was forfeited by treason long and meritorious service in the armies of Rome raised him to the dignity of a military count the narrow policy of the court of Theodosius had adopted the mischievous expedient of supporting a legal government by the interest of a powerful family and the brother of Firmus was invested with the command of Africa His ambition soon usurped the administration of justice and of the finances without account and without control and he maintained during a reign of twelve years the possession of an office from which it was impossible to remove him without the danger of a civil war During those twelve years the provinces of Africa groaned under the dominion of a tyrant who seemed to unite the unfeeling temper of a stranger with the partial resentments of domestic faction The forms of law were often superseded by the use of poison and if the trembling guests who were invited to the table of Gildo presumed to express fears the insolent suspicion served only to excite his fury and he loudly summoned the ministers of death Gildo alternately indulged the passions of avarice and lust thirty eight and if his days were terrible to the rich his nights were not less dreadful to husbands and parents The fairest of their wives and daughters were prostituted to the embraces of the tyrant and afterwards abandoned to a ferocious troop of Barbarians and assassins the black or swarthy natives of the desert whom Gildo considered as the only of his throne In the civil war between Theodosius and Eugenius the count or rather the sovereign of Africa maintained a haughty and suspicious neutrality refused to assist either of the contending parties with troops or vessels expected the declaration of fortune and reserved for the conqueror the vain professions of his allegiance Such professions would not have satisfied the master of the Roman world but the death of Theodosius and the weakness and discord of his sons confirmed the power of the Moor who condescended as a proof of his moderation to abstain from the use of the diadem and to supply Rome with the customary tribute or rather subsidy of corn In every division of the empire the five provinces of Africa were invariably assigned to the West and Gildo had to govern that extensive country in the name of Honorius but his knowledge of the character and designs of Stilicho soon engaged him to address his homage to a more distant and feeble sovereign The ministers of Arcadius embraced the cause of a perfidious rebel and the delusive hope of adding the numerous cities of Africa to the empire of the East tempted them to assert a claim which they were incapable of supporting either by reason or by arms thirty nine Footnote thirty seven

delicacy the intrigues of the Byzantine court which are likewise mentioned by Zosimus l v p three hundred two When Stilicho had given a firm and decisive answer to the pretensions of the Byzantine court he solemnly accused the tyrant of Africa before the tribunal which had formerly judged the kings and nations of the earth and the image of the republic was revived after a long interval under the reign of Honorius The emperor transmitted an accurate and ample detail of the complaints of the provincials and the crimes of Gildo to the Roman senate and the members of that venerable assembly were required to pronounce the condemnation of the rebel Their unanimous suffrage declared him the enemy of the republic and the decree of the senate added a sacred and legitimate sanction to the Roman arms forty A people who still remembered that their ancestors had been the masters of the world would have applauded with conscious pride the representation of ancient freedom if they had not since been accustomed to prefer the solid assurance of bread to the unsubstantial visions of liberty and greatness The subsistence of Rome depended on the harvests of Africa and it was evident that a declaration of war would be the signal of famine The praefect Symmachus who presided in the deliberations of the senate admonished the minister of his just apprehension that as soon as the revengeful Moor should prohibit the exportation of corn the and perhaps the safety of the capital would be threatened by the hungry rage of a turbulent multitude forty one The prudence of Stilicho conceived and executed without delay the most effectual measure for the relief of the Roman people A large and seasonable supply of corn collected in the inland provinces of Gaul was embarked on the rapid stream of the Rhone and transported by an easy navigation from the Rhone to the Tyber During the whole term of the African war the granaries of Rome were continually filled her dignity was vindicated from the

younger brother whose courage and abilities he feared and Mascezel oppressed by superior power refuge in the court of Milan where he soon received the cruel intelligence that his two innocent and helpless children had been murdered by their inhuman uncle The affliction of the father was suspended only by the desire of revenge The vigilant Stilicho already prepared to collect the naval and military force of the Western empire and he had resolved if the tyrant should be able to wage an equal and doubtful war to march against him in person But as Italy required his presence and as it might be dangerous to weaken the of the frontier he judged it more advisable that Mascezel should attempt this arduous adventure at the head of a chosen body of Gallic veterans who had lately served

men who fly from the light They call themselves Monks or solitaries because they choose to live alone without any witnesses of their actions They fear the gifts of fortune from the apprehension of losing them and lest they should be miserable they embrace a life of voluntary wretchedness How absurd is their choice how perverse their understanding to dread the evils without being able to support

deferred by art of persuasion the consummation of the royal nuptials Maria died a virgin after she had been ten years a wife and the chastity of the emperor was secured by the coldness perhaps the debility of his constitution sixty His subjects who attentively studied the character of their young sovereign discovered that Honorius was without passions and consequently without talents and that his feeble and languid disposition was alike incapable of discharging the duties of his rank or of enjoying the pleasures of his age In his early youth he made some progress in the exercises of riding and drawing the bow but he soon relinquished these fatiguing occupations and the amusement of feeding poultry became the serious and daily care of the monarch of the West sixty one who resigned the reins of empire to the firm and skilful hand of his guardian Stilicho The experience of history will countenance the suspicion that a prince who was born in the purple received a worse education than the meanest peasant of his dominions and that the ambitious minister suffered him to attain the age of manhood without attempting to excite his courage or to enlighten his under standing sixty two The predecessors of Honorius were accustomed to animate by their example or at least by their presence the valor of the legions and the dates of their laws attest the perpetual activity of their motions

again attempted to penetrate into the heart of Italy Since the public and important events escape the diligence of the historian he may amuse himself with contemplating for a moment the influence of the arms of Alaric on the fortunes of two obscure individuals a presbyter of Aquileia and a husbandman of Verona The learned Rufinus who was summoned by his enemies to appear before a Roman synod twenty eight wisely preferred the dangers of a besieged city and the Barbarians who furiously shook the walls of Aquileia might save him from the cruel sentence of another heretic who at the request of the same bishops was severely whipped and condemned to perpetual exile on a desert island twenty nine The old man thirty who had passed his simple and innocent life in the neighborhood of Verona was a stranger to the quarrels both of kings and of bishops his pleasures his desires his knowledge were confined within the little circle of his paternal farm and a staff supported his aged steps on the same ground where he had sported in his infancy Yet even this humble and rustic felicity which Claudian describes with so much truth and feeling was still exposed to the undistinguishing rage of war His trees his old contemporary trees thirty one must blaze in the conflagration of the whole country a detachment of Gothic cavalry might sweep away his cottage and his family and the power of Alaric could destroy this happiness which he was not able either to taste or to bestow Fame says the poet encircling with terror her gloomy wings proclaimed the march of the Barbarian army and filled Italy with consternation the apprehensions of each individual were increased in just proportion to the measure of his fortune and the most timid who had already embarked their valuable effects meditated their escape to the Island of Sicily or the African coast The public distress was aggravated by the fears and reproaches of superstition thirty two Every hour produced some horrid tale of strange and portentous accidents the Pagans deplored the neglect of omens and the interruption of sacrifices but the Christians still derived some comfort from the powerful intercession of the saints

passages of Paulinus which Baronius has produced Annal Eccles A D four hundred three No fifty one it is manifest that the general alarm had pervaded all Italy as far as Nola in Campania where that famous penitent had fixed his abode Chapter XXX Revolt Of The Goths Part II The emperor Honorius was distinguished above his subjects by the preeminence of fear as well as of rank The pride and luxury in which he was educated had not allowed him to suspect that there existed on the earth any power presumptuous enough to invade the repose of the successor of Augustus The arts of flattery concealed the impending danger till Alaric approached the palace of Milan But when the sound of war had awakened the young emperor instead of flying to arms with the spirit or even the rashness of his age he eagerly listened to those timid counsellors who proposed to convey his sacred person and his faithful attendants to some secure and distant station in the provinces of Gaul Stilicho alone thirty four had courage and authority to resist his disgraceful measure which would have abandoned Rome and Italy to the Barbarians but as the troops of the palace had been lately detached to the Rhaetian frontier and as the resource of new levies was slow and precarious the general of the West could only promise that if the court of Milan would maintain their ground during his absence he would soon return with an army equal to the encounter of the Gothic king Without losing a moment while each moment was so important to the public safety Stilicho hastily embarked on the Larian Lake ascended the mountains of ice and snow amidst the severity of an Alpine winter and suddenly repressed by his unexpected presence the enemy who had disturbed the tranquillity of Rhaetia thirty five The Barbarians perhaps some tribes of the Alemanni respected the firmness of a chief who still assumed the language of command and the choice which he condescended to make of a select number of their bravest youth was considered as a mark of his esteem and favor The cohorts who were delivered from the neighboring foe diligently repaired to the Imperial standard and Stilicho issued his orders to the most remote troops of the West to advance by rapid marches to the defence of Honorius and of Italy The fortresses of the Rhine were abandoned and the safety of Gaul was protected only by the faith of the Germans and the ancient terror of the Roman name Even the legion which had been stationed to guard the wall of Britain against the Caledonians of the North was hastily recalled thirty six and a numerous body of the cavalry of the Alani was persuaded to engage in the service of the emperor who anxiously expected the return of his general The prudence and vigor of Stilicho were conspicuous on this occasion which revealed at the same time the weakness of the falling empire The legions of Rome which had long since languished in the gradual decay of discipline and courage were exterminated by the Gothic and civil wars and it was found impossible without exhausting and exposing the provinces to assemble an army for the defence of Italy Footnote thirty four Solus erat Stilicho c is the exclusive commendation which Claudian bestows del Bell Get two hundred sixty seven without condescending to except the emperor How insignificant must Honorius have appeared in his own court Footnote thirty five

Quae Scoto dat frena truci De Bell Get four hundred sixteen Yet the most rapid march from Edinburgh or Newcastle to Milan must have required a longer space of time than Claudian seems willing to allow for the duration of the Gothic war Chapter XXX Revolt Of The Goths Part III When Stilicho seemed to abandon his sovereign in the unguarded palace of Milan he had probably calculated the term of his absence the distance of the enemy and the obstacles that might retard their march He principally depended on the rivers of Italy the Adige the Mincius the Oglio and the Addua which in the winter or spring by the fall of rains or by the melting of the snows are commonly swelled into broad and impetuous torrents thirty seven But the season happened to be remarkably dry and the Goths could traverse without impediment the wide and stony beds whose centre was faintly marked by the course of a shallow stream The bridge and passage of the Addua were secured by a strong detachment of the Gothic army and as Alaric approached the walls or rather the suburbs of Milan he enjoyed the proud satisfaction of seeing the emperor of the Romans fly before him Honorius accompanied by a feeble train of statesmen and eunuchs hastily retreated towards the Alps with a design of securing his person in the city of Arles which had often been the royal residence of his predecessors three thousand seven hundred eleven But Honorius thirty eight had scarcely passed the Po before he was overtaken by the speed of the Gothic cavalry thirty nine since the urgency of the danger compelled him to seek a temporary shelter within the fortifications of Asta a town of Liguria or Piemont situate on the banks of the Tanarus forty The siege of an obscure place which contained so rich a prize and seemed incapable of a long resistance was instantly formed and indefatigably pressed by the king of the Goths and the bold declaration which the emperor might afterwards make that his breast had never been susceptible of fear did not probably obtain much credit even in his own court forty one In the last and almost hopeless extremity after the Barbarians had already proposed the indignity of a capitulation the Imperial captive was suddenly relieved by the fame the approach and at length the presence of the hero whom he had so long expected At the head of a chosen and intrepid vanguard Stilicho swam the stream of the Addua to gain the time which he must have lost in the attack of the bridge the passage of the Po was an enterprise of much less hazard and difficulty and the successful action in which he cut his way through the Gothic camp under the walls of Asta revived the hopes and vindicated the honor of Rome Instead of grasping the fruit of his victory the Barbarian was gradually invested on every side by the troops of the West who successively issued through all the passes of the Alps his quarters were straitened his convoys were intercepted and the vigilance of the Romans prepared to form a chain of fortifications and to besiege the lines of the besiegers A military council was assembled of the long haired chiefs of the Gothic nation of aged warriors whose bodies were wrapped in furs and whose stern countenances were marked with honorable wounds They weighed the glory of persisting in their attempt against the advantage of securing their plunder and they recommended the prudent measure of a seasonable retreat In this important debate Alaric displayed the spirit of the conqueror of Rome and after he had reminded his countrymen of their achievements and of their designs he concluded his animating speech by the solemn and positive assurance that he was resolved to find in Italy either a kingdom or a grave forty two Footnote thirty

Achilles are strong characteristic adapted to the circumstances and possibly not less genuine than those of Livy The loose discipline of the Barbarians always exposed them to the danger of a surprise but instead of choosing the dissolute hours of riot and intemperance Stilicho resolved to attack the Christian Goths whilst they were devoutly employed in celebrating the festival of Easter forty three The execution of the stratagem or as it was termed by the clergy of the sacrilege was intrusted to Saul a Barbarian and a Pagan who had served however with distinguished reputation among the veteran generals of Theodosius The camp of the Goths which Alaric had pitched in the neighborhood of Pollentia forty four was thrown into confusion by the sudden and impetuous charge of the Imperial cavalry but in a few moments the undaunted genius of their leader gave them an order and a field of battle and as soon as they had recovered from their astonishment the pious confidence that the God of the Christians would assert their cause added new strength to their native valor In this engagement which was long maintained with equal courage and success the chief of the Alani whose diminutive and savage form concealed a magnanimous soul approved his suspected loyalty by the zeal with which he fought and fell in the service of the republic and the fame of this gallant Barbarian has been imperfectly preserved in the verses of Claudian since the poet who celebrates his virtue has omitted the mention of his name His death was followed by the flight and dismay of the squadrons which he commanded and the defeat of the wing of cavalry might have decided the victory of Alaric if Stilicho had not immediately led the Roman and Barbarian infantry to the attack The skill of the general and the bravery of the soldiers surmounted every obstacle In the evening of the bloody day the Goths retreated from the field of battle the intrenchments of their camp were forced and the scene of rapine and slaughter made some atonement for the calamities which they had inflicted on the subjects of the empire forty five The magnificent spoils of Corinth and Argos enriched the veterans of the West the captive wife of Alaric who had impatiently claimed his promise of Roman jewels and Patrician handmaids forty six was reduced to implore the mercy of the insulting foe and many thousand prisoners released from the Gothic chains dispersed through the provinces of Italy the praises of their heroic deliverer The triumph of Stilicho forty seven was compared by the poet and perhaps by the public to that of Marius who in the same part of Italy had encountered and destroyed another army of Northern Barbarians The huge bones and the empty helmets of the Cimbri and of the Goths would easily be confounded by succeeding generations and posterity might erect a common trophy to the memory of the two most illustrious generals who had vanquished on the same memorable ground the two most

They are poetical and party writers yet some credit is due to the most suspicious witnesses who are checked by the recent notoriety of facts Footnote forty eight Claudian s peroration is strong and elegant but the identity of the Cimbric and Gothic fields must be understood like Virgil s Philippi Georgic i four hundred ninety according to the loose geography of a poet Verselle and Pollentia are sixty miles from each other and the latitude is still greater if the Cimbri were defeated in the wide and barren plain of Verona Maffei Verona Illustrata P i p fifty four sixty two The eloquence of Claudian forty nine has celebrated with lavish applause the victory of Pollentia one of the most glorious days in the life of his patron but his reluctant and partial muse bestows more genuine praise on the character of the Gothic king His name is indeed branded with the reproachful epithets of pirate and robber to which the conquerors of every age are so justly entitled but the poet of Stilicho is compelled to acknowledge that Alaric possessed the invincible temper of mind which rises superior to every misfortune and derives new resources from adversity After the total defeat of his infantry he escaped or rather withdrew from the field of battle with the greatest part of his cavalry entire and unbroken Without wasting a moment to lament the irreparable loss of so many brave companions he left his victorious enemy to bind in chains the captive images of a Gothic king fifty and boldly resolved to break through the unguarded passes of the Apennine to spread desolation over the fruitful face of Tuscany and to conquer or die before the gates of Rome The capital was saved by the active and incessant diligence of Stilicho but he respected the despair of his enemy and instead of committing the fate of the republic to the chance of another battle he proposed to purchase the absence of the Barbarians The spirit of Alaric would have rejected such terms the permission of a retreat and the offer of a pension with contempt and indignation but he exercised a limited and precarious authority over the independent chieftains who had raised him for their service above the rank of his equals they were still less disposed to follow an unsuccessful general and many of them were tempted to consult their interest by a private negotiation with the minister of Honorius The king submitted to the voice of his people ratified the treaty with the empire of the West and repassed the Po with the remains of the flourishing army which he had led into Italy A considerable part of the Roman forces still continued to attend his motions and Stilicho who maintained a secret correspondence with some of the Barbarian chiefs was punctually apprised of the designs that were formed in the camp and council of Alaric The king of the Goths ambitious to signalize his retreat by some splendid achievement had resolved to occupy the important city of Verona which commands the principal passage of the Rhaetian Alps and directing his march through the territories of those German tribes whose alliance would restore his exhausted strength to invade on the side of the Rhine the wealthy and unsuspecting provinces of Gaul Ignorant of the treason which had already betrayed his bold and judicious enterprise he advanced towards the passes of the mountains already possessed by the Imperial troops where he was exposed almost at the same instant to a general attack in the front on his flanks and in the rear In this bloody action at a small distance from the walls of Verona the loss of the Goths was not less heavy than that which they had sustained in the defeat of Pollentia and their valiant king who escaped by the swiftness of his horse must either have been slain or made prisoner if the hasty rashness of the Alani had not disappointed the measures of the Roman general Alaric secured the remains of his army on the adjacent rocks and prepared himself with undaunted resolution to maintain a siege against the superior numbers of the enemy who invested him on all sides But he could not oppose the destructive progress of hunger and disease nor was it possible for him to check the continual desertion of his impatient and capricious Barbarians In this extremity he still found resources in his own courage or in the moderation of his adversary and the retreat of the Gothic king was considered as the deliverance of Italy fifty one Yet the people and even the clergy incapable of forming any rational judgment of the business of peace and war presumed to arraign the policy of Stilicho who so often vanquished so often surrounded and so often dismissed the implacable enemy of the republic The first momen of the public safety is devoted to gratitude and joy but the second is diligently occupied by envy and calumny fifty two Footnote forty nine Claudian and Prudentius must be strictly examined to reduce the figures and extort the historic sense of those poets

honorable three hundred twenty drops the curtain with a fine image The citizens of Rome had been astonished by the approach of Alaric and the diligence with which they labored to restore the walls of the capital confessed their own fears and the decline of the empire After the retreat of the Barbarians Honorius was directed to accept the dutiful invitation of the senate and to celebrate in the Imperial city the auspicious aera of the Gothic victory and of his sixth consulship fifty three The suburbs and the streets from the Milvian bridge to the Palatine mount were filled by the Roman people who in the space of a hundred years had only thrice been honored with the presence of their sovereigns While their eyes were fixed on the chariot where Stilicho was deservedly seated by the side of his royal pupil they applauded the pomp of a triumph which was not stained like that of Constantine or of Theodosius with civil blood The procession passed under a lofty arch which had been purposely erected but in less than seven years the Gothic conquerors of Rome might read if they were able to read the superb inscription of that monument which attested the total defeat and destruction of their nation fifty four The emperor resided several months in the capital and every part of his behavior was regulated with care to conciliate the affection of the clergy the senate and the people of Rome The clergy was edified by his frequent visits and liberal gifts to the shrines of the apostles The senate who in the triumphal procession had been excused from the humiliating ceremony of preceding on foot the Imperial chariot was treated with the decent reverence which Stilicho always affected for that assembly The people was repeatedly gratified by the attention and courtesy of Honorius in the public games which were celebrated on that occasion with a magnificence not unworthy of the spectator As soon as the appointed number of chariot races was concluded the decoration of the Circus was suddenly changed the hunting of wild beasts afforded a various and splendid entertainment and the chase was succeeded by a military dance which seems in the lively description of Claudian to present the image of a modern tournament Footnote fifty three The remainder of Claudian s poem on the sixth consulship of Honorius describes the journey the triumph and the games three hundred thirty six hundred sixty Footnote fifty four See the inscription in Mascou s History of the Ancient Germans viii twelve The words are positive and indiscreet Getarum nationem in

first edict which condemned the art and amusement of shedding human blood fifty six but this benevolent law expressed the wishes of the prince without reforming an inveterate abuse which degraded a civilized nation below the condition of savage cannibals Several hundred perhaps several thousand victims were annually slaughtered in the great cities of the empire and the month of December more peculiarly devoted to the combats of gladiators still exhibited to the eyes of the Roman people a grateful spectacle of blood and cruelty Amidst the general joy of the victory of Pollentia a Christian poet exhorted the emperor to extirpate by his authority the horrid custom which had so long resisted the voice of humanity and religion fifty seven The pathetic representations of Prudentius were less effectual than the generous boldness of Telemachus and Asiatic monk whose death was more useful to mankind than his life fifty eight The Romans were provoked by the interruption of their pleasures and the rash monk who had descended into the arena to separate the gladiators was overwhelmed under a shower of stones But the madness of the people soon subsided they respected the memory of Telemachus who had deserved the honors of martyrdom and they submitted without a murmur to the laws of Honorius which abolished forever the human sacrifices of the amphitheater five thousand eight hundred eleven The citizens who adhered to the manners of their ancestors might perhaps insinuate that the last remains of a martial spirit were preserved in this school of fortitude which accustomed the Romans to the sight of blood and to the contempt of death a vain and cruel prejudice so nobly confuted by the valor of ancient Greece and of modern Europe fifty nine Footnote fifty five On the curious though

et mortem disciplina Seneca epist vii shows the feelings of a man The recent danger to which the person of the emperor had been exposed in the defenceless palace of Milan urged him to seek a retreat in some inaccessible fortress of Italy where he might securely remain while the open country was covered by a deluge of Barbarians On the coast of the Adriatic about ten or twelve miles from the most southern of the seven mouths of the Po the Thessalians had founded the ancient colony of Ravenna sixty which they afterwards resigned to the natives of Umbria Augustus who had observed the opportunity of the place prepared at the distance of three miles from the old town a capacious harbor for the reception of two hundred and fifty ships of war This naval establishment which included the arsenals and magazines the barracks of the troops and the houses of the artificers derived its origin and name from the permanent station of the Roman fleet the intermediate space was soon filled with buildings and inhabitants and the three extensive and populous quarters of Ravenna gradually contributed to form one of the most important cities of Italy The principal canal of Augustus poured a copious stream of the waters of the Po through the midst of the city to the entrance of the harbor the same waters were introduced into the profound ditches that encompassed the walls they were distributed by a thousand subordinate canals into every part of the city which they divided into a variety of small islands the communication was maintained only by the use of boats and bridges and the houses of Ravenna whose appearance may be compared to that of Venice were raised on the foundation of wooden piles The adjacent country to the distance of many miles was a deep and impassable morass and the artificial causeway which connected Ravenna with the continent might be easily guarded or destroyed on the approach of a hostile army These morasses were interspersed however with vineyards and though the soil was exhausted by four or five crops the town enjoyed a more plentiful supply of wine than of fresh water sixty one The air instead of receiving the sickly and almost pestilential exhalations of low and marshy grounds was distinguished like the neighborhood of Alexandria as uncommonly pure and salubrious and this singular advantage was ascribed to the regular tides of the Adriatic which swept the canals interrupted the unwholesome stagnation of the waters and floated every day the vessels of the adjacent country into the heart of Ravenna The gradual retreat of the sea has left the modern city at the distance of four miles from the Adriatic and as early as the fifth or sixth century of the Christian aera the port of Augustus was converted into pleasant orchards and a lonely grove of pines covered the ground where the Roman fleet once rode at anchor sixty two Even this alteration contributed to increase the natural strength of the place and the shallowness of the water was a sufficient barrier against the large ships of the enemy This advantageous situation was fortified by art and labor and in the twentieth year of his age the emperor of the West anxious only for his personal safety retired to the perpetual confinement of the walls and morasses of Ravenna The example of Honorius was imitated by his feeble successors the Gothic kings and afterwards the Exarchs who occupied the throne and palace of the emperors and till the middle of the eight century Ravenna was considered as the seat of government and the capital of Italy sixty

Chronology of the Laws tom i p cxlviii c The fears of Honorius were not without foundation nor were his precautions without effect While Italy rejoiced in her deliverance from the Goths a furious tempest was excited among the nations of Germany who yielded to the irresistible impulse that appears to have been gradually communicated from the eastern extremity of the continent of Asia The Chinese annals as they have been interpreted by the earned industry of the present age may be usefully applied to reveal the secret and remote causes of the fall of the Roman empire The extensive territory to the north of the great wall was possessed after the flight of the Huns by the victorious Sienpi who were sometimes broken into independent tribes and sometimes reunited under a supreme chief till at length styling themselves Topa or masters of the earth they acquired a more solid consistence and a more formidable power The Topa soon compelled the pastoral nations of the eastern desert to acknowledge the superiority of their arms they invaded China in a period of weakness and intestine discord and these fortunate Tartars adopting the laws and manners of the vanquished people founded an Imperial dynasty which reigned near one hundred and sixty years over the northern provinces of the monarchy Some generations before they ascended the throne of China one of the Topa princes had enlisted in his cavalry a slave of the name of Moko renowned for his valor but who was tempted by the fear of punishment to desert his standard and to range the desert at the head of a hundred followers This gang of robbers and outlaws swelled into a camp a tribe a numerous people distinguished by the appellation of Geougen and their hereditary chieftains the posterity of Moko the slave assumed their rank among the Scythian monarchs The youth of Toulun the greatest of his descendants was exercised by those misfortunes which are the school of heroes He bravely struggled with adversity broke the imperious yoke of the Topa and became the legislator of his nation and the conqueror of Tartary His troops were distributed into regular bands of a hundred and of a thousand men cowards were stoned to death the most splendid honors were proposed as the reward of valor and Toulun who had knowledge enough to despise the learning of China adopted only such arts and institutions as were favorable to the military spirit of his government His tents which he removed in the winter season to a more southern latitude were pitched during the summer on the fruitful banks of the Selinga His conquests stretched from Corea far beyond the River Irtish He vanquished in the country to the north of the Caspian Sea the nation of the Huns and the new title of Khan or Cagan expressed the fame and

five three hundred thirty four three hundred thirty eight The chain of events is interrupted or rather is concealed as it passes from the Volga to the Vistula through the dark interval which separates the extreme limits of the Chinese and of the Roman geography Yet the temper of the Barbarians and the experience of successive emigrations sufficiently declare that the Huns who were oppressed by the arms of the Geougen soon withdrew from the presence of an insulting victor The countries towards the Euxine were already occupied by their kindred tribes and their hasty flight which they soon converted into a bold attack would more naturally be directed towards the rich and level plains through which the Vistula gently flows into the Baltic Sea The North must again have been alarmed and agitated by the invasion of the Huns six thousand four hundred eleven and the nations who retreated before them must have pressed with incumbent weight on the confines of Germany sixty five The inhabitants of those regions which the ancients have assigned to the Suevi the Vandals and the Burgundians might embrace the resolution of abandoning to the fugitives of Sarmatia their woods and morasses or at least of discharging their superfluous numbers on the provinces of the Roman empire sixty six About four years after the victorious Toulun had assumed the title of Khan of the Geougen another Barbarian the haughty Rhodogast or Radagaisus sixty seven marched from the northern extremities of Germany almost to the gates of Rome and left the remains of his army to achieve the destruction of the West The Vandals the Suevi and the Burgundians formed the strength of this mighty host but the Alani who had found a hospitable reception in their new seats added their active cavalry to the heavy infantry of the Germans and the Gothic adventurers crowded so eagerly to the standard of Radagaisus that by some historians he has been styled the King of the Goths Twelve thousand warriors distinguished above the vulgar by their noble birth or their valiant deeds glittered in the van sixty eight and the whole multitude which was not less than two hundred thousand fighting men might be increased by the accession of women of children and of slaves to the amount of four hundred thousand persons This formidable emigration issued from the same coast of the Baltic which had poured forth the myriads of the Cimbri and Teutones to assault Rome and Italy in the vigor of the republic After the departure of those Barbarians their native country which was marked by the vestiges of their greatness long ramparts and gigantic moles sixty nine remained during some ages a vast and dreary solitude till the human species was renewed by the powers of generation and the

correspondence of nations was in that age so imperfect and precarious that the revolutions of the North might escape the knowledge of the court of Ravenna till the dark cloud which was collected along the coast of the Baltic burst in thunder upon the banks of the Upper Danube The emperor of the West if his ministers disturbed his amusements by the news of the impending danger was satisfied with being the occasion and the spectator of the war seventy The safety of Rome was intrusted to the counsels and the sword of Stilicho but such was the feeble and exhausted state of the empire that it was impossible to restore the fortifications of the Danube or to prevent by a vigorous effort the invasion of the Germans seventy one The hopes of the vigilant minister of Honorius were confined to the defence of Italy He once more abandoned the provinces recalled the troops pressed the new levies which were rigorously exacted and pusillanimously eluded employed the most efficacious means to arrest or allure the deserters and offered the gift of freedom and of two pieces of gold to all the slaves who would enlist seventy two By these efforts he painfully collected from the subjects of a great empire an army of thirty or forty thousand men which in the days of Scipio or Camillus would have been instantly furnished by the free citizens of the territory of Rome seventy three The thirty legions of Stilicho were reenforced by a large body of Barbarian auxiliaries the faithful Alani were personally attached to his service and the troops of Huns and of Goths who marched under the banners of their native princes Huldin and Sarus were animated by interest and resentment to oppose the ambition of Radagaisus The king of the confederate Germans passed without resistance the Alps the Po and the Apennine leaving on one hand the inaccessible palace of Honorius securely buried among the marshes of Ravenna and on the other the camp of Stilicho who had fixed his head quarters at Ticinum or Pavia but who seems to have avoided a decisive battle till he had assembled his distant forces Many cities of Italy were pillaged or destroyed and the siege of Florence seventy four by Radagaisus is one of the earliest events in the history of that celebrated republic whose firmness checked and delayed the unskillful fury of the Barbarians The senate and people trembled at their

leader of a disciplined army who understood the laws of war who respected the sanctity of treaties and who had familiarly conversed with the subjects of the empire in the same camps and the same churches The savage Radagaisus was a stranger to the manners the religion and even the language of the civilized nations of the South The fierceness of his temper was exasperated by cruel superstition and it was universally believed that he had bound himself by a solemn vow to reduce the city into a heap of stones and ashes and to sacrifice the most illustrious of the Roman senators on the altars of those gods who were appeased by human blood The public danger which should have reconciled all domestic animosities displayed the incurable madness of religious faction The oppressed votaries of Jupiter and Mercury respected in the implacable enemy of Rome the character of a devout Pagan loudly declared that they were more apprehensive of the sacrifices than of the arms of Radagaisus and secretly rejoiced in the calamities of their country which condemned the faith of their Christian adversaries seventy five seven thousand five hundred eleven Footnote seventy Cujus agendi Spectator

supported only by the authority of saint Ambrose who had communicated in a dream the promise of a speedy deliverance seventy six On a sudden they beheld from their walls the banners of Stilicho who advanced with his united force to the relief of the faithful city and who soon marked that fatal spot for the grave of the Barbarian host The apparent contradictions of those writers who variously relate the defeat of Radagaisus may be reconciled without offering much violence to their respective testimonies Orosius and Augustin who were intimately connected by friendship and religion ascribed this miraculous victory to the providence of God rather than to the valor of man seventy seven They strictly exclude every idea of chance or even of bloodshed and positively affirm that the Romans whose camp was the scene of plenty and idleness enjoyed the distress of the Barbarians slowly expiring on the sharp and barren ridge of the hills of Faesulae which rise above the city of Florence Their extravagant assertion that not a single soldier of the Christian army was killed or even wounded may be dismissed with silent contempt but the rest of the narrative of Augustin and Orosius is consistent with the state of the war and the character of Stilicho Conscious that he commanded the last army of the republic his prudence would not expose it in the open field to the headstrong fury of the Germans The method of surrounding the enemy with strong lines of circumvallation which he had twice employed against the Gothic king was repeated on a larger scale and with more considerable effect The examples of Caesar must have been familiar to the most illiterate of the Roman warriors and the fortifications of Dyrrachium which connected twenty four castles by a perpetual ditch and rampart of fifteen miles afforded the model of an intrenchment which might confine and starve the most numerous host of Barbarians seventy eight The Roman troops had less degenerated from the industry than from the valor of their ancestors and if their servile and laborious work offended the pride of the soldiers Tuscany could supply many thousand peasants who would labor though perhaps they would not fight for the salvation of their native country The imprisoned multitude of horses and men seventy nine was gradually destroyed by famine rather than by the sword but the Romans were exposed during the progress of such an extensive work to the frequent attacks of an impatient enemy The despair of the hungry Barbarians would precipitate them against the fortifications of Stilicho the general might sometimes indulge the ardor of his brave auxiliaries who eagerly pressed to assault the camp of the Germans and these various incidents might produce the sharp and bloody conflicts which dignify the narrative of Zosimus and the Chronicles of Prosper and Marcellinus eighty A seasonable supply of men and provisions had been introduced into the walls of Florence and the famished host of Radagaisus was in its turn besieged The proud monarch of so many warlike nations after the loss of his bravest warriors was reduced to confide either in the faith of a capitulation or in the clemency of Stilicho eighty one But the death of the royal captive who was ignominiously beheaded disgraced the triumph of Rome and of Christianity and the short delay of his execution was sufficient to brand the conqueror with the guilt of cool and deliberate cruelty eighty two The famished Germans who escaped the fury of the auxiliaries were sold as slaves at the contemptible price of as many single pieces of gold but the difference of food and climate swept away great numbers of those unhappy strangers and it was observed that the inhuman purchasers instead of reaping the fruits of their labor were soon obliged to provide the expense of their interment Stilicho informed the emperor and the senate of his success and deserved a second time the glorious title of Deliverer of Italy eighty three

persuasion that the whole army or rather nation of Germans who migrated from the shores of the Baltic miserably perished under the walls of Florence Such indeed was the fate of Radagaisus himself of his brave and faithful companions and of more than one third of the various multitude of Sueves and Vandals of Alani and Burgundians who adhered to the standard of their general eighty four The union of such an army might excite our surprise but the causes of separation are obvious and forcible the pride of birth the insolence of valor the jealousy of command the impatience of subordination and the obstinate conflict of opinions of interests and of passions among so many kings and warriors who were untaught to yield or to obey After the defeat of Radagaisus two parts of the German host which must have exceeded the number of one hundred thousand men still remained in arms between the Apennine and the Alps or between the Alps and the Danube It is uncertain whether they attempted to revenge the death of their general but their irregular fury was soon diverted by the prudence and firmness of Stilicho who opposed their march and facilitated their retreat who considered the safety of Rome and Italy as the great object of his care and who sacrificed with too much indifference the wealth and tranquillity of the distant provinces eighty five The Barbarians acquired from the junction of some Pannonian deserters the knowledge of the country and of the roads and the invasion of Gaul which Alaric had designed was executed by the remains of the great army of Radagaisus eighty six

tom vii p eighty seven one hundred twenty one Paris seventeen seventy two an elaborate work which I had not the advantage of perusing till the year seventeen seventy seven As early as seventeen seventy one I find the same idea expressed in a rough draught of the present History I have since observed a similar intimation in Mascou viii fifteen Such agreement without mutual communication may add some weight to our common sentiment Yet if they expected to derive any assistance from the tribes of Germany who inhabited the banks of the Rhine their hopes were disappointed The Alemanni preserved a state of inactive neutrality and the Franks distinguished their zeal and courage in the defence of the of the empire In the rapid progress down the Rhine which was the first act of the administration of Stilicho he had applied himself with peculiar attention to secure the alliance of the warlike Franks and to remove the irreconcilable enemies of peace and of the republic Marcomir one of their kings was publicly convicted before the tribunal of the Roman magistrate of violating the faith of treaties He was sentenced to a mild but distant exile in the province of Tuscany and this degradation of the regal dignity was so far from exciting the resentment of his subjects that they punished with death the turbulent Sunno who attempted to revenge his brother and maintained a dutiful allegiance to the princes who were established on the throne by the choice of Stilicho eighty seven When the limits of Gaul and Germany were shaken by the northern emigration the Franks bravely encountered the single force of the Vandals who regardless of the lessons of adversity had again separated their troops from the standard of their Barbarian allies They paid the penalty of their rashness and twenty thousand Vandals with their king Godigisclus were slain in the field of battle The whole people must have been extirpated if the squadrons of the Alani advancing to their relief had not trampled down the infantry of the Franks who after an honorable resistance were compelled to relinquish the unequal contest The victorious confederates pursued their march and on the last day of the year in a season when the waters of the Rhine were most probably frozen they entered without opposition the defenceless provinces of Gaul This memorable passage of the Suevi the Vandals the Alani and the Burgundians who never afterwards retreated may be considered as the fall of the Roman empire in the countries beyond the Alps and the barriers which had so long separated the savage and the civilized nations of the earth were from that fatal moment levelled with the ground eighty eight Footnote eighty seven Provincia missos Expellet citius fasces quam Francia reges Quos

the Franks and the neutrality of the Alemanni the subjects of Rome unconscious of their approaching calamities enjoyed the state of quiet and prosperity which had seldom blessed the frontiers of Gaul Their flocks and herds were permitted to graze in the pastures of the Barbarians their huntsmen penetrated without fear or danger into the darkest recesses of the Hercynian wood eighty nine The banks of the Rhine were crowned like those of the Tyber with elegant houses and well cultivated farms and if a poet descended the river he might express his doubt on which side was situated the territory of the Romans ninety This scene of peace and plenty was suddenly changed into a desert and the prospect of the smoking ruins could alone distinguish the solitude of nature from the desolation of man The flourishing city of Mentz was surprised and destroyed and many thousand Christians were inhumanly massacred in the church Worms perished after a long and obstinate siege Strasburgh Spires Rheims Tournay Arras Amiens experienced the cruel oppression of the German yoke and the consuming flames of war spread from the banks of the Rhine over the greatest part of the seventeen provinces of Gaul That rich and extensive country as far as the ocean the Alps and the Pyrenees was delivered to the Barbarians who drove before them in a promiscuous crowd the bishop the senator and the virgin laden with the spoils of their houses and altars ninety one The ecclesiastics to whom we are indebted for this vague description of the public calamities embraced the opportunity of exhorting the Christians to repent of the sins which had provoked the Divine Justice and to renounce the perishable goods of a wretched and deceitful world But as the Pelagian controversy ninety two which attempts to sound the abyss of grace and predestination soon became the serious employment of the Latin clergy the Providence which had decreed or foreseen or permitted such a train of moral and natural evils was rashly weighed in the imperfect and fallacious balance of reason The crimes and the misfortunes of the suffering people were presumptuously compared with those of their ancestors and they arraigned the Divine Justice which did not exempt from the common destruction the feeble the guiltless the infant portion of the human species These idle disputants overlooked the invariable laws of nature which have connected peace with innocence plenty with industry and safety with valor The timid and selfish policy of the court of Ravenna might recall the Palatine legions for the protection of Italy the remains of the stationary troops might be unequal to the arduous task and the Barbarian auxiliaries might prefer the unbounded license of spoil to the benefits of a moderate and regular stipend But the provinces of Gaul were filled with a numerous race of hardy and robust youth who in the defence of their houses their families and their altars if they had dared to die would have deserved to vanquish The knowledge of their native country would have enabled them to oppose continual and insuperable obstacles to the progress of an invader and the deficiency of the Barbarians in arms as well as in discipline removed the only pretence which excuses the submission of a populous country to the inferior numbers of a veteran army When France was invaded by Charles V he inquired of a prisoner how many days Paris might be distant from the frontier Perhaps twelve but they will be days of battle ninety three such was the gallant answer which checked the arrogance of that ambitious prince The

Guillaume du Bellay l vi In French the original reproof is less obvious and more pointed from the double sense of the word journee which alike signifies a day s travel or a battle In the early part of the reign of Honorius the vigilance of Stilicho had successfully guarded the remote island of Britain from her incessant enemies of the ocean the mountains and the Irish coast ninety four But those restless Barbarians could not neglect the fair opportunity of the Gothic war when the walls and stations of the province were stripped of the Roman troops If any of the legionaries were permitted to return from the Italian expedition their faithful report of the court and character of Honorius must have tended to dissolve the bonds of allegiance and to exasperate the seditious temper of the British army The spirit of revolt which had formerly disturbed the age of Gallienus was revived by the capricious violence of the soldiers and the unfortunate perhaps the ambitious candidates who were the objects of their choice were the instruments and at length the victims of their passion ninety five Marcus was the first whom they placed on the throne as the lawful emperor of Britain and of the West They violated by the hasty murder of Marcus the oath of fidelity which they had imposed on themselves and their disapprobation of his manners may seem to inscribe an honorable epitaph on his tomb Gratian was the next whom they adorned with the diadem and the purple and at the end of four months Gratian experienced the fate of his predecessor The memory of the great Constantine whom the British legions had given to the church and to the empire suggested the singular motive of their third choice They discovered in the ranks a private soldier of the name of Constantine and their impetuous levity had already seated him on the throne before they perceived his incapacity to sustain the weight of that glorious appellation ninety six Yet the authority of Constantine was less precarious and his government was more successful than the transient reigns of Marcus and of Gratian The danger of leaving his inactive troops in those camps which had been twice polluted with blood and sedition urged him to attempt the reduction of the Western provinces He landed at Boulogne with an inconsiderable force and after he had reposed himself some days he summoned the cities of Gaul which had escaped the yoke of the Barbarians to acknowledge their lawful sovereign They obeyed the summons without reluctance The neglect of the court of Ravenna had absolved a deserted people from the duty of allegiance their actual distress encouraged them to accept any circumstances of change without apprehension and perhaps with some degree of hope and they might flatter themselves that the troops the authority and even the name of a Roman emperor who fixed his residence in Gaul would protect the unhappy country from the rage of the Barbarians The first successes of Constantine against the detached parties of the Germans were magnified by the voice of adulation into splendid and decisive victories which the reunion and insolence of the enemy soon reduced to their just value His negotiations procured a short and precarious truce and if some tribes of the Barbarians were engaged by the liberality of his gifts and promises to undertake the defence of the Rhine these expensive and uncertain treaties instead of restoring the pristine vigor of the Gallic frontier served only to disgrace the majesty of the prince and to exhaust what yet remained of the treasures of the republic Elated however with this imaginary triumph the vain deliverer of Gaul advanced into the provinces of the South to encounter a more pressing and personal danger Sarus the Goth was ordered to lay the head of the rebel at the feet of the emperor Honorius and the forces of Britain and Italy were unworthily consumed in this domestic quarrel After the loss of his two bravest generals Justinian and Nevigastes the former of whom was slain in the field of battle the latter in a peaceful but treacherous interview Constantine fortified himself within the walls of Vienna The place was ineffectually attacked seven days and the Imperial army supported in a precipitate retreat the ignominy of purchasing a secure passage from the freebooters and outlaws of the Alps ninety seven Those mountains now separated the dominions of two rival monarchs and the fortifications of the double frontier were guarded by the troops of the empire whose arms would have been more usefully employed to maintain the Roman

again Chapter XXX Revolt Of The Goths Part V On the side of the Pyrenees the ambition of Constantine might be justified by the proximity of danger but his throne was soon established by the conquest or rather submission of Spain which yielded to the influence of regular and habitual subordination and received the laws and magistrates of the Gallic praefecture The only opposition which was made to the authority of Constantine proceeded not so much from the powers of government or the spirit of the people as from the private zeal and interest of the family of Theodosius Four brothers ninety eight had obtained by the favor of their kinsman the deceased emperor an honorable rank and ample possessions in their native country and the grateful youths resolved to risk those advantages in the service of his son After an unsuccessful effort to maintain their ground at the head of the stationary troops of Lusitania they retired to their estates where they armed and levied at their own expense a considerable body of slaves and dependants and boldly marched to occupy the strong posts of the Pyrenean Mountains This domestic insurrection alarmed and perplexed the sovereign of Gaul and Britain and he was compelled to negotiate with some troops of Barbarian auxiliaries for the service of the Spanish war They were distinguished by the title of Honorians ninety nine a name which might have reminded them of their fidelity to their lawful sovereign and if it should candidly be allowed that the Scots were influenced by any partial affection for a British prince the Moors and the Marcomanni could be tempted only by the profuse liberality of the usurper who distributed among the Barbarians the military and even the civil honors of Spain The nine bands of Honorians which may be easily traced on the establishment of the Western empire could not exceed the number of five thousand men yet this inconsiderable force was sufficient to terminate a war which had threatened the power and safety of Constantine The rustic army of the Theodosian family was surrounded and destroyed in the Pyrenees two of the brothers had the good fortune to escape by sea to Italy or the East the other two after an interval of suspense were executed at Arles and if Honorius could remain insensible of the public disgrace he might perhaps be affected by the personal misfortunes of his generous kinsmen Such were the feeble arms which decided the possession of the Western provinces of Europe from the wall of Antoninus to the columns of Hercules The events of peace and war have undoubtedly been diminished by the narrow and imperfect view of the historians of the times who were equally ignorant of the causes and of the effects of the most important revolutions But the total decay of the national strength had annihilated even the last resource of a despotic government and the revenue of exhausted provinces could no longer purchase the military service of a discontented and pusillanimous people Footnote ninety eight Verinianus Didymus Theodosius and Lagodius who in modern courts would be styled princes of the blood were not distinguished by any rank or privileges above

Barbarians which was almost exterminated by war famine and disease one hundred In the course of this unfortunate expedition the king of the Goths must indeed have sustained a considerable loss and his harassed forces required an interval of repose to recruit their numbers and revive their confidence Adversity had exercised and displayed the genius of Alaric and the fame of his valor invited to the Gothic standard the bravest of the Barbarian warriors who from the Euxine to the Rhine were agitated by the desire of rapine and conquest He had deserved the esteem and he soon accepted the friendship of Stilicho himself Renouncing the service of the emperor of the East Alaric concluded with the court of Ravenna a treaty of peace and alliance by which he was declared master general of the Roman armies throughout the praefecture of Illyricum as it was claimed according to the true and ancient limits by the minister of Honorius one hundred one The execution of the ambitious design which was either stipulated or implied in the articles of the treaty appears to have been suspended by the formidable irruption of Radagaisus and the neutrality of the Gothic king may perhaps be compared to the indifference of Caesar who in the conspiracy of Catiline refused either to assist or to oppose the enemy of the republic After the defeat of the Vandals Stilicho resumed his pretensions to the provinces of the East appointed civil magistrates for the administration of justice and of the finances and declared his impatience to lead to the gates of Constantinople the united armies of the Romans and of the Goths The prudence however of Stilicho his aversion to civil war and his perfect knowledge of the weakness of the state may countenance the suspicion that domestic peace rather than foreign conquest was the object of his policy and that his principal care was to employ the forces of Alaric at a distance from Italy This design could not long escape the penetration of the Gothic king who continued to hold a doubtful and perhaps a treacherous correspondence with the rival courts who protracted like a dissatisfied mercenary his languid operations in Thessaly and Epirus and who soon returned to claim the extravagant reward of his ineffectual services From his camp near Aemona one hundred two on the confines of Italy he transmitted to the emperor of the West a long account of promises of expenses and of demands called for immediate satisfaction and clearly intimated the consequences of a refusal Yet if his conduct was hostile his language was decent and dutiful He humbly professed himself the friend of Stilicho and the soldier of Honorius offered his person and his troops to march without delay against the usurper of Gaul and solicited as a permanent retreat for the

speeches or in tumultuary acclamations that it was unworthy of the majesty of Rome to purchase a precarious and disgraceful truce from a Barbarian king and that in the judgment of a magnanimous people the chance of ruin was always preferable to the certainty of dishonor The minister whose pacific intentions were seconded only by the voice of a few servile and venal followers attempted to allay the general ferment by an apology for his own conduct and even for the demands of the Gothic prince The payment of a subsidy which had excited the indignation of the Romans ought not such was the language of Stilicho to be considered in the odious light either of a tribute or of a ransom extorted by the menaces of a Barbarian enemy Alaric had faithfully asserted the just pretensions of the republic to the provinces which were usurped by the Greeks of Constantinople he modestly required the fair and stipulated recompense of his services and if he had desisted from the prosecution of his enterprise he had obeyed in his retreat the peremptory though private letters of the emperor himself These contradictory orders he would not dissemble the errors of his own family had been procured by the intercession of Serena The tender piety of his wife had been too deeply affected by the discord of the royal brothers the sons of her adopted father and the sentiments of nature had too easily prevailed over the stern dictates of the public welfare These ostensible reasons which faintly disguise the obscure intrigues of the palace of Ravenna were supported by the authority of Stilicho and obtained after a warm debate the reluctant approbation of the senate The tumult of virtue and freedom subsided and the sum of four thousand pounds of gold was granted under the name of a subsidy to secure the peace of Italy and to conciliate the friendship of the king of the Goths Lampadius alone one of the most illustrious members of the assembly still persisted in his dissent exclaimed with a loud voice This is not a treaty of peace but of servitude one hundred three and escaped the danger of such bold opposition by immediately retiring to the sanctuary of a Christian church See Palace Of The Caesars Footnote one hundred three Zosimus l v p three hundred thirty eight three hundred thirty nine He repeats the words of Lampadius as they were spoke in Latin Non est ista pax sed pactio servi tutis and then translates them into Greek for the benefit of his readers Note From Cicero s XIIth Philippic fourteen M But the reign of Stilicho drew towards its end and the proud minister might perceive the symptoms of his approaching disgrace The generous boldness of Lampadius had been applauded and the senate so patiently resigned to a long servitude rejected with disdain the offer of invidious and imaginary freedom The troops who still assumed the name and prerogatives of the Roman legions were exasperated by the partial affection of Stilicho for the Barbarians and the people imputed to the mischievous policy of the minister the public misfortunes which were the natural consequence of their own degeneracy Yet Stilicho might have continued to brave the clamors of the people and even of the soldiers if he could have maintained his dominion over the feeble mind of his pupil But the respectful attachment of Honorius was converted into fear suspicion and hatred The crafty Olympius one hundred four who concealed his vices under the mask of Christian piety had secretly undermined the benefactor by whose favor he was promoted to the honorable offices of the Imperial palace Olympius revealed to the unsuspecting emperor who had attained the twenty fifth year of his age that he was without weight or authority in his own government and artfully alarmed his timid and indolent disposition by a lively picture of the designs of Stilicho who already meditated the death of his sovereign with the ambitious hope of placing the diadem on the head of his son Eucherius The emperor was instigated by his new favorite to assume the tone of independent dignity and the minister was astonished to find that secret resolutions were formed in the court and council which were repugnant to his interest or to his intentions Instead of residing in the palace of Rome Honorius declared that it was his pleasure to return to the secure fortress of Ravenna On the first intelligence of the death of his brother Arcadius he prepared to visit Constantinople and to regulate with the authority of a guardian the provinces of the infant Theodosius one hundred five The representation of the difficulty and expense of such a distant expedition checked this strange and sudden sally of active diligence but the dangerous project of showing the emperor to the camp of Pavia which was composed of the Roman troops the enemies of Stilicho and his Barbarian auxiliaries remained fixed and unalterable The minister was pressed by the advice of his confidant Justinian a Roman advocate of a lively and penetrating genius to oppose a journey so prejudicial to his reputation and safety His strenuous but ineffectual efforts confirmed the triumph of Olympius and the prudent lawyer withdrew himself from the impending ruin of his patron Footnote one hundred four He came from the coast of the Euxine and exercised a splendid office His actions justify his character which Zosimus l v p three hundred forty exposes with visible satisfaction Augustin revered the piety of Olympius whom he styles a true son of the church Baronius Annal Eccles Eccles A D four hundred

ignorance as from adulation Footnote one hundred five Zosimus l v p three hundred thirty eight three hundred thirty nine Sozomen l ix c four Stilicho offered to undertake the journey to Constantinople that he might divert Honorius from the vain attempt The Eastern empire would not have obeyed and could not have been conquered In the passage of the emperor through Bologna a mutiny of the guards was excited and appeased by the secret policy of Stilicho who announced his instructions to decimate the guilty and ascribed to his own intercession the merit of their pardon After this tumult Honorius embraced for the last time the minister whom he now considered as a tyrant and proceeded on his way to the camp of Pavia where he was received by the loyal acclamations of the troops who were assembled for the service of the Gallic war On the morning of the fourth day he pronounced as he had been taught a military oration in the presence of the soldiers whom the charitable visits and artful discourses of Olympius had prepared to execute a dark and bloody conspiracy At the first signal they massacred the friends of Stilicho the most illustrious officers of the empire two Praetorian praefects of Gaul and of Italy two masters general of the cavalry and infantry the master of the offices the quaestor the treasurer and the count of the domestics Many lives were lost many houses were plundered the furious sedition continued to rage till the close of the evening and the trembling emperor who was seen in the streets of Pavia without his robes or diadem yielded to the persuasions of his favorite condemned the memory of the slain and solemnly approved the innocence and fidelity of their assassins The intelligence of the massacre of Pavia filled the mind of Stilicho with just and gloomy apprehensions and he instantly summoned in the camp of Bologna a council of the confederate leaders who were attached to his service and would be involved in his ruin The impetuous voice of the assembly called aloud for arms and for revenge to march without a moment s delay under the banners of a hero whom they had so often followed to victory to surprise to oppress to extirpate the guilty Olympius and his degenerate Romans and perhaps to fix the diadem on the head of their injured general Instead of executing a resolution which might have been justified by success Stilicho hesitated till he was irrecoverably lost He was still ignorant of the fate of the emperor he distrusted the fidelity of his own party and he viewed with horror the fatal consequences of arming a crowd of licentious Barbarians against the soldiers and people of Italy The confederates impatient of his timorous and doubtful delay hastily retired with fear and indignation At the hour of midnight Sarus a Gothic warrior renowned among the Barbarians themselves for his strength and valor suddenly invaded the camp of his benefactor plundered the baggage cut in pieces the faithful Huns who guarded his person and penetrated to the tent where the minister pensive and sleepless meditated on the dangers of his situation Stilicho escaped with difficulty from the sword of the Goths and after issuing a last and generous admonition to the cities of Italy to shut their gates against the Barbarians his confidence or his despair urged him to throw himself into Ravenna which was already in the absolute possession of his enemies Olympius who had assumed the dominion of Honorius was speedily informed that his rival had embraced as a suppliant the altar of the Christian church The base and cruel disposition of the hypocrite was incapable of pity or remorse but he piously affected to elude rather than to violate the privilege of the sanctuary Count Heraclian with a troop of soldiers appeared at the dawn of day before the gates of the church of Ravenna The bishop was satisfied by a solemn oath that the Imperial mandate only directed them to secure the person of Stilicho but as soon as the unfortunate minister had been tempted beyond the holy threshold he produced the warrant for his instant execution Stilicho supported with calm resignation the injurious names of traitor and parricide repressed the unseasonable zeal of his followers who were ready to attempt an ineffectual rescue and with a firmness not unworthy of the last of the Roman generals submitted his neck to the sword of Heraclian one hundred six Footnote one hundred six Zosimus l v p three hundred thirty six three hundred forty five has copiously though not clearly related the disgrace and death of Stilicho

afford supplemental hints The servile crowd of the palace who had so long adored the fortune of Stilicho affected to insult his fall and the most distant connection with the master general of the West which had so lately been a title to wealth and honors was studiously denied and rigorously punished His family united by a triple alliance with the family of Theodosius might envy the condition of the meanest peasant The flight of his son Eucherius was intercepted and the death of that innocent youth soon followed the divorce of Thermantia who filled the place of her sister Maria and who like Maria had remained a virgin in the Imperial bed one hundred seven The friends of Stilicho who had escaped the massacre of Pavia were persecuted by the implacable revenge of Olympius and the most exquisite cruelty was employed to extort the confession of a treasonable and sacrilegious conspiracy They died in silence their firmness justified the choice one hundred eight and perhaps absolved the innocence of their patron and the despotic power which could take his life without a trial and stigmatize his memory without a proof has no jurisdiction over the impartial suffrage of posterity one hundred nine The services of Stilicho are great and manifest his crimes as they are vaguely stated in the language of flattery and hatred are obscure at least and improbable About four months after his death an edict was published in the name of Honorius to restore the free communication of the two empires which had been so long interrupted by the public enemy one hundred ten The minister whose fame and fortune depended on the prosperity of the state was accused of betraying Italy to the Barbarians whom he repeatedly vanquished at Pollentia at Verona and before the walls of Florence His pretended design of placing the diadem on the head of his son Eucherius could not have been conducted without preparations or accomplices and the ambitious father would not surely have left the future emperor till the twentieth year of his age in the humble station of tribune of the notaries Even the religion of Stilicho was arraigned by the malice of his rival The seasonable and almost miraculous deliverance was devoutly celebrated by the applause of the clergy who asserted that the restoration of idols and the persecution of the church would have been the first measure of the reign of Eucherius The son of Stilicho however was educated in the bosom of Christianity which his father had uniformly professed and zealously supported one hundred eleven eleven eleven Serena had borrowed her magnificent necklace from the statue of Vesta one hundred twelve and the Pagans execrated the memory of the sacrilegious minister by whose order the Sibylline books the oracles of Rome had been committed to the flames one hundred thirteen The pride and power of Stilicho constituted his real guilt An honorable reluctance to shed the blood of his countrymen appears to have contributed to the success of his unworthy rival and it is the last humiliation of the character of Honorius that posterity has not condescended to reproach him with his base ingratitude to the guardian of his youth and the support of his empire Footnote one hundred seven Zosimus l v p three hundred thirty three The marriage of a Christian with two sisters scandalizes Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom v p five hundred

curiosity is excited by the celebrated name of the poet Claudian who enjoyed the favor of Stilicho and was overwhelmed in the ruin of his patron The titular offices of tribune and notary fixed his rank in the Imperial court he was indebted to the powerful intercession of Serena for his marriage with a very rich heiress of the province of Africa one hundred fourteen and the statute of Claudian erected in the forum of Trajan was a monument of the taste and liberality of the Roman senate one hundred fifteen After the praises of Stilicho became offensive and criminal Claudian was exposed to the enmity of a powerful and unforgiving courtier whom he had provoked by the insolence of wit He had compared in a lively epigram the opposite characters of two Praetorian praefects of Italy he contrasts the innocent repose of a philosopher who sometimes resigned the hours of business to slumber perhaps to study with the interesting diligence of a rapacious minister indefatigable in the pursuit of unjust or sacrilegious gain How happy continues Claudian how happy might it be for the people of Italy if Mallius could be constantly awake and if Hadrian would always sleep one hundred sixteen The repose of Mallius was not disturbed by this friendly and gentle admonition but the cruel vigilance of Hadrian watched the opportunity of revenge and easily obtained from the enemies of Stilicho the trifling sacrifice of an obnoxious poet The poet concealed himself however during the tumult of the revolution and consulting the dictates of prudence rather than of honor he addressed in the form of an epistle a suppliant and humble recantation to the offended praefect He deplores in mournful strains the fatal indiscretion into which he had been hurried by passion and folly submits to the imitation of his adversary the generous examples of the clemency of gods of heroes and of lions and expresses his hope that the magnanimity of Hadrian will not trample on a defenceless and contemptible foe already humbled by disgrace and poverty and deeply wounded by the exile the tortures and the death of his dearest friends one hundred seventeen Whatever might be the success of his prayer or the accidents of his future life the period of a few years levelled in the grave the minister and the poet but the name of Hadrian is almost sunk in oblivion while Claudian is read with pleasure in every country which has retained or acquired the knowledge of the Latin language If we fairly balance his merits and his defects we shall acknowledge that Claudian does not either satisfy or silence our reason It would not be easy to produce a passage that deserves the epithet of sublime or pathetic to select a verse that melts the heart or enlarges the imagination We should vainly seek in the poems of Claudian the happy invention and artificial conduct of an interesting fable or the just and lively representation of the characters and situations of real life For the service of his patron he published occasional panegyrics and invectives and the design of these slavish compositions encouraged his propensity to exceed the limits of truth and nature These imperfections however are compensated in some degree by the poetical virtues of Claudian He was endowed with the rare and precious talent of raising the meanest of adorning the most barren and of diversifying the most similar topics his coloring more especially in descriptive poetry is soft and splendid and he seldom fails to display and even to abuse the advantages of a cultivated understanding a copious fancy an easy and sometimes forcible expression and a perpetual flow of harmonious versification To these commendations independent of any accidents of time and place we must add the peculiar merit which Claudian derived from the unfavorable circumstances of his birth In the decline of arts and of empire a native of Egypt one hundred eighteen who had received the education of a Greek assumed in a mature age the familiar use and absolute command of the Latin language one hundred nineteen soared above the heads of his feeble contemporaries and placed himself after an interval of three hundred years among the poets of ancient Rome one hundred twenty Footnote one hundred fourteen At the nuptials of Orpheus a modest comparison all the parts of animated nature contributed their various gifts and the gods themselves enriched their favorite Claudian had neither flocks nor herds nor vines nor olives His wealthy bride was heiress to them all But he carried to Africa a recommendatory letter

excepting his Mythological poem on the rape of Proserpine are confined to temporary subjects and to the politics of his own eventful day yet excepting in one or two small and indifferent pieces manifestly written by a Christian and interpolated among his poems there is no allusion whatever to the great religious strife No one would know the existence of Christianity at that period of the world by reading the works of Claudian His panegyric and his satire preserve the same religious impartiality award their most lavish praise or their bitterest invective on Christian or Pagan he

Senate And People Rome Is Thrice Besieged And At Length Pillaged By The Goths Death Of Alaric The Goths Evacuate Italy Fall Of Constantine Gaul And Spain Are Occupied By The Barbarians Independence Of Britain The incapacity of a weak and distracted government may often assume the appearance and produce the effects of a treasonable correspondence with the public enemy If Alaric himself had been introduced into the council of Ravenna he would probably have advised the same measures which were actually pursued by the ministers of Honorius one The king of the Goths would have conspired perhaps with some reluctance to destroy the formidable adversary by whose arms in Italy as well as in Greece he had been twice overthrown Their active and interested hatred laboriously accomplished the disgrace and ruin of the great Stilicho The valor of Sarus his fame in arms and his personal or hereditary influence over the confederate Barbarians could recommend him only to the friends of their country who despised or detested the worthless characters of Turpilio Varanes and Vigilantius By the pressing instances of the new favorites these generals unworthy as they had shown themselves of the names of soldiers two were promoted to the command of the cavalry of the infantry and of the domestic troops The Gothic prince would have subscribed with pleasure the edict which the fanaticism of Olympius dictated to the simple and devout emperor Honorius excluded all persons who were adverse to the Catholic church from holding any office in the state obstinately rejected the service of all those who dissented from his religion and rashly disqualified many of his bravest and most skilful officers who adhered to the Pagan worship or who had imbibed the opinions of Arianism three These measures so advantageous to an enemy Alaric would have approved and might perhaps have suggested but it may seem doubtful whether the Barbarian would have promoted his interest at the expense of the inhuman and absurd cruelty which was perpetrated by the direction or at least with the connivance of the Imperial ministers The foreign auxiliaries who had been attached to the person of Stilicho lamented his death but the desire of revenge was checked by a natural apprehension for the safety of their wives and children who were detained as hostages in the strong cities of Italy where they had likewise deposited their most valuable effects At the same hour and as if by a common signal the cities of Italy were polluted by the same horrid scenes of universal massacre and pillage which involved in promiscuous destruction the families and fortunes of the Barbarians Exasperated by such an injury which might have awakened the tamest and most servile spirit they cast a look of indignation and hope towards the camp of Alaric and unanimously swore to pursue with just and implacable war the perfidious nation who had so basely violated the laws of hospitality By the imprudent conduct of the ministers of Honorius the republic lost the assistance and deserved the enmity of thirty thousand of her bravest soldiers and the weight of that formidable army which alone might have determined the event of the war was transferred from the scale of the Romans into that of the Goths Footnote one The series of events from the death of Stilicho to the arrival of Alaric before Rome can only be found in Zosimus l v p three hundred forty seven three hundred fifty Footnote two The expression of Zosimus is strong and lively sufficient to excite the contempt of the enemy Footnote

as in those of war the Gothic king maintained his superior ascendant over an enemy whose seeming changes proceeded from the total want of counsel and design From his camp on the confines of Italy Alaric attentively observed the revolutions of the palace watched the progress of faction and discontent disguised the hostile aspect of a Barbarian invader and assumed the more popular appearance of the friend and ally of the great Stilicho to whose virtues when they were no longer formidable he could pay a just tribute of sincere praise and regret The pressing invitation of the malecontents who urged the king of the Goths to invade Italy was enforced by a lively sense of his personal injuries and he might especially complain that the Imperial ministers still delayed and eluded the payment of the four thousand pounds of gold which had been granted by the Roman senate either to reward his services or to appease his fury His decent firmness was supported by an artful moderation which contributed to the success of his designs He required a fair and reasonable satisfaction but he gave the strongest assurances that as soon as he had obtained it he would immediately retire He refused to trust the faith of the Romans unless Aetius and Jason the sons of two great officers of state were sent as hostages to his camp but he offered to deliver in exchange several of the noblest youths of the Gothic nation The modesty of Alaric was interpreted by the ministers of Ravenna as a sure evidence of his weakness and fear They disdained either to negotiate a treaty or to assemble an army and with a rash confidence derived only from their ignorance of the extreme danger irretrievably wasted the decisive moments of peace and war While they expected in sullen silence that the Barbarians would evacuate the confines of Italy Alaric with bold and rapid marches passed the Alps and the Po hastily pillaged the cities of Aquileia Altinum Concordia and Cremona which yielded to his arms increased his forces by the accession of thirty thousand auxiliaries and without meeting a single enemy in the field advanced as far as the edge of the morass which protected the impregnable residence of the emperor of the West Instead of attempting the hopeless siege of Ravenna the prudent leader of the Goths proceeded to Rimini stretched his ravages along the sea coast of the Hadriatic and meditated the conquest of the ancient mistress of the world An Italian hermit whose zeal and sanctity were respected by the Barbarians themselves encountered the victorious monarch and boldly denounced the indignation of Heaven against the oppressors of the earth but the saint himself was confounded by the solemn asseveration of Alaric that he felt a secret and praeternatural impulse which directed and even compelled his march to the gates of Rome He felt that his genius and his fortune were equal to the most arduous enterprises and the enthusiasm which he communicated to the Goths insensibly removed the popular and almost superstitious reverence of the nations for the majesty of the Roman name His troops animated by the hopes of spoil followed the course of the Flaminian way occupied the unguarded passes of the Apennine four descended into the rich plains of Umbria and as they lay encamped on the banks of the Clitumnus might wantonly slaughter and devour the milk white oxen which had been so long reserved for the use of Roman triumphs five A lofty situation and a seasonable tempest of thunder and lightning preserved the little city of Narni but the king of the Goths despising the ignoble prey still advanced with unabated vigor and after he had passed through the stately arches adorned with the spoils of Barbaric victories he pitched his camp under the walls of Rome six Footnote four Addison see his Works vol ii p fifty four edit Baskerville has given a very picturesque description of the road through the Apennine The Goths were not at leisure to observe the

kings and of a people to whom the ambassador of Pyrrhus ascribed the inexhaustible resources of the Hydra eight Each of the senators in the time of the Punic war had accomplished his term of the military service either in a subordinate or a superior station and the decree which invested with temporary command all those who had been consuls or censors or dictators gave the republic the immediate assistance of many brave and experienced generals In the beginning of the war the Roman people consisted of two hundred and fifty thousand citizens of an age to bear arms nine Fifty thousand had already died in the defence of their country and the twenty three legions which were employed in the different camps of Italy Greece Sardinia Sicily and Spain required about one hundred thousand men But there still remained an equal number in Rome and the adjacent territory who were animated by the same intrepid courage and every citizen was trained from his earliest youth in the discipline and exercises of a soldier Hannibal was astonished by the constancy of the senate who without raising the siege of Capua or recalling their scattered forces expected his approach He encamped on the banks of the Anio at the distance of three miles from the city and he was soon informed that the ground on which he had pitched his tent was sold for an adequate price at a public auction nine hundred

faith in the other of national pride M Footnote ten Livy considers these two incidents as the effects only of chance and courage I suspect that they were both managed by the admirable policy of the senate From the time of the Punic war the uninterrupted succession of senators had preserved the name and image of the republic and the degenerate subjects of Honorius ambitiously derived their descent from the heroes who had repulsed the arms of Hannibal and subdued the nations of the earth The temporal honors which the devout Paula eleven inherited and despised are carefully recapitulated by Jerom the guide of her conscience and the historian of her life The genealogy of her father Rogatus which ascended as high as Agamemnon might seem to betray a Grecian origin but her mother Blaesilla numbered the Scipios Aemilius Paulus and the Gracchi in the list of her ancestors and Toxotius the husband of Paula deduced his royal lineage from Aeneas the father of the Julian line The vanity of the rich who desired to be noble was gratified by these lofty pretensions Encouraged by the applause of their parasites they easily imposed on the credulity of the vulgar and were countenanced in some measure by the custom of adopting the name of their patron which had always prevailed among the freedmen and clients of illustrious families Most of those families however attacked by so many causes of external violence or internal decay were gradually extirpated and it would be more reasonable to seek for a lineal descent of twenty generations among the mountains of the Alps or in the peaceful solitude of Apulia than on the theatre of Rome the seat of fortune of danger and of perpetual revolutions Under each successive reign and from every province of the empire

that between the battle of Actium and the reign of Vespasian the senate was gradually filled with new families from the Municipia and colonies of Italy In the time of Jerom and Claudian the senators unanimously yielded the preeminence to the Anician line and a slight view of their history will serve to appreciate the rank and antiquity of the noble families which contended only for the second place thirteen During the five first ages of the city the name of the Anicians was unknown they appear to have derived their origin from Praeneste and the ambition of those new citizens was long satisfied with the Plebeian honors of tribunes of the people fourteen One hundred and sixty eight years before the Christian aera the family was ennobled by the Praetorship of Anicius who gloriously terminated the Illyrian war by the conquest of the nation and the captivity of their king fifteen From the triumph of that general three consulships in distant periods mark the succession of the Anician name sixteen From the reign of Diocletian to the final extinction of the Western empire that name shone with a lustre which was not eclipsed in the public estimation by the majesty of the Imperial purple seventeen The several branches to whom it was communicated united by marriage or inheritance the wealth and titles of the Annian the Petronian and the Olybrian houses and in each generation the number of consulships was multiplied by an hereditary claim eighteen The Anician family excelled in faith and in riches they were the first of the Roman senate who embraced Christianity and it is probable that Anicius Julian who was afterwards consul and praefect of the city atoned for his attachment to the party of Maxentius by the readiness with which he accepted the religion of Constantine nineteen Their ample patrimony was increased by the industry of Probus the chief of the Anician family who shared with Gratian the honors of the consulship and exercised four times the high office of Praetorian praefect twenty His immense estates were scattered over the wide extent of the Roman world and though the public might suspect or disapprove the methods by which they had been acquired the generosity and magnificence of that fortunate statesman deserved the gratitude of his clients and the admiration of strangers twenty one Such was the respect entertained for his memory that the two sons of Probus in their earliest youth and at the request of the senate were associated in the consular dignity a memorable distinction without example in the annals of Rome twenty

palace were used as a proverbial expression of opulence and splendor twenty three but the nobles and senators of Rome aspired in due gradation to imitate that illustrious family The accurate description of the city which was composed in the Theodosian age enumerates one thousand seven hundred and eighty houses the residence of wealthy and honorable citizens twenty four Many of these stately mansions might almost excuse the exaggeration of the poet that Rome contained a multitude of palaces and that each palace was equal to a city since it included within its own precincts every thing which could be subservient either to use or luxury markets hippodromes temples fountains baths porticos shady groves and artificial aviaries twenty five The historian Olympiodorus who represents the state of Rome when it was besieged by the Goths twenty six continues to observe that several of the richest senators received from their estates an annual income of four thousand pounds of gold above one hundred and sixty thousand pounds sterling without computing the stated provision of corn and wine which had they been sold might have equalled in value one third of the money Compared to this immoderate wealth an ordinary revenue of a thousand or fifteen hundred pounds of gold might be considered as no more than adequate to the dignity of the senatorian rank which required many expenses of a public and ostentatious kind Several examples are recorded in the age of Honorius of vain and popular nobles who celebrated the year of their praetorship by a festival which lasted seven days and cost above one hundred thousand pounds sterling twenty seven The estates of the Roman senators which so far exceeded the proportion of modern wealth were not confined to the limits of Italy Their possessions extended far beyond the Ionian and Aegean Seas to the most distant provinces the city of Nicopolis which Augustus had founded as an eternal monument of the Actian victory was the property of the devout Paula twenty eight and it is observed by Seneca that the rivers which had divided hostile nations now flowed through the lands of private citizens twenty nine According to their temper and circumstances the estates of the Romans were either cultivated by the labor of their slaves or granted for a certain and stipulated rent to the industrious farmer The economical writers of antiquity strenuously recommend the former method wherever it may be practicable but if the object should be removed by its distance or magnitude from the immediate eye of the master they prefer the active care of an old hereditary tenant attached to the soil and interested in the produce to the mercenary administration of a negligent perhaps an unfaithful steward thirty Footnote twenty three

subject De Re Rustica l i c seven p four hundred eight edit Gesner Leipsig seventeen thirty five The opulent nobles of an immense capital who were never excited by the pursuit of military glory and seldom engaged in the occupations of civil government naturally resigned their leisure to the business and amusements of private life At Rome commerce was always held in contempt but the senators from the first age of the republic increased their patrimony and multiplied their clients by the lucrative practice of usury and the obselete laws were eluded or violated by the mutual inclinations and interest of both parties thirty one A considerable mass of treasure must always have existed at Rome either in the current coin of the empire or in the form of gold and silver plate and there were many sideboards in the time of Pliny which contained more solid silver than had been transported by Scipio from vanquished Carthage thirty two The greater part of the nobles who dissipated their fortunes in profuse luxury found themselves poor in the midst of wealth and idle in a constant round of dissipation Their desires were continually gratified by the labor of a thousand hands of the numerous train of their domestic slaves who were actuated by the fear of punishment and of the various professions of artificers and merchants who were more powerfully impelled by the hopes of gain The ancients were destitute of many of the conveniences of life which have been invented or improved by the progress of industry and the plenty of glass and linen has diffused more real comforts among the modern nations of Europe than the senators of Rome could derive from all the refinements of pompous or sensual luxury thirty three Their luxury and their manners have been the subject of minute and laborious disposition but as such inquiries would divert me too long from the design of the present work I shall produce an authentic state of Rome and its inhabitants which is more peculiarly applicable to the period of the Gothic invasion Ammianus Marcellinus who prudently chose the capital of the empire as the residence the best adapted to the historian of his own times has mixed with the narrative of public events a lively representation of the scenes with which he was familiarly conversant The judicious reader will not always approve of the asperity of censure the choice of circumstances or the style of expression he will perhaps detect the latent prejudices and personal resentments which soured the temper of Ammianus himself but he will surely observe with philosophic curiosity the interesting and original picture of the manners of Rome thirty four Footnote thirty one Valesius ad Ammian xiv six has proved from Chrysostom and Augustin that the senators were not allowed to lend money at usury Yet it appears from the Theodosian Code see Godefroy ad l ii tit xxxiii tom i p two hundred thirty two hundred eighty nine that they were permitted to take six percent or one half of the legal interest and what is more singular this permission was granted to the young senators Footnote thirty two Plin Hist Natur xxxiii fifty He states the silver at only four thousand three hundred eighty pounds which is increased by Livy xxx forty five to one hundred thousand twenty three the former seems too little for an opulent city the latter too much for any private sideboard Footnote thirty three The learned Arbuthnot Tables of Ancient Coins c p one hundred fifty three has observed with humor and I believe with truth that Augustus had neither glass to his windows nor a shirt to his back Under the lower empire the use of linen and glass became somewhat more common Note The discovery of glass in such common use at Pompeii spoils the argument of Arbuthnot See Sir W Gell Pompeiana twod ser p ninety eight M Footnote thirty four It is incumbent on me to explain the liberties which I have taken with the text of Ammianus one I have melted down into one piece the sixth chapter of the fourteenth and the fourth of the twenty eighth book two I have given order and connection to the confused mass of materials three I have softened some extravagant hyperbeles and pared away some superfluities of the original four I have developed some observations which were insinuated rather than expressed With these allowances my version will be found not literal indeed but faithful and exact The greatness of Rome such is the language of the historian was founded on the rare and almost incredible alliance of virtue and of fortune The long period of her infancy was employed in a laborious struggle against the tribes of Italy the neighbors and enemies of the rising city In the strength and ardor of youth she sustained the storms of war carried her victorious arms beyond the seas and the mountains and brought home triumphal laurels from every country of the globe At length verging towards old age and sometimes conquering by the terror only of her name she sought the blessings of ease and tranquillity The venerable city which had trampled on the necks of the fiercest nations and established a system of laws the perpetual guardians of justice and freedom was content like a wise and wealthy parent to devolve on the Caesars her favorite sons the care of governing her ample patrimony thirty five A secure and profound peace such as had been once enjoyed in the reign of Numa succeeded to the tumults of a republic while Rome was still adored as the queen of the earth and the subject nations still reverenced the name of the people and the majesty of the senate But this native splendor continues Ammianus is degraded and sullied by the conduct of some nobles who unmindful of their own dignity and of that of their country assume an unbounded license of vice and folly They contend with each other in the empty vanity of titles and surnames and curiously select or invent the most lofty and sonorous appellations Reburrus or Fabunius Pagonius or Tarasius thirty six which may impress the ears of the vulgar with astonishment and respect From a vain ambition of perpetuating their memory they affect to multiply their likeness in statues of bronze and marble nor are they satisfied unless those statues are covered with plates of gold an honorable distinction first granted to Acilius the consul after he had subdued by his arms and counsels the power of King Antiochus The ostentation of displaying of magnifying perhaps the rent roll of the estates which they possess in all the provinces from the rising to the setting sun provokes the just resentment of every man who recollects that their poor and invincible ancestors were not distinguished from the meanest of the soldiers by the delicacy of their food or the splendor of their apparel But the modern nobles measure their rank and consequence according to the loftiness of their chariots thirty seven and the weighty magnificence of their dress Their long robes of silk and purple float in the wind and as they are agitated by art or accident they occasionally discover the under garments the rich tunics embroidered with the figures of various animals thirty eight Followed by a train of fifty servants and tearing up the pavement they move along the streets with the same impetuous speed as if they travelled with post horses and the example of the senators is boldly imitated by the matrons and ladies whose covered carriages are continually driving round the immense space of the city and suburbs Whenever these persons of high distinction condescend to visit the public baths they assume on their entrance a tone of loud and insolent command and appropriate to their own use the conveniences which were designed for the Roman people If in these places of mixed and general resort they meet any of the infamous ministers of their pleasures they express their affection by a tender embrace while they proudly decline the salutations of their fellow citizens who are not permitted to aspire above the honor of kissing their hands or their knees As soon as they have indulged themselves in the refreshment of the bath they resume their rings and the other ensigns of their dignity select from their private wardrobe of the finest linen such as might suffice for a dozen persons the garments the most agreeable to their fancy and maintain till their departure the same haughty demeanor which perhaps might have been excused in the great Marcellus after the conquest of Syracuse Sometimes indeed these heroes undertake more arduous achievements they visit their estates in Italy and procure themselves by the toil of servile hands the amusements of the chase thirty nine If at any time but more especially on a hot day they have courage to sail in their painted galleys from the Lucrine Lake forty to their elegant villas on the seacoast of Puteoli and Cayeta forty one they compare their own expeditions to the marches of Caesar and Alexander Yet should a fly presume to settle on the silken folds of their gilded umbrellas should a sunbeam penetrate through some unguarded and imperceptible chink they deplore their intolerable hardships and lament in affected language that they were not born in the land of the Cimmerians forty two the regions of eternal darkness In these journeys into the country forty three the whole body of the household marches with their master In the same manner as the cavalry and infantry the heavy and the light armed troops the advanced guard and the rear are marshalled by the skill of their military leaders so the domestic officers who bear a rod as an ensign of authority distribute and arrange the numerous train of slaves and attendants The baggage and wardrobe move in the front and are immediately followed by a multitude of cooks and inferior ministers employed in the service of the kitchens and of the table The main body is composed of a promiscuous crowd of slaves increased by the accidental concourse of idle or dependent plebeians The rear is closed by the favorite band of eunuchs distributed from age to youth according to the order of seniority Their numbers and their deformity excite the horror of the indignant spectators who are ready to execrate the memory of Semiramis for the cruel art which she invented of frustrating the purposes of nature and of blasting in the bud the hopes of future generations In the exercise of domestic jurisdiction the nobles of Rome express an exquisite sensibility for any personal injury and a contemptuous indifference for the rest of the human species When they have called for warm water if a slave has been tardy in his obedience he is instantly chastised with three hundred lashes but should the same slave commit a wilful murder the master will mildly observe that he is a worthless fellow but that if he repeats the offence he shall not escape punishment Hospitality was formerly the virtue of the Romans and every stranger who could plead either merit or misfortune was relieved or rewarded by their generosity At present if a foreigner perhaps of no contemptible rank is introduced to one of the proud and wealthy senators he is welcomed indeed in the first audience with such warm professions and such kind inquiries that he retires enchanted with the affability of his illustrious friend and full of regret that he had so long delayed his journey to Rome the active seat of manners as well as of empire Secure of a favorable reception he repeats his visit the ensuing day and is mortified by the discovery that his person his name and his country are already forgotten If he still has resolution to persevere he is gradually numbered in the train of dependants and obtains the permission to pay his assiduous and unprofitable court to a haughty patron incapable of gratitude or friendship who scarcely deigns to remark his presence his departure or his return Whenever the rich prepare a solemn and popular entertainment forty four whenever they celebrate with profuse and pernicious luxury their private banquets the choice of the guests is the subject of anxious deliberation The modest the sober and the learned are seldom preferred and the nomenclators who are commonly swayed by interested motives have the address to insert in the list of invitations the obscure names of the most worthless of mankind But the frequent and familiar companions of the great are those parasites who practise the most useful of all arts the art of flattery who eagerly applaud each word and every action of their immortal patron gaze with rapture on his marble columns and variegated pavements and strenuously praise the pomp and elegance which he is taught to consider as a part of his personal merit At the Roman tables the birds the squirrels forty five or the fish which appear of an uncommon size are contemplated with curious attention a pair of scales is accurately applied to ascertain their real weight and while the more rational guests are disgusted by the vain and tedious repetition notaries are summoned to attest by an authentic record the truth of such a marvelous event Another method of introduction into the houses and society of the great is derived from the profession of gaming or as it is more politely styled of play The confederates are united by a strict and indissoluble bond of friendship or rather of conspiracy a superior degree of skill in the Tesserarian art which may be interpreted the game of dice and tables forty six is a sure road to wealth and reputation A master of that sublime science who in a supper or assembly is placed below a magistrate displays in his countenance the surprise and indignation which Cato might be supposed to feel when he was refused the praetorship by the votes of a capricious people The acquisition of knowledge seldom engages the curiosity of nobles who abhor the fatigue and disdain the advantages of study and the only books which they peruse are the Satires of Juvenal and the verbose and fabulous histories of Marius Maximus forty seven The libraries which they have inherited from their fathers are secluded like dreary sepulchres from the light of day forty eight But the costly instruments of the theatre flutes and enormous lyres and hydraulic organs are constructed for their use and the harmony of vocal and instrumental music is incessantly repeated in the palaces of Rome In those palaces sound is preferred to sense and the care of the body to that of the mind It is allowed as a salutary maxim that the light and frivolous suspicion of a contagious malady is of sufficient weight to excuse the visits of the most intimate friends and even the servants who are despatched to make the decent inquiries are not suffered to return home till they have undergone the ceremony of a previous ablution Yet this selfish and unmanly delicacy occasionally yields to the more imperious passion of avarice The prospect of gain will urge a rich and gouty senator as far as Spoleto every sentiment of arrogance and dignity is subdued by the hopes of an inheritance or even of a legacy and a wealthy childless citizen is the most powerful of the Romans The art of obtaining the signature of a favorable testament and sometimes of hastening the moment of its execution is perfectly understood and it has happened that in the same house though in different apartments a husband and a wife with the laudable design of overreaching each other have summoned their respective lawyers to declare at the same time their mutual but contradictory intentions The distress which follows and chastises extravagant luxury often reduces the great to the use of the most humiliating expedients When they desire to borrow they employ the base and supplicating style of the slave in the comedy but when they are called upon to pay they assume the royal and tragic declamation of the grandsons of Hercules If the demand is repeated they readily procure some trusty sycophant instructed to maintain a charge of poison or magic against the insolent creditor who is seldom released from prison till he has signed a discharge of the whole debt These vices which degrade the moral character of the Romans are mixed with a puerile superstition that disgraces their understanding They listen with confidence to the predictions of haruspices who pretend to read in the entrails of victims the signs of future greatness and prosperity and there are many who do not presume either to bathe or to dine or to appear in public till they have diligently consulted according to the rules of astrology the situation of Mercury and the aspect of the moon forty nine It is singular enough that this vain credulity may often be discovered among the profane sceptics who impiously doubt or deny the existence of a celestial power Footnote thirty five Claudian who seems to have read the history of Ammianus speaks of this great revolution in a much less courtly style Postquam jura ferox in se communia Caesar Transtulit et lapsi mores desuetaque priscis Artibus in gremium pacis servile recessi De Be Gildonico p forty nine Footnote thirty six The minute diligence of antiquarians has not been able to verify these extraordinary names I am of opinion that they were invented by the historian himself who was afraid of any personal satire or application It is certain however that the simple denominations of the Romans were gradually lengthened to the number of four five or even seven pompous surnames as for instance Marcus Maecius Maemmius Furius Balburius Caecilianus Placidus See Noris Cenotaph Piran Dissert iv p four hundred thirty eight Footnote thirty seven The or coaches of the romans were often of solid silver curiously carved and engraved and the trappings of the mules or horses were embossed with gold This magnificence continued from the reign of Nero to that of Honorius and the Appian way was covered with the

frequently mentioned in the epigrams of Martial and the satires of Juvenal See likewise Suetonius in Claud c twenty one in Neron c sixteen in Domitian c four seven These baskets of provisions were

Chapter XXXI Invasion Of Italy Occupation Of Territories By Barbarians Part II In populous cities which are the seat of commerce and manufactures the middle ranks of inhabitants who derive their subsistence from the dexterity or labor of their hands are commonly the most prolific the most useful and in that sense the most respectable part of the community But the plebeians of Rome who disdained such sedentary and servile arts had been oppressed from the earliest times by the weight of debt and usury and the husbandman during the term of his military service was obliged to abandon the cultivation of his farm fifty The lands of Italy which had been originally divided among the families of free and indigent proprietors were insensibly purchased or usurped by the avarice of the nobles and in the age which preceded the fall of the republic it was computed that only two thousand citizens were possessed of an independent substance fifty one Yet as long as the people bestowed by their suffrages the honors of the state the command of the legions and the administration of wealthy provinces their conscious pride alleviated in some measure the hardships of poverty and their wants were seasonably supplied by the ambitious liberality of the candidates who aspired to secure a venal majority in the thirty five tribes or the hundred and ninety three centuries of Rome But when the prodigal commons had not only imprudently alienated the use but the inheritance of power they sunk under the reign of the Caesars into a vile and wretched populace which must in a few generations have been totally extinguished if it had not been continually recruited by the manumission of slaves and the influx of strangers As early as the time of Hadrian it was the just complaint of the ingenuous natives that the capital had attracted the vices of the universe and the manners of the most opposite nations The intemperance of the Gauls the cunning and levity of the Greeks the savage obstinacy of the Egyptians and Jews the servile temper of the Asiatics and the dissolute effeminate prostitution of the Syrians were mingled in the various multitude which under the proud and false denomination of

capricious tumults of its inhabitants were indulged with impunity and the successors of Constantine instead of crushing the last remains of the democracy by the strong arm of military power embraced the mild policy of Augustus and studied to relieve the poverty and to amuse the idleness of an innumerable people fifty three I For the convenience of the lazy plebeians the monthly distributions of corn were converted into a daily allowance of bread a great number of ovens were constructed and maintained at the public expense and at the appointed hour each citizen who was furnished with a ticket ascended the flight of steps which had been assigned to his peculiar quarter or division and received either as a gift or at a very low price a loaf of bread of the weight of three pounds for the use of his family II The forest of Lucania whose acorns fattened large droves of wild hogs fifty four afforded as a species of tribute a plentiful supply of cheap and wholesome meat During five months of the year a regular allowance of bacon was distributed to the poorer citizens and the annual consumption of the capital at a time when it was much declined from its former lustre was ascertained by an

the bath and the annual tax which was imposed on Africa for the benefit of Rome amounted to the weight of three millions of pounds to the measure perhaps of three hundred thousand English gallons IV The anxiety of Augustus to provide the metropolis with sufficient plenty of corn was not extended beyond that necessary article of human subsistence and when the popular clamor accused the dearness and scarcity of wine a proclamation was issued by the grave reformer to remind his subjects that no man could reasonably complain of thirst since the aqueducts of Agrippa had introduced into the city so many copious streams of pure and salubrious water fifty six This rigid sobriety was insensibly relaxed and although the generous design of Aurelian fifty seven does not appear to have been executed in its full extent the use of wine was allowed on very easy and liberal terms The administration of the public cellars was delegated to a magistrate of honorable rank and a considerable part of the vintage of Campania was reserved for the fortunate inhabitants of Rome Footnote fifty three Almost all that is said of the bread bacon oil wine c may be found in the fourteenth book of the Theodosian

service of the senators and the people contained above sixteen hundred seats of marble and more than three thousand were reckoned in the baths of Diocletian fifty eight The walls of the lofty apartments were covered with curious mosaics that imitated the art of the pencil in the elegance of design and the variety of colors The Egyptian granite was beautifully encrusted with the precious green marble of Numidia the perpetual stream of hot water was poured into the capacious basins through so many wide mouths of bright and massy silver and the meanest Roman could purchase with a small copper coin the daily enjoyment of a scene of pomp and luxury which might excite the envy of the kings of Asia fifty nine From these stately palaces issued a swarm of dirty and ragged plebeians without shoes and without a mantle who loitered away whole days in the street of Forum to hear news and to hold disputes who dissipated in extravagant gaming the miserable pittance of their wives and children and spent the hours of the night in the obscure taverns and brothels in the indulgence of gross and vulgar sensuality sixty Footnote fifty eight Olympiodor apud Phot p one hundred ninety

and l xxviii c four after describing the luxury and pride of the nobles of Rome exposes with equal indignation the vices and follies of the common people But the most lively and splendid amusement of the idle multitude depended on the frequent exhibition of public games and spectacles The piety of Christian princes had suppressed the inhuman combats of gladiators but the Roman people still considered the Circus as their home their temple and the seat of the republic The impatient crowd rushed at the dawn of day to secure their places and there were many who passed a sleepless and anxious night in the adjacent porticos From the morning to the evening careless of the sun or of the rain the spectators who sometimes amounted to the number of four hundred thousand remained in eager attention their eyes fixed on the horses and charioteers their minds agitated with hope and fear for the success of the colors which they espoused and the happiness of Rome appeared to hang on the event of a race sixty one The same immoderate ardor inspired their clamors and their applause as often as they were entertained with the hunting of wild beasts and the various modes of theatrical representation These representations in modern capitals may deserve to be considered as a pure and elegant school of taste and perhaps of virtue But the Tragic and Comic Muse of the Romans who seldom aspired beyond the imitation of Attic genius sixty two had been almost totally silent since the fall of the republic sixty three and their place was unworthily occupied by licentious farce effeminate music and splendid pageantry The pantomimes sixty four who maintained their reputation from the age of Augustus to the sixth century expressed without the use of words the various fables of the gods and heroes of antiquity and the perfection of their art which sometimes disarmed the gravity of the philosopher always excited the applause and wonder of the people The vast and magnificent theatres of Rome were filled by three thousand female dancers and by three thousand singers with the masters of the respective choruses Such was the popular favor which they enjoyed that in a time of scarcity when all strangers were banished from the city the merit of contributing to the public pleasures exempted them from a law which was strictly executed against the professors of the liberal arts sixty

but whose only occupation was to curl and dress their hair and jactari volubilibus gyris dum experimunt innumera simulacra quae finxere fabulae theatrales It is said that the foolish curiosity of Elagabalus attempted to discover from the quantity of spiders webs the number of the inhabitants of Rome A more rational method of inquiry might not have been undeserving of the attention of the wisest princes who could easily have resolved a question so important for the Roman government and so interesting to succeeding ages The births and deaths of the citizens were duly registered and if any writer of antiquity had condescended to mention the annual amount or the common average we might now produce some satisfactory calculation which would destroy the extravagant assertions of critics and perhaps confirm the modest and probable conjectures of philosophers sixty six The most diligent researches have collected only the following circumstances which slight and imperfect as they are may tend in some degree to illustrate the question of the populousness of ancient Rome I When the capital of the empire was besieged by the Goths the circuit of the walls was accurately measured by Ammonius the mathematician who found it equal to twenty one miles sixty seven It should not be forgotten that the form of the city was almost that of a circle the geometrical figure which is known to contain the largest space within any given circumference II The architect Vitruvius who flourished in the Augustan age and whose evidence on this occasion has peculiar weight and authority observes that the innumerable habitations of the Roman people would have spread themselves far beyond the narrow limits of the city and that the want of ground which was probably contracted on every side by gardens and villas suggested the common though inconvenient practice of raising the houses to a considerable height in the air sixty eight But the loftiness of these buildings which often consisted of hasty work and insufficient materials was the cause of frequent and fatal accidents and it was repeatedly enacted by Augustus as well as by Nero that the height of private edifices within the walls of Rome should not exceed the measure of seventy feet from the ground sixty nine III Juvenal seventy laments as it should seem from his own experience the hardships of the poorer citizens to whom he addresses the salutary advice of emigrating without delay from the smoke of Rome since they might purchase in the little towns of Italy a cheerful commodious dwelling at the same price which they annually paid for a dark and miserable lodging House rent was therefore immoderately dear the rich acquired at an enormous expense the ground which they covered with palaces and gardens but the body of the Roman people was crowded into a narrow space and the different floors and apartments of the same house were divided as it is still the custom of Paris and other cities among several families of plebeians IV The total number of houses in the fourteen regions of the city is accurately stated in the description of Rome composed under the reign of Theodosius and they amount to forty eight thousand three hundred and eighty two seventy one The two classes of domus and of insuloe into which they are divided include all the habitations of the capital of every rank and condition from the marble palace of the Anicii with a numerous establishment of freedmen and slaves to the lofty and narrow lodging house where the poet Codrus and his wife were permitted to hire a wretched garret immediately under the files If we adopt the same average which under similar circumstances has been found applicable to Paris seventy two and indifferently allow about twenty five persons for each house of every degree we may fairly estimate the inhabitants of Rome at twelve hundred thousand a number which cannot be thought excessive for the capital of a mighty empire though it exceeds the populousness of the greatest cities of modern Europe seventy three seven thousand three hundred eleven Footnote sixty six Lipsius tom iii p four hundred twenty three de Magnitud Romana l iii c three

which M Brotier the last editor of Tacitus tom ii p three hundred eighty has assumed from similar principles though he seems to aim at a degree of precision which it is neither possible nor important to obtain Footnote seven thousand three hundred eleven M Dureau de la Malle Economic Politique des Romaines t i p three hundred sixty nine quotes a passage from the xvth chapter of Gibbon in which he estimates the population of Rome at not less than a million and adds omitting any reference to this passage that he Gibbon could not have seriously studied the question M Dureau de la Malle proceeds to argue that Rome as contained within the walls of Servius Tullius occupying an area only one fifth of that of Paris could not have contained three hundred thousand inhabitants within those of Aurelian not more than five hundred sixty thousand inclusive of soldiers and strangers The suburbs he endeavors to show both up to the time of Aurelian and after his reign were neither so extensive nor so populous as generally supposed M Dureau de la Malle has but imperfectly quoted the important passage of Dionysius that which proves that when he wrote in the time of Augustus the walls of Servius no longer marked the boundary of the city In many places they were so built upon that it was impossible to trace them There was no certain limit where the city ended and ceased to be the city it stretched out to so boundless an extent into the country Ant Rom iv thirteen None of M de la Malle s arguments appear to me to prove against this statement that these irregular suburbs did not extend so far in many parts as to make it impossible to calculate accurately the inhabited area of the city Though no doubt the city as reconstructed by Nero was much less closely built and with many more open spaces for palaces temples and other public edifices yet many passages seem to prove that the laws respecting the height of houses were not rigidly enforced A great part of the lower especially of the slave population were very densely crowded and lived even more than in our modern towns in cellars and subterranean dwellings under the public edifices Nor do M de la Malle s arguments by which he would explain the insulae insulae of which the Notitiae Urbis give us the number as rows of shops with a chamber or two within the domus or houses of the wealthy satisfy me as to their soundness of their scholarship Some passages which he adduces directly contradict his theory none as appears to me distinctly prove it I must adhere to the old interpretation of the word as chiefly dwellings for the middling or lower classes or clusters of tenements often perhaps under the same roof On this point Zumpt in the Dissertation before quoted entirely disagrees with M de la Malle Zumpt has likewise detected the mistake of M de la Malle as to the canon of corn mentioned in the life of Septimius Severus by Spartianus On this canon the French writer calculates the inhabitants of Rome at that time But the canon was not the whole supply of Rome but that quantity which the state required for the public granaries to supply the gratuitous distributions to the people and the public officers and slaves no doubt likewise to keep down the general price M Zumpt reckons the population of Rome at two million After careful consideration I should conceive the number in the text one million two hundred thousand to be nearest the truth M eighteen forty five Such was the state of Rome under the reign of Honorius at the time when the Gothic army formed the siege or rather the blockade of the city seventy four By a skilful disposition of his numerous forces who impatiently watched the moment of an assault Alaric encompassed the walls commanded the twelve principal gates intercepted all communication with the adjacent country and vigilantly guarded the navigation of the Tyber from which the Romans derived the surest and most plentiful supply of provisions The first emotions of the nobles and of the people were those of surprise and indignation that a vile Barbarian should dare to insult the capital of the world but their arrogance was soon humbled by misfortune and their unmanly rage instead of being directed against an enemy in arms was meanly exercised on a defenceless and innocent victim Perhaps in the person of Serena the Romans might have respected the niece of Theodosius the aunt nay even the adoptive mother of the reigning emperor but they abhorred the widow of Stilicho and they listened with credulous passion to the tale of calumny which accused her of maintaining a secret and criminal correspondence with the Gothic invader Actuated or overawed by the same popular frenzy the senate without requiring any evidence of his guilt pronounced the sentence of her death Serena was ignominiously strangled and the infatuated multitude were astonished to find that this cruel act of injustice did not immediately produce the retreat of the Barbarians and the deliverance of the city That unfortunate city gradually experienced the distress of scarcity and at length the horrid calamities of famine The daily allowance of three pounds of bread was reduced to one half to one third to nothing and the price of corn still continued to rise in a rapid and extravagant proportion The poorer citizens who were unable to purchase the necessaries of life solicited the precarious charity of the rich and for a while the public misery was alleviated by the humanity of Laeta the widow of the emperor Gratian who had fixed her residence at Rome and consecrated to the use of the indigent the princely revenue which she annually received from the grateful successors of her husband seventy five But these private and temporary donatives were insufficient to appease the hunger of a numerous people and the progress of famine invaded the marble palaces of the senators themselves The persons of both sexes who had been educated in the enjoyment of ease and luxury discovered how little is requisite to supply the demands of nature and lavished their unavailing treasures of gold and silver to obtain the coarse and scanty sustenance which they would formerly have rejected with disdain The food the most repugnant to sense or imagination the aliments the most unwholesome and pernicious to the constitution were eagerly devoured and fiercely disputed by the rage of hunger A dark suspicion was entertained that some desperate wretches fed on the bodies of their fellow creatures whom they had secretly murdered and even mothers such was the horrid conflict of the two most powerful instincts implanted by nature in the human breast even mothers are said to have tasted the flesh of their slaughtered infants seventy six Many thousands of the inhabitants of Rome expired in their houses or in the streets for want of sustenance and as the public sepulchres without the walls were in the power of the enemy the stench which arose from so many putrid and unburied carcasses infected the air and the miseries of famine were succeeded and aggravated by the contagion of a pestilential disease The assurances of speedy and effectual relief which were repeatedly transmitted from the court of Ravenna supported for some time the fainting resolution of the Romans till at length the despair of any human aid tempted them to accept the offers of a praeternatural deliverance Pompeianus praefect of the city had been persuaded by the art or fanaticism of some Tuscan diviners that by the mysterious force of spells and sacrifices they could extract the lightning from the clouds and point those celestial fires against the camp of the Barbarians seventy seven The important secret was communicated to Innocent the bishop of Rome and the successor of saint Peter is accused perhaps without foundation of preferring the safety of the republic to the rigid severity of the Christian worship But when the question was agitated in the senate when it was proposed as an essential condition that those sacrifices should be performed in the Capitol by the authority and in the presence of the magistrates the majority of that respectable assembly apprehensive either of the Divine or of the Imperial displeasure refused to join in an act which appeared almost equivalent to the public restoration of Paganism

hundred forty five is determined not to believe that a pope could be guilty of such impious condescension The last resource of the Romans was in the clemency or at least in the moderation of the king of the Goths The senate who in this emergency assumed the supreme powers of government appointed two ambassadors to negotiate with the enemy This important trust was delegated to Basilius a senator of Spanish extraction and already conspicuous in the administration of provinces and to John the first tribune of the notaries who was peculiarly qualified by his dexterity in business as well as by his former intimacy with the Gothic prince When they were introduced into his presence they declared perhaps in a more lofty style than became their abject condition that the Romans were resolved to maintain their dignity either in peace or war and that if Alaric refused them a fair and honorable capitulation he might sound his trumpets and prepare to give battle to an innumerable people exercised in arms and animated by despair The thicker the hay the easier it is mowed was the concise reply of the Barbarian and this rustic metaphor was accompanied by a loud and insulting laugh expressive of his contempt for the menaces of an unwarlike populace enervated by luxury before they were emaciated by famine He then condescended to fix the ransom which he would accept as the price of his retreat from the walls of Rome all the gold and silver in the city whether it were the property of the state or of individuals all the rich and precious movables and all the slaves that could prove their title to the name of Barbarians The ministers of the senate presumed to ask in a modest and suppliant tone If such O king are your demands what do you intend to leave us Your Lives replied the haughty conqueror they trembled and retired Yet before they retired a short suspension of arms was granted which allowed some time for a more temperate negotiation The stern features of Alaric were insensibly relaxed he abated much of the rigor of his terms and at length consented to raise the siege on the immediate payment of five thousand pounds of gold of thirty thousand pounds of silver of four thousand robes of silk of three thousand pieces of fine scarlet cloth and of three thousand pounds weight of pepper seventy nine But the public treasury was exhausted the annual rents of the great estates in Italy and the provinces had been exchanged during the famine for the vilest sustenance the hoards of secret wealth were still concealed by the obstinacy of avarice and some remains of consecrated spoils afforded the only resource that could avert the impending ruin of the city As soon as the Romans had satisfied the rapacious demands of Alaric they were restored in some measure to the enjoyment of peace and plenty Several of the gates were cautiously opened the importation of provisions from the river and the adjacent country was no longer obstructed by the Goths the citizens resorted in crowds to the free market which was held during three days in the suburbs and while the merchants who undertook this gainful trade made a considerable profit the future subsistence of the city was secured by the ample magazines which were deposited in the public and private granaries A more regular discipline than could have been expected was maintained in the camp of Alaric and the wise Barbarian justified his regard for the faith of treaties by the just severity with which he chastised a party of licentious Goths who had insulted some Roman citizens on the road to Ostia His army enriched by the contributions of the capital slowly advanced into the fair and fruitful province of Tuscany where he proposed to establish his winter quarters and the Gothic standard became the refuge of forty thousand Barbarian slaves who had broke their chains and aspired under the command of their great deliverer to revenge the injuries and the disgrace of their cruel servitude About the same time he received a more honorable reenforcement of Goths and Huns whom Adolphus eighty the brother of his wife had conducted at his pressing invitation from the banks of the Danube to those of the Tyber and who had cut their way with some difficulty and loss through the superior number of the Imperial troops A victorious leader who united the daring spirit of a Barbarian with the art and

additional circumstances are too few and trifling to require any other quotation Chapter XXXI Invasion Of Italy Occupation Of Territories By Barbarians Part III At the distance of fourteen centuries we may be satisfied with relating the military exploits of the conquerors of Rome without presuming to investigate the motives of their political conduct In the midst of his apparent prosperity Alaric was conscious perhaps of some secret weakness some internal defect or perhaps the moderation which he displayed was intended only to deceive and disarm the easy credulity of the ministers of Honorius The king of the Goths repeatedly declared that it was his desire to be considered as the friend of peace and of the Romans Three senators at his earnest request were sent ambassadors to the court of Ravenna to solicit the exchange of hostages and the conclusion of the treaty and the proposals which he more clearly expressed during the course of the negotiations could only inspire a doubt of his sincerity as they might seem inadequate to the state of his fortune The Barbarian still aspired to the rank of master general of the armies of the West he stipulated an annual subsidy of corn and money and he chose the provinces of Dalmatia Noricum and Venetia for the seat of his new kingdom which would have commanded the important communication between Italy and the Danube If these modest terms should be rejected Alaric showed a disposition to relinquish his pecuniary demands and even to content himself with the possession of Noricum an exhausted and impoverished country perpetually exposed to the inroads of the Barbarians of Germany eighty two But the hopes of peace were disappointed by the weak obstinacy or interested views of the minister Olympius Without listening to the salutary remonstrances of the senate he dismissed their ambassadors under the conduct of a military escort too numerous for a retinue of honor and too feeble for any army of defence Six thousand Dalmatians the flower of the Imperial legions were ordered to march from Ravenna to Rome through an open country which was occupied by the formidable myriads of the Barbarians These brave legionaries encompassed and betrayed fell a sacrifice to ministerial folly their general Valens with a hundred soldiers escaped from the field of battle and one of the ambassadors who could no longer claim the protection of the law of nations was obliged to purchase his freedom with a ransom of thirty thousand pieces of gold Yet Alaric instead of resenting this act of impotent hostility immediately renewed his proposals of peace and the second embassy of the Roman senate which derived weight and dignity from the presence of Innocent bishop of the city was guarded from the dangers of the road by a detachment of Gothic soldiers eighty three Footnote eighty two Zosimus l v p three hundred sixty seven three hundred sixty eight three hundred sixty nine Footnote eighty three Zosimus l v p three

Olympius eighty four might have continued to insult the just resentment of a people who loudly accused him as the author of the public calamities but his power was undermined by the secret intrigues of the palace The favorite eunuchs transferred the government of Honorius and the empire to Jovius the Praetorian praefect an unworthy servant who did not atone by the merit of personal attachment for the errors and misfortunes of his administration The exile or escape of the guilty Olympius reserved him for more vicissitudes of fortune he experienced the adventures of an obscure and wandering life he again rose to power he fell a second time into disgrace his ears were cut off he expired under the lash and his ignominious death afforded a grateful spectacle to the friends of Stilicho After the removal of Olympius whose character was deeply tainted with religious fanaticism the Pagans and heretics were delivered from the impolitic proscription which excluded them from the dignities of the state The brave Gennerid eighty five a soldier of Barbarian origin who still adhered to the worship of his ancestors had been obliged to lay aside the military belt and though he was repeatedly assured by the emperor himself that laws were not made for persons of his rank or merit he refused to accept any partial dispensation and persevered in honorable disgrace till he had extorted a general act of justice from the distress of the Roman government The conduct of Gennerid in the important station to which he was promoted or restored of master general of Dalmatia Pannonia Noricum and Rhaetia seemed to revive the discipline and spirit of the republic From a life of idleness and want his troops were soon habituated to severe exercise and plentiful subsistence and his private generosity often supplied the rewards which were denied by the avarice or poverty of the court of Ravenna The valor of Gennerid formidable to the adjacent Barbarians was the firmest bulwark of the Illyrian frontier and his vigilant care assisted the empire with a reenforcement of ten thousand Huns who arrived on the confines of Italy attended by such a convoy of provisions and such a numerous train of sheep and oxen as might have been sufficient not only for the march of an army but for the settlement of a colony But the court and councils of Honorius still remained a scene of weakness and distraction of corruption and anarchy Instigated by the praefect Jovius the guards rose in furious mutiny and demanded the heads of two generals and of the two principal eunuchs The generals under a perfidious promise of safety were sent on shipboard and privately executed while the favor of the eunuchs procured them a mild and secure exile at Milan and Constantinople Eusebius the eunuch and the Barbarian Allobich succeeded to the command of the bed chamber and of the guards and the mutual jealousy of these subordinate ministers was the cause of their mutual destruction By the insolent order of the count of the domestics the great chamberlain was shamefully beaten to death with sticks before the eyes of the astonished emperor and the subsequent assassination of Allobich in the midst of a public procession is the only circumstance of his life in which Honorius discovered the faintest symptom of courage or resentment Yet before they fell Eusebius and Allobich had contributed their part to the ruin of the empire by opposing the conclusion of a treaty which Jovius from a selfish and perhaps a criminal motive had negotiated with Alaric in a personal interview under the walls of Rimini During the absence of Jovius the emperor was persuaded to assume a lofty tone of inflexible dignity such as neither his situation nor his character could enable him to support and a letter signed with the name of Honorius was immediately despatched to the Praetorian praefect granting him a free permission to dispose of the public money but sternly refusing to prostitute the military honors of Rome to the proud demands of a Barbarian This letter was imprudently communicated to Alaric himself and the Goth who in the whole transaction had behaved with temper and decency expressed in the most outrageous language his lively sense of the insult so wantonly offered to his person and to his nation The conference of Rimini was hastily interrupted and the praefect Jovius on his return to Ravenna was compelled to adopt and even to encourage the fashionable opinions of the court By his advice and example the principal officers of the state and army were obliged to swear that without listening in any circumstances to any conditions of peace they would still persevere in perpetual and implacable war against the enemy of the republic This rash engagement opposed an insuperable bar to all future negotiation The ministers of Honorius were heard to declare that if they had only in voked the name of the Deity they would consult the public safety and trust their souls to the mercy of Heaven but they had sworn by the sacred head of the emperor himself they had sworn by the sacred head of the emperor himself they had touched in solemn ceremony that august seat of majesty and wisdom and the violation of their oath would exposethem to the temporal penalties of sacrilege and rebellion eighty six Footnote eighty four For the adventures of Olympius and his successors in the ministry

Caesars and Tertullian complains that it was the only oath which the Romans of his time affected to reverence See an elegant Dissertation of the Abbe Mossieu on the Oaths of the Ancients in the Mem de l Academie des Inscriptions tom i p two hundred eight two hundred nine While the emperor and his court enjoyed with sullen pride the security of the marches and fortifications of Ravenna they abandoned Rome almost without defence to the resentment of Alaric Yet such was the moderation which he still preserved or affected that as he moved with his army along the Flaminian way he successively despatched the bishops of the towns of Italy to reiterate his offers of peace and to congradulate the emperor that he would save the city and its inhabitants from hostile fire and the sword of the Barbarians eighty seven These impending calamities were however averted not indeed by the wisdom of Honorius but by the prudence or humanity of the Gothic king who employed a milder though not less effectual method of conquest Instead of assaulting the capital he successfully directed his efforts against the Port of Ostia one of the boldest and most stupendous works of Roman magnificence eighty eight The accidents to which the precarious subsistence of the city was continually exposed in a winter navigation and an open road had suggested to the genius of the first Caesar the useful design which was executed under the reign of Claudius The artificial moles which formed the narrow entrance advanced far into the sea and firmly repelled the fury of the waves while the largest vessels securely rode at anchor within three deep and capacious basins which received the northern branch of the Tyber about two miles from the ancient colony of Ostia eighty nine The Roman Port insensibly swelled to the size of an episcopal city ninety where the corn of Africa was deposited in spacious granaries for the use of the capital As soon as Alaric was in possession of that important place he summoned the city to surrender at discretion and his demands were enforced by the positive declaration that a refusal or even a delay should be instantly followed by the destruction of the magazines on which the life of the Roman people depended The clamors of that people and the terror of famine subdued the pride of the senate they listened without reluctance to the proposal of placing a new emperor on the throne of the unworthy Honorius and the suffrage of the Gothic conqueror bestowed the purple on Attalus praefect of the city The grateful monarch immediately acknowledged his protector as master general of the armies of the West Adolphus with the rank of count of the domestics obtained the custody of the person of Attalus and the two hostile nations seemed to be united

Gothic arms was conducted in tumultuous procession to the palace of Augustus and Trajan After he had distributed the civil and military dignities among his favorites and followers Attalus convened an assembly of the senate before whom in a format and florid speech he asserted his resolution of restoring the majesty of the republic and of uniting to the empire the provinces of Egypt and the East which had once acknowledged the sovereignty of Rome Such extravagant promises inspired every reasonable citizen with a just contempt for the character of an unwarlike usurper whose elevation was the deepest and most ignominious wound which the republic had yet sustained from the insolence of the Barbarians But the populace with their usual levity applauded the change of masters The public discontent was favorable to the rival of Honorius and the sectaries oppressed by his persecuting edicts expected some degree of countenance or at least of toleration from a prince who in his native country of Ionia had been educated in the Pagan superstition and who had since received the sacrament of baptism from the hands of an Arian bishop ninety two The first days of the reign of Attalus were fair and prosperous An officer of confidence was sent with an inconsiderable body of troops to secure the obedience of Africa the greatest part of Italy submitted to the terror of the Gothic powers and though the city of Bologna made a vigorous and effectual resistance the people of Milan dissatisfied perhaps with the absence of Honorius accepted with loud acclamations the choice of the Roman senate At the head of a formidable army Alaric conducted his royal captive almost to the gates of Ravenna and a solemn embassy of the principal ministers of Jovius the Praetorian praefect of Valens master of the cavalry and infantry of the quaestor Potamius and of Julian the first of the notaries was introduced with martial pomp into the Gothic camp In the name of their sovereign they consented to acknowledge the lawful election of his competitor and to divide the provinces of Italy and the West between the two emperors Their proposals were rejected with disdain and the refusal was aggravated by the insulting clemency of Attalus who condescended to promise that if Honorius would instantly resign the purple he should be permitted to pass the remainder of his life in the peaceful exile of some remote island ninety three So desperate indeed did the situation of the son of Theodosius appear to those who were the best acquainted with his strength and resources that Jovius and Valens his minister and his general betrayed their trust infamously deserted the sinking cause of their benefactor and devoted their treacherous allegiance to the service of his more fortunate rival Astonished by such examples of domestic treason Honorius trembled at the approach of every servant at the arrival of every messenger He dreaded the secret enemies who might lurk in his capital his palace his bed chamber and some ships lay ready in the harbor of Ravenna to transport the abdicated monarch to the dominions of his infant nephew the emperor of the East Footnote ninety two We may admit the evidence of Sozomen for the Arian baptism and that of Philostorgius for the Pagan education of Attalus The visible joy of Zosimus and the discontent which he imputes to the Anician family are very unfavorable to the Christianity of the new emperor Footnote ninety three He carried his insolence so far as to declare that he should mutilate Honorius before he sent him into exile But this assertion of Zosimus is destroyed by the more impartial testimony of Olympiodorus who attributes the ungenerous proposal which was absolutely rejected by Attalus to the baseness and perhaps the treachery of Jovius But there is a Providence such at least was the opinion of the historian Procopius ninety four that watches over innocence and folly and the pretensions of Honorius to its peculiar care cannot reasonably be disputed At the moment when his despair incapable of any wise or manly resolution meditated a shameful flight a seasonable reenforcement of four thousand veterans unexpectedly landed in the port of Ravenna To these valiant strangers whose fidelity had not been corrupted by the factions of the court he committed the walls and gates of the city and the slumbers of the emperor were no longer disturbed by the apprehension of imminent and internal danger The favorable intelligence which was received from Africa suddenly changed the opinions of men and the state of public affairs The troops and officers whom Attalus had sent into that province were defeated and slain and the active zeal of Heraclian maintained his own allegiance and that of his people The faithful count of Africa transmitted a large sum of money which fixed the attachment of the Imperial guards and his vigilance in preventing the exportation of corn and oil introduced famine tumult and discontent into the walls of Rome The failure of the African expedition was the source of mutual complaint and recrimination in the party of Attalus and the mind of his protector was insensibly alienated from the interest of a prince who wanted spirit to command or docility to obey The most imprudent measures were adopted without the knowledge or against the advice of Alaric and the obstinate refusal of the senate to allow in the embarkation the mixture even of five hundred Goths betrayed a suspicious and distrustful temper which in their situation was neither generous nor prudent The resentment of the Gothic king was exasperated by the malicious arts of Jovius who had been raised to the rank of patrician and who afterwards excused his double perfidy by declaring without a blush that he had only seemed to abandon the service of Honorius more effectually to ruin the cause of the usurper In a large plain near Rimini and in the presence of an innumerable multitude of Romans and Barbarians the wretched Attalus was publicly despoiled of the diadem and purple and those ensigns of royalty were sent by Alaric as the pledge of peace and friendship to the son of Theodosius ninety five The officers who returned to their duty were reinstated in their employments and even the merit of a tardy repentance was graciously allowed but the degraded emperor of the Romans desirous of life and insensible of disgrace implored the permission of following the Gothic camp in the train of a haughty and capricious Barbarian ninety six Footnote ninety four Procop de

degradation of Attalus removed the only real obstacle to the conclusion of the peace and Alaric advanced within three miles of Ravenna to press the irresolution of the Imperial ministers whose insolence soon returned with the return of fortune His indignation was kindled by the report that a rival chieftain that Sarus the personal enemy of Adolphus and the hereditary foe of the house of Balti had been received into the palace At the head of three hundred followers that fearless Barbarian immediately sallied from the gates of Ravenna surprised and cut in pieces a considerable body of Goths reentered the city in triumph and was permitted to insult his adversary by the voice of a herald who publicly declared that the guilt of Alaric had forever excluded him from the friendship and alliance of the emperor ninety seven The crime and folly of the court of Ravenna was expiated a third time by the calamities of Rome The king of the Goths who no longer dissembled his appetite for plunder and revenge appeared in arms under the walls of the capital and the trembling senate without any hopes of relief prepared by a desperate resistance to defray the ruin of their country But they were unable to guard against the secret conspiracy of their slaves and domestics who either from birth or interest were attached to the cause of the enemy At the hour of midnight the Salarian gate was silently opened and the inhabitants were awakened by the tremendous sound of the Gothic trumpet Eleven hundred and sixty three years after the foundation of Rome the Imperial city which had subdued and civilized so considerable a part of mankind was delivered to the licentious fury of the tribes of Germany and Scythia ninety eight Footnote ninety seven Zosimus l vi p three hundred eighty four Sozomen l ix c nine Philostorgius l xii c three In this place the text of Zosimus is mutilated and we have lost the remainder of his sixth and last book which ended with the sack of Rome Credulous and partial as he is we must take our leave of that historian with some regret Footnote ninety eight Adest Alaricus trepidam Romam obsidet turbat irrumpit Orosius l vii c thirty nine p five hundred seventy three He despatches this great event in seven words but he employs whole pages in celebrating the devotion of the Goths I have extracted from an improbable story of Procopius the circumstances which had an air of probability Procop de Bell Vandal l i c two He supposes that the city was surprised while the senators slept in the afternoon but Jerom with more authority and more reason affirms that it was in the night nocte Moab capta est nocte cecidit murus ejus tom i p one hundred twenty one ad Principiam The proclamation of Alaric when he forced his entrance into a vanquished city discovered however some regard for the laws of humanity and religion He encouraged his troops boldly to seize the rewards of valor and to enrich themselves with the spoils of a wealthy and effeminate people but he exhorted them at the same time to spare the lives of the unresisting citizens and to respect the churches of the apostles saint Peter and saint Paul as holy and inviolable sanctuaries Amidst the horrors of a nocturnal tumult several of the Christian Goths displayed the fervor of a recent conversion and some instances of their uncommon piety and moderation are related and perhaps adorned by the zeal of ecclesiastical writers ninety nine While the Barbarians roamed through the city in quest of prey the humble dwelling of an aged virgin who had devoted her life to the service of the altar was forced open by one of the powerful Goths He immediately demanded though in civil language all the gold and silver in her possession and was astonished at the readiness with which she conducted him to a splendid hoard of massy plate of the richest materials and the most curious workmanship The Barbarian viewed with wonder and delight this valuable acquisition till he was interrupted by a serious admonition addressed to him in the following words These said she are the consecrated vessels belonging to saint Peter if you presume to touch them the sacrilegious deed will remain on your conscience For my part I dare not keep what I am unable to defend The Gothic captain struck with reverential awe despatched a messenger to inform the king of the treasure which he had discovered and received a peremptory order from Alaric that all the consecrated plate and ornaments should be transported without damage or delay to the church of the apostle From the extremity perhaps of the Quirinal hill to the distant quarter of the Vatican a numerous detachment of Goths marching in order of battle through the principal streets protected with glittering arms the long train of their devout companions who bore aloft on their heads the sacred vessels of gold and silver and the martial shouts of the Barbarians were mingled with the sound of religious psalmody From all the adjacent houses a crowd of Christians hastened to join this edifying procession and a multitude of fugitives without distinction of age or rank or even of sect had the good fortune to escape to the secure and hospitable sanctuary of the Vatican The learned work concerning the City of God was professedly composed by saint Augustin to justify the ways of Providence in the destruction of the Roman greatness He celebrates with peculiar satisfaction this memorable triumph of Christ and insults his adversaries by challenging them to produce some similar example of a town taken by storm in which the fabulous gods of antiquity had been able to protect either themselves or their deluded votaries one hundred Footnote ninety nine Orosius l vii c thirty nine p five hundred seventy three five hundred seventy six applauds the piety of the Christian Goths without seeming to perceive that the greatest part of them were Arian heretics Jornandes c thirty p six hundred fifty three and Isidore of Seville Chron p four hundred seventeen edit Grot who were both attached to the Gothic cause have repeated and embellished these edifying tales According to Isidore Alaric himself was heard to say that he waged war with the Romans and not with the apostles Such was the style of the seventh century two hundred years before the fame and merit had been ascribed not to the apostles but to Christ Footnote one hundred See Augustin de Civitat Dei l i c one six He particularly appeals to the examples of Troy Syracuse and Tarentum In the sack of Rome some rare and extraordinary examples of Barbarian virtue have been deservedly applauded But the holy precincts of the Vatican and the apostolic churches could receive a very small proportion of the Roman people many thousand warriors more especially of the Huns who served under the standard of Alaric were strangers to the name or at least to the faith of Christ and we may suspect without any breach of charity or candor that in the hour of savage license when every passion was inflamed and every restraint was removed the precepts of the Gospel seldom influenced the behavior of the Gothic Christians The writers the best disposed to exaggerate their clemency have freely confessed that a cruel slaughter was made of the Romans one hundred one and that the streets of the city were filled with dead bodies which remained without burial during the general consternation The despair of the citizens was sometimes converted into fury and whenever the Barbarians were provoked by opposition they extended the promiscuous massacre to the feeble the innocent and the helpless The private revenge of forty thousand slaves was exercised without pity or remorse and the ignominious lashes which they had formerly received were washed away in the blood of the guilty or obnoxious families The matrons and virgins of Rome were exposed to injuries more dreadful in the apprehension of chastity than death itself and the ecclesiastical historian has selected an example of female virtue for the admiration of future ages one hundred two A Roman lady of singular beauty and orthodox faith had excited the impatient desires of a young Goth who according to the sagacious remark of Sozomen was attached to the Arian heresy Exasperated by her obstinate resistance he drew his sword and with the anger of a lover slightly wounded her neck The bleeding heroine still continued to brave his resentment and to repel his love till the ravisher desisted from his unavailing efforts respectfully conducted her to the sanctuary of the Vatican and gave six pieces of gold to the guards of the church on condition that they should restore her inviolate to the arms of her husband Such instances of courage and generosity were not extremely common The brutal soldiers satisfied their sensual appetites without consulting either the inclination or the duties of their female captives and a nice question of casuistry was seriously agitated Whether those tender victims who had inflexibly refused their consent to the violation which they sustained had lost by their misfortune the glorious crown of virginity one hundred three Their were other losses indeed of a more substantial kind and more general concern It cannot be presumed that all the Barbarians were at all times capable of perpetrating such amorous outrages and the want of youth or beauty or chastity protected the greatest part of the Roman women from the danger of a rape But avarice is an insatiate and universal passion since the enjoyment of almost every object that can afford pleasure to the different tastes and tempers of mankind may be procured by the possession of wealth In the pillage of Rome a just preference was given to gold and jewels which contain the greatest value in the smallest compass and weight but after these portable riches had been removed by the more diligent robbers the palaces of Rome were rudely stripped of their splendid and costly furniture The sideboards of massy plate and the variegated wardrobes of silk and purple were irregularly piled in the wagons that always followed the march of a Gothic army The most exquisite works of art were roughly handled or wantonly destroyed many a statue was melted for the sake of the precious materials and many a vase in the division of the spoil was shivered into fragments by the stroke of a battle axe The acquisition of riches served only to stimulate the avarice of the rapacious Barbarians who proceeded by threats by blows and by tortures to force from their prisoners the confession of hidden treasure one hundred four Visible splendor and expense were alleged as the proof of a plentiful fortune the appearance of poverty was imputed to a parsimonious disposition and the obstinacy of some misers who endured the most cruel torments before they would discover the secret object of their affection was fatal to many unhappy wretches who expired under the lash for refusing to reveal their imaginary treasures The edifices of Rome though the damage has been much exaggerated received some injury from the violence of the Goths At their entrance through the Salarian gate they fired the adjacent houses to guide their march and to distract the attention of the citizens the flames which encountered no obstacle in the disorder of the night consumed many private and public buildings and the ruins of the palace of Sallust one hundred five remained in the age of Justinian a stately monument of the Gothic conflagration one hundred six Yet a contemporary historian has observed that fire could scarcely consume the enormous beams of solid brass and that the strength of man was insufficient to subvert the foundations of ancient structures Some truth may possibly be concealed in his devout assertion that the wrath of Heaven supplied the imperfections of hostile rage and that the proud Forum of Rome decorated with the statues of so many gods and heroes was levelled in the dust by the stroke of lightning one hundred seven Footnote one hundred one Jerom tom i p one hundred twenty one ad Principiam has applied to the sack of Rome all the strong expressions of Virgil Quis cladem

violation and though he admires their spirit he is obliged by his theology to condemn their rash presumption Perhaps the good bishop of Hippo was too easy in the belief as well as too rigid in the censure of this act of female heroism The twenty maidens if they ever existed who threw themselves into the Elbe when Magdeburgh was taken by storm have been multiplied to the number of twelve hundred See Harte s History of Gustavus Adolphus vol i p three hundred eight Footnote one hundred three See Augustin de Civitat Dei l i c sixteen eighteen He treats the subject with remarkable accuracy and

actual topography Chapter XXXI Invasion Of Italy Occupation Of Territories By Barbarians Part IV Whatever might be the numbers of equestrian or plebeian rank who perished in the massacre of Rome it is confidently affirmed that only one senator lost his life by the sword of the enemy one hundred eight But it was not easy to compute the multitudes who from an honorable station and a prosperous fortune were suddenly reduced to the miserable condition of captives and exiles As the Barbarians had more occasion for money than for slaves they fixed at a moderate price the redemption of their indigent prisoners and the ransom was often paid by the benevolence of their friends or the charity of strangers one hundred nine The captives who were regularly sold either in open market or by private contract would have legally regained their native freedom which it was impossible for a citizen to lose or to alienate one hundred ten But as it was soon discovered that the vindication of their liberty would endanger their lives and that the Goths unless they were tempted to sell might be provoked to murder their useless prisoners the civil jurisprudence had been already qualified by a wise regulation that they should be obliged to serve the moderate term of five years till they had discharged by their labor the price of their redemption one hundred eleven The nations who invaded the Roman empire had driven before them into Italy whole troops of hungry and affrighted provincials less apprehensive of servitude than of famine The calamities of Rome and Italy dispersed the inhabitants to the most lonely the most secure the most distant places of refuge While the Gothic cavalry spread terror and desolation along the sea coast of Campania and Tuscany the little island of Igilium separated by a narrow channel from the Argentarian promontory repulsed or eluded their hostile attempts and at so small a distance from Rome great numbers of citizens were securely concealed in the thick woods of that sequestered spot one hundred twelve The ample patrimonies which many senatorian families possessed in Africa invited them if they had time and prudence to escape from the ruin of their country to embrace the shelter of that hospitable province The most illustrious of these fugitives was the noble and pious Proba one hundred thirteen the widow of the praefect Petronius After the death of her husband the most powerful subject of Rome she had remained at the head of the Anician family and successively supplied from her private fortune the expense of the consulships of her three sons When the city was besieged and taken by the Goths Proba supported with Christian resignation the loss of immense riches embarked in a small vessel from whence she beheld at sea the flames of her burning palace and fled with her daughter Laeta and her granddaughter the celebrated virgin Demetrias to the coast of Africa The benevolent profusion with which the matron distributed the fruits or the price of her estates contributed to alleviate the misfortunes of exile and captivity But even the family of Proba herself was not exempt from the rapacious oppression of Count Heraclian who basely sold in matrimonial prostitution the noblest maidens of Rome to the lust or avarice of the Syrian merchants The Italian fugitives were dispersed through the provinces along the coast of Egypt and Asia as far as Constantinople and Jerusalem and the village of Bethlem the solitary residence of saint Jerom and his female converts was crowded with illustrious beggars of either sex and every age who excited the public compassion by the remembrance of their past fortune one hundred fourteen This awful catastrophe of Rome filled the astonished empire with grief and terror So

exists in human nature a strong propensity to depreciate the advantages and to magnify the evils of the present times Yet when the first emotions had subsided and a fair estimate was made of the real damage the more learned and judicious contemporaries were forced to confess that infant Rome had formerly received more essential injury from the Gauls than she had now sustained from the Goths in her declining age one hundred fifteen The experience of eleven centuries has enabled posterity to produce a much more singular parallel and to affirm with confidence that the ravages of the Barbarians whom Alaric had led from the banks of the Danube were less destructive than the hostilities exercised by the troops of Charles the Fifth a Catholic prince who styled himself Emperor of the Romans one hundred sixteen The Goths evacuated the city at the end of six days but Rome remained above nine months in the possession of the Imperialists and every hour was stained by some atrocious act of cruelty lust and rapine The authority of Alaric preserved some order and moderation among the ferocious multitude which acknowledged him for their leader and king but the constable of Bourbon had gloriously fallen in the attack of the walls and the death of the general removed every restraint of discipline from an army which consisted of three independent nations the Italians the Spaniards and the Germans In the beginning of the sixteenth century the manners of Italy exhibited a remarkable scene of the depravity of mankind They united the sanguinary crimes that prevail in an unsettled state of society with the polished vices which spring from the abuse of art and luxury and the loose adventurers who had violated every prejudice of patriotism and superstition to assault the palace of the Roman pontiff must deserve to be considered as the most profligate of the Italians At the same aera the Spaniards were the terror both of the Old and New World but their high spirited valor was disgraced by gloomy pride rapacious avarice and unrelenting cruelty Indefatigable in the pursuit of fame and riches they had improved by repeated practice the most exquisite and effectual methods of torturing their prisoners many of the Castilians who pillaged Rome were familiars of the holy inquisition and some volunteers perhaps were lately returned from the conquest of Mexico The Germans were less corrupt than the Italians less cruel than the Spaniards and the rustic or even savage aspect of those Tramontane warriors often disguised a simple and merciful disposition But they had imbibed in the first fervor of the reformation the spirit as well as the principles of Luther It was their favorite amusement to insult or destroy the consecrated objects of Catholic superstition they indulged

the age of forty he renounced the enjoyment of wealth and honor of society and literature to embrace a life of solitude and penance and the loud applause of the clergy encouraged him to despise the reproaches of his worldly friends who ascribed this desperate act to some disorder of the mind or body one hundred twenty three An early and passionate attachment determined him to fix his humble dwelling in one of the suburbs of Nola near the miraculous tomb of saint Faelix which the public devotion had already surrounded with five large and populous churches The remains of his fortune and of his understanding were dedicated to the service of the glorious martyr whose praise on the day of his festival Paulinus never failed to celebrate by a solemn hymn and in whose name he erected a sixth church of superior elegance and beauty which was decorated with many curious pictures from the history of the Old and New Testament Such assiduous zeal secured the favor of the saint one hundred twenty four or at least of the people and after fifteen years retirement the Roman consul was compelled to accept the bishopric of Nola a few months before the city was invested by the Goths During the siege some religious persons were satisfied that they had seen either in dreams or visions the divine form of their tutelar patron yet it soon appeared by the event that Faelix wanted power or inclination to preserve the flock of which he had formerly been the shepherd Nola was not saved from the general devastation one hundred twenty five and the captive bishop was protected only by the general opinion of his innocence and poverty Above four years elapsed from the successful invasion of Italy by the arms of Alaric to the voluntary retreat of the Goths under the conduct of his successor Adolphus and during the whole time they reigned without control over a country which in the opinion of the ancients had united all the various excellences of nature and art The prosperity indeed which Italy had attained in the auspicious age of the Antonines had gradually declined with the decline of the empire The fruits of a long peace perished under the rude grasp of the Barbarians and they themselves were incapable of tasting the more elegant refinements of luxury which had been prepared for the use of the soft and polished Italians Each soldier however claimed an ample portion of the substantial plenty the corn and cattle oil and wine that was daily collected and consumed in the Gothic camp and the principal warriors insulted the villas and gardens once inhabited by Lucullus and Cicero along the beauteous coast of Campania Their trembling captives the sons and daughters of Roman senators presented in goblets of gold and gems large draughts of Falernian wine to the haughty victors who stretched their huge limbs under the shade of plane trees one hundred twenty six artificially disposed to exclude the scorching rays and to admit the genial warmth of the sun

philosophic poem of which he has left such an exquisite specimen Whether fame or conquest or riches were the object or Alaric he pursued that object with an indefatigable ardor which could neither be quelled by adversity nor satiated by success No sooner had he reached the extreme land of Italy than he was attracted by the neighboring prospect of a fertile and peaceful island Yet even the possession of Sicily he considered only as an intermediate step to the important expedition which he already meditated against the continent of Africa The Straits of Rhegium and Messina one hundred

was daunted by the terrors of a new element and the whole design was defeated by the premature death of Alaric which fixed after a short illness the fatal term of his conquests The ferocious character

fifty four Chapter XXXI Invasion Of Italy Occupation Of Territories By Barbarians Part V The personal animosities and hereditary feuds of the Barbarians were suspended by the strong necessity of their affairs and the brave Adolphus the brother in law of the deceased monarch was unanimously elected to succeed to his throne The character and political system of the new king of the Goths may be best understood from his own conversation with an illustrious citizen of Narbonne who afterwards in a pilgrimage to the Holy Land related it to saint Jerom in the presence of the historian Orosius In the full confidence of valor and victory I once aspired said Adolphus to change the face of the universe to obliterate the name of Rome to erect on its ruins the dominion of the Goths and to acquire like Augustus the immortal fame of the founder of a new empire By repeated experiments I was gradually convinced that laws are essentially necessary to maintain and regulate a well constituted state and that the fierce untractable humor of the Goths was incapable of bearing the salutary yoke of laws and civil government From that moment I proposed to myself a different object of glory and ambition and it is now my sincere wish that the gratitude of future ages should acknowledge the merit of a stranger who employed the sword of the Goths not to subvert but to restore and maintain the prosperity of the Roman empire one hundred thirty With these pacific views the successor of Alaric suspended the operations of war and seriously negotiated with the Imperial court a treaty of friendship and alliance It was the interest of the ministers of Honorius who were now released from the obligation of their extravagant oath to deliver Italy from the intolerable weight of the Gothic powers and they readily accepted their service against the tyrants and Barbarians who infested the provinces beyond the Alps one hundred thirty one Adolphus assuming the character of a Roman general directed his march from the extremity of Campania to the southern provinces of Gaul His troops either by force of agreement immediately occupied the cities of Narbonne Thoulouse and Bordeaux and though they were repulsed by Count Boniface from the walls of Marseilles they soon extended their quarters from the Mediterranean to the Ocean The oppressed provincials might exclaim that the miserable remnant which the enemy had spared was cruelly ravished by their pretended allies yet some specious colors were not wanting to palliate or justify the violence of the Goths The cities of Gaul which they attacked might perhaps be considered as in a state of rebellion against the government of Honorius the articles of the treaty or the secret instructions of the court might sometimes be alleged in favor of the seeming usurpations of Adolphus and the guilt of any irregular unsuccessful act of hostility might always be imputed with an appearance of truth to the ungovernable spirit of a Barbarian host impatient of peace or discipline The luxury of Italy had been less effectual to soften the temper than to relax the courage of the Goths and they had imbibed the vices without imitating the arts and institutions of civilized society one hundred thirty two Footnote one hundred thirty Orosius l vii c forty three p five hundred eighty four five hundred eighty five He was sent by saint Augustin in

prince and Honorius See Oros l vii c forty three p five hundred eighty four five hundred eighty five Jornandes de Reb Geticis c thirty one p six hundred fifty four six hundred fifty five Footnote one hundred thirty two The retreat of the Goths from Italy and their first transactions in Gaul are dark and doubtful I have derived much assistance from Mascou Hist of the Ancient Germans l viii c twenty nine thirty five thirty six thirty seven who has illustrated and connected the broken chronicles and fragments of the times The professions of Adolphus were probably sincere and his attachment to the cause of the republic was secured by the ascendant which a Roman princess had acquired over the heart and understanding of the Barbarian king Placidia one hundred thirty three the daughter of the great Theodosius and of Galla his second wife had received a royal education in the palace of Constantinople but the eventful story of her life is connected with the revolutions which agitated the Western empire under the reign of her brother Honorius When Rome was first invested by the arms of Alaric Placidia who was then about twenty years of age resided in the city and her ready consent to the death of her cousin Serena has a cruel and ungrateful appearance which according to the circumstances of the action may be aggravated or excused by the consideration of her tender age one hundred thirty four The victorious Barbarians detained either as a hostage or a captive one hundred thirty five the sister of Honorius but while she was exposed to the disgrace of following round Italy the motions of a Gothic camp she experienced however a decent and respectful treatment The authority of Jornandes who praises the beauty of Placidia may perhaps be counterbalanced by the silence the expressive silence of her flatterers yet the splendor of her birth the bloom of youth the elegance of manners and the dexterous insinuation which she condescended to employ made a deep impression on the mind of Adolphus and the Gothic king aspired to call himself the brother of the emperor The ministers of Honorius rejected with disdain the proposal of an alliance so injurious to every sentiment of Roman pride and repeatedly urged the restitution of Placidia as an indispensable condition of the treaty of peace But the daughter of Theodosius submitted without reluctance to the desires of the conqueror a young and valiant prince who yielded to Alaric in loftiness of stature but who excelled in the more attractive qualities of grace and beauty The marriage of Adolphus and Placidia one hundred thirty six was consummated before the Goths retired from Italy and the solemn perhaps the anniversary day of their nuptials was afterwards celebrated in the house of Ingenuus one of the most illustrious citizens of Narbonne in Gaul The bride attired and adorned like a Roman empress was placed on a throne of state and the king of the Goths who assumed on this occasion the Roman habit contented himself with a less honorable seat by her side The nuptial gift which according to the custom of his nation one hundred thirty seven was offered to Placidia consisted of the rare and magnificent spoils of her country Fifty beautiful youths in silken robes carried a basin in each hand and one of these basins was filled with pieces of gold the other with precious stones of an inestimable value Attalus so long the sport of fortune and of the Goths was appointed to lead the chorus of the Hymeneal song and the degraded emperor might aspire to the praise of a skilful musician

Footnote one hundred thirty eight We owe the curious detail of this nuptial feast to the historian Olympiodorus ap Photium p one hundred eighty five one hundred eighty eight The hundred basins of gold and gems presented to Placidia at her nuptial feast formed an inconsiderable portion of the Gothic treasures of which some extraordinary specimens may be selected from the history of the successors of Adolphus Many curious and costly ornaments of pure gold enriched with jewels were found in their palace of Narbonne when it was pillaged in the sixth century by the Franks sixty cups caps or chalices fifteen patens or plates for the use of the communion twenty boxes or cases to hold the books of the Gospels this consecrated wealth one hundred thirty nine was distributed by the son of Clovis among the churches of his dominions and his pious liberality seems to upbraid some former sacrilege of the Goths They possessed with more security of conscience the famous missorium or great dish for the service of the table of massy gold of the weight of five hundred pounds and of far superior value from the precious stones the exquisite workmanship and the tradition that it had been presented by Aetius the patrician to Torismond king of the Goths One of the successors of Torismond purchased the aid of the French monarch by the promise of this magnificent gift When he was seated on the throne of Spain he delivered it with reluctance to the ambassadors of Dagobert despoiled them on the road stipulated after a long negotiation the inadequate ransom of two hundred thousand pieces of gold and preserved the missorium as the pride of the Gothic treasury one hundred forty When that treasury after the conquest of Spain was plundered by the Arabs they admired and they have celebrated another object still more remarkable a table of considerable size of one single piece of solid emerald one hundred forty one encircled with three rows of fine pearls supported by three hundred and sixty five feet of gems and massy gold and estimated at the price of five hundred thousand pieces of gold one hundred forty two Some portion of the Gothic treasures might be the gift of friendship or the tribute

years the ordinary tribute was reduced to one fifth and even that fifth was destined to restore and support the useful institution of the public posts By another law the lands which had been left without inhabitants or cultivation were granted with some diminution of taxes to the neighbors who should occupy or the strangers who should solicit them and the new possessors were secured against the future claims of the fugitive proprietors About the same time a general amnesty was published in the name of Honorius to abolish the guilt and memory of all the involuntary offences which had been committed by his unhappy subjects during the term of the public disorder and calamity A decent and respectful attention was paid to the restoration of the capital the citizens were encouraged to rebuild the edifices which had been destroyed or damaged by hostile fire and extraordinary supplies of corn were imported from the coast of Africa The crowds that so lately fled before the sword of the Barbarians were soon recalled by the hopes of plenty and pleasure and Albinus praefect of Rome informed the court with some anxiety and surprise that in a single day he had taken an account of the

recinge comas c This apparent tranquillity was soon disturbed by the approach of a hostile armament from the country which afforded the daily subsistence of the Roman people Heraclian count of Africa who under the most difficult and distressful circumstances had supported with active loyalty the cause of Honorius was tempted in the year of his consulship to assume the character of a rebel and the title of emperor The ports of Africa were immediately filled with the naval forces at the head of which he prepared to invade Italy and his fleet when it cast anchor at the mouth of the Tyber indeed surpassed the fleets of Xerxes and Alexander if all the vessels including the royal galley and the smallest boat did actually amount to the incredible number of three thousand two hundred one hundred forty six Yet with such an armament which might have subverted or restored the greatest empires of the earth the African usurper made a very faint and feeble impression on the provinces of his rival As he marched from the port along the road which leads to the gates of Rome he was encountered terrified and routed by one of the Imperial captains and the lord of this mighty host deserting his fortune and his friends ignominiously fled with a single ship one hundred forty seven When Heraclian landed in the harbor of Carthage he found that the whole province disdaining such an unworthy ruler had returned to their allegiance The rebel was beheaded in the ancient temple of Memory his consulship was abolished one hundred forty eight and the remains of his private fortune not exceeding the moderate sum of four thousand pounds of gold were granted to the brave Constantius who had already defended the throne which he afterwards shared with his feeble sovereign Honorius viewed with supine indifference the calamities of Rome and Italy one hundred forty nine but the rebellious attempts of Attalus and Heraclian against his personal safety awakened for a moment the torpid instinct of his nature He was probably ignorant of the causes and events which preserved him from these impending dangers and as Italy was no longer invaded by any foreign or domestic enemies he peaceably existed in the palace of Ravenna while the tyrants beyond the Alps were repeatedly vanquished in the name and by the lieutenants of the son of Theodosius one hundred fifty In the course of a busy and interesting narrative I might possibly forget to mention the death of such a prince and I shall therefore take the precaution of observing in this place that he survived the last siege of Rome about thirteen years Footnote one hundred forty six Orosius composed his history in Africa only two years after the event yet his authority seems to be overbalanced by the improbability of the fact The Chronicle of Marcellinus gives Heraclian seven hundred ships and three thousand men the latter of these numbers is ridiculously corrupt but the former would please me very much Footnote one hundred forty seven The

Constantine who received the purple from the legions of Britain had been successful and seemed to be secure His title was acknowledged from the wall of Antoninus to the columns of Hercules and in the midst of the public disorder he shared the dominion and the plunder of Gaul and Spain with the tribes of Barbarians whose destructive progress was no longer checked by the Rhine or Pyrenees Stained with the blood of the kinsmen of Honorius he extorted from the court of Ravenna with which he secretly corresponded the ratification of his rebellious claims Constantine engaged himself by a solemn promise to deliver Italy from the Goths advanced as far as the banks of the Po and after alarming rather than assisting his pusillanimous ally hastily returned to the palace of Arles to celebrate with intemperate luxury his vain and ostentatious triumph But this transient prosperity was soon interrupted and destroyed by the revolt of Count Gerontius the bravest of his generals who during the absence of his son Constants a prince already invested with the Imperial purple had been left to command in the provinces of Spain From some reason of which we are ignorant Gerontius instead of assuming the diadem placed it on the head of his friend Maximus who fixed his residence at Tarragona while the active count pressed forwards through the Pyrenees to surprise the two emperors Constantine and Constans before they could prepare for their defence The son was made prisoner at Vienna and immediately put to death and the unfortunate youth had scarcely leisure to deplore the elevation of his family which had tempted or compelled him sacrilegiously to desert the peaceful obscurity of the monastic life The father maintained a siege within the walls of Arles but those walls must have yielded to the assailants had not the city been unexpectedly relieved by the approach of an Italian army The name of Honorius the proclamation of a lawful emperor astonished the contending parties of the rebels Gerontius abandoned by his own troops escaped to the confines of Spain and rescued his name from oblivion by the Roman courage which appeared to animate the last moments of his life In the middle of the night a great body of his perfidious soldiers surrounded and attacked his house which he had strongly barricaded His wife a valiant friend of the nation of the Alani and some faithful slaves were still attached to his person and he used with so much skill and resolution a large magazine of darts and arrows that above three hundred of the assailants lost their lives in the attempt His slaves when all the missile weapons were spent fled at the dawn of day and Gerontius if he had not been restrained by conjugal tenderness might have imitated their example till the soldiers provoked by such obstinate resistance applied fire on all sides to the house In this fatal extremity he complied with the request of his Barbarian friend and cut off his head The wife of Gerontius who conjured him not to abandon her to a life of misery and disgrace eagerly presented her neck to his sword and the tragic scene was terminated by the death of the count himself who after three ineffectual strokes drew a short dagger and sheathed it in his heart one hundred fifty one The unprotected Maximus whom he had invested with the purple was indebted for his life to the contempt that was entertained of his power and abilities The caprice of the Barbarians who ravaged Spain once more seated this Imperial phantom on the throne but they soon resigned him to the justice of Honorius and the tyrant Maximus after he had been shown to the people of Ravenna and Rome was publicly executed Footnote one hundred fifty one The praises which Sozomen has bestowed on this act of despair appear strange and scandalous in the mouth of an ecclesiastical historian He observes p three hundred seventy nine that the wife of Gerontius was a Christian and that her death was worthy of her religion and of immortal fame The general Constantius was his name who raised by his approach the siege of Arles and dissipated the troops of Gerontius was born a Roman and this remarkable distinction is strongly expressive of the decay of military spirit among the subjects of the empire The strength and majesty which were conspicuous in the person of that general one hundred fifty two marked him in the popular opinion as a candidate worthy of the throne which he afterwards ascended In the familiar intercourse of private life his manners were cheerful and engaging nor would he sometimes disdain in the license of convivial mirth to vie with the pantomimes themselves in the exercises of their ridiculous profession But when the trumpet summoned him to arms when he mounted his horse and bending down for such was his singular practice almost upon the neck fiercely rolled his large animated eyes round the field Constantius then struck terror into his foes and inspired his soldiers with the assurance of victory He had received from the court of Ravenna the important commission of extirpating rebellion in the provinces of the West and the pretended emperor Constantine after enjoying a short and anxious respite was again besieged in his capital by the arms of a more formidable enemy Yet this interval allowed time for a successful negotiation with the Franks and Alemanni and his ambassador Edobic soon returned at the head of an army to disturb the operations of the siege of Arles The Roman general instead of expecting the attack in his lines boldly and perhaps wisely resolved to pass the Rhone and to meet the Barbarians His measures were conducted with so much skill and secrecy that while they engaged the infantry of Constantius in the front they were suddenly attacked surrounded and destroyed by the cavalry of his lieutenant Ulphilas who had silently gained an advantageous post in their rear The remains of the army of Edobic were preserved by flight or submission and their leader escaped from the field of battle to the house of a faithless friend who too clearly understood that the head of his obnoxious guest would be an acceptable and lucrative present for the Imperial general On this occasion Constantius behaved with the magnanimity of a genuine Roman Subduing or suppressing every sentiment of jealousy he publicly acknowledged the merit and services of Ulphilas but he turned with horror from the assassin of Edobic and sternly intimated his commands that the camp should no longer be polluted by the presence of an ungrateful wretch who had violated the laws of friendship and hospitality The usurper who beheld from the walls of Arles the ruin of his last hopes was tempted to place some confidence in so generous a conqueror He required a solemn promise for his security and after receiving by the imposition of hands the sacred character of a Christian Presbyter he ventured to open the gates of the city But he soon experienced that the principles of honor and integrity which might regulate the ordinary conduct of Constantius were superseded by the loose doctrines of political morality The Roman general indeed refused to sully his laurels with the blood of Constantine but the abdicated emperor and his son Julian were sent under a strong guard into Italy and before they reached the palace of Ravenna they met the ministers of death Footnote one hundred fifty two It is the expression of Olympiodorus which he seems to have borrowed from Aeolus a tragedy of Euripides of which some fragments only are now extant Euripid Barnes tom ii p four hundred forty three ver thirty eight This allusion may prove that the ancient tragic poets were still familiar to the Greeks of the fifth century At a time when it was universally confessed that almost every man in the empire was superior in personal merit to the princes whom the accident of their birth had seated on the throne a rapid succession of usurpers regardless of the fate of their predecessors still continued to arise This mischief was peculiarly felt in the provinces of Spain and Gaul where the principles of order and obedience had been extinguished by war and rebellion Before Constantine resigned the purple and in the fourth month of the siege of Arles intelligence was received in the Imperial camp that Jovinus has assumed the diadem at Mentz in the Upper Germany at the instigation of Goar king of the Alani and of Guntiarius king of the Burgundians and that the candidate on whom they had bestowed the empire advanced with a formidable host of Barbarians from the banks of the Rhine to those of the Rhone Every circumstance is dark and extraordinary in the short history of the reign of Jovinus It was natural to expect that a brave and skilful general at the head of a victorious army would have asserted in a field of battle the justice of the cause of Honorius The hasty retreat of Constantius might be justified by weighty reasons but he resigned without a struggle the possession of Gaul and Dardanus the Praetorian praefect is recorded as the only magistrate who refused to yield obedience to the usurper one hundred fifty three When the Goths two years after the siege of Rome established their quarters in Gaul it was natural to suppose that their inclinations could be divided only between the emperor Honorius with whom they had formed a recent alliance and the degraded Attalus whom they reserved in their camp for the occasional purpose of acting the part of a musician or a monarch Yet in a moment of disgust for which it is not easy to assign a cause or a date Adolphus connected himself with the usurper of Gaul and imposed on Attalus the ignominious task of negotiating the treaty which ratified his own disgrace We are again surprised to read that instead of considering the Gothic alliance as the firmest support of his throne Jovinus upbraided in dark and ambiguous language the officious importunity of Attalus that scorning the advice of his great ally he invested with the purple his brother Sebastian and that he most imprudently accepted the service of Sarus when that gallant chief the soldier of Honorius was provoked to desert the court of a prince who knew not how to reward or punish Adolphus educated among a race of warriors who esteemed the duty of revenge as the most precious and sacred portion of their inheritance advanced with a body of ten thousand Goths to encounter the hereditary enemy of the house of Balti He attacked Sarus at an unguarded moment when he was accompanied only by eighteen or twenty of his valiant followers United by friendship animated by despair but at length oppressed by multitudes this band of heroes deserved the esteem without exciting the compassion of their enemies and the lion was no sooner taken in the toils one hundred fifty four than he was instantly despatched The death of Sarus dissolved the loose alliance which Adolphus still maintained with the usurpers of Gaul He again listened to the dictates of love and prudence and soon satisfied the brother of Placidia by the assurance that he would immediately transmit to the palace of Ravenna the heads of the two tyrants Jovinus and Sebastian The king of the Goths executed his promise without difficulty or delay the helpless brothers unsupported by any personal merit were abandoned by their Barbarian auxiliaries and the short opposition of Valentia was expiated by the ruin of one of the noblest cities of Gaul The emperor chosen by the Roman senate who had been promoted degraded insulted restored again degraded and again insulted was finally abandoned to his fate but when the Gothic king withdrew his protection he was restrained by pity or contempt from offering any violence to the person of Attalus The unfortunate Attalus who was left without subjects or allies embarked in one of the ports of Spain in search of some secure and solitary retreat but he was intercepted at sea conducted to the presence of Honorius led in triumph through the streets of Rome or Ravenna and publicly exposed to the gazing multitude on the second step of the throne of his invincible conqueror The same measure of punishment with which in the days of his prosperity he was accused of menacing his rival was inflicted on Attalus himself he was condemned after the amputation of two fingers to a perpetual exile in the Isle of Lipari where he was supplied with the decent necessaries of life The remainder of the reign of Honorius was undisturbed by rebellion and it may be observed that in the space of five years seven usurpers had yielded to the fortune of a prince who was himself incapable either of counsel or of action Footnote one hundred fifty three Sidonius

Occupation Of Territories By Barbarians Part VI The situation of Spain separated on all sides from the enemies of Rome by the sea by the mountains and by intermediate provinces had secured the long tranquillity of that remote and sequestered country and we may observe as a sure symptom of domestic happiness that in a period of four hundred years Spain furnished very few materials to the history of the Roman empire The footsteps of the Barbarians who in the reign of Gallienus had penetrated beyond the Pyrenees were soon obliterated by the return of peace and in the fourth century of the Christian aera the cities of Emerita or Merida of Corduba Seville Bracara and Tarragona were numbered with the most illustrious of the Roman world The various plenty of the animal the vegetable and the mineral kingdoms was improved and manufactured by the skill of an industrious people and the peculiar advantages of naval stores contributed to support an extensive and profitable trade one hundred fifty five The arts and sciences flourished under the protection of the emperors and if the character of the Spaniards was enfeebled by peace and servitude the hostile approach of the Germans who had spread terror and desolation from the Rhine to the Pyrenees seemed to rekindle some sparks of military ardor As long as the defence of the mountains was intrusted to the hardy and faithful militia of the country they successfully repelled the frequent attempts of the Barbarians But no sooner had the national troops been compelled to resign their post to the Honorian bands in the service of Constantine than the gates of Spain were treacherously betrayed to the public enemy about ten months before the sack of Rome by the Goths one hundred fifty six The consciousness of guilt and the thirst of rapine prompted the mercenary guards of the Pyrenees to desert their station to invite the arms of the Suevi the Vandals and the Alani and to swell the torrent which was poured with irresistible violence from the frontiers of Gaul to the sea of Africa The misfortunes of Spain may be described in the language of its most eloquent historian who has concisely expressed the passionate and perhaps exaggerated declamations of contemporary writers one hundred fifty seven The irruption of these nations was followed by the most dreadful calamities as the Barbarians exercised their indiscriminate cruelty on the fortunes of the Romans and the Spaniards and ravaged with equal fury the cities and the open country The progress of famine reduced the miserable inhabitants to feed on the flesh of their fellow creatures and even the wild beasts who multiplied without control in the desert were exasperated by the taste of blood and the impatience of hunger boldly to attack and devour their human prey Pestilence soon appeared the inseparable companion of famine a large proportion of the people was swept away and the groans of the dying excited only the envy of their surviving friends At length the Barbarians satiated with carnage and rapine and afflicted by the contagious evils which they themselves had introduced fixed their permanent seats in the depopulated country The ancient Gallicia whose limits included the kingdom of Old Castille was divided between the Suevi and the Vandals the Alani were scattered over the provinces of Carthagena and Lusitania from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic Ocean and the fruitful territory of Boetica was allotted to the Silingi another branch of the Vandalic nation After regulating this partition the conquerors contracted with their new subjects some reciprocal engagements of protection and obedience the lands were again cultivated and the towns and villages were again occupied by a captive people The greatest part of the Spaniards was even disposed to prefer this new condition of poverty and barbarism to the severe oppressions of the Roman government yet there were many who still asserted their native freedom and who refused more especially in the mountains of Gallicia to submit to the Barbarian yoke one hundred fifty eight Footnote one hundred fifty five Without recurring to the more

vii c forty one p five hundred seventy nine that the Barbarians had turned their swords into ploughshares and that many of the Provincials had preferred inter Barbaros pauperem libertatem quam inter Romanos tributariam solicitudinem sustinere The important present of the heads of Jovinus and Sebastian had approved the friendship of Adolphus and restored Gaul to the obedience of his brother Honorius Peace was incompatible with the situation and temper of the king of the Goths He readily accepted the proposal of turning his victorious arms against the Barbarians of Spain the troops of Constantius intercepted his communication with the seaports of Gaul and gently pressed his march towards the Pyrenees one hundred fifty nine he passed the mountains and surprised in the name of the emperor the city of Barcelona The fondness of Adolphus for his Roman bride was not abated by time or possession and the birth of a son surnamed from his illustrious grandsire Theodosius appeared to fix him forever in the interest of the republic The loss of that infant whose remains were deposited in a silver coffin in one of the churches near Barcelona afflicted his parents but the grief of the Gothic king was suspended by the labors of the field and the course of his victories was soon interrupted by domestic treason He had imprudently received into his service one of the followers of Sarus a Barbarian of a daring spirit but of a diminutive stature whose secret desire of revenging the death of his beloved patron was continually irritated by the sarcasms of his insolent master Adolphus was assassinated in the palace of Barcelona the laws of the succession were violated by a tumultuous faction one hundred sixty and a stranger to the royal race Singeric the brother of Sarus himself was seated on the Gothic throne The first act of his reign was the inhuman murder of the six children of Adolphus the issue of a former marriage whom he tore without pity from the feeble arms of a venerable bishop one hundred sixty one The unfortunate Placidia instead of the respectful compassion which she might have excited in the most savage breasts was treated with cruel and wanton insult The daughter of the emperor Theodosius confounded among a crowd of vulgar captives was compelled to march on foot above twelve miles before the horse of a Barbarian the assassin of a husband whom Placidia loved and lamented one hundred sixty two Footnote one hundred fifty nine This mixture of force and persuasion may be fairly inferred from comparing Orosius and Jornandes the Roman and the Gothic historian Footnote one hundred sixty According to the system of Jornandes c thirty three p six hundred fifty nine the true hereditary right to the Gothic sceptre was vested in the Amali but those princes who were the vassals of the Huns commanded the tribes of the Ostrogoths in some distant parts of Germany or Scythia Footnote one hundred sixty one The murder is related by Olympiodorus but the number of the children is taken from an epitaph of suspected authority Footnote one hundred sixty two The death of Adolphus was celebrated at Constantinople with illuminations and Circensian games See Chron Alexandrin It may seem doubtful whether the Greeks were actuated on this occasion be their hatred of the Barbarians or of the Latins But Placidia soon obtained the pleasure of revenge and the view of her ignominious sufferings might rouse an indignant people against the tyrant who was assassinated on the seventh day of his usurpation After the death of Singeric the free choice of the nation bestowed the Gothic sceptre on Wallia whose warlike and ambitious temper appeared in the beginning of his reign extremely hostile to the republic He marched in arms from Barcelona to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean which the ancients revered and dreaded as the boundary of the world But when he reached the southern promontory of Spain one hundred sixty three and from the rock now covered by the fortress of Gibraltar contemplated the neighboring and fertile coast of Africa Wallia resumed the designs of conquest which had been interrupted by the death of Alaric The winds and waves again disappointed the enterprise of the Goths and the minds of a superstitious people were deeply affected by the repeated disasters of storms and shipwrecks In this disposition the successor of Adolphus no longer refused to listen to a Roman ambassador whose proposals were enforced by the real or supposed approach of a numerous army under the conduct of the brave Constantius A solemn treaty was stipulated and observed Placidia was honorably restored to her brother six hundred thousand measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry Goths one hundred sixty four and Wallia engaged to draw his sword in the service of the empire A bloody war was instantly excited among the Barbarians of Spain and the contending princes are said to have addressed their letters their ambassadors and their hostages to the throne of the Western emperor exhorting him to remain a tranquil spectator of their contest the events of which must be favorable to the Romans by the mutual slaughter of their common enemies one hundred sixty five The Spanish war was obstinately supported during three campaigns with desperate valor and various success and the martial achievements of Wallia diffused through the empire the superior renown of the Gothic hero He exterminated the Silingi who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the province of Boetica He slew in battle the king of the Alani and the remains of those Scythian wanderers who escaped from the field instead of choosing a new leader humbly sought a refuge under the standard of the Vandals with whom they were ever afterwards confounded The Vandals themselves and the Suevi yielded to the efforts of the invincible Goths The promiscuous multitude of Barbarians whose retreat had been intercepted were driven into the mountains of Gallicia where they still continued in a narrow compass and on a barren soil to exercise their domestic and implacable hostilities In the pride of victory Wallia was faithful to his engagements he restored his Spanish conquests to the obedience of Honorius and the tyranny of the Imperial officers soon reduced an oppressed people to regret the time of their Barbarian servitude While the event of the war was still doubtful the first advantages obtained by the arms of Wallia had encouraged the court of Ravenna to decree the honors of a triumph to their feeble sovereign He entered Rome like the ancient conquerors of nations and if the monuments of servile corruption had not long since met with the fate which they deserved we should probably find that a crowd of poets and orators of magistrates and bishops applauded the fortune the wisdom and the invincible courage of the emperor Honorius one hundred sixty six Footnote one hundred sixty three Quod Tartessiacis avus hujus Vallia

one thirty two and the chronicles of Idatius and Isidore Such a triumph might have been justly claimed by the ally of Rome if Wallia before he repassed the Pyrenees had extirpated the seeds of the Spanish war His victorious Goths forty three years after they had passed the Danube were established according to the faith of treaties in the possession of the second Aquitain a maritime province between the Garonne and the Loire under the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Bourdeaux That metropolis advantageously situated for the trade of the ocean was built in a regular and elegant form and its numerous inhabitants were distinguished among the Gauls by their wealth their learning and the politeness of their manners The adjacent province which has been fondly compared to the garden of Eden is blessed with a fruitful soil and a temperate climate the face of the country displayed the arts and the rewards of industry and the Goths after their martial toils luxuriously exhausted the rich vineyards of Aquitain one hundred sixty seven The Gothic limits were enlarged by the additional gift of some neighboring dioceses and the successors of Alaric fixed their royal residence at Thoulouse which included five populous quarters or cities within the spacious circuit of its walls About the same time in the last years of the reign of Honorius the Goths the Burgundians and the Franks obtained a permanent seat and dominion in the provinces of Gaul The liberal grant of the usurper Jovinus to his Burgundian allies was confirmed by the lawful emperor the lands of the First or Upper Germany were ceded to those formidable Barbarians and they gradually occupied either by conquest or treaty the two provinces which still retain with the titles of Duchy and County the national appellation of Burgundy one hundred sixty eight The Franks the valiant and faithful allies of the Roman republic were soon tempted to imitate the invaders whom they had so bravely resisted Treves the capital of Gaul was pillaged by their lawless bands and the humble colony which they so long maintained in the district of Toxandia in Brabant insensibly multiplied along the banks of the Meuse and Scheld till their independent power filled the whole extent of the Second or Lower Germany These facts may be sufficiently justified by historic evidence but the foundation of the French monarchy by Pharamond the conquests the laws and even the existence of that hero have been justly arraigned by the impartial severity of modern criticism one hundred sixty nine Footnote one hundred

in Tuscany Note The first mention of Pharamond is in the Gesta Francorum assigned to about the year seven hundred twenty saint Martin iv four hundred sixty nine The modern French writers in general subscribe to the opinion of Thierry Faramond fils de Markomir quo que son nom soit bien germanique et son regne possible ne figure pas dans les histoires les plus dignes de foi A Thierry Lettres l Histoire de France p ninety M The ruin of the opulent provinces of Gaul may be dated from the establishment of these Barbarians whose alliance was dangerous and oppressive and who were capriciously impelled by interest or passion to violate the public peace A heavy and partial ransom was imposed on the surviving provincials who had escaped the calamities of war the fairest and most fertile lands were assigned to the rapacious strangers for the use of their families their slaves and their cattle and the trembling natives relinquished with a sigh the inheritance of their fathers Yet these domestic misfortunes which are seldom the lot of a vanquished people had been felt and inflicted by the Romans themselves not only in the insolence of foreign conquest but in the madness of civil discord The Triumvirs proscribed eighteen of the most flourishing colonies of Italy and distributed their lands and houses to the veterans who revenged the death of Caesar and oppressed the liberty of their country Two poets of unequal fame have deplored in similar circumstances the loss of their patrimony but the legionaries of Augustus appear to have surpassed in violence and injustice the Barbarians who invaded Gaul under the reign of Honorius It was not without the utmost difficulty that Virgil escaped from the sword of the Centurion who had usurped his farm in the neighborhood of Mantua one hundred seventy but Paulinus of Bourdeaux received a sum of money from his Gothic purchaser which he accepted with pleasure and surprise and though it was much inferior to the real value of his estate this act of rapine was disguised by some colors of moderation and equity one hundred seventy one The odious name of conquerors was softened into the mild and friendly appellation of the guests of the Romans and the Barbarians of Gaul more especially the Goths repeatedly declared that they were bound to the people by the ties of hospitality and to the emperor by the duty of allegiance and military service The title of Honorius and his successors their laws and their civil magistrates were still respected in the provinces of Gaul of which they had resigned the possession to the Barbarian allies and the kings who exercised a supreme and independent authority over their native subjects ambitiously solicited the more honorable rank of master generals of the Imperial armies one

and a succession of feeble tyrants oppressed the provinces beyond the Alps the British island separated itself from the body of the Roman empire The regular forces which guarded that remote province had been gradually withdrawn and Britain was abandoned without defence to the Saxon pirates and the savages of Ireland and Caledonia The Britons reduced to this extremity no longer relied on the tardy and doubtful aid of a declining monarchy They assembled in arms repelled the invaders and rejoiced in the important discovery of their own strength one hundred seventy three Afflicted by similar calamities and actuated by the same spirit the Armorican provinces a name which comprehended the maritime countries of Gaul between the Seine and the Loire one hundred seventy four resolved to imitate the example of the neighboring island They expelled the Roman magistrates who acted under the authority of the usurper Constantine and a free government was established among a people who had so long been subject to the arbitrary will of a master The independence of Britain and Armorica was soon confirmed by Honorius himself the lawful emperor of the West and the letters by which he committed to the new states the care of their own safety might be interpreted as an absolute and perpetual abdication of the exercise and rights of sovereignty This interpretation was in some measure justified by the event After the usurpers of Gaul had successively fallen the maritime provinces were restored to the empire Yet their obedience was imperfect and precarious the vain inconstant rebellious disposition of the people was incompatible either with freedom or servitude one hundred seventy five and Armorica though it could not long maintain the form of a republic one hundred seventy six was agitated by frequent and destructive revolts Britain was irrecoverably lost one hundred seventy seven But as the emperors wisely acquiesced in the independence of a remote province the separation was not imbittered by the reproach of tyranny or rebellion and the claims of allegiance and protection were succeeded by the mutual and voluntary offices of national friendship one hundred seventy eight

See Esprit des Loix l xxx c twenty four Note See Memoires de Gallet sur l Origine des Bretons quoted by Daru Histoire de Bretagne i p fifty seven According to the opinion of these authors the

reign of Honorius Yet our modern historians and antiquaries extend the term of their dominion and there are some who allow only the interval of a few months between their departure and the arrival of the Saxons Footnote one hundred seventy eight Bede has not forgotten the occasional aid of the legions against the Scots and Picts and more authentic proof will hereafter be produced that the independent Britons raised twelve thousand men for the service of the emperor Anthemius in Gaul This revolution dissolved the artificial fabric of civil and military government and the independent country during a period of forty years till the descent of the Saxons was ruled by the authority of the clergy the nobles and the municipal towns one hundred seventy nine I Zosimus who alone has preserved the memory of this singular transaction very accurately observes that the letters of Honorius were addressed to the cities of Britain one hundred eighty Under the protection of the Romans ninety two considerable towns had arisen in the several parts of that great province and among these thirty three cities were distinguished above the rest by their superior privileges and importance one hundred eighty one Each of these cities as in all the other provinces of the empire formed a legal corporation for the purpose of regulating their domestic policy and the powers of municipal government were distributed among annual magistrates a select senate and the assembly of the people according to the original model of the Roman constitution one hundred eighty two The management of a common revenue the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction and the habits of public counsel and command were inherent to these petty republics and when they asserted their independence the youth of the city and of the adjacent districts would naturally range themselves under the standard of the magistrate But the desire of obtaining the advantages and of escaping the burdens of political society is a perpetual and inexhaustible source of discord nor can it reasonably be presumed that the restoration of British freedom was exempt from tumult and faction The preeminence of birth and fortune must have been frequently violated by bold and popular citizens and the haughty nobles who complained that they were become the subjects of their own servants one hundred eighty three would sometimes regret the reign of an arbitrary monarch II The jurisdiction of each city over the adjacent country was supported by the patrimonial influence of the principal senators and the smaller towns the villages and the proprietors of land consulted their own safety by adhering to the shelter of these rising republics The sphere of their attraction was proportioned to the respective degrees of their wealth and populousness but the hereditary lords of ample possessions who were not oppressed by the neighborhood of any powerful city aspired to the rank of independent princes and boldly exercised the rights of peace and war The gardens and villas which exhibited some faint imitation of Italian elegance would soon be converted into strong castles the refuge in time of danger of the adjacent country one hundred eighty four the produce of the land was applied to purchase arms and horses to maintain a military force of slaves of peasants and of licentious followers and the chieftain might assume within his own domain the powers of a civil magistrate Several of these British chiefs might be the genuine posterity of ancient kings and many more would be tempted to adopt this honorable genealogy and to vindicate their hereditary claims which had been suspended by the usurpation of the Caesars one hundred eighty five Their situation and their hopes would dispose them to affect the dress the language and the customs of their ancestors If the princes of Britain relapsed into barbarism while the cities studiously preserved the laws and manners of Rome the whole island must have been gradually divided by the distinction of two national parties again broken into a thousand subdivisions of war and faction by the various provocations of interest and resentment The public strength instead of being united against a foreign enemy was consumed in obscure and intestine quarrels and the personal merit which had placed a successful leader at the head of his equals might enable him to subdue the freedom of some neighboring cities and to claim a rank among the tyrants one hundred eighty six who infested Britain after the dissolution of the Roman government III The British church might be composed of thirty or forty bishops one hundred eighty seven with an adequate proportion of the inferior clergy and the want of riches for they seem to have been poor one hundred eighty eight would compel them to deserve the public esteem by a decent and exemplary behavior The interest as well as the temper of the clergy was favorable to the peace and union of their distracted country those salutary lessons might be frequently inculcated in their popular discourses and the episcopal synods were the only councils that could pretend to the weight and authority of a national assembly In such councils where the princes and magistrates sat promiscuously with the bishops the important affairs of the state as well as of the church might be freely debated differences reconciled alliances formed contributions imposed wise resolutions often concerted and sometimes executed and there is reason to believe that in moments of extreme danger a Pendragon or Dictator was elected by the general consent of the Britons These pastoral cares so worthy of the episcopal character were interrupted however by zeal and superstition and the British clergy incessantly labored to eradicate the Pelagian heresy which they abhorred as the peculiar disgrace of their native country one hundred eighty nine Footnote one hundred seventy nine I owe it to myself and to historic truth to

express and so seldom feel the emperor Honorius promulgated his intention of convening an annual assembly of the seven provinces a name peculiarly appropriated to Aquitain and the ancient Narbonnese which had long since exchanged their Celtic rudeness for the useful and elegant arts of Italy one hundred ninety one Arles the seat of government and commerce was appointed for the place of the assembly which regularly continued twenty eight days from the fifteenth of August to the thirteenth of September of every year It consisted of the Praetorian praefect of the Gauls of seven provincial governors one consular and six presidents of the magistrates and perhaps the bishops of about sixty cities and of a competent though indefinite number of the most honorable and opulent possessors of land who might justly be considered as the representatives of their country They were empowered to interpret and communicate the laws of their sovereign to expose the grievances and wishes of their constituents to moderate the excessive or unequal weight of taxes and to deliberate on every subject of local or national importance that could tend to the restoration of the peace and prosperity of the seven provinces If such an institution which gave the people an interest in their own government had been universally established by Trajan or the Antonines the seeds of public wisdom and virtue might have been cherished and propagated in the empire of Rome The privileges of the subject would have secured the throne of the monarch the abuses of an arbitrary administration might have been prevented in some degree or corrected by the interposition of these representative assemblies and the country would have been defended against a foreign enemy by the arms of natives and freemen Under the mild and generous influence of liberty the Roman empire might have remained invincible and immortal or if its excessive magnitude and the instability of human affairs had opposed such perpetual continuance its vital and constituent members might have separately preserved their vigor and independence But in the decline of the empire when every principle of health and life had been exhausted the tardy application of this partial remedy was incapable of producing any important or salutary effects The emperor Honorius expresses his surprise that he must compel the reluctant provinces to accept a privilege which they should ardently have solicited A fine of three or even five pounds of gold was imposed on the absent representatives who seem to have declined this imaginary gift of a free constitution as the last and most cruel insult of their oppressors Footnote one hundred ninety See the correct text of this edict as published by Sirmond Not ad Sidon Apollin p one hundred forty

climate while the impregnable strength of their capital continued for ages to defy the hostile attempts of the Barbarians Their dominions were bounded by the Adriatic and the Tigris and the whole interval of twenty five days navigation which separated the extreme cold of Scythia from the torrid zone of Aethiopia two was comprehended within the limits of the empire of the East The populous countries of that empire were the seat of art and learning of luxury and wealth and the inhabitants who had assumed the language and manners of Greeks styled themselves with some appearance of truth the most enlightened and civilized portion of the human species The form of government was a pure and simple monarchy the name of the Roman Republic which so long preserved a faint tradition of freedom was confined to the Latin provinces and the princes of Constantinople measured their greatness by the servile obedience of their people They were ignorant how much this passive disposition enervates and degrades every faculty of the mind The subjects who had resigned their will to the absolute commands of a master were equally incapable of guarding their lives and fortunes against the assaults of the Barbarians or of defending their reason from the terrors of superstition Footnote one Father Montfaucon who by the command of his Benedictine superiors was compelled see Longueruana

reign of Arcadius and Honorius are so intimately connected that the rebellion of the Goths and the fall of Rufinus have already claimed a place in the history of the West It has already been observed that Eutropius three one of the principal eunuchs of the palace of Constantinople succeeded the haughty minister whose ruin he had accomplished and whose vices he soon imitated Every order of the state bowed to the new favorite and their tame and obsequious submission encouraged him to insult the laws and what is still more difficult and dangerous the manners of his country Under the weakest of the predecessors of Arcadius the reign of the eunuchs had been secret and almost invisible They insinuated themselves into the confidence of the prince but their ostensible functions were confined to the menial service of the wardrobe and Imperial bed chamber They might direct in a whisper the public counsels and blast by their malicious suggestions the fame and fortunes of the most illustrious citizens but they never presumed to stand forward in the front of empire four or to profane the public honors of the state Eutropius was the first of his artificial sex who dared to assume the character of a Roman magistrate and general five Sometimes in the presence of the blushing senate he ascended the tribunal to pronounce judgment or to repeat elaborate harangues and sometimes appeared on horseback at the head of his troops in the dress and armor of a hero The disregard of custom and decency always betrays a weak and ill regulated mind nor does Eutropius seem to have compensated for the folly of the design by any superior merit or ability in the execution His former habits of life had not introduced him to the study of the laws or the exercises of the field his awkward and unsuccessful attempts provoked the secret contempt of the spectators the Goths expressed their wish that such a general might always command the armies of Rome and the name of the minister was branded with ridicule more pernicious perhaps than hatred to a public character The subjects of Arcadius were exasperated by the recollection that this deformed and decrepit eunuch six who so perversely mimicked the actions of a man was born in the most abject condition of servitude that before he entered the Imperial palace he had been successively sold and purchased by a hundred masters who had exhausted his youthful strength in every mean and infamous office and at length dismissed him in his old age to freedom and poverty seven While these disgraceful stories were circulated and perhaps exaggerated in private conversation the vanity of the favorite was flattered with the most extraordinary honors In the senate in the capital in the provinces the statues of Eutropius were erected in brass or marble decorated with the symbols of his civil and military virtues and inscribed with the pompous title of the third founder of Constantinople He was promoted to the rank of patrician which began to signify in a popular and even legal acceptation the father of the emperor and the last year of the fourth century was polluted by the consulship of a eunuch and a slave This strange and inexpiable prodigy eight awakened however the prejudices of the Romans The effeminate consul was rejected by the West as an indelible stain to the annals of the republic and without invoking the shades of Brutus and Camillus the colleague of Eutropius a learned and respectable magistrate nine sufficiently represented the different maxims of the two administrations Footnote three Barthius who adored his author with the blind superstition of a commentator gives the preference to the two books which Claudian composed against Eutropius above all his other productions Baillet Jugemens des Savans tom iv p two hundred twenty seven They are indeed a very elegant and spirited satire and would be more valuable in an historical light if the invective were less vague and more temperate Footnote four After lamenting the progress of the eunuchs in the Roman palace and defining their proper functions Claudian adds A fronte recedant Imperii In Eutrop i four hundred twenty two Yet it does not appear that the eunuchs had assumed any of the efficient offices of the empire and he is styled only Praepositun sacri cubiculi in the edict of his banishment See Cod Theod l leg seventeen Jamque oblita sui nec sobria divitiis mens In miseras leges hominumque negotia ludit Judicat eunuchus Arma etiam violare parat Claudian i two hundred twenty nine two hundred seventy with that mixture of indignation and humor which always pleases in a satiric poet describes the insolent folly of the eunuch the disgrace of the empire and the joy of the Goths Gaudet cum viderit hostis Et sentit jam

remark must have been founded on experience that there was scarcely an interval between the youth and the decrepit age of a eunuch Footnote seven Eutropius appears to have been a native of Armenia or Assyria His three services which Claudian more particularly describes were these one He spent many years as the catamite of Ptolemy a groom or soldier of the Imperial stables two Ptolemy gave him to the old general Arintheus for whom he very skilfully exercised the profession of a pimp three He was given on her marriage to the daughter of Arintheus and the future consul was employed to comb her hair to present the silver ewer to wash and to fan his mistress in hot weather See l i thirty one one hundred thirty seven Footnote eight Claudian l i in Eutrop l twenty two after enumerating the various prodigies of monstrous births speaking animals showers of blood or stones double suns c adds with some exaggeration Omnia cesserunt eunucho consule monstra The first book concludes with a noble speech of the goddess of Rome to her favorite Honorius deprecating the new ignominy to which she was exposed Footnote nine Fl Mallius Theodorus whose civil honors and philosophical works have been celebrated by Claudian in a very elegant panegyric The bold and vigorous mind of Rufinus seems to have been actuated by a more sanguinary and revengeful spirit but the avarice of the eunuch was not less insatiate than that of the praefect ten As long as he despoiled the oppressors who had enriched themselves with the plunder of the people Eutropius might gratify his covetous disposition without much envy or injustice but the progress of his rapine soon invaded the wealth which had been acquired by lawful inheritance or laudable industry The usual methods of extortion were practised and improved and Claudian has sketched a lively and original picture of the public auction of the state The impotence of the eunuch says that agreeable satirist has served only to stimulate his avarice the same hand which in his servile condition was exercised in petty thefts to unlock the coffers of his master now grasps the riches of the world and this infamous broker of the empire appreciates and divides the Roman provinces from Mount Haemus to the Tigris One man at the expense of his villa is made proconsul of Asia a second purchases Syria with his wife s jewels and a third laments that he has exchanged his paternal estate for the government of Bithynia In the antechamber of Eutropius a large tablet is exposed to public view which marks the respective prices of the provinces The different value of Pontus of Galatia of Lydia is accurately distinguished Lycia may be obtained for so many thousand pieces of gold but the opulence of Phrygia will require a more considerable sum The eunuch wishes to obliterate by the general disgrace his personal ignominy and as he has been sold himself he is desirous of selling the rest of mankind In the eager contention the balance which contains the fate and fortunes of the province often trembles on the beam and till one of the scales is inclined by a superior weight the mind of the impartial judge remains in anxious suspense eleven Such continues the indignant poet are the fruits of Roman valor of the defeat of Antiochus and of the triumph of Pompey This venal prostitution of public honors secured the impunity of future crimes but the riches which Eutropius derived from confiscation were already stained with injustice since it was decent to accuse and to condemn the proprietors of the wealth which he was impatient to confiscate Some noble blood was shed by the hand of the executioner and the most inhospitable extremities of the empire were filled with innocent and illustrious exiles Among the generals and consuls of the East Abundantius twelve had reason to dread the first effects of the resentment of Eutropius He had been guilty of the unpardonable crime of introducing that abject slave to the palace of Constantinople and some degree of praise must be allowed to a powerful and ungrateful favorite who was satisfied with the disgrace of his benefactor Abundantius was stripped of his ample fortunes by an Imperial rescript and banished to Pityus on the Euxine the last frontier of the Roman world where he subsisted by the precarious mercy of the Barbarians till he could obtain after the fall of Eutropius a milder exile at Sidon in Phoenicia The destruction of Timasius thirteen required a more serious and regular mode of attack That great officer the master general of the armies of Theodosius had signalized his valor by a decisive victory which he obtained over the Goths of Thessaly but he was too prone after the example of his sovereign to enjoy the luxury of peace and to abandon his confidence to wicked and designing flatterers Timasius had despised the public clamor by promoting an infamous dependant to the command of a cohort and he deserved to feel the ingratitude of Bargus who was secretly instigated by the favorite to accuse his patron of a treasonable conspiracy The general was arraigned before the tribunal of Arcadius himself and the principal eunuch stood by the side of the throne to suggest the questions and answers of his sovereign But as this form of trial might be deemed partial and arbitrary the further inquiry into the crimes of Timasius was delegated to Saturninus and Procopius the former of consular rank the latter still respected as the father in law of the emperor Valens The appearances of a fair and legal proceeding were maintained by the blunt honesty of Procopius and he yielded with reluctance to the obsequious dexterity of his colleague who pronounced a sentence of condemnation against the unfortunate Timasius His immense riches were confiscated in the name of the emperor and for the benefit of the favorite and he was doomed to perpetual exile a Oasis a solitary spot in the midst of the sandy deserts of Libya fourteen Secluded from all human converse the master general of the Roman armies was lost forever to the world but the circumstances of his fate have been related in a various and contradictory manner It is insinuated that Eutropius despatched a private order for his secret execution fifteen It was reported that in attempting to escape from Oasis he perished in the desert of thirst and hunger and that his dead body was found on the sands of Libya sixteen It has been asserted with more confidence that his son Syagrius after successfully eluding the pursuit of the agents and emissaries of the court collected a band of African robbers that he rescued Timasius from the place of his exile and that both the father and the son disappeared from the knowledge of mankind seventeen But the ungrateful Bargus instead of being suffered to possess the reward of guilt was soon after circumvented and destroyed by the more powerful villany of the minister himself who retained sense and spirit enough to abhor the instrument of his own crimes Footnote ten Drunk with riches is the forcible expression of Zosimus l v p three hundred one and the avarice of Eutropius is equally execrated in the Lexicon of Suidas and the Chronicle of Marcellinus Chrysostom had often admonished the favorite of the vanity and danger of immoderate wealth tom iii p three hundred eighty one certantum saepe duorum Diversum suspendit onus cum pondere judex Vergit et in geminas nutat provincia lances Claudian i one hundred ninety two two hundred nine so curiously distinguishes the circumstances of the sale that they all

hundred eighty three in Niebuhr eighty seven M Footnote sixteen Sozomen l viii c seven He speaks from report Footnote seventeen Zosimus l v p three hundred Yet he seems to suspect that this rumor was spread by the friends of Eutropius The public hatred and the despair of individuals continually threatened or seemed to threaten the personal safety of Eutropius as well as of the numerous adherents who were attached to his fortune and had been promoted by his venal favor For their mutual defence he contrived the safeguard of a law which violated every principal of humanity and justice eighteen I It is enacted in the name and by the authority of Arcadius that all those who should conspire either with subjects or with strangers against the lives of any of the persons whom the emperor considers as the members of his own body shall be punished with death and confiscation This species of fictitious and metaphorical treason is extended to protect not only the illustrious officers of the state and army who were admitted into the sacred consistory but likewise the principal domestics of the palace the senators of Constantinople the military commanders and the civil magistrates of the provinces a vague and indefinite list which under the successors of Constantine included an obscure and numerous train of subordinate ministers II This extreme severity might perhaps be justified had it been only directed to secure the representatives of the sovereign from any actual violence in the execution of their office But the whole body of Imperial dependants claimed a privilege or rather impunity which screened them in the loosest moments of their lives from the hasty perhaps the justifiable resentment of their fellow citizens and by a strange perversion of the laws the same degree of guilt and punishment was applied to a private quarrel and to a deliberate conspiracy against the emperor and the empire The edicts of Arcadius most positively and most absurdly declares that in such cases of treason thoughts and actions ought to be punished with equal severity that the knowledge of a mischievous intention unless it be instantly revealed becomes equally criminal with the intention itself nineteen and that those rash men who shall presume to solicit the pardon of traitors shall themselves be branded with public and perpetual infamy III With regard to the sons of the traitors continues the emperor although they ought to share the punishment since they will probably imitate the guilt of their parents yet by the special effect of our Imperial lenity we grant them their lives but at the same time we declare them incapable of inheriting either on the father s or on the mother s side or of receiving any gift or legacy from the testament either of kinsmen or of strangers Stigmatized with hereditary infamy excluded from the hopes of honors or fortune let them endure the pangs of poverty and contempt till they shall consider life as a calamity and death as a comfort and relief In such words so well adapted to insult the feelings of mankind did the emperor or rather his favorite eunuch applaud the moderation of a law which transferred the same unjust and inhuman penalties to the children of all those who had seconded or who had not disclosed their fictitious conspiracies Some of the noblest regulations of Roman jurisprudence have been suffered to expire but this edict a convenient and forcible engine of ministerial tyranny was carefully inserted in the codes of Theodosius and Justinian and the same maxims have been revived in modern ages to protect the electors of Germany and the cardinals of the church of Rome twenty Footnote eighteen See the Theodosian Code l ix tit fourteen ad legem Corneliam de Sicariis leg three and the Code of Justinian l ix tit viii viii ad legem Juliam de Majestate leg five The alteration of the title from murder to treason was an improvement of the subtle Tribonian Godefroy in a formal dissertation which he has inserted in his Commentary illustrates this law of Arcadius and explains all the difficult passages which had been perverted by the jurisconsults of the darker ages See tom iii p eighty eight one

part continues the discreet Heineccius Element Jur Civil l iv p four hundred eleven I must approve the theory of Bartolus but in practice I should incline to the sentiments of Baldus Yet Bartolus was gravely quoted by the lawyers of Cardinal Richelieu and Eutropius was indirectly guilty of the murder of the virtuous De Thou Footnote twenty Godefroy tom iii p eighty nine It is however suspected that this law so repugnant to the maxims of Germanic freedom has been surreptitiously added to the golden bull Yet these sanguinary laws which spread terror among a disarmed and dispirited people were of too weak a texture to restrain the bold enterprise of Tribigild twenty one the Ostrogoth The colony of that warlike nation which had been planted by Theodosius in one of the most fertile districts of Phrygia twenty two impatiently compared the slow returns of laborious husbandry with the successful rapine and liberal rewards of Alaric and their leader resented as a personal affront his own ungracious reception in the palace of Constantinople A soft and wealthy province in the heart of the empire was astonished by the sound of war and the faithful vassal who had been disregarded or oppressed was again respected as soon as he resumed the hostile character of a Barbarian The vineyards and fruitful fields between the rapid Marsyas and the winding Maeander twenty three were consumed with fire the decayed walls of the cities crumbled into dust at the first stroke of an enemy the trembling inhabitants escaped from a bloody massacre to the shores of the Hellespont and a considerable part of Asia Minor was desolated by the rebellion of Tribigild His rapid progress was checked by the resistance of the peasants of Pamphylia and the Ostrogoths attacked in a narrow pass between the city of Selgae twenty four a deep morass and the craggy cliffs of Mount Taurus were defeated with the loss of their bravest troops But the spirit of their chief was not daunted by misfortune and his army was continually recruited by swarms of Barbarians and outlaws who were desirous of exercising the profession of robbery under the more honorable names of war and conquest The rumors of the success of Tribigild might for some time be suppressed by fear or disguised by flattery yet they gradually alarmed both the court and the capital Every misfortune was exaggerated in dark and doubtful hints and the future designs of the rebels became the subject of anxious conjecture Whenever Tribigild advanced into the inland country the Romans were inclined to suppose that he meditated the passage of Mount Taurus and the invasion of Syria If he descended towards the sea they imputed and perhaps suggested to the Gothic chief the more dangerous project of arming a fleet in the harbors of Ionia and of extending his depredations along the maritime coast from the mouth of the Nile to the port of Constantinople The approach of danger and the obstinacy of Tribigild who refused all terms of accommodation compelled Eutropius to summon a council of war twenty five After claiming for himself the privilege of a veteran soldier the eunuch intrusted the guard of Thrace and the Hellespont to Gainas the Goth and the command of the Asiatic army to his favorite Leo two generals who differently but effectually promoted the cause of the rebels Leo twenty six who from the bulk of his body and the dulness of his mind was surnamed the Ajax of the East had deserted his original trade of a woolcomber to exercise with much less skill and success the military profession and his uncertain operations were capriciously framed and executed with an ignorance of real difficulties and a timorous neglect of every favorable opportunity The rashness of the Ostrogoths had drawn them into a disadvantageous position between the Rivers Melas and Eurymedon where they were almost besieged by the peasants of Pamphylia but the arrival of an Imperial army instead of completing their destruction afforded the means of safety and victory Tribigild surprised the unguarded camp of the Romans in the darkness of the night seduced the faith of the greater part of the Barbarian auxiliaries and dissipated without much effort the troops which had been corrupted by the relaxation of discipline and the luxury of the capital The discontent of Gainas who had so boldly contrived and executed the death of Rufinus was irritated by the fortune of his unworthy successor he accused his own dishonorable patience under the servile reign of a eunuch and the ambitious Goth was convicted at least in the public opinion of secretly fomenting the revolt of Tribigild with whom he was connected by a domestic as well as by a national alliance twenty seven When Gainas passed the Hellespont to unite under his standard the remains of the Asiatic troops he skilfully adapted his motions to the wishes of the Ostrogoths abandoning by his retreat the country which they desired to invade or facilitating by his approach the desertion of the Barbarian auxiliaries To the Imperial court he repeatedly magnified the valor the genius the inexhaustible resources of Tribigild confessed his own inability to prosecute the war and extorted the permission of negotiating with his invincible adversary The conditions of peace were dictated by the haughty rebel and the peremptory demand of the head of Eutropius revealed the author and the design of this hostile conspiracy Footnote twenty one A copious and circumstantial narrative which he might have reserved for more important events is bestowed by Zosimus l v p three hundred four three hundred twelve on the revolt of Tribigild and Gainas See likewise Socrates l vi c six and Sozomen l viii c four The second book of Claudian against Eutropius is a fine though imperfect piece of history Footnote twenty two Claudian in Eutrop l ii two hundred thirty seven two hundred fifty very accurately observes that the ancient name and nation of the Phrygians extended very far on every side till their limits were contracted by the colonies of the Bithvnians of Thrace of the Greeks and at last of the Gauls His description ii two hundred fifty seven two

Zosimus it was reduced to a small town See Cellarius Geograph Antiq tom ii p one hundred seventeen Footnote twenty five The council of Eutropius in Claudian may be compared to that of Domitian in the fourth Satire of Juvenal The principal members of the former were juvenes protervi lascivique senes one of them had been a cook a second a woolcomber The language of their original profession exposes their assumed dignity and their trifling conversation about tragedies dancers c is made still more ridiculous by the importance of the debate Footnote twenty six Claudian l ii three hundred seventy

Tribigild which is attested by the Greek historian had not reached the ears of Claudian who attributes the revolt of the Ostrogoth to his own martial spirit and the advice of his wife Chapter XXXII Emperors Arcadius Eutropius Theodosius II Part II The bold satirist who has indulged his discontent by the partial and passionate censure of the Christian emperors violates the dignity rather than the truth of history by comparing the son of Theodosius to one of those harmless and simple animals who scarcely feel that they are the property of their shepherd Two passions however fear and conjugal affection awakened the languid soul of Arcadius he was terrified by the threats of a victorious Barbarian and he yielded to the tender eloquence of his wife Eudoxia who with a flood of artificial tears presenting her infant children to their father implored his justice for some real or imaginary insult which she imputed to the audacious eunuch twenty eight The emperor s hand was directed to sign the condemnation of Eutropius the magic spell which during four years had bound the prince and the people was instantly dissolved and the acclamations that so lately hailed the merit and fortune of the favorite were converted into the clamors of the soldiers and people who reproached his crimes and pressed his immediate execution In this hour of distress and despair his only refuge was in the sanctuary of the church whose privileges he had wisely or profanely attempted to circumscribe and the most eloquent of the saints John Chrysostom enjoyed the triumph of protecting a prostrate minister whose choice had raised him to the ecclesiastical throne of Constantinople The archbishop ascending the pulpit of the cathedral that he might be distinctly seen and heard by an innumerable crowd of either sex and of every age pronounced a seasonable and pathetic discourse on the forgiveness of injuries and the instability of human greatness The agonies of the pale and affrighted wretch who lay grovelling under the table of the altar exhibited a solemn and instructive spectacle and the orator who was afterwards accused of insulting the misfortunes of Eutropius labored to excite the contempt that he might assuage the fury of the people twenty nine The powers of humanity of superstition and of eloquence prevailed The empress Eudoxia was restrained by her own prejudices or by those of her subjects from violating the sanctuary of the church and Eutropius was tempted to capitulate by the milder arts of persuasion and by an oath that his life should be spared thirty Careless of the dignity of their sovereign the new ministers of the palace immediately published an edict to declare that his late favorite had disgraced the names of consul and patrician to abolish his statues to confiscate his wealth and to inflict a perpetual exile in the Island of Cyprus thirty one A despicable and decrepit eunuch could no longer alarm the fears of his enemies nor was he capable of enjoying what yet remained the comforts of peace of solitude and of a happy climate But their implacable revenge still envied him the last moments of a miserable life and Eutropius had no sooner touched the shores of Cyprus than he was hastily recalled The vain hope of eluding by a change of place the obligation of an oath engaged the empress to transfer the scene of his trial and execution from Constantinople to the adjacent suburb of Chalcedon The consul Aurelian pronounced the sentence and the motives of that sentence expose the jurisprudence of a despotic government The crimes which Eutropius had committed against the people might have justified his death but he was found guilty of harnessing to his chariot the sacred animals who from their breed or color were reserved for the use of the emperor alone thirty two Footnote twenty eight This anecdote which Philostorgius alone has preserved l xi c six and Gothofred Dissertat p four hundred fifty one four hundred fifty six is curious and important since it connects the revolt of the Goths with the secret intrigues of the palace Footnote twenty nine See the Homily of Chrysostom tom iii p three hundred eighty one three

flight of the eunuch to the sanctuary Suppliciterque pias humilis prostratus ad aras Mitigat iratas voce tremente nurus Footnote thirty Chrysostom in another homily tom iii p three hundred eighty six

transacted Gainas thirty three openly revolted from his allegiance united his forces at Thyatira in Lydia with those of Tribigild and still maintained his superior ascendant over the rebellious leader of the Ostrogoths The confederate armies advanced without resistance to the straits of the Hellespont and the Bosphorus and Arcadius was instructed to prevent the loss of his Asiatic dominions by resigning his authority and his person to the faith of the Barbarians The church of the holy martyr Euphemia situate on a lofty eminence near Chalcedon thirty four was chosen for the place of the interview Gainas bowed with reverence at the feet of the emperor whilst he required the sacrifice of Aurelian and Saturninus two ministers of consular rank and their naked necks were exposed by the haughty rebel to the edge of the sword till he condescended to grant them a precarious and disgraceful respite The Goths according to the terms of the agreement were immediately transported from Asia into Europe and their victorious chief who accepted the title of master general of the Roman armies soon filled Constantinople with his troops and distributed among his dependants the honors and rewards of the empire In his early youth Gainas had passed the Danube as a suppliant and a fugitive his elevation had been the work of valor and fortune and his indiscreet or perfidious conduct was the cause of his rapid downfall Notwithstanding the vigorous opposition of the archbishop he importunately claimed for his Arian sectaries the possession of a peculiar church and the pride of the Catholics was offended by the public toleration of heresy thirty five Every quarter of Constantinople was filled with tumult and disorder and the Barbarians gazed with such ardor on the rich shops of the jewellers and the tables of the bankers which were covered with gold and silver that it was judged prudent to remove those dangerous temptations from their sight They resented the injurious precaution and some alarming attempts were made during the night to attack and destroy with fire the Imperial palace thirty six In this state of mutual and suspicious hostility the guards and the people of Constantinople shut the gates and rose in arms to prevent or to punish the conspiracy of the Goths During the absence of Gainas his troops were surprised and oppressed seven thousand Barbarians perished in this bloody massacre In the fury of the pursuit the Catholics uncovered the roof and continued to throw down flaming logs of wood till they overwhelmed their adversaries who had retreated to the church or conventicle of the Arians Gainas was either innocent of the design or too confident of his success he was astonished by the intelligence that the flower of his army had been ingloriously destroyed that he himself was declared a public enemy and that his countryman Fravitta a brave and loyal confederate had assumed the management of the war by sea and land The enterprises of the rebel against the cities of Thrace were encountered by a firm and well ordered defence his hungry soldiers were soon reduced to the grass that grew on the margin of the fortifications and Gainas who vainly regretted the wealth and luxury of Asia embraced a desperate resolution of forcing the passage of the Hellespont He was destitute of vessels but the woods of the Chersonesus afforded materials for rafts and his intrepid Barbarians did not refuse to trust themselves to the waves But Fravitta attentively watched the progress of their undertaking As soon as they had gained the middle of the stream the Roman galleys thirty seven impelled by the full force of oars of the current and of a favorable wind rushed forwards in compact order and with irresistible weight and the Hellespont was covered with the fragments of the Gothic shipwreck After the destruction of his hopes and the loss of many thousands of his bravest soldiers Gainas who could no longer aspire to govern or to subdue the Romans determined to resume the independence of a savage life A light and active body of Barbarian horse disengaged from their infantry and baggage might perform in eight or ten days a march of three hundred miles from the Hellespont to the Danube thirty eight the garrisons of that important frontier had been gradually annihilated the river in the month of December would be deeply frozen and the unbounded prospect of Scythia was opened to the ambition of Gainas This design was secretly communicated to the national troops who devoted themselves to the fortunes of their leader

marches through the plains of Thrace and they were soon delivered from the fear of a pursuit by the vanity of Fravitta three thousand eight hundred eleven who instead of extinguishing the war hastened to enjoy the popular applause and to assume the peaceful honors of the consulship But a formidable ally appeared in arms to vindicate the majesty of the empire and to guard the peace and liberty of Scythia thirty nine The superior forces of Uldin king of the Huns opposed the progress of Gainas a hostile and ruined country prohibited his retreat he disdained to capitulate and after repeatedly attempting to cut his way through the ranks of the enemy he was slain with his desperate followers in the field of battle Eleven days after the naval victory of the Hellespont the head of Gainas the inestimable gift of the conqueror was received at Constantinople with the most liberal expressions of gratitude and the public deliverance was celebrated by festivals and illuminations The triumphs of

insinuation that they were successful is disproved by facts Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom v p three hundred eighty three has discovered that the emperor to satisfy the rapacious demands of Gainas was obliged to melt the plate of the church of the apostles Footnote thirty six The ecclesiastical historians who sometimes guide and sometimes follow the public opinion most confidently assert that the palace of Constantinople was guarded by legions of angels Footnote thirty seven Zosmius l v p three hundred nineteen mentions these galleys by the name of Liburnians and observes that they were as swift without explaining the difference between them as the vessels with fifty oars but that they were far inferior in speed to the triremes which had been long disused Yet he reasonably concludes from the testimony of Polybius that galleys of a still larger size had been constructed in the Punic wars Since the establishment of the Roman empire over the Mediterranean the useless art of building large ships of war had probably been neglected and at length forgotten Footnote thirty eight Chishull Travels p sixty one sixty three seventy two seventy six proceeded from Gallipoli through

Audynaeus Footnote forty Eusebius Scholasticus acquired much fame by his poem on the Gothic war in which he had served Near forty years afterwards Ammonius recited another poem on the same subject in the presence of the emperor Theodosius See Socrates l vi c six After the death of the indolent Nectarius the successor of Gregory Nazianzen the church of Constantinople was distracted by the ambition of rival candidates who were not ashamed to solicit with gold or flattery the suffrage of the people or of the favorite On this occasion Eutropius seems to have deviated from his ordinary maxims and his uncorrupted judgment was determined only by the superior merit of a stranger In a late journey into the East he had admired the sermons of John a native and presbyter of Antioch whose name has been distinguished by the epithet of Chrysostom or the Golden Mouth forty one A private order was despatched to the governor of Syria and as the people might be unwilling to resign their favorite preacher he was transported with speed and secrecy in a post chariot from Antioch to Constantinople The unanimous and unsolicited consent of the court the clergy and the people ratified the choice of the minister and both as a saint and as an orator the new archbishop surpassed the sanguine expectations of the public Born of a noble and opulent family in the capital of Syria Chrysostom had been educated by the care of a tender mother under the tuition of the most skilful masters He studied the art of rhetoric in the school of Libanius and that celebrated sophist who soon discovered the talents of his disciple ingenuously confessed that John would have deserved to succeed him had he not been stolen away by the Christians His piety soon disposed him to receive the sacrament of baptism to renounce the lucrative and honorable profession of the law and to bury himself in the adjacent desert where he subdued the lusts of the flesh by an austere penance of six years His infirmities compelled him to return to the society of mankind and the authority of Meletius devoted his talents to the service of the church but in the midst of his family and afterwards on the archiepiscopal throne Chrysostom still persevered in the practice of the monastic virtues The ample revenues which his predecessors had consumed in pomp and luxury he diligently applied to the establishment of hospitals and the multitudes who were supported by his charity preferred the eloquent and edifying discourses of their archbishop to the amusements of the theatre or the circus The monuments of that eloquence which was admired near twenty years at Antioch and Constantinople have been carefully preserved and the possession of near one thousand sermons or homilies has authorized the critics forty two of succeeding times to appreciate the genuine merit of Chrysostom They unanimously attribute to the Christian orator the free command of an elegant and copious language the judgment to conceal the advantages which he derived from the knowledge of rhetoric and philosophy an inexhaustible fund of metaphors and similitudes of ideas and images to vary and illustrate the most familiar topics the happy art of engaging the passions in the service of virtue and of exposing the folly as well as the turpitude of vice almost with the truth and spirit of a dramatic representation Footnote forty one The sixth book of Socrates the eighth of Sozomen and the fifth of Theodoret afford curious and authentic materials for the life of John Chrysostom Besides those general historians I have taken for my guides the four principal biographers of the saint one The author of a partial and passionate Vindication of the archbishop of Constantinople composed in the form of a dialogue and under the name of his zealous partisan Palladius bishop of Helenopolis Tillemont Mem Eccles tom xi p five hundred five hundred thirty three It is inserted among the works of Chrysostom tom xiii p one ninety edit

lives of the saints with incredible patience and religious accuracy He has minutely searched the voluminous works of Chrysostom himself four Father Montfaucon who has perused those works with the curious diligence of an editor discovered several new homilies and again reviewed and composed the Life of Chrysostom Opera Chrysostom tom xiii p ninety one one hundred seventy seven Footnote forty two As I am almost a stranger to the voluminous sermons of Chrysostom I have given my confidence to the two most judicious and moderate of the ecclesiastical critics Erasmus tom iii p thirteen forty four and Dupin Bibliotheque Ecclesiastique tom iii p thirty eight yet the good taste of the former is sometimes vitiated by an excessive love of antiquity and the good sense of the latter is always restrained by prudential considerations The pastoral labors of the archbishop of Constantinople provoked and gradually united against him two sorts of enemies the aspiring clergy who envied his success and the obstinate sinners who were offended by his reproofs When Chrysostom thundered from the pulpit of saint Sophia against the degeneracy of the Christians his shafts were spent among the crowd without wounding or even marking the character of any individual When he declaimed against the peculiar vices of the rich poverty might obtain a transient consolation from his invectives but the guilty were still sheltered by their numbers and the reproach itself was dignified by some ideas of superiority and enjoyment But as the pyramid rose towards the summit it insensibly diminished to a point and the magistrates the ministers the favorite eunuchs the ladies of the court forty three the empress Eudoxia herself had a much larger share of guilt to divide among a smaller proportion of criminals The personal applications of the audience were anticipated or confirmed by the testimony of their own conscience and the intrepid preacher assumed the dangerous right of exposing both the offence and the offender to the public abhorrence The secret resentment of the court encouraged the discontent of the clergy and monks of Constantinople who were too hastily reformed by the fervent zeal of their archbishop He had condemned from the pulpit the domestic females of the clergy of Constantinople who under the name of servants or sisters afforded a perpetual occasion either of sin or of scandal The silent and solitary ascetics who had secluded themselves from the world were entitled to the warmest approbation of Chrysostom but he despised and stigmatized as the disgrace of their holy profession the crowd of degenerate monks who from some unworthy motives of pleasure or profit so frequently infested the streets of the capital To the voice of persuasion the archbishop was obliged to add the terrors of authority and his ardor in the exercise of ecclesiastical jurisdiction was not always exempt from passion nor was it always guided by prudence Chrysostom was naturally of a choleric disposition forty four Although he struggled according to the precepts of the gospel to love his private enemies he indulged himself in the privilege of hating the enemies of God and of the church and his sentiments were sometimes delivered with too much energy of countenance and expression He still maintained from some considerations of health or abstinence his former habits of taking his repasts alone and this inhospitable custom forty five which his enemies imputed to pride contributed at least to nourish the infirmity of a morose and unsocial humor Separated from that familiar intercourse which facilitates the knowledge and the despatch of business he reposed an unsuspecting confidence in his deacon Serapion and seldom applied his speculative knowledge of human nature to the particular character either of his dependants or of his equals Conscious of the purity of his intentions and perhaps of the superiority of his genius the archbishop of Constantinople extended the jurisdiction of the Imperial city that he might enlarge the sphere of his pastoral labors and the conduct which the profane imputed to an ambitious motive appeared to Chrysostom himself in the light of a sacred and indispensable duty In his visitation through the Asiatic provinces he deposed thirteen bishops of Lydia and Phrygia and indiscreetly declared that a deep corruption of simony and licentiousness had infected the whole episcopal order forty six If those bishops were innocent such a rash and unjust condemnation must excite a well grounded discontent If they were guilty the numerous associates of their guilt would soon discover that their own safety depended on the ruin of the archbishop whom they studied to represent as the tyrant of the Eastern church Footnote forty

persecution Pallad Dialog tom xiii p fourteen It was impossible that they should forgive a preacher who reproached their affectation to conceal by the ornaments of dress their age and ugliness Pallad

Sozomen and more especially Socrates have defined the real character of Chrysostom with a temperate and impartial freedom very offensive to his blind admirers Those historians lived in the next generation when party violence was abated and had conversed with many persons intimately acquainted with the virtues and imperfections of the saint Footnote forty five Palladius tom xiii p forty c very seriously defends the archbishop one He never tasted wine two The weakness of his stomach required a peculiar diet three Business or study or devotion often kept him fasting till sunset four He detested the noise and levity of great dinners five He saved the expense for the use of the poor six He was apprehensive in a capital like Constantinople of the envy and reproach of partial invitations Footnote forty six Chrysostom declares his free opinion tom ix hom iii in Act Apostol p twenty nine that the number of bishops who might be saved bore a very small proportion to those who would be damned This ecclesiastical conspiracy was managed by Theophilus forty seven archbishop of Alexandria an active and ambitious prelate who displayed the fruits of rapine in monuments of ostentation His national dislike to the rising greatness of a city which degraded him from the second to the third rank in the Christian world was exasperated by some personal dispute with Chrysostom himself forty eight By the private invitation of the empress Theophilus landed at Constantinople with a stou body of Egyptian mariners to encounter the populace and a train of dependent bishops to secure by their voices the majority of a synod The synod forty nine was convened in the suburb of Chalcedon surnamed the Oak where Rufinus had erected a stately church and monastery and their proceedings were continued during fourteen days or sessions A bishop and a deacon accused the archbishop of Constantinople but the frivolous or improbable nature of the forty seven articles which they presented against him may justly be considered as a fair and unexceptional panegyric Four successive summons were signified to Chrysostom but he still refused to trust either his person or his reputation in the hands of his implacable enemies who prudently declining the examination of any particular charges condemned his contumacious disobedience and hastily pronounced a sentence of deposition The synod of the Oak immediately addressed the emperor to ratify and execute their judgment and charitably insinuated that the penalties of treason might be inflicted on the audacious preacher who had reviled under the name of Jezebel the empress Eudoxia herself The archbishop was rudely arrested and conducted through the city by one of the Imperial messengers who landed him after a short navigation near the entrance of the Euxine from whence before the expiration of two days he was gloriously recalled Footnote forty seven See Tillemont Mem Eccles tom xi p four hundred forty

Theophilus his artful management of the simplicity of Epiphanius the persecution and flight of the long or tall brothers the ambiguous support which they received at Constantinople from Chrysostom c c Footnote forty nine Photius p fifty three sixty has preserved the original acts of the synod of the Oak which destroys the false assertion that Chrysostom was condemned by no more than thirty six bishops of whom twenty nine were Egyptians Forty five bishops subscribed his sentence See Tillemont Mem Eccles tom xi p five hundred ninety five Note Tillemont argues strongly for the number of thirty six M The first astonishment of his faithful people had been mute and passive they suddenly rose with unanimous and irresistible fury Theophilus escaped but the promiscuous crowd of monks and Egyptian mariners was slaughtered without pity in the streets of Constantinople fifty A seasonable earthquake justified the interposition of Heaven the torrent of sedition rolled forwards to the gates of the palace and the empress agitated by fear or remorse threw herself at the feet of Arcadius and confessed that the public safety could be purchased only by the restoration of Chrysostom The Bosphorus was covered with innumerable vessels the shores of Europe and Asia were profusely illuminated and the acclamations of a victorious people accompanied from the port to the cathedral the triumph of the archbishop who too easily consented to resume the exercise of his functions before his sentence had been legally reversed by the authority of an ecclesiastical synod Ignorant or careless of the impending danger Chrysostom indulged his zeal or perhaps his resentment declaimed with peculiar asperity against female vices and condemned the profane honors which were addressed almost in the precincts of saint Sophia to the statue of the empress His imprudence tempted his enemies to inflame the haughty spirit of Eudoxia by reporting or perhaps inventing the famous exordium of a sermon Herodias is again furious Herodias again dances she once more requires the head of John an insolent allusion which as a woman and a sovereign it was impossible for her to forgive fifty one The short interval of a perfidious truce was employed to concert more effectual measures for the disgrace and ruin of the archbishop A numerous council of the Eastern prelates who were guided from a distance by the advice of Theophilus confirmed the validity without examining the justice of the former sentence and a detachment of Barbarian troops was introduced into the city to suppress the emotions of the people On the vigil of Easter the solemn administration of baptism was rudely interrupted by the soldiers who alarmed the modesty of the naked catechumens and violated by their presence the awful mysteries of the Christian worship Arsacius occupied the church of saint Sophia and the archiepiscopal throne The Catholics retreated to the baths of Constantine and afterwards to the fields where they were still pursued and insulted by the guards the bishops and the magistrates The fatal day of the second and final exile of Chrysostom was marked by the conflagration of the cathedral of the senate house and of the adjacent buildings and this calamity was imputed without proof but not without probability to the despair of a persecuted faction fifty two Footnote fifty Palladius owns p

eighteen and the Paschal Chronicle p three hundred seven Cicero might claim some merit if his voluntary banishment preserved the peace of the republic fifty three but the submission of Chrysostom was the indispensable duty of a Christian and a subject Instead of listening to his humble prayer that he might be permitted to reside at Cyzicus or Nicomedia the inflexible empress assigned for his exile the remote and desolate town of Cucusus among the ridges of Mount Taurus in the Lesser Armenia A secret hope was entertained that the archbishop might perish in a difficult and dangerous march of seventy days in the heat of summer through the provinces of Asia Minor where he was continually threatened by the hostile attacks of the Isaurians and the more implacable fury of the monks Yet Chrysostom arrived in safety at the place of his confinement and the three years which he spent at Cucusus and the neighboring town of Arabissus were the last and most glorious of his life His character was consecrated by absence and persecution the faults of his administration were no longer remembered but every tongue repeated the praises of his genius and virtue and the respectful attention of the Christian world was fixed on a desert spot among the mountains of Taurus From that solitude the archbishop whose active mind was invigorated by misfortunes maintained a strict and frequent correspondence fifty four with the most distant provinces exhorted the separate congregation of his faithful adherents to persevere in their allegiance urged the destruction of the temples of Phoenicia and the extirpation of heresy in the Isle of Cyprus extended his pastoral care to the missions of Persia and Scythia negotiated by his ambassadors with the Roman pontiff and the emperor Honorius and boldly appealed from a partial synod to the supreme tribunal of a free and general council The mind of the illustrious exile was still independent but his captive body was exposed to the revenge of the oppressors who continued to abuse the name and authority of Arcadius fifty five An order was despatched for the instant removal of Chrysostom to the extreme desert of Pityus and his guards so faithfully obeyed their cruel instructions that before he reached the sea coast of the Euxine he expired at Comana in Pontus in the sixtieth year of his age The succeeding generation acknowledged his innocence and merit The archbishops of the East who might blush that their predecessors had been the enemies of Chrysostom were gradually disposed by the firmness of the Roman pontiff to restore the honors of that venerable name fifty six At the pious solicitation of the clergy and people of Constantinople his relics thirty years after his death were transported from their obscure sepulchre to the royal city fifty seven The emperor Theodosius advanced to receive them as far as Chalcedon and falling prostrate on the coffin implored in the name of his guilty parents Arcadius and

Chrysostom Theophilus published an enormous and horrible volume against him in which he perpetually repeats the polite expressions of hostem humanitatis sacrilegorum principem immundum daemonem he affirms that John Chrysostom had delivered his soul to be adulterated by the devil and wishes that some further punishment adequate if possible to the magnitude of his crimes may be inflicted on him

stain of hereditary guilt could be derived from Arcadius to his successor Eudoxia was a young and beautiful woman who indulged her passions and despised her husband Count John enjoyed at least the familiar confidence of the empress and the public named him as the real father of Theodosius the younger fifty nine The birth of a son was accepted however by the pious husband as an event the most fortunate and honorable to himself to his family and to the Eastern world and the royal infant by an unprecedented favor was invested with the titles of Caesar and Augustus In less than four years afterwards Eudoxia in the bloom of youth was destroyed by the consequences of a miscarriage and this untimely death confounded the prophecy of a holy bishop sixty who amidst the universal joy had ventured to foretell that she should behold the long and auspicious reign of her glorious son The Catholics applauded the justice of Heaven which avenged the persecution of saint Chrysostom and perhaps the emperor was the only person who sincerely bewailed the loss of the haughty and rapacious Eudoxia Such a domestic misfortune afflicted him more deeply than the public calamities of the East sixty one the licentious excursions from Pontus to Palestine of the Isaurian robbers whose impunity accused the weakness of the government and the earthquakes the conflagrations the famine and the flights of locusts sixty two which the popular discontent was equally disposed to attribute to the incapacity of the monarch At length in the thirty first year of his age after a reign if we may abuse that word of thirteen years three months and fifteen days Arcadius expired in the palace of Constantinople It is impossible to delineate his character since in a period very copiously furnished with historical materials it has not been possible to remark one action that properly belongs to the son of the great Theodosius Footnote fifty nine Zosimus l v p three hundred fifteen The chastity of an empress should not be impeached without producing a witness but it is astonishing that the witness should write and live under a prince whose legitimacy he dared to attack We must suppose that his history was a party libel privately read and circulated by the Pagans Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom v p seven hundred eighty two is not averse to brand the reputation of Eudoxia Footnote sixty

the land of Palestine Seasonable winds scattered them partly into the Dead Sea and partly into the Mediterranean The historian Procopius sixty three has indeed illuminated the mind of the dying emperor with a ray of human prudence or celestial wisdom Arcadius considered with anxious foresight the helpless condition of his son Theodosius who was no more than seven years of age the dangerous factions of a minority and the aspiring spirit of Jezdegerd the Persian monarch Instead of tempting the allegiance of an ambitious subject by the participation of supreme power he boldly appealed to the magnanimity of a king and placed by a solemn testament the sceptre of the East in the hands of Jezdegerd himself The royal guardian accepted and discharged this honorable trust with unexampled fidelity and the infancy of Theodosius was protected by the arms and councils of Persia Such is the singular narrative of Procopius and his veracity is not disputed by Agathias sixty four while he presumes to dissent from his judgment and to arraign the wisdom of a Christian emperor who so rashly though so fortunately committed his son and his dominions to the unknown faith of a stranger a rival and a heathen At the distance of one hundred and fifty years this political question might be debated in the court of Justinian but a prudent historian will refuse to examine the propriety till he has ascertained the truth of the testament of Arcadius As it stands without a parallel in the history of the world we may justly require that it should be attested by the positive and unanimous evidence of contemporaries The strange novelty of the event which excites our distrust must have attracted their notice and their universal silence annihilates the vain tradition of the succeeding age Footnote sixty three Procopius de Bell Persic l i c two p eight edit Louvre Footnote sixty four Agathias l iv p one hundred thirty six one hundred thirty seven Although he confesses the prevalence of the tradition he asserts that Procopius was the first who had committed it to writing Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom vi p five hundred ninety seven argues very sensibly on the merits of this fable His criticism was not warped by any ecclesiastical authority both Procopius and Agathias are half Pagans Note See saint Martin s article on Jezdegerd in the Biographie Universelle de Michand M The maxims of Roman jurisprudence if they could fairly be transferred from private property to public dominion would have adjudged to the emperor Honorius the guardianship of his nephew till he had attained at least the fourteenth year of his age But the weakness of Honorius and the calamities of his reign disqualified him from prosecuting this natural claim and such was the absolute separation of the two monarchies both in interest and affection that Constantinople would have obeyed with less reluctance the orders of the Persian than those of the Italian court Under a prince whose weakness is disguised by the external signs of manhood and discretion the most worthless favorites may secretly dispute the empire of the palace and dictate to submissive provinces the commands of a master whom they direct and despise But the ministers of a child who is incapable of arming them with the sanction of the royal name must acquire and exercise an independent authority The great officers of the state and army who had been appointed before the death of Arcadius formed an aristocracy which might have inspired them with the idea of a free republic and the government of the Eastern empire was fortunately assumed by the praefect Anthemius sixty five who obtained by his superior abilities a lasting ascendant over the minds of his equals The safety of the young emperor proved the merit and integrity of Anthemius and his prudent firmness sustained the force and reputation of an infant reign Uldin with a formidable host of Barbarians was encamped in the heart of Thrace he proudly rejected all terms of accommodation and pointing to the rising sun declared to the Roman ambassadors that the course of that planet should alone terminate the conquest of the Huns But the desertion of his confederates who were privately convinced of the justice and liberality of the Imperial ministers obliged Uldin to repass the Danube the tribe of the Scyrri which composed his rear guard was almost extirpated and many thousand captives were dispersed to cultivate with servile labor the fields of Asia sixty six In the midst of the public triumph Constantinople was protected by a strong enclosure of new and more extensive walls the same vigilant care was applied to restore the fortifications of the Illyrian cities and a plan was judiciously conceived which in the space of seven years would have secured the command of the Danube by establishing on that river a perpetual fleet of two hundred and fifty armed vessels sixty seven Footnote sixty five Socrates l vii c l Anthemius was the grandson of Philip one of the ministers of Constantius and the grandfather of the emperor Anthemius After his return from the Persian embassy he was appointed consul and Praetorian praefect of the

tit xvi l xv tit i leg forty nine But the Romans had so long been accustomed to the authority of a monarch that the first even among the females of the Imperial family who displayed any courage or capacity was permitted to ascend the vacant throne of Theodosius His sister Pulcheria sixty eight who was only two years older than himself received at the age of sixteen the title of Augusta and though her favor might be sometimes clouded by caprice or intrigue she continued to govern the Eastern empire near forty years during the long minority of her brother and after his death in her own name and in the name of Marcian her nominal husband From a motive either of prudence or religion she embraced a life of celibacy and notwithstanding some aspersions on the chastity of Pulcheria sixty nine this resolution which she communicated to her sisters Arcadia and Marina was celebrated by the Christian world as the sublime effort of heroic piety In the presence of the clergy and people the three daughters of Arcadius seventy dedicated their virginity to God and the obligation of their solemn vow was inscribed on a tablet of gold and gems which they publicly offered in the great church of Constantinople Their palace was converted into a monastery and all males except the guides of their conscience the saints who had forgotten the distinction of sexes were scrupulously excluded from the holy threshold Pulcheria her two sisters and a chosen train of favorite damsels formed a religious community they denounced the vanity of dress interrupted by frequent fasts their simple and frugal diet allotted a portion of their time to works of embroidery and devoted several hours of the day and night to the exercises of prayer and psalmody The piety of a Christian virgin was adorned by the zeal and liberality of an empress Ecclesiastical history describes the splendid churches which were built at the expense of Pulcheria in all the provinces of the East her charitable foundations for the benefit of strangers and the poor the ample donations which she assigned for the perpetual maintenance of monastic societies and the active severity with which she labored to suppress the opposite heresies of Nestorius and Eutyches Such virtues were supposed to deserve the peculiar favor of the Deity and the relics of martyrs as well as the knowledge of future events were communicated in visions and revelations to the Imperial saint seventy one Yet the devotion of Pulcheria never diverted her indefatigable attention from temporal affairs and she alone among all the descendants of the great Theodosius appears to have inherited any share of his manly spirit and abilities The elegant and familiar use which she had acquired both of the Greek and Latin languages was readily applied to the various occasions of speaking or writing on public business her deliberations were maturely weighed her actions were prompt and decisive and while she moved without noise or ostentation the wheel of government she discreetly attributed to the genius of the emperor the long tranquillity of his reign In the last years of his peaceful life Europe was indeed afflicted by the arms of war but the more extensive provinces of Asia still continued to enjoy a profound and permanent repose Theodosius the younger was never reduced to the disgraceful necessity of encountering and punishing a rebellious subject and since we cannot applaud the vigor some praise may be due to the mildness and prosperity of the administration of Pulcheria Footnote sixty eight Sozomen has filled three chapters

Jortin Remarks tom iv p two hundred thirty four it is not easy to acquit Pulcheria of some share in the pious fraud which must have been transacted when she was more than five and thirty years of age The Roman world was deeply interested in the education of its master A regular course of study and exercise was judiciously instituted of the military exercises of riding and shooting with the bow of the liberal studies of grammar rhetoric and philosophy the most skilful masters of the East ambitiously solicited the attention of their royal pupil and several noble youths were introduced into the palace to animate his diligence by the emulation of friendship Pulcheria alone discharged the important task of instructing her brother in the arts of government but her precepts may countenance some suspicions of the extent of her capacity or of the purity of her intentions She taught him to maintain a grave and majestic deportment to walk to hold his robes to seat himself on his throne in a manner worthy of a great prince to abstain from laughter to listen with condescension to return suitable answers to assume by turns a serious or a placid countenance in a word to represent with grace and dignity the external figure of a Roman emperor But Theodosius seventy two was never excited to support the weight and glory of an illustrious name and instead of aspiring to support his ancestors he degenerated if we may presume to measure the degrees of incapacity below the weakness of his father and his uncle Arcadius and Honorius had been assisted by the guardian care of a parent whose lessons were enforced by his authority and example But the unfortunate prince who is born in the purple must remain a stranger to the voice of truth and the son of Arcadius was condemned to pass his perpetual infancy encompassed only by a servile train of women and eunuchs The ample leisure which he acquired by neglecting the essential duties of his high office was filled by idle amusements and unprofitable studies Hunting was the only active pursuit that could tempt him beyond the limits of the palace but he most assiduously labored sometimes by the light of a midnight lamp in the mechanic occupations of painting and carving and the elegance with which he transcribed religious books entitled the Roman emperor to the singular epithet of Calligraphes or a fair writer Separated from the world by an impenetrable veil Theodosius trusted the persons whom he loved he loved those who were accustomed to amuse and flatter his indolence and as he never perused the papers that were presented for the royal signature the acts of injustice the most repugnant to his character were frequently perpetrated in his name The emperor himself was chaste temperate liberal and merciful but these qualities which can only deserve the name of virtues when they are supported by courage and regulated by discretion were seldom beneficial and they sometimes proved mischievous to mankind His mind enervated by a royal education was oppressed and degraded by abject superstition he fasted he sung psalms he blindly accepted the miracles and doctrines with which his faith was continually nourished Theodosius devoutly worshipped the dead and living saints of the Catholic church and he once refused to eat till an insolent monk who had cast an excommunication on his sovereign condescended to heal the spiritual wound which he had inflicted seventy three Footnote seventy two There is a remarkable difference between the two ecclesiastical historians who in general bear so close a resemblance Sozomen l ix c one ascribes to Pulcheria the government of the empire and the education of her brother whom he scarcely condescends to praise Socrates though he affectedly disclaims all hopes of favor or fame composes an elaborate panegyric on the emperor and cautiously suppresses the merits of his sister l vii c twenty two forty two Philostorgius l xii c seven expresses the influence of Pulcheria in gentle and courtly language Suidas Excerpt p fifty three gives a true character of Theodosius and I have followed the example of Tillemont tom vi p twenty five in borrowing some strokes from the modern Greeks Footnote seventy three Theodoret l v c thirty seven The bishop of Cyrrhus one of the first men of his age for his learning and piety applauds the obedience of Theodosius to the divine laws The story of a fair and virtuous maiden exalted from a private condition to the Imperial throne might be deemed an incredible romance if such a romance had not been verified in the marriage of Theodosius The celebrated Athenais seventy four was educated by her father Leontius in the religion and sciences of the Greeks and so advantageous was the opinion which the Athenian philosopher entertained of his contemporaries that he divided his patrimony between his two sons bequeathing to his daughter a small legacy of one hundred pieces of gold in the lively confidence that her beauty and merit would be a sufficient portion The jealousy and avarice of her brothers soon compelled Athenais to seek a refuge at Constantinople and with some hopes either of justice or favor to throw herself at the feet of Pulcheria That sagacious princess listened to her eloquent complaint and secretly destined the daughter of the philosopher Leontius for the future wife of the emperor of the East who had now attained the twentieth year of his age She easily excited the curiosity of her brother by an interesting picture of the charms of Athenais large eyes a well proportioned nose a fair complexion golden locks a slender person a graceful demeanor an understanding improved by study and a virtue tried by distress Theodosius concealed behind a curtain in the apartment of his sister was permitted to behold the Athenian virgin the modest youth immediately declared his pure and honorable love and the royal nuptials were celebrated amidst the acclamations of the capital and the provinces Athenais who was easily persuaded to renounce the errors of Paganism received at her baptism the Christian name of Eudocia but the cautious Pulcheria withheld the title of Augusta till the wife of Theodosius had approved her fruitfulness by the birth of a daughter who espoused fifteen years afterwards the emperor of the West The brothers of Eudocia obeyed with some anxiety her Imperial summons but as she could easily forgive their unfortunate unkindness she indulged the tenderness or perhaps the vanity of a sister by promoting them to the rank of consuls and praefects In the luxury of the palace she still cultivated those ingenuous arts which had contributed to her greatness and wisely dedicated her talents to the honor of religion and of her husband Eudocia composed a poetical paraphrase of the first eight books of the Old Testament and of the prophecies of Daniel and Zechariah a cento of the verses of Homer applied to the life and miracles of Christ the legend of saint Cyprian and a panegyric on the Persian victories of Theodosius and her writings which were applauded by a servile and superstitious age have not been disdained by the candor of impartial criticism seventy five The fondness of the emperor was not abated by time and possession and Eudocia after the marriage of her daughter was permitted to discharge her grateful vows by a solemn pilgrimage to Jerusalem Her ostentatious progress through the East may seem inconsistent with the spirit of Christian humility she pronounced from a throne of gold and gems an eloquent oration to the senate of Antioch declared her royal intention of enlarging the walls of the city bestowed a donative of two hundred pounds of gold to restore the public baths and accepted the statues which were decreed by the gratitude of Antioch In the Holy Land her alms and pious foundations exceeded the munificence of the great Helena and though the public treasure might be impoverished by this excessive liberality she enjoyed the conscious satisfaction of returning to Constantinople with the chains of saint Peter the right arm of saint Stephen and an undoubted picture of the Virgin painted by saint Luke seventy six But this pilgrimage was the fatal term of the glories of Eudocia Satiated with empty pomp and unmindful perhaps of her obligations to Pulcheria she ambitiously aspired to the government of the Eastern empire the palace was distracted by female discord but the victory was at last decided by the superior ascendant of the sister of Theodosius The execution of Paulinus master of the offices and the disgrace of Cyrus Praetorian praefect of the East convinced the public that the favor of Eudocia was insufficient to protect her most faithful friends and the uncommon beauty of Paulinus encouraged the secret rumor that his guilt was that of a successful lover seventy seven As soon as the empress perceived that the affection of Theodosius was irretrievably lost she requested the permission of retiring to the distant solitude of Jerusalem She obtained her request but the jealousy of Theodosius or the vindictive spirit of Pulcheria pursued her in her last retreat and Saturninus count of the domestics was directed to punish with death two ecclesiastics her most favored servants Eudocia instantly revenged them by the assassination of the count the furious passions which she indulged on this suspicious occasion seemed to justify the severity of Theodosius and the empress ignominiously stripped of the honors of her rank seventy eight was disgraced perhaps unjustly in the eyes of the world The remainder of the life of Eudocia about sixteen years was spent in exile and devotion and the approach of age the death of Theodosius the misfortunes of her only daughter who was led a captive from Rome to Carthage and the society of the Holy Monks of Palestine insensibly confirmed the religious temper of her mind After a full experience of the vicissitudes of human life the daughter of the philosopher Leontius expired at Jerusalem in the sixty seventh year of her age protesting with her dying breath that she had never transgressed the bounds of innocence and friendship

of her history is in John Malala part ii p twenty twenty one edit Venet seventeen forty three and in the Paschal Chronicle p three hundred eleven three hundred twelve Those authors had probably seen original pictures of the empress Eudocia The modern Greeks Zonaras Cedrenus c have displayed the love rather than the talent of fiction From Nicephorus indeed I have ventured to assume her age The writer of a romance would not have imagined that Athenais was near twenty eight years old when she inflamed the heart of a young emperor Footnote seventy five Socrates l vii c twenty one Photius p

Guenee in a memoir on the fertility of Palestine of which I have only seen an extract calculates the gifts of Eudocia at twenty thousand four hundred eighty eight pounds of gold above eight hundred thousand pounds sterling The gentle mind of Theodosius was never inflamed by the ambition of conquest or military renown and the slight alarm of a Persian war scarcely interrupted the tranquillity of the East The motives of this war were just and honorable In the last year of the reign of Jezdegerd the supposed guardian of Theodosius a bishop who aspired to the crown of martyrdom destroyed one of the fire temples of Susa eighty His zeal and obstinacy were revenged on his brethren the Magi excited a cruel persecution and the intolerant zeal of Jezdegerd was imitated by his son Varanes or Bahram who soon afterwards ascended the throne Some Christian fugitives who escaped to the Roman frontier were sternly demanded and generously refused and the refusal aggravated by commercial disputes soon kindled a war between the rival monarchies The mountains of Armenia and the plains of Mesopotamia were filled with hostile armies but the operations of two successive campaigns were not productive of any decisive or memorable events Some engagements were fought some towns were besieged with various and doubtful success and if the Romans failed in their attempt to recover the long lost possession of Nisibis the Persians were repulsed from the walls of a Mesopotamian city by the valor of a martial bishop who pointed his thundering engine in the name of saint Thomas the Apostle Yet the splendid victories which the incredible speed of the messenger Palladius repeatedly announced to the palace of Constantinople were celebrated with festivals and panegyrics From these panegyrics the historians eighty one of the age might borrow their extraordinary and perhaps fabulous tales of the proud challenge of a Persian hero who was entangled by the net and despatched by the sword of Areobindus the Goth of the ten thousand Immortals who were slain in the attack of the Roman camp and of the hundred thousand Arabs or Saracens who were impelled by a panic terror to throw themselves headlong into the Euphrates Such events may be disbelieved or disregarded but the charity of a bishop Acacius of Amida whose name might have dignified the saintly calendar shall not be lost in oblivion Boldly declaring that vases of gold and silver are useless to a God who neither eats nor drinks the generous prelate sold the plate of the church of Amida employed the price in the redemption of seven thousand Persian captives supplied their wants with affectionate liberality and dismissed them to their native country to inform their king of the true spirit of the religion which he persecuted The practice of benevolence in the midst of war must always tend to assuage the animosity of contending nations and I wish to persuade myself that Acacius contributed to the restoration of peace In the conference which was held on the limits of the two empires the Roman ambassadors degraded the personal character of their sovereign by a vain attempt to magnify the extent of his power when they seriously advised the Persians to prevent by a timely accommodation the wrath of a monarch who was yet ignorant of this distant war A truce of one hundred years was solemnly ratified and although the revolutions of Armenia might threaten the public tranquillity the essential conditions of this treaty were respected near fourscore years by the successors of Constantine and Artaxerxes Footnote

Theodoret blames the rashness of Abdas but extols the constancy of his martyrdom Yet I do not clearly understand the casuistry which prohibits our repairing the damage which we have unlawfully committed Footnote eighty one Socrates l vii c eighteen nineteen twenty twenty one is the best author for the Persian war We may likewise consult the three Chronicles the Paschal and those of Marcellinus and Malala Since the Roman and Parthian standards first encountered on the banks of the Euphrates the kingdom of Armenia eighty two was alternately oppressed by its formidable protectors and in the course of this History several events which inclined the balance of peace and war have been already related A disgraceful treaty had resigned Armenia to the ambition of Sapor and the scale of Persia appeared to preponderate But the royal race of Arsaces impatiently submitted to the house of Sassan the turbulent nobles asserted or betrayed their hereditary independence and the nation was still attached to the Christian princes of Constantinople In the beginning of the fifth century Armenia was divided by the progress of war and faction eighty three and the unnatural division precipitated the downfall of that ancient monarchy Chosroes the Persian vassal reigned over the Eastern and most extensive portion of the country while the Western province acknowledged the jurisdiction of Arsaces and the supremacy of the emperor Arcadius eight thousand one hundred eleven After the death of Arsaces the Romans suppressed the regal government and imposed on their allies the condition of subjects The military command was delegated to the count of the Armenian frontier the city of Theodosiopolis eighty four was built and fortified in a strong situation on a fertile and lofty ground near the sources of the Euphrates and the dependent territories were ruled by five satraps whose dignity was marked by a peculiar habit of gold and purple The less fortunate nobles who lamented the loss of their king and envied the honors of their equals were provoked to negotiate their peace and pardon at the Persian court and returning with their followers to the palace of Artaxata acknowledged Chosroes eight thousand four hundred eleven for their lawful sovereign About thirty years afterwards Artasires the nephew and successor of Chosroes fell under the displeasure of the haughty and capricious nobles of Armenia and they unanimously desired a Persian governor in the room of an unworthy king The answer of the archbishop Isaac whose sanction they earnestly solicited is expressive of the character of a superstitious people He deplored the manifest and inexcusable vices of Artasires and declared that he should not hesitate to accuse him before the tribunal of a Christian emperor who would punish without destroying the sinner Our king continued Isaac is too much addicted to licentious pleasures but he has been purified in the holy waters of baptism He is a lover of women but he does not adore the fire or the elements He may deserve the reproach of lewdness but he is an undoubted Catholic and his faith is pure though his manners are flagitious I will never consent to abandon my sheep to the rage of devouring wolves and you would soon repent your rash exchange of the infirmities of a believer for the specious virtues of a heathen eighty five Exasperated by the firmness of Isaac the factious nobles accused both the king and the archbishop as the secret adherents of the emperor and absurdly rejoiced in the sentence of condemnation which after a partial hearing was solemnly pronounced by Bahram himself The descendants of Arsaces were degraded from the royal dignity eighty six which they had possessed above five hundred and sixty years eighty seven and the dominions of the unfortunate Artasires eight thousand seven hundred eleven under the new and significant appellation of Persarmenia were reduced into the form of a province This usurpation excited the jealousy of the Roman government but the rising disputes were soon terminated by an amicable though unequal partition of the ancient kingdom of Armenia eight thousand seven hundred twelve and a territorial acquisition which Augustus might have despised reflected some lustre on the declining empire of the younger Theodosius Footnote eighty two This account of the ruin and division of the kingdom of Armenia is taken from the third book of the Armenian history of Moses of Chorene Deficient as he is in every qualification of a good historian his local information his passions and his prejudices are strongly expressive of a native and contemporary Procopius de Edificiis l iii c one five relates the same facts in a very different manner but I have extracted the circumstances the most probable in themselves and the least inconsistent with Moses of Chorene Footnote eighty three The western Armenians used the Greek language and characters in their religious offices but the use of that hostile tongue was prohibited by the Persians in the Eastern provinces which were obliged to use the Syriac till the invention of the Armenian letters by Mesrobes in the

Mother Placidia Aetius And Boniface Conquest Of Africa By The Vandals During a long and disgraceful reign of twenty eight years Honorius emperor of the West was separated from the friendship of his brother and afterwards of his nephew who reigned over the East and Constantinople beheld with apparent indifference and secret joy the calamities of Rome The strange adventures of Placidia one gradually renewed and cemented the alliance of the two empires The daughter of the great Theodosius had been the captive and the queen of the Goths she lost an affectionate husband she was dragged in chains by his insulting assassin she tasted the pleasure of revenge and was exchanged in the treaty of peace for six hundred thousand measures of wheat After her return from Spain to Italy Placidia experienced a new persecution in the bosom of her family She was averse to a marriage which had been stipulated without her consent and the brave Constantius as a noble reward for the tyrants whom he had vanquished received from the hand of Honorius himself the struggling and the reluctant hand of the widow of Adolphus But her resistance ended with the ceremony of the nuptials nor did Placidia refuse to become the mother of Honoria and Valentinian the Third or to assume and exercise an absolute dominion over the mind of her grateful husband The generous soldier whose time had hitherto been divided between social pleasure and military service was taught new lessons of avarice and ambition he extorted the title of Augustus and the servant of Honorius was associated to the empire of the West The death of Constantius in the seventh month of his reign instead of diminishing seemed to inerease the power of Placidia and the indecent familiarity two of her brother which might be no more than the symptoms of a childish affection were universally attributed to incestuous love On a sudden by some base intrigues of a steward and a nurse this excessive fondness was converted into an irreconcilable quarrel the debates of the emperor and his sister were not long confined within the walls of the palace and as the Gothic soldiers adhered to their queen the city of Ravenna was agitated with bloody and dangerous tumults which could only be appeased by the forced or voluntary retreat of Placidia and her children The royal exiles landed at Constantinople soon after the marriage of Theodosius during the festival of the Persian victories They were treated with kindness and magnificence but as the statues of the emperor Constantius had been rejected by the Eastern court the title of Augusta could not decently be allowed to his widow Within a few months after the arrival of Placidia a swift messenger announced the death of Honorius the consequence of a dropsy but the important secret was not divulged till the necessary orders had been despatched for the march of a large body of troops to the sea coast of Dalmatia The shops and the gates of Constantinople remained shut during seven days and the loss of a foreign prince who could neither be esteemed nor regretted was celebrated with loud and affected demonstrations of the public grief Footnote one See vol iii p two hundred ninety six Footnote two It is the expression of Olympiodorus apud Phetium p one hundred ninety seven who means perhaps to describe the same caresses which Mahomet bestowed on his daughter Phatemah Quando says the prophet himself quando subit mihi desiderium Paradisi osculor eam et ingero linguam meam in os ejus But this sensual indulgence was justified by miracle and mystery and the anecdote has been communicated to the public by the Reverend Father Maracci in his Version and Confutation of the Koran tom i p thirty two While the ministers of Constantinople deliberated the vacant throne of Honorius was usurped by the ambition of a stranger The name of the rebel was John he filled the confidential office of Primicerius or principal secretary and history has attributed to his character more virtues than can easily be reconciled with the violation of the most sacred duty Elated by the submission of Italy and the hope of an alliance with the Huns John presumed to insult by an embassy the majesty of the Eastern emperor but when he understood that his agents had been banished imprisoned and at length chased away with deserved ignominy John prepared to assert by arms the injustice of his claims In such a cause the grandson of the great Theodosius should have marched in person but the young emperor was easily diverted by his physicians from so rash and hazardous a design and the conduct of the Italian expedition was prudently intrusted to Ardaburius and his son Aspar who had already signalized their valor against the Persians It was resolved that Ardaburius should embark with the infantry whilst Aspar at the head of the cavalry conducted Placidia and her son Valentinian along the sea coast of the Adriatic The march of the cavalry was performed with such active diligence that they surprised without resistance the important city of Aquileia when the hopes of Aspar were unexpectedly confounded by the intelligence that a storm had dispersed the Imperial fleet and that his father with only two galleys was taken and carried a prisoner into the port of Ravenna Yet this incident unfortunate as it might seem facilitated the conquest of Italy Ardaburius employed or abused the courteous freedom which he was permitted to enjoy to revive among the troops a sense of loyalty and gratitude and as soon as the conspiracy was ripe for execution he invited by private messages and pressed the approach of Aspar A shepherd whom the popular credulity transformed into an angel guided the eastern cavalry by a secret and it was thought an impassable road through the morasses of the Po the gates of Ravenna after a short struggle were thrown open and the defenceless tyrant was delivered to the mercy or rather to the cruelty of the conquerors His right hand was first cut off and after he had been exposed mounted on an ass to the public derision John was beheaded in the circus of Aquileia The emperor Theodosius when he received the news of the victory interrupted the horse races and singing as he marched through the streets a suitable psalm conducted his people from the Hippodrome to the church where he spent the remainder of the day in grateful devotion three Footnote three For these revolutions of the Western empire consult Olympiodor apud Phot p one hundred ninety two one hundred ninety three one hundred ninety six one hundred ninety seven

hereditary or patrimonial it was impossible that the intricate claims of female and collateral succession should be clearly defined four and Theodosius by the right of consanguinity or conquest might have reigned the sole legitimate emperor of the Romans For a moment perhaps his eyes were dazzled by the prospect of unbounded sway but his indolent temper gradually acquiesced in the dictates of sound policy He contented himself with the possession of the East and wisely relinquished the laborious task of waging a distant and doubtful war against the Barbarians beyond the Alps or of securing the obedience of the Italians and Africans whose minds were alienated by the irreconcilable difference of language and interest Instead of listening to the voice of ambition Theodosius resolved to imitate the moderation of his grandfather and to seat his cousin Valentinian on the throne of the West The royal infant was distinguished at Constantinople by the title of Nobilissimus he was promoted before his departure from Thessalonica to the rank and dignity of Caesar and after the conquest of Italy the patrician Helion by the authority of Theodosius and in the presence of the senate saluted Valentinian the Third by the name of Augustus and solemnly invested him with the diadem and the Imperial purple five By the agreement of the three females who governed the Roman world the son of Placidia was betrothed to Eudoxia the daughter of Theodosius and Athenais and as soon as the lover and his bride had attained the age of puberty this honorable alliance was faithfully accomplished At the same time as a compensation perhaps for the expenses of the war the Western Illyricum was detached from the Italian dominions and yielded to the throne of Constantinople six The emperor of the East acquired the useful dominion of the rich and maritime province of Dalmatia and the dangerous sovereignty of Pannonia and Noricum which had been filled and ravaged above twenty years by a promiscuous crowd of Huns Ostrogoths Vandals and Bavarians Theodosius and Valentinian continued to respect the obligations of their public and domestic alliance but the unity of the Roman government was finally dissolved By a positive declaration the validity of all future laws was limited to the dominions of their peculiar author unless he should think proper to communicate them subscribed with his own hand for the approbation of his independent colleague seven Footnote four See Grotius de Jure Belli et Pacis l ii c seven He has laboriously out vainly attempted to form a reasonable system of

remarkable cession Footnote seven See the first Novel of Theodosius by which he ratifies and communicates A D four hundred thirty eight the Theodosian Code About forty years before that time the unity

xvi tit viii leg thirteen and the Western emperor was obliged to invalidate by a special edict the law quam constat meis partibus esse damnosam Cod Theod l xi tit i leg one hundred fifty eight Valentinian when he received the title of Augustus was no more than six years of age and his long minority was intrusted to the guardian care of a mother who might assert a female claim to the succession of the Western empire Placidia envied but she could not equal the reputation and virtues of the wife and sister of Theodosius the elegant genius of Eudocia the wise and successful policy of Pulcheria The mother of Valentinian was jealous of the power which she was incapable of exercising eight she reigned twenty five years in the name of her son and the character of that unworthy emperor gradually countenanced the suspicion that Placidia had enervated his youth by a dissolute education and studiously diverted his attention from every manly and honorable pursuit Amidst the decay of military spirit her armies were commanded by two generals Aetius nine and Boniface ten who may be deservedly named as the last of the Romans Their union might have supported a sinking empire their discord was the fatal and immediate cause of the loss of Africa The invasion and defeat of Attila have immortalized the fame of Aetius and though time has thrown a shade over the exploits of his rival the defence of Marseilles and the deliverance of Africa attest the military talents of Count Boniface In the field of battle in partial encounters in single combats he was still the terror of the Barbarians the clergy and particularly his friend Augustin were edified by the Christian piety which had once tempted him to retire from the world the people applauded his spotless integrity the army dreaded his equal and inexorable justice which may be displayed in a very singular example A peasant who complained of the criminal intimacy between his wife and a Gothic soldier was directed to attend his tribunal the following day in the evening the count who had diligently informed himself of the time and place of the assignation mounted his horse rode ten miles into the country surprised the guilty couple punished the soldier with instant death and silenced the complaints of the husband by presenting him the next morning with the head of the adulterer The abilities of Aetius and Boniface might have been usefully employed against the public enemies in separate and important commands but the experience of their past conduct should have decided the real favor and confidence of the empress Placidia In the melancholy season of her exile and distress Boniface alone had maintained her cause with unshaken fidelity and the troops and treasures of Africa had essentially contributed to extinguish the rebellion The same rebellion had been supported by the zeal and activity of Aetius who brought an army of sixty thousand Huns from the Danube to the confines of Italy for the service of the usurper The untimely death of John compelled him to accept an advantageous treaty but he still continued the subject and the soldier of Valentinian to entertain a secret perhaps a treasonable correspondence with his Barbarian allies whose retreat had been purchased by liberal gifts and more liberal promises But Aetius possessed an advantage of singular moment in a female reign he was present he besieged with artful and assiduous flattery the palace of Ravenna disguised his dark designs with the mask of loyalty and friendship and at length deceived both his mistress and his absent rival by a subtle conspiracy which a weak woman and a brave man could not easily suspect He had secretly persuaded eleven Placidia to recall Boniface from the government of Africa he secretly advised Boniface to disobey the Imperial summons to the one he represented the order as a sentence of death to the other he stated the refusal as a signal of revolt and when the credulous and unsuspectful count had armed the province in his defence Aetius applauded his sagacity in foreseeing the rebellion which his own perfidy had excited A temperate inquiry into the real motives of Boniface would have restored a faithful servant to his duty and to the republic but the arts of Aetius still continued to betray and to inflame and the count was urged by persecution to embrace the most desperate counsels The success with which he eluded or repelled the first attacks could not inspire a vain confidence that at the head of some loose disorderly Africans he should be able to withstand the regular forces of the West commanded by a rival whose military character it was impossible for him to despise After some hesitation the last struggles of prudence and loyalty Boniface despatched a trusty friend to the court or rather to the camp of Gonderic king of the Vandals with the proposal of a strict alliance and the offer of an advantageous and perpetual settlement Footnote eight Cassiodorus Variar l xi Epist i p two hundred thirty eight has compared the regencies of Placidia and Amalasuntha He arraigns the weakness of the mother of Valentinian and praises the virtues of

testimony see Ruinart Hist Persecut Vandal p four hundred twenty four hundred twenty one seems agreeable to the practice of ancient and modern courts and would be naturally revealed by the repentance of Boniface After the retreat of the Goths the authority of Honorius had obtained a precarious establishment in Spain except only in the province of Gallicia where the Suevi and the Vandals had fortified their camps in mutual discord and hostile independence The Vandals prevailed and their adversaries were besieged in the Nervasian hills between Leon and Oviedo till the approach of Count Asterius compelled or rather provoked the victorious Barbarians to remove the scene of the war to the plains of Boetica The rapid progress of the Vandals soon acquired a more effectual opposition and the master general Castinus marched against them with a numerous army of Romans and Goths Vanquished in battle by an inferior army Castinus fled with dishonor to Tarragona and this memorable defeat which has been represented as the punishment was most probably the effect of his rash presumption twelve Seville and Carthagena became the reward or rather the prey of the ferocious conquerors and the vessels which they found in the harbor of Carthagena might easily transport them to the Isles of Majorca and Minorca where the Spanish fugitives as in a secure recess had vainly concealed their families and their fortunes The experience of navigation and perhaps the prospect of Africa encouraged the Vandals to accept the invitation which they received from Count Boniface and the death of Gonderic served only to forward and animate the bold enterprise In the room of a prince not conspicuous for any superior powers of the mind or body they acquired his bastard brother the terrible Genseric thirteen a name which in the destruction of the Roman empire has deserved an equal rank with the names of Alaric and Attila The king of the Vandals is described to have been of a middle stature with a lameness in one leg which he had contracted by an accidental fall from his horse His slow and cautious speech seldom declared the deep purposes of his soul he disdained to imitate the luxury of the vanquished but he indulged the sterner passions of anger and revenge The ambition of Genseric was without bounds and without scruples and the warrior could dexterously employ the dark engines of policy to solicit the allies who might be useful to his success or to scatter among his enemies the seeds of hatred and contention Almost in the moment of his departure he was informed that Hermanric king of the Suevi had presumed to ravage the Spanish territories which he was resolved to abandon Impatient of the insult Genseric pursued the hasty retreat of the Suevi as far as Merida precipitated the king and his army into the River Anas and calmly returned to the sea shore to embark his victorious troops The vessels which transported the Vandals over the modern Straits of Gibraltar a channel only twelve miles in breadth were furnished by the Spaniards who anxiously wished their departure and by the African general who had implored their formidable assistance fourteen Footnote twelve See the Chronicles of Prosper and Idatius Salvian de Gubernat Dei l vii p two hundred forty six Paris sixteen oh eight ascribes the victory of the Vandals to their superior piety They fasted they prayed they carried a Bible in the front of the Host with the design perhaps of reproaching the perfidy and sacrilege of their enemies Footnote thirteen Gizericus his name is variously

commences in October twenty four forty four This date which coincides with A D four hundred twenty nine is confirmed by Isidore another Spanish bishop and is justly preferred to the opinion of those writers who have marked for that event one of the two preceding years See Pagi Critica tom ii p two hundred five c Our fancy so long accustomed to exaggerate and multiply the martial swarms of Barbarians that seemed to issue from the North will perhaps be surprised by the account of the army which Genseric mustered on the coast of Mauritania The Vandals who in twenty years had penetrated from the Elbe to Mount Atlas were united under the command of their warlike king and he reigned with equal authority over the Alani who had passed within the term of human life from the cold of Scythia to the excessive heat of an African climate The hopes of the bold enterprise had excited many brave adventurers of the Gothic nation and many desperate provincials were tempted to repair their fortunes by the same means which had occasioned their ruin Yet this various multitude amounted only to fifty thousand effective men and though Genseric artfully magnified his apparent strength by appointing eighty chinarchs or commanders of thousands the fallacious increase of old men of children and of slaves would scarcely have swelled his army to the number of four score thousand persons fifteen But his own dexterity and the discontents of Africa soon fortified the Vandal powers by the accession of numerous and active allies The parts of Mauritania which border on the Great Desert and the Atlantic Ocean were filled with a fierce and untractable race of men whose savage temper had been exasperated rather than reclaimed by their dread of the Roman arms The wandering Moors sixteen as they gradually ventured to approach the seashore and the camp of the Vandals must have viewed with terror and astonishment the dress the armor the martial pride and discipline of the unknown strangers who had landed on their coast and the fair complexions of the blue eyed warriors of Germany formed a very singular contrast with the swarthy or olive hue which is derived from the neighborhood of the torrid zone After the first difficulties had in some measure been removed which arose from the mutual ignorance of their respective language the Moors regardless of any future consequence embraced the alliance of the enemies of Rome and a crowd of naked savages rushed from the woods and valleys of Mount Atlas to satiate their revenge on the polished tyrants who had injuriously expelled them from the native sovereignty of the land Footnote fifteen Compare Procopius de Bell Vandal l i c five p one hundred ninety and Victor Vitensis de Persecutione Vandal l i c one p three edit Ruinart We are assured by Idatius that Genseric evacuated Spain cum Vandalis omnibus eorumque familiis and Possidius in Vit Augustin c twenty eight apud Ruinart p four hundred twenty seven describes his army as

the death of Valentinian de Bell Vandal l i c five p one hundred ninety and it is probable that the independent tribes did not embrace any uniform system of policy The persecution of the Donatists seventeen was an event not less favorable to the designs of Genseric Seventeen years before he landed in Africa a public conference was held at Carthage by the order of the magistrate The Catholics were satisfied that after the invincible reasons which they had alleged the obstinacy of the schismatics must be inexcusable and voluntary and the emperor Honorius was persuaded to inflict the most rigorous penalties on a faction which had so long abused his patience and clemency Three hundred bishops eighteen with many thousands of the inferior clergy were torn from their churches stripped of their ecclesiastical possessions banished to the islands and proscribed by the laws if they presumed to conceal themselves in the provinces of Africa Their numerous congregations both in cities and in the country were deprived of the rights of citizens and of the exercise of religious worship A regular scale of fines from ten to two hundred pounds of silver was curiously ascertained according to the distinction of rank and fortune to punish the crime of assisting at a schismatic conventicle and if the fine had been levied five times without subduing the obstinacy of the offender his future punishment was referred to the discretion of the Imperial court nineteen By these severities which obtained the warmest approbation of saint Augustin twenty great numbers of Donatists were reconciled to the Catholic Church but the fanatics who still persevered in their opposition were provoked to madness and despair the distracted country was filled with tumult and bloodshed the armed troops of Circumcellions alternately pointed their rage against themselves or against their adversaries and the calendar of martyrs received on both sides a considerable augmentation twenty one Under these circumstances Genseric a Christian but an enemy of the orthodox communion showed himself to the Donatists as a powerful deliverer from whom they might reasonably expect the repeal of the odious and oppressive edicts of the Roman emperors twenty two The conquest of Africa was facilitated by the active zeal or the secret favor of a domestic faction the wanton outrages against the churches and the clergy of which the Vandals are accused may be fairly imputed to the fanaticism of their allies and the intolerant spirit which disgraced the triumph of Christianity contributed to the loss of the most important province of the West twenty three Footnote seventeen See Tillemont Memoires Eccles tom xiii p five hundred sixteen five hundred fifty eight and the whole series of the persecution in the original monuments published by Dupin at the end of Optatus p three hundred twenty three five hundred fifteen Footnote eighteen The Donatist Bishops at the conference of Carthage amounted to two hundred seventy nine and they asserted that their whole number was not less than four hundred The Catholics had two hundred eighty six present one hundred twenty absent besides sixty four vacant bishoprics Footnote nineteen The fifth title of the sixteenth book of the Theodosian Code exhibits a series of the Imperial laws against the Donatists from the year four hundred to the year four

tosthe proper treatment of heretics His pathetic declaration of pity and indulgence for the Manichaeans has been inserted by mister Locke vol iii p four hundred sixty nine among the choice specimens of his common place book Another philosopher the celebrated Bayle tom ii p four hundred forty five four hundred ninety six has refuted with superfluous diligence and ingenuity the arguments by which the bishop of Hippo justified in his old age the persecution of the Donatists Footnote twenty one See Tillemont Mem Eccles tom xiii p five hundred eighty six five hundred ninety two eight hundred six The Donatists boasted of thousands of these voluntary martyrs Augustin asserts and probably with truth that these numbers were much exaggerated but he sternly maintains that it was better that some should burn themselves in this world than that all should burn in hell flames Footnote twenty two According to saint Augustin and Theodoret the Donatists were inclined to the principles or at least to the party of the Arians which Genseric supported Tillemont Mem Eccles tom vi p sixty eight Footnote twenty three See Baronius Annal Eccles A D four hundred twenty eight No seven A D four hundred thirty nine No thirty five The cardinal though more inclined to seek the cause of great events in heaven than on the earth has observed the apparent connection of the Vandals and the Donatists Under the reign of the Barbarians the schismatics of Africa enjoyed an obscure peace of one hundred years at the end of which we may again trace them by the fight of the Imperial persecutions See Tillemont Mem Eccles tom vi p one hundred ninety two c The court and the people were astonished by the strange intelligence that a virtuous hero after so many favors and so many services had renounced his allegiance and invited the Barbarians to destroy the province intrusted to his command The friends of Boniface who still believed that his criminal behavior might be excused by some honorable motive solicited during the absence of Aetius a free conference with the Count of Africa and Darius an officer of high distinction was named for the important embassy twenty four In their first interview at Carthage the imaginary provocations were mutually explained the opposite letters of Aetius were produced and compared and the fraud was easily detected Placidia and Boniface lamented their fatal error and the count had sufficient magnanimity to confide in the forgiveness of his sovereign or to expose his head to her future resentment His repentance was fervent and sincere but he soon discovered that it was no longer in his power to restore the edifice which he had shaken to its foundations Carthage and the Roman garrisons returned with their general to the allegiance of Valentinian but the rest of Africa was still distracted with war and faction and the inexorable king of the Vandals disdaining all terms of accommodation sternly refused to relinquish the possession of his prey The band of veterans who marched under the standard of Boniface and his hasty levies of provincial troops were defeated with considerable loss the victorious Barbarians insulted the open country and Carthage Cirta and Hippo Regius were the only cities that appeared to rise above the general inundation Footnote twenty four In a confidential letter to Count Boniface saint Augustin without examining the grounds of the quarrel piously exhorts him to discharge the duties of a Christian and a subject to extricate himself without delay from his dangerous and guilty situation and even if he could obtain the consent of his wife to embrace a life of celibacy and penance Tillemont Mem Eccles tom xiii p eight hundred ninety The bishop was intimately connected with Darius the minister of peace Id tom xiii p nine hundred twenty eight The long and narrow tract of the African coast was filled with frequent monuments of Roman art and magnificence and the respective degrees of improvement might be accurately measured by the distance from Carthage and the Mediterranean A simple reflection will impress every thinking mind with the clearest idea of fertility and cultivation the country was extremely populous the inhabitants reserved a liberal subsistence for their own use and the annual exportation particularly of wheat was so regular and plentiful that Africa deserved the name of the common granary of Rome and of mankind On a sudden the seven fruitful provinces from Tangier to Tripoli were overwhelmed by the invasion of the Vandals whose destructive rage has perhaps been exaggerated by popular animosity religious zeal and extravagant declamation War in its fairest form implies a perpetual violation of humanity and justice and the hostilities of Barbarians are inflamed by the fierce and lawless spirit which incessantly disturbs their peaceful and domestic society The Vandals where they found resistance seldom gave quarter and the deaths of their valiant countrymen were expiated by the ruin of the cities under whose walls they had fallen Careless of the distinctions of age or sex or rank they employed every species of indignity and torture to force from the captives a discovery of their hidden wealth The stern policy of Genseric justified his frequent examples of military execution he was not always the master of his own passions or of those of his followers and the calamities of war were aggravated by the licentiousness of the Moors and the fanaticism of the Donatists Yet I shall not easily be persuaded that it was the common practice of the Vandals to extirpate the olives and other fruit trees of a country where they intended to settle nor can I believe that it was a usual stratagem to slaughter great numbers of their prisoners before the walls of a besieged city for the sole purpose of infecting the air and producing a pestilence of which they themselves must have been the first victims twenty five Footnote twenty five The

edit Ruinart The last picture which was drawn sixty years after the event is more expressive of the author s passions than of the truth of facts The generous mind of Count Boniface was tortured by the exquisite distress of beholding the ruin which he had occasioned and whose rapid progress he was unable to check After the loss of a battle he retired into Hippo Regius where he was immediately besieged by an enemy who considered him as the real bulwark of Africa The maritime colony of Hippo twenty six about two hundred miles westward of Carthage had formerly acquired the distinguishing epithet of Regius from the residence of Numidian kings and some remains of trade and populousness still adhere to the modern city which is known in Europe by the corrupted name of Bona The military labors and anxious reflections of Count Boniface were alleviated by the edifying conversation of his friend saint Augustin twenty seven till that bishop the light and pillar of the Catholic church was gently released in the third month of the siege and in the seventy sixth year of his age from the actual and the impending calamities of his country The youth of Augustin had been stained by the vices and errors which he so ingenuously confesses but from the moment of his conversion to that of his death the manners of the bishop of Hippo were pure and austere and the most conspicuous of his virtues was an ardent zeal against heretics of every denomination the Manichaeans the Donatists and the Pelagians against whom he waged a perpetual controversy When the city some months after his death was burnt by the Vandals the library was fortunately saved which contained his voluminous writings two hundred and thirty two separate books or treatises on theological subjects besides a complete exposition of the psalter and the gospel and a copious magazine of epistles and homilies twenty eight According to the judgment of the most impartial critics the superficial learning of Augustin was confined to the Latin language twenty nine and his style though sometimes animated by the eloquence of passion is usually clouded by false and affected rhetoric But he possessed a strong capacious argumentative mind he boldly sounded the dark abyss of grace predestination free will and original sin and the rigid system of Christianity which he framed or restored thirty has been entertained with

territory is renowned for a pure air a fertile soil and plenty of exquisite fruits Footnote twenty seven The life of saint Augustin by Tillemont fills a quarto volume Mem Eccles tom xiii of more than one thousand pages and the diligence of that learned Jansenist was excited on this occasion by factious and devout zeal for the founder of his sect Footnote twenty eight Such at least is the account

abstract of them as they stand in the last edition of the Benedictines My personal acquaintance with the bishop of Hippo does not extend beyond the Confessions and the City of God Footnote twenty nine In his early youth Confess i fourteen saint Augustin disliked and neglected the study of Greek and he frankly owns that he read the Platonists in a Latin version Confes vii nine Some modern critics have thought that his ignorance of Greek disqualified him from expounding the Scriptures and Cicero or Quintilian would have required the knowledge of that language in a professor of rhetoric Footnote thirty These questions were seldom agitated from the time of saint Paul to that of saint Augustin I am informed that the Greek fathers maintain the natural sentiments of the Semi Pelagians and that the orthodoxy of saint Augustin was derived from the Manichaean school Footnote thirty one The church of Rome has canonized Augustin and reprobated Calvin Yet as the real difference between them is invisible even to a theological microscope the Molinists are oppressed by the authority of the saint and the Jansenists are disgraced by their resemblance to the heretic In the mean while the Protestant Arminians stand aloof and deride the mutual perplexity of the disputants see a curious Review of the Controversy by Le Clerc Bibliotheque Universelle tom xiv p one hundred forty four three hundred ninety eight Perhaps a reasoner still more independent may smile in his turn when he peruses an Arminian Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans Chapter XXXIII Conquest Of Africa By The Vandals Part II By the skill of Boniface and perhaps by the ignorance of the Vandals the siege of Hippo was protracted above fourteen months the sea was continually open and when the adjacent country had been exhausted by irregular rapine the besiegers themselves were compelled by famine to relinquish their enterprise The importance and danger of Africa were deeply felt by the regent of the West Placidia implored the assistance of her eastern ally and the Italian fleet and army were reenforced by Asper who sailed from Constantinople with a powerful armament As soon as the force of the two empires was united under the command of Boniface he boldly marched against the Vandals and the loss of a second battle irretrievably decided the fate of Africa He embarked with the precipitation of despair and the people of Hippo were permitted with their families and effects to occupy the vacant place of the soldiers the greatest part of whom were either slain or made prisoners by the Vandals The count whose fatal credulity had wounded the vitals of the republic might enter the palace of Ravenna with some anxiety which was soon removed by the smiles of Placidia Boniface accepted with gratitude the rank of patrician and the dignity of master general of the Roman armies but he must have blushed at the sight of those medals in which he was represented with the name and attributes of victory thirty two The discovery of his fraud the displeasure of the empress and the distinguished favor of his rival exasperated the haughty and perfidious soul of Aetius He hastily returned from Gaul to Italy with a retinue or rather with an army of Barbarian followers and such was the weakness of the government that the two generals decided their private quarrel in a bloody battle Boniface was successful but he received in the conflict a mortal wound from the spear of his adversary of which he expired within a few days in such Christian and charitable sentiments that he exhorted his wife a rich heiress of Spain to accept Aetius for her second husband But Aetius could not derive any immediate advantage from the generosity of his dying enemy he was proclaimed a rebel by the justice of Placidia and though he attempted to defend some strong fortresses erected on his patrimonial estate the Imperial power soon compelled him to retire into Pannonia to the tents of his faithful Huns

expression of the latter that Aetius the day before had provided himself with a longer spear implies something like a regular duel It might naturally be expected after the retreat of Boniface that the Vandals would achieve without resistance or delay the conquest of Africa Eight years however elapsed from the evacuation of Hippo to the reduction of Carthage In the midst of that interval the ambitious Genseric in the full tide of apparent prosperity negotiated a treaty of peace by which he gave his son Hunneric for a hostage and consented to leave the Western emperor in the undisturbed possession of the three Mauritanias thirty four This moderation which cannot be imputed to the justice must be ascribed to the policy of the conqueror His throne was encompassed with domestic enemies who accused the baseness of his birth and asserted the legitimate claims of his nephews the sons of Gonderic Those nephews indeed he sacrificed to his safety and their mother the widow of the deceased king was precipitated by his order into the river Ampsaga But the public discontent burst forth in dangerous and frequent conspiracies and the warlike tyrant is supposed to have shed more Vandal blood by the hand of the executioner than in the field of battle thirty five The convulsions of Africa which had favored his attack opposed the firm establishment of his power and the various seditions of the Moors and Germans the Donatists and Catholics continually disturbed or threatened the unsettled reign of the conqueror As he advanced towards Carthage he was forced to withdraw his troops from the Western provinces the sea coast was exposed to the naval enterprises of the Romans of Spain and Italy and in the heart of Numidia the strong inland city of Corta still persisted in obstinate independence thirty six These difficulties were gradually subdued by the spirit the perseverance and the cruelty of Genseric who alternately applied the arts of peace and war to the establishment of his African kingdom He subscribed a solemn treaty with the hope of deriving some advantage from the term of its continuance and the moment of its violation The vigilance of his enemies was relaxed by the protestations of friendship which concealed his hostile approach and Carthage was at length surprised by the Vandals five hundred and eighty five years after the destruction of the city and republic by the younger Scipio thirty seven Footnote thirty four See Procopius de Bell Vandal l i c four p one hundred eighty six Valentinian published several humane laws to relieve the distress of

seven See the Chronicles of Idatius Isidore Prosper and Marcellinus They mark the same year but different days for the surprisal of Carthage A new city had arisen from its ruins with the title of a colony and though Carthage might yield to the royal prerogatives of Constantinople and perhaps to the trade of Alexandria or the splendor of Antioch she still maintained the second rank in the West as the Rome if we may use the style of contemporaries of the African world That wealthy and opulent metropolis thirty eight displayed in a dependent condition the image of a flourishing republic Carthage contained the manufactures the arms and the treasures of the six provinces A regular subordination of civil honors gradually ascended from the procurators of the streets and quarters of the city to the tribunal of the supreme magistrate who with the title of proconsul represented the state and dignity of a consul of ancient Rome Schools and gymnasia were instituted for the education of the African youth and the liberal arts and manners grammar rhetoric and philosophy were publicly taught in the Greek and Latin languages The buildings of Carthage were uniform and magnificent a shady grove was planted in the midst of the capital the new port a secure and capacious harbor was subservient to the commercial indus try of citizens and strangers and the splendid games of the circus and theatre were exhibited almost in the presence of the Barbarians The reputation of the Carthaginians was not equal to that of their country and the reproach of Punic faith still adhered to their subtle and faithless character thirty nine The habits of trade and the abuse of luxury had corrupted their manners but their impious contempt of monks and the shameless practice of unnatural lusts are the two abominations which excite the pious vehemence of Salvian the preacher of the age forty The king of the Vandals severely reformed the vices of a voluptuous people and the ancient noble ingenuous freedom of Carthage these expressions of Victor are not without energy was reduced by Genseric into a state of ignominious servitude After he had permitted his licentious troops to satiate their rage and avarice he instituted a more regular system of rapine and oppression An edict was promulgated which enjoined all persons without fraud or delay to deliver their gold silver jewels and valuable furniture or apparel to the royal officers and the attempt to secrete any part of their patrimony was inexorably punished with death and torture as an act of treason against the state The lands of the proconsular province which formed the immediate district of Carthage were accurately measured and divided among the Barbarians and the conqueror reserved for his peculiar domain the fertile territory of Byzacium and the adjacent parts of Numidia and Getulia forty one Footnote thirty eight The picture of Carthage as it flourished in the fourth and fifth centuries is taken from the Expositio totius

enough that Genseric should hate those whom he had injured the nobility and senators of Carthage were exposed to his jealousy and resentment and all those who refused the ignominious terms which their honor and religion forbade them to accept were compelled by the Arian tyrant to embrace the condition of perpetual banishment Rome Italy and the provinces of the East were filled with a crowd of exiles of fugitives and of ingenuous captives who solicited the public compassion and the benevolent epistles of Theod oret still preserve the names and misfortunes of Caelestian and Maria forty two The Syrian bishop deplores the misfortunes of Caelestian who from the state of a noble and opulent senator of Carthage was reduced with his wife and family and servants to beg his bread in a foreign country but he applauds the resignation of the Christian exile and the philosophic temper which under the pressure of such calamities could enjoy more real happiness than was the ordinary lot of wealth and prosperity The story of Maria the daughter of the magnificent Eudaemon is singular and interesting In the sack of Carthage she was purchased from the Vandals by some merchants of Syria who afterwards sold her as a slave in their native country A female attendant transported in the same ship and sold in the same family still continued to respect a mistress whom fortune had reduced to the common level of servitude and the daughter of Eudaemon received from her grateful affection the domestic services which she had once required from her obedience This remarkable behavior divulged the real condition of Maria who in the absence of the bishop of Cyrrhus was redeemed from slavery oy the generosity of some soldiers of the garrison The liberality of Theodoret provided for her decent maintenance and she passed ten months among the deaconesses of the church till she was unexpectedly informed that her father who had escaped from the ruin of Carthage exercised an honorable office in one of the Western provinces Her filial impatience was seconded by the pious bishop Theodoret in a letter still extant recommends Maria to the bishop of Aegae a maritime city of Cilicia which was frequented during the annual fair by the vessels of the West most earnestly requesting that his colleague would use the maiden with a tenderness suitable to her birth and that he would intrust her to the care of such faithful merchants as would esteem it a sufficient gain if they restored a daughter lost beyond all human hope to the arms of her afflicted parent Footnote forty two Ruinart p four hundred forty one four hundred fifty seven has collected from Theodoret and other authors the misfortunes real and fabulous of the inhabitants of Carthage Among the insipid legends of ecclesiastical history I am tempted to distinguish the memorable fable of the Seven Sleepers forty three whose imaginary date corresponds with the reign of the younger Theodosius and the conquest of Africa by the Vandals forty four When the emperor Decius persecuted the Christians seven noble youths of Ephesus concealed themselves in a spacious cavern in the side of an adjacent mountain where they were doomed to perish by the tyrant who gave orders that the entrance should be firmly secured by the a pile of huge stones They immediately fell into a deep slumber which was miraculously prolonged without injuring the powers of life during a period of one hundred and eighty seven years At the end of that time the slaves of Adolius to whom the inheritance of the mountain had descended removed the stones to supply materials for some rustic edifice the light of the sun darted into the cavern and the Seven Sleepers were permitted to awake After a slumber as they thought of a few hours they were pressed by the calls of hunger and resolved that Jamblichus one of their number should secretly return to the city to purchase bread for the use of his companions The youth if we may still employ that appellation could no longer recognize the once familiar aspect of his native country and his surprise was increased by the appearance of a large cross triumphantly erected over the principal gate of Ephesus His singular dress and obsolete language confounded the baker to whom he offered an ancient medal of Decius as the current coin of the empire and Jamblichus on the suspicion of a secret treasure was dragged before the judge Their mutual inquiries produced the amazing discovery that two centuries were almost elapsed since Jamblichus and his friends had escaped from the rage of a Pagan tyrant The bishop of Ephesus the clergy the magistrates the people and as it is said the emperor Theodosius himself hastened to visit the cavern of the Seven Sleepers who bestowed their benediction related their story and at the same instant peaceably expired The origin of this marvellous fable cannot be ascribed to the pious fraud and credulity of the modern Greeks since the authentic tradition may be traced within half a century of the supposed miracle James of Sarug a Syrian bishop who was born only two years after the death of the younger Theodosius has devoted one of his two hundred and thirty homilies to the praise of the young men of Ephesus forty five Their legend before the end of the sixth century was translated from the Syriac into the Latin language by the care of Gregory of Tours The hostile communions of the East preserve their memory with equal reverence and their names are honorably inscribed in the Roman the Abyssinian and the Russian calendar forty six Nor has their reputation been confined to the Christian world This popular tale which Mahomet might learn when he drove his camels to the fairs of Syria is introduced as a divine revelation into the Koran forty seven The story of the Seven Sleepers has been adopted and adorned by the nations from Bengal to Africa who profess the Mahometan religion forty eight and some vestiges of a similar tradition have been discovered in the remote extremities of Scandinavia forty nine This easy and universal belief so expressive of the sense of mankind may be ascribed to the genuine merit of the fable itself We imperceptibly advance from youth to age without observing the gradual but incessant change of human affairs and even in our larger experience of history the imagination is accustomed by a perpetual series of causes and effects to unite the most distant revolutions But if the interval between two memorable aeras could be instantly annihilated if it were possible after a momentary slumber of two hundred years to display the new world to the eyes of a spectator who still retained a lively and recent impression of the old his surprise and his reflections would furnish the pleasing subject of a philosophical romance The scene could not be more advantageously placed than in the two centuries which elapsed between the reigns of Decius and of Theodosius the Younger During this period the seat of government had been transported from Rome to a new city on the banks of the Thracian Bosphorus and the abuse of military spirit had been suppressed by an artificial system of tame and ceremonious servitude The throne of the persecuting Decius was filled by a succession of Christian and orthodox princes who had extirpated the fabulous gods of antiquity and the public devotion of the age was impatient to exalt the saints and martyrs of the Catholic church on the altars of Diana and Hercules The union of the Roman empire was dissolved its genius was humbled in the dust and armies of unknown Barbarians issuing from the frozen regions of the North had established their victorious reign over the fairest provinces of Europe and Africa Footnote forty three The choice of fabulous circumstances is of small importance yet I have confined myself to the narrative which was translated from the Syriac by the care of Gregory of Tours de Gloria Martyrum l i c ninety five in Max

Of Theodosius The Younger Elevation Of Marcian To The Empire Of The East The Western world was oppressed by the Goths and Vandals who fled before the Huns but the achievements of the Huns themselves were not adequate to their power and prosperity Their victorious hordes had spread from the Volga to the Danube but the public force was exhausted by the discord of independent chieftains their valor was idly consumed in obscure and predatory excursions and they often degraded their national dignity by condescending for the hopes of spoil to enlist under the banners of their fugitive enemies In the reign of Attila one the Huns again became the terror of the world and I shall now describe the character and actions of that formidable Barbarian who alternately insulted and invaded the East and the West and urged the rapid downfall of the Roman empire Footnote one The authentic materials for the history of Attila may be found in Jornandes de Rebus Geticis c thirty four fifty p six hundred sixty eight six hundred eighty eight edit Grot and Priscus Excerpta de Legationibus p thirty three seventy six Paris sixteen forty eight I have not seen the Lives of Attila composed by Juvencus Caelius Calanus Dalmatinus in the twelfth century or by Nicholas Olahus archbishop of Gran in the sixteenth See Mascou s History of the Germans ix and Maffei Osservazioni Litterarie tom i p eighty eight eighty nine Whatever the modern Hungarians have added must be fabulous and they do not seem to have excelled in the art of fiction They suppose that when Attila invaded Gaul and Italy married innumerable wives c he was one hundred and twenty years of age Thewrocz Chron c i p twenty two in Script Hunger tom i p seventy six In the tide of emigration which impetuously rolled from the confines of China to those of Germany the most powerful and populous tribes may commonly be found on the verge of the Roman provinces The accumulated weight was sustained for a while by artificial barriers and the easy condescension of the emperors invited without satisfying the insolent demands of the Barbarians who had acquired an eager appetite for the luxuries of civilized life The Hungarians who ambitiously insert the name of Attila among their native kings may affirm with truth that the hordes which were subject to his uncle Roas or Rugilas had formed their encampments within the limits of modern Hungary two in a fertile country which liberally supplied the wants of a nation of hunters and shepherds In this advantageous situation Rugilas and his valiant brothers who continually added to their power and reputation commanded the alternative of peace or war with the two empires His alliance with the Romans of the West was cemented by his personal friendship for the great Aetius who was always secure of finding in the Barbarian camp a hospitable reception and a powerful support At his solicitation and in the name of John the usurper sixty thousand Huns advanced to the confines of Italy their march and their retreat were alike expensive to the state and the grateful policy of Aetius abandoned the possession of Pannonia to his faithful confederates The Romans of the East were not less apprehensive of the arms of Rugilas which threatened the provinces or even the capital Some ecclesiastical historians have destroyed the Barbarians with lightning and pestilence three but Theodosius was reduced to the more humble expedient of stipulating an annual payment of three hundred and fifty pounds of gold and of disguising this dishonorable tribute by the title of general which the king of the Huns condescended to accept The public tranquillity was frequently interrupted by the fierce impatience of the Barbarians and the perfidious intrigues of the Byzantine court Four dependent nations among whom we may distinguish the Barbarians disclaimed the sovereignty of the Huns and their revolt was encouraged and protected by a Roman alliance till the just claims and formidable power of Rugilas were effectually urged by the voice of Eslaw his ambassador Peace was the unanimous wish of the senate their decree was ratified by the emperor and two ambassadors were named Plinthas a general of Scythian extraction but of consular rank and the quaestor Epigenes a wise and experienced statesman who was recommended to that office by his ambitious colleague Footnote

p fifty M Footnote three Socrates l vii c forty three Theodoret l v c thirty six Tillemont who always depends on the faith of his ecclesiastical authors strenuously contends Hist des Emp tom vi p one hundred thirty six six hundred seven that the wars and personages were not the same The death of Rugilas suspended the progress of the treaty His two nephews Attila and Bleda who succeeded to the throne of their uncle consented to a personal interview with the ambassadors of Constantinople but as they proudly refused to dismount the business was transacted on horseback in a spacious plain near the city of Margus in the Upper Maesia The kings of the Huns assumed the solid benefits as well as the vain honors of the negotiation They dictated the conditions of peace and each condition was an insult on the majesty of the empire Besides the freedom of a safe and plentiful market on the banks of the Danube they required that the annual contribution should be augmented from three hundred and fifty to seven hundred pounds of gold that a fine or ransom of eight pieces of gold should be paid for every Roman captive who had escaped from his Barbarian master that the emperor should renounce all treaties and engagements with the enemies of the Huns and that all the fugitives who had taken refuge in the court or provinces of Theodosius should be delivered to the justice of their offended sovereign This justice was rigorously inflicted on some unfortunate youths of a royal race They were crucified on the territories of the empire by the command of Attila and as soon as the king of the Huns had impressed the Romans with the terror of his name he indulged them in a short and arbitrary respite whilst he subdued the rebellious or independent nations of Scythia and Germany four Footnote four See Priscus p forty seven forty eight and Hist de Peuples de l Europe tom v i c xii xiii xiv xv Attila the son of Mundzuk deduced his noble perhaps his regal descent five from the ancient Huns who had formerly contended with the monarchs of China His features according to the observation of a Gothic historian bore the stamp of his national origin and the portrait of Attila exhibits the genuine deformity of a modern Calmuk six a large head a swarthy complexion small deep seated eyes a flat nose a few hairs in the place of a beard broad shoulders and a short square body of nervous strength though of a disproportioned form The haughty step and demeanor of the king of the Huns expressed the consciousness of his superiority above the rest of mankind and he had a custom of fiercely rolling his eyes as if he wished to enjoy the terror which he inspired Yet this savage hero was not inaccessible to pity his suppliant enemies might confide in the assurance of peace or pardon and Attila was considered by his subjects as a just and indulgent master He delighted in war but after he had ascended the throne in a mature age his head rather than his hand achieved the conquest of the North and the fame of an adventurous soldier was usefully exchanged for that of a prudent and successful general The effects of personal valor are so inconsiderable except in poetry or romance that victory even among Barbarians must depend on the degree of skill with which the passions of the multitude are combined and guided for the service of a single man The Scythian conquerors Attila and Zingis surpassed their rude countrymen in art rather than in courage and it may be observed that the monarchies both of the Huns and of the Moguls were erected by their founders on the basis of popular superstition The miraculous conception which fraud and credulity ascribed to the virgin mother of Zingis raised him above the level of human nature and the naked prophet who in the name of the Deity invested him with the empire of the earth pointed the valor of the Moguls with irresistible enthusiasm seven The religious arts of Attila were not less skillfully adapted to the character of his age and country It was natural enough that the Scythians should adore with peculiar devotion the god of war but as they were incapable of forming either an abstract idea or a corporeal representation they worshipped their tutelar deity under the symbol of an iron cimeter eight One of the shepherds of the Huns perceived that a heifer who was grazing had wounded herself in the foot and curiously followed the track of the blood till he discovered among the long grass the point of an ancient sword which he dug out of the ground and presented to Attila That magnanimous or rather that artful prince accepted with pious gratitude this celestial favor and as the rightful possessor of the sword of Mars asserted his divine and indefeasible claim to the dominion of the earth nine If the rites of Scythia were practised on this solemn occasion a lofty altar or rather pile of fagots three hundred yards in length and in breadth was raised in a spacious plain and the sword of Mars was placed erect on the summit of this rustic altar which was annually consecrated by the blood of sheep horses and of the hundredth captive ten Whether human sacrifices formed any part of the worship of Attila or whether he propitiated the god of war with the victims which he continually offered in the field of battle the favorite of Mars soon acquired a sacred character which rended his conquests more easy and more permanent and the Barbarian princes confessed in the language of devotion or flattery that they could not presume to gaze with a steady eye on the divine majesty of the king of the Huns eleven His brother Bleda who reigned over a considerable part of the nation was compelled to resign his sceptre and his life Yet even this cruel act was attributed to a supernatural impulse and the vigor with which Attila wielded the sword of Mars convinced the world that it had been reserved alone for his invincible arm twelve But the extent of his empire affords the only remaining evidence of the number and importance of his victories and the Scythian monarch however ignorant of the value of science and philosophy might perhaps lament that his illiterate subjects were destitute of the art which could perpetuate the memory of his exploits Footnote five Priscus p thirty nine The modern Hungarians have deduced his genealogy which ascends in the thirty fifth degree to Ham the son of Noah

reject the concurrent testimony of Jornandes and the contemporary Chronicles If a line of separation were drawn between the civilized and the savage climates of the globe between the inhabitants of cities who cultivated the earth and the hunters and shepherds who dwelt in tents Attila might aspire to the title of supreme and sole monarch of the Barbarians thirteen He alone among the conquerors of ancient and modern times united the two mighty kingdoms of Germany and Scythia and those vague appellations when they are applied to his reign may be understood with an ample latitude Thuringia which stretched beyond its actual limits as far as the Danube was in the number of his provinces he interposed with the weight of a powerful neighbor in the domestic affairs of the Franks and one of his lieutenants chastised and almost exterminated the Burgundians of the Rhine He subdued the islands of the ocean the kingdoms of Scandinavia encompassed and divided by the waters of the Baltic and the Huns might derive a tribute of furs from that northern region which has been protected from all other conquerors by the severity of the climate and the courage of the natives Towards the East it is difficult to circumscribe the dominion of Attila over the Scythian deserts yet we may be assured that he reigned on the banks of the Volga that the king of the Huns was dreaded not only as a warrior but as a magician fourteen that he insulted and vanquished the khan of the formidable Geougen and that he sent ambassadors to negotiate an equal alliance with the empire of China In the proud review of the nations who acknowledged the sovereignty of Attila and who never entertained during his lifetime the thought of a revolt the Gepidae and the Ostrogoths were distinguished by their numbers their bravery and the personal merits of their chiefs The renowned Ardaric king of the Gepidae was the faithful and sagacious counsellor of the monarch who esteemed his intrepid genius whilst he loved the mild and discreet virtues of the noble Walamir king of the Ostrogoths The crowd of vulgar kings the leaders of so many martial tribes who served under the standard of Attila were ranged in the submissive order of guards and domestics round the person of their master They watched his nod they trembled at his frown and at the first signal of his will they executed without murmur or hesitation his stern and absolute commands In time of peace the dependent princes with their national troops attended the royal camp in regular succession but when Attila collected his military force he was able to bring into the field an army of five or according to another account of seven hundred thousand Barbarians fifteen Footnote thirteen Fortissimarum gentium dominus qui inaudita ante se

Empereurs tom vi p one hundred twenty nine one hundred thirty eight Corneille has represented the pride of Attila to his subject kings and his tragedy opens with these two ridiculous lines Ils ne sont pas venus nos deux rois qu on leur die Qu ils se font trop attendre et qu Attila s ennuie The two kings of the Gepidae and the Ostrogoths are profound politicians and sentimental lovers and the whole piece exhibits the defects without the genius of the poet The ambassadors of the Huns might awaken the attention of Theodosius by reminding him that they were his neighbors both in Europe and Asia since they touched the Danube on one hand and reached with the other as far as the Tanais In the reign of his father Arcadius a band of adventurous Huns had ravaged the provinces of the East from whence they brought away rich spoils and innumerable captives sixteen They advanced by a secret path along the shores of the Caspian Sea traversed the snowy mountains of Armenia passed the Tigris the Euphrates and the Halys recruited their weary cavalry with the generous breed of Cappadocian horses occupied the hilly country of Cilicia and disturbed the festal songs and dances of the citizens of Antioch Egypt trembled at their approach and the monks and pilgrims of the Holy Land prepared to escaped their fury by a speedy embarkation The memory of this invasion was still recent in the minds of the Orientals The subjects of Attila might execute with superior forces the design which these adventurers had so boldly attempted and it soon became the subject of anxious conjecture whether the tempest would fall on the dominions of Rome or of Persia Some of the great vassals of the king of the Huns who were themselves in the rank of powerful princes had been sent to ratify an alliance and society of arms with the emperor or rather with the general of the West They related during their residence at Rome the circumstances of an expedition which they had lately made into the East After passing a desert and a morass supposed by the Romans to be the Lake Maeotis they penetrated through the mountains and arrived at the end of fifteen days march on the confines of Media where they advanced as far as the unknown cities of Basic and Cursic sixteen eleven They encountered the Persian army in the plains of Media and the air according to their own expression was darkened by a cloud of arrows But the Huns were obliged to retire before the numbers of the enemy Their laborious retreat was effected by a different road they lost the greatest part of their booty and at length returned to the royal camp with some knowledge of the country and an impatient desire of revenge In the free conversation of the Imperial ambassadors who discussed at the court of Attila the character and designs of their formidable enemy the ministers of Constantinople expressed their hope that his strength might be diverted and employed in a long and doubtful contest with the princes of the house of Sassan The more sagacious Italians admonished their Eastern brethren of the folly and danger of such a hope and convinced them that the Medes and Persians were incapable of resisting the arms of the Huns and that the easy and important acquisition would exalt the pride as well as power of the conqueror Instead of contenting himself with a moderate contribution and a military title which equalled him only to the generals of Theodosius Attila would proceed to impose a disgraceful and intolerable yoke on the necks of the prostrate and captive Romans who would then be encompassed on all sides by the empire of the Huns seventeen Footnote sixteen Alii per Caspia claustra Armeniasque nives inopino tramite ducti Invadunt Orientis opes jam pascua fumant Cappadocum volucrumque parens Argaeus

edit Bonn p two hundred M Footnote seventeen See the original conversation in Priscus p sixty four sixty five While the powers of Europe and Asia were solicitous to avert the impending danger the alliance of Attila maintained the Vandals in the possession of Africa An enterprise had been concerted between the courts of Ravenna and Constantinople for the recovery of that valuable province and the ports of Sicily were already filled with the military and naval forces of Theodosius But the subtle Genseric who spread his negotiations round the world prevented their designs by exciting the king of the Huns to invade the Eastern empire and a trifling incident soon became the motive or pretence of a destructive war eighteen Under the faith of the treaty of Margus a free market was held on the Northern side of the Danube which was protected by a Roman fortress surnamed Constantia A troop of Barbarians violated the commercial security killed or dispersed the unsuspecting traders and levelled the fortress with the ground The Huns justified this outrage as an act of reprisal alleged that the bishop of Margus had entered their territories to discover and steal a secret treasure of their kings and sternly demanded the guilty prelate the sacrilegious spoil and the fugitive subjects who had escaped from the justice of Attila The refusal of the Byzantine court was the signal of war and the Maesians at first applauded the generous firmness of their sovereign But they were soon intimidated by the destruction of Viminiacum and the adjacent towns and the people was persuaded to adopt the convenient maxim that a private citizen however innocent or respectable may be justly sacrificed to the safety of his country The bishop of Margus who did not possess the spirit of a martyr resolved to prevent the designs which he suspected He boldly treated with the princes of the Huns secured by solemn oaths his pardon and reward posted a numerous detachment of Barbarians in silent ambush on the banks of the Danube and at the appointed hour opened with his own hand the gates of his episcopal city This advantage which had been obtained by treachery served as a prelude to more honorable and decisive victories The Illyrian frontier was covered by a line of castles and fortresses and though the greatest part of them consisted only of a single tower with a small garrison they were commonly sufficient to repel or to intercept the inroads of an enemy who was ignorant of the art and impatient of the delay of a regular siege But these slight obstacles were instantly swept away by the inundation of the Huns nineteen They destroyed with fire and sword the populous cities of Sirmium and Singidunum of Ratiaria and Marcianopolis of Naissus and Sardica where every circumstance of the discipline of the people and the construction of the buildings had been gradually adapted to the sole purpose of defence The whole breadth of Europe as it extends above five hundred miles from the Euxine to the Hadriatic was at once invaded and occupied and desolated by the myriads of Barbarians whom Attila led into the field The public danger and distress could not however provoke Theodosius to interrupt his amusements and devotion or to appear in person at the head of the Roman legions But the troops which had been sent against Genseric were hastily recalled from Sicily the garrisons on the side of Persia were exhausted and a military force was collected in Europe formidable by their arms and numbers if the generals had understood the science of command and the soldiers the duty of obedience The armies of the Eastern empire were vanquished in three successive engagements and the progress of Attila may be traced by the fields of battle The two former on the banks of the Utus and under the walls of Marcianopolis were fought in the extensive plains between the Danube and Mount Haemus As the Romans were pressed by a victorious enemy they gradually and unskilfully retired towards the Chersonesus of Thrace and that narrow peninsula the last extremity of the land was marked by their third and irreparable defeat By the destruction of this army Attila acquired the indisputable possession of the field From the Hellespont to Thermopylae and the suburbs of Constantinople he ravaged without resistance and without mercy the provinces of Thrace and Macedonia Heraclea and Hadrianople might perhaps escape this dreadful irruption of the Huns but the words the most expressive of total extirpation and erasure are applied to the calamities which they inflicted on seventy cities of the Eastern empire twenty Theodosius his court and the unwarlike people were protected by the walls of Constantinople but those walls had been shaken by a recent earthquake and the fall of fifty eight towers had opened a large and tremendous breach The damage indeed was speedily repaired but this accident was aggravated by a superstitious fear that Heaven itself had delivered the Imperial city to the shepherds of Scythia who were strangers to the laws the language and the religion of the Romans twenty one Footnote eighteen Priscus p three hundred thirty one His history contained a copious and elegant account of the war Evagrius l i c seventeen but the extracts which relate to the embassies are the only parts that have reached our times The original work was

possessions of the Huns Footnote twenty Septuaginta civitates says Prosper Tyro depredatione vastatoe The language of Count Marcellinus is still more forcible Pene totam Europam invasis excisisque civitatibus atque castellis conrasit Footnote twenty one Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom vi p one hundred six one hundred seven has paid great attention to this memorable earthquake which was felt as far from Constantinople as Antioch and Alexandria and is celebrated by all the ecclesiastical writers In the hands of a popular preacher an earthquake is an engine of admirable effect In all their invasions of the civilized empires of the South the Scythian shepherds have been uniformly actuated by a savage and destructive spirit The laws of war that restrain the exercise of national rapine and murder are founded on two principles of substantial interest the knowledge of the permanent benefits which may be obtained by a moderate use of conquest and a just apprehension lest the desolation which we inflict on the enemy s country may be retaliated on our own But these considerations of hope and fear are almost unknown in the pastoral state of nations The Huns of Attila may without injustice be compared to the Moguls and Tartars before their primitive manners were changed by religion and luxury and the evidence of Oriental history may reflect some light on the short and imperfect annals of Rome After the Moguls had subdued the northern provinces of China it was seriously proposed not in the hour of victory and passion but in calm deliberate council to exterminate all the inhabitants of that populous country that the vacant land might be converted to the pasture of cattle The firmness of a Chinese mandarin twenty two who insinuated some principles of rational policy into the mind of Zingis diverted him from the execution of this horrid design But in the cities of Asia which yielded to the Moguls the inhuman abuse of the rights of war was exercised with a regular form of discipline which may with equal reason though not with equal authority be imputed to the victorious Huns The inhabitants who had submitted to their discretion were ordered to evacuate their houses and to assemble in some plain adjacent to the city where a division was made of the vanquished into three parts The first class consisted of the soldiers of the garrison and of the young men capable of bearing arms and their fate was instantly decided they were either enlisted among the Moguls or they were massacred on the spot by the troops who with pointed spears and bended bows had formed a circle round the captive multitude The second class composed of the young and beautiful women of the artificers of every rank and profession and of the more wealthy or honorable citizens from whom a private ransom might be expected was distributed in equal or proportionable lots The remainder whose life or death was alike useless to the conquerors were permitted to return to the city which in the mean while had been stripped of its valuable furniture and a tax was imposed on those wretched inhabitants for the indulgence of breathing their native air Such was the behavior of the Moguls when they were not conscious of any extraordinary rigor twenty three But the most casual provocation the slightest motive of caprice or convenience often provoked them to involve a whole people in an indiscriminate massacre and the ruin of some flourishing cities was executed with such unrelenting perseverance that according to their own expression horses might run without stumbling over the ground where they had once stood The three great capitals of Khorasan Maru Neisabour and Herat were destroyed by the armies of Zingis and the exact account which was taken of the slain amounted to four millions three hundred and forty seven thousand persons twenty four Timur or Tamerlane was educated in a less barbarous age and in the profession of the Mahometan religion yet if Attila equalled the hostile ravages of Tamerlane twenty five either the Tartar or the Hun might deserve the epithet of the Scourge of God twenty six Footnote twenty two He represented to the emperor of the Moguls

ix twenty three and Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom vi p one hundred forty three Chapter XXXIV Attila Part II It may be affirmed with bolder assurance that the Huns depopulated the provinces of the empire by the number of Roman subjects whom they led away into captivity In the hands of a wise legislator such an industrious colony might have contributed to diffuse through the deserts of Scythia the rudiments of the useful and ornamental arts but these captives who had been taken in war were accidentally dispersed among the hordes that obeyed the empire of Attila The estimate of their respective value was formed by the simple judgment of unenlightened and unprejudiced Barbarians Perhaps they might not understand the merit of a theologian profoundly skilled in the controversies of the Trinity and the Incarnation yet they respected the ministers of every religion and the active zeal of the Christian missionaries without approaching the person or the palace of the monarch successfully labored in the propagation of the gospel twenty seven The pastoral tribes who were ignorant of the distinction of landed property must have disregarded the use as well as the abuse of civil jurisprudence and the skill of an eloquent lawyer could excite only their contempt or their abhorrence twenty eight The perpetual intercourse of the Huns and the Goths had communicated the familiar knowledge of the two national dialects and the Barbarians were ambitious of conversing in Latin the military idiom even of the Eastern empire twenty nine But they disdained the language and the sciences of the Greeks and the vain sophist or grave philosopher who had enjoyed the flattering applause of the schools was mortified to find that his robust servant was a captive of more value and importance than himself The mechanic arts were encouraged and esteemed as they tended to satisfy the wants of the Huns An architect in the service of Onegesius one of the favorites of Attila was employed to construct a bath but this work was a rare example of private luxury and the trades of the smith the carpenter the armorer were much more adapted to supply a wandering people with the useful instruments of peace and war But the merit of the physician was received with universal favor and respect the Barbarians who despised death might be apprehensive of disease and the haughty conqueror trembled in the presence of a captive to whom he ascribed perhaps an imaginary power of prolonging or preserving his life thirty The Huns might be provoked to insult the misery of their slaves over whom they exercised a despotic command thirty one but their manners were not susceptible of a refined system of oppression and the efforts of courage and diligence were often recompensed by the gift of freedom The historian Priscus whose embassy is a source of curious instruction was accosted in the camp of Attila by a stranger who saluted him in the Greek language but whose dress and figure displayed the appearance of a wealthy Scythian In the siege of Viminiacum he had lost according to his own account his fortune and liberty he became the slave of Onegesius but his faithful services against the Romans and the Acatzires had gradually raised him to the rank of the native Huns to whom he was attached by the domestic pledges of a new wife and several children The spoils of war had restored and improved his private property he was admitted to the table of his former lord and the apostate Greek blessed the hour of his captivity since it had been the introduction to a happy and independent state which he held by the honorable tenure of military service This reflection naturally produced a dispute on the advantages and defects of the Roman government which was severely arraigned by the apostate and defended by Priscus in a prolix and feeble declamation The freedman of Onegesius exposed in true and lively colors the vices of a declining empire of which he had so long been the victim the cruel absurdity of the Roman princes unable to protect their subjects against the public enemy unwilling to trust them with arms for their own defence the intolerable weight of taxes rendered still more oppressive by the intricate or arbitrary modes of collection the obscurity of numerous and contradictory laws the tedious and expensive forms of judicial

The loss of armies and the want of discipline or virtue were not supplied by the personal character of the monarch Theodosius might still affect the style as well as the title of Invincible Augustus but he was reduced to solicit the clemency of Attila who imperiously dictated these harsh and humiliating conditions of peace I The emperor of the East resigned by an express or tacit convention an extensive and important territory which stretched along the southern banks of the Danube from Singidunum or Belgrade as far as Novae in the diocese of Thrace The breadth was defined by the vague computation of fifteen three thousand three hundred eleven days journey but from the proposal of Attila to remove the situation of the national market it soon appeared that he comprehended the ruined city of Naissus within the limits of his dominions II The king of the Huns required and obtained that his tribute or subsidy should be augmented from seven hundred pounds of gold to the annual sum of two thousand one hundred and he stipulated the immediate payment of six thousand pounds of gold to defray the expenses or to expiate the guilt of the war One might imagine that such a demand which scarcely equalled the measure of private wealth would have been readily discharged by the opulent empire of the East and the public distress affords a remarkable proof of the impoverished or at least of the disorderly state of the finances A large proportion of the taxes extorted from the people was detained and intercepted in their passage though the foulest channels to the treasury of Constantinople The revenue was dissipated by Theodosius and his favorites in wasteful and profuse luxury which was disguised by the names of Imperial magnificence or Christian charity The immediate supplies had been exhausted by the unforeseen necessity of military preparations A personal contribution rigorously but capriciously imposed on the members of the senatorian order was the only expedient that could disarm without loss of time the impatient avarice of Attila and the poverty of the nobles compelled them to adopt the scandalous resource of exposing to public auction the jewels of their wives and the hereditary ornaments of their palaces thirty four III The king of the Huns appears to have established as a principle of national jurisprudence that he could never lose the property which he had once acquired in the persons who had yielded either a voluntary or reluctant submission to his authority From this principle he concluded and the conclusions of Attila were irrevocable laws that the Huns who had been taken prisoner in war should be released without delay and without ransom that every Roman captive who had presumed to escape should purchase his right to freedom at the price of twelve pieces of gold and that all the Barbarians who had deserted the standard of Attila should be restored without any promise or stipulation of pardon In the execution of this cruel and ignominious treaty the Imperial officers were forced to massacre several loyal and noble deserters who refused to devote themselves to certain death and the Romans forfeited all reasonable claims to the friendship of any Scythian people by this public confession that they were destitute either of faith or power to protect the suppliant who had embraced the throne of Theodosius thirty five Footnote thirty three Nova iterum Orienti assurgit ruina quum nulla ab Cocidentalibus ferrentur auxilia Prosper Tyro composed his Chronicle in the West and his observation

it has never been mentioned by any historian or geographer exposed the disgrace of the emperor and empire Azimus or Azimuntium a small city of Thrace on the Illyrian borders thirty six had been distinguished by the martial spirit of its youth the skill and reputation of the leaders whom they had chosen and their daring exploits against the innumerable host of the Barbarians Instead of tamely expecting their approach the Azimuntines attacked in frequent and successful sallies the troops of the Huns who gradually declined the dangerous neighborhood rescued from their hands the spoil and the captives and recruited their domestic force by the voluntary association of fugitives and deserters After the conclusion of the treaty Attila still menaced the empire with implacable war unless the Azimuntines were persuaded or compelled to comply with the conditions which their sovereign had accepted The ministers of Theodosius confessed with shame and with truth that they no longer possessed any authority over a society of men who so bravely asserted their natural independence and the king of the Huns condescended to negotiate an equal exchange with the citizens of Azimus They demanded the restitution of some shepherds who with their cattle had been accidentally surprised A strict though fruitless inquiry was allowed but the Huns were obliged to swear that they did not detain any prisoners belonging to the city before they could recover two surviving countrymen whom the Azimuntines had reserved as pledges for the safety of their lost companions Attila on his side was satisfied and deceived by their solemn asseveration that the rest of the captives had been put to the sword and that it was their constant practice immediately to dismiss the Romans and the deserters who had obtained the security of the public faith This prudent and officious dissimulation may be condemned or excused by the casuists as they incline to the rigid decree of saint Augustin or to the milder sentiment of saint Jerom and saint Chrysostom but every soldier every statesman must acknowledge that if the race of the Azimuntines had been encouraged and multiplied the Barbarians would have ceased to trample on the majesty of the empire thirty seven Footnote thirty six Priscus p thirty five thirty six Among the hundred and eighty two forts or castles of Thrace enumerated by Procopius de

saint Jerom and saint Augustin who labored by different expedients to reconcile the seeming quarrel of the two apostles saint Peter and saint Paul depends on the solution of an important question Middleton s Works vol ii p five twenty which has been frequently agitated by Catholic and Protestant divines and even by lawyers and philosophers of every age It would have been strange indeed if Theodosius had purchased by the loss of honor a secure and solid tranquillity or if his tameness had not invited the repetition of injuries The Byzantine court was insulted by five or six successive embassies thirty eight and the ministers of Attila were uniformly instructed to press the tardy or imperfect execution of the last treaty to produce the names of fugitives and deserters who were still protected by the empire and to declare with seeming moderation that unless their sovereign obtained complete and immediate satisfaction it would be impossible for him were it even his wish to check the resentment of his warlike tribes Besides the motives of pride and interest which might prompt the king of the Huns to continue this train of negotiation he was influenced by the less honorable view of enriching his favorites at the expense of his enemies The Imperial treasury was exhausted to procure the friendly offices of the ambassadors and their principal attendants whose favorable report might conduce to the maintenance of peace The Barbarian monarch was flattered by the liberal reception of his ministers he computed with pleasure the value and splendor of their gifts rigorously exacted the performance of every promise which would contribute to their private emolument and treated as an important business of state the marriage of his secretary Constantius thirty nine That Gallic adventurer who was recommended by Aetius to the king of the Huns had engaged his service to the ministers of Constantinople for the stipulated reward of a wealthy and noble wife and the daughter of Count Saturninus was chosen to discharge the obligations of her country The reluctance of the victim some domestic troubles and the unjust confiscation of her fortune cooled the ardor of her interested lover but he still demanded in the name of Attila an equivalent alliance and after many ambiguous delays and excuses the Byzantine court was compelled to sacrifice to this insolent stranger the widow of Armatius whose birth opulence and beauty placed her in the most illustrious rank of the Roman matrons For these importunate and oppressive embassies Attila claimed a suitable return he weighed with suspicious pride the character and station of the Imperial envoys but he condescended to promise that he would advance as far as Sardica to receive any ministers who had been invested with the consular dignity The council of Theodosius eluded this proposal by representing the desolate and ruined condition of Sardica and even ventured to insinuate that every officer of the army or household was qualified to treat with the most powerful princes of Scythia Maximin forty a respectable courtier whose abilities had been long exercised in civil and military employments accepted with reluctance the troublesome and perhaps dangerous commission of reconciling the angry spirit of the king of the Huns His friend the historian Priscus forty one embraced the opportunity of observing the Barbarian hero in the peaceful and domestic scenes of life but the secret of the embassy a fatal and guilty secret was intrusted only to the interpreter Vigilius The two last ambassadors of the Huns Orestes a noble subject of the Pannonian province and Edecon a valiant chieftain of the tribe of the Scyrri returned at the same time from Constantinople to the royal camp Their obscure names were afterwards illustrated by the extraordinary fortune and the contrast of their sons the two servants of Attila became the fathers of the last Roman emperor of the West and of the first Barbarian king of Italy Footnote thirty eight Montesquieu Considerations sur la Grandeur c c xix has delineated with a bold and easy pencil some of the most striking circumstances of the pride of

Notwithstanding the charitable judgment of the critics I suspect that Priscus was a Pagan Note Niebuhr concurs in this opinion Life of Priscus in the new edition of the Byzantine historians M The ambassadors who were followed by a numerous train of men and horses made their first halt at Sardica at the distance of three hundred and fifty miles or thirteen days journey from Constantinople As the remains of Sardica were still included within the limits of the empire it was incumbent on the Romans to exercise the duties of hospitality They provided with the assistance of the provincials a sufficient number of sheep and oxen and invited the Huns to a splendid or at least a plentiful supper But the harmony of the entertainment was soon disturbed by mutual prejudice and indiscretion The greatness of the emperor and the empire was warmly maintained by their ministers the Huns with equal ardor asserted the superiority of their victorious monarch the dispute was inflamed by the rash and unseasonable flattery of Vigilius who passionately rejected the comparison of a mere mortal with the divine Theodosius and it was with extreme difficulty that Maximin and Priscus were able to divert the conversation or to soothe the angry minds of the Barbarians When they rose from table the Imperial ambassador presented Edecon and Orestes with rich gifts of silk robes and Indian pearls which they thankfully accepted Yet Orestes could not forbear insinuating that he had not always been treated with such respect and liberality and the offensive distinction which was implied between his civil office and the hereditary rank of his colleague seems to have made Edecon a doubtful friend and Orestes an irreconcilable enemy After this entertainment they travelled about one hundred miles from Sardica to Naissus That flourishing city which has given birth to the great Constantine was levelled with the ground the inhabitants were destroyed or dispersed and the appearance of some sick persons who were still permitted to exist among the ruins of the churches served only to increase the horror of the prospect The surface of the country was covered with the bones of the slain and the ambassadors who directed their course to the north west were obliged to pass the hills of modern Servia before they descended into the flat and marshy grounds which are terminated by the Danube The Huns were masters of the great river their navigation was performed in large canoes hollowed out of the trunk of a single tree the ministers of Theodosius were safely landed on the opposite bank and their Barbarian associates immediately hastened to the camp of Attila which was equally prepared for the amusements of hunting or of war No sooner had Maximin advanced about two miles four thousand one hundred eleven from the Danube than he began to experience the fastidious insolence of the conqueror He was sternly forbid to pitch his tents in a pleasant valley lest he should infringe the distant awe that was due to the royal mansion four thousand one hundred twelve The ministers of Attila pressed them to communicate the business and the instructions which he reserved for the ear of their sovereign When Maximin temperately urged the contrary practice of nations he was still more confounded to find that the resolutions of the Sacred Consistory those secrets says Priscus which should not be revealed to the gods themselves had been treacherously disclosed to the public enemy On his refusal to comply with such ignominious terms the Imperial envoy was commanded instantly to depart the order was recalled it was again repeated and the Huns renewed their ineffectual attempts to subdue the patient firmness of Maximin At length by the intercession of Scotta the brother of Onegesius whose friendship had been purchased by a liberal gift he was admitted to the royal presence but in stead of obtaining a decisive answer he was compelled to undertake a remote journey towards the north that Attila might enjoy the proud satisfaction of receiving in the same camp the ambassadors of the Eastern and Western empires His journey was regulated by the guides who obliged him to halt to hasten his march or to deviate from the common road as it best suited the convenience of the king The Romans who traversed the plains of Hungary suppose that they passed several navigable rivers either in canoes or portable boats but there is reason to suspect that the winding stream of the Teyss or Tibiscus might present itself in different places under different names From the contiguous villages they received a plentiful and regular supply of provisions mead instead of wine millet in the place of bread and a certain liquor named camus which according to the report of Priscus was distilled from barley forty two Such fare might appear coarse and indelicate to men who had tasted the luxury of Constantinople but in their accidental distress they were relieved by the gentleness and hospitality of the same Barbarians so terrible and so merciless in war The ambassadors had encamped on the edge of a large morass A violent tempest of wind and rain of thunder and lightning overturned their tents immersed their baggage and furniture in the water and scattered their retinue who wandered in the darkness of the night uncertain of their road and apprehensive of some unknown danger till they awakened by their cries the inhabitants of a neighboring village the property of the widow of Bleda A bright illumination and in a few moments a comfortable fire of reeds was kindled by their officious benevolence the wants and even the desires of the Romans were liberally satisfied and they seem to have been embarrassed by the singular politeness of Bleda s widow who added to her other favors the gift or at least the loan of a sufficient number of beautiful and obsequious damsels The sunshine of the succeeding day was dedicated to repose to collect and dry the baggage and to the refreshment of the men and horses but in the evening before they pursued their journey the ambassadors expressed their gratitude to the bounteous lady of the village by a very acceptable present of silver cups red fleeces dried fruits and Indian pepper Soon after this adventure they rejoined the march of Attila from whom they had been separated about six days and slowly proceeded to the capital of an empire which did not contain in the space of several thousand miles a single city Footnote four thousand one hundred eleven seventy stadia Priscus one hundred seventy

Genealogical History of the Tartars p four hundred twenty three four hundred fifty five c As far as we may ascertain the vague and obscure geography of Priscus this capital appears to have been seated between the Danube the Teyss and the Carpathian hills in the plains of Upper Hungary and most probably in the neighborhood of Jezberin Agria or Tokay forty three In its origin it could be no more than an accidental camp which by the long and frequent residence of Attila had insensibly swelled into a huge village for the reception of his court of the troops who followed his person and of the various multitude of idle or industrious slaves and retainers forty four The baths constructed by Onegesius were the only edifice of stone the materials had been transported from Pannonia and since the adjacent country was destitute even of large timber it may be presumed that the meaner habitations of the royal village consisted of straw or mud or of canvass The wooden houses of the more illustrious Huns were built and adorned with rude magnificence according to the rank the fortune or the taste of the proprietors They seem to have been distributed with some degree of order and symmetry and each spot became more honorable as it approached the person of the sovereign The palace of Attila which surpassed all other houses in his dominions was built entirely of wood and covered an ample space of ground The outward enclosure was a lofty wall or palisade of smooth square timber intersected with high towers but intended rather for ornament than defence This wall which seems to have encircled the declivity of a hill comprehended a great variety of wooden edifices adapted to the uses of royalty A separate house was assigned to each of the numerous wives of Attila and instead of the rigid and illiberal confinement imposed by Asiatic jealousy they politely admitted the Roman ambassadors to their presence their table and even to the freedom of an innocent embrace When Maximin offered his presents to Cerca four thousand four hundred eleven the principal queen he admired the singular architecture on her mansion the height of the round columns the size and beauty of the wood which was curiously shaped or turned or polished or carved and his attentive eye was able to discover some taste in the ornaments and some regularity in the proportions After passing through the guards who watched before the gate the ambassadors were introduced into the private apartment of Cerca The wife of Attila received their visit sitting or rather lying on a soft couch the floor was covered with a carpet the domestics formed a circle round the queen and her damsels seated on the ground were employed in working the variegated embroidery which adorned the dress of the Barbaric warriors The Huns were ambitious of displaying those riches which were the fruit and evidence of their victories the trappings of their horses their swords and even their shoes were studded with gold and precious stones and their tables were profusely spread with plates and goblets and vases of gold and silver which had been fashioned by the labor of Grecian artists The monarch alone assumed the superior pride of still adhering to the simplicity of his Scythian ancestors forty five The dress of Attila his arms and the furniture of his horse were plain without ornament and of a single color The royal table was served in wooden cups and platters flesh was his only food and the conqueror of the North never tasted the luxury of bread Footnote forty three It is evident that Priscus passed the Danube and the Teyss and that he did not reach the foot of the Carpathian hills Agria Tokay and Jazberin are situated in the plains circumscribed by this definition M de Buat Histoire des Peuples c tom vii p four hundred sixty one has chosen Tokay Otrokosci p one hundred eighty apud Mascou ix twenty three a learned Hungarian has preferred Jazberin a place about thirty six miles westward of Buda and the Danube Note M saint Martin considers the narrative of Priscus the only authority of M de Buat and of Gibbon too vague to fix the position of Attila s camp It is worthy of remark that in the Hungarian traditions collected by Thwrocz l two c seventeen precisely on the left branch of the Danube where Attila s residence was situated in the same parallel stands the present city of Buda in Hungarian Buduvur It is for this reason that this city has retained for a long time among the Germans of Hungary the name of Etzelnburgh or Etzela burgh i e the city of Attila The distance of Buda from the place where Priscus crossed the Danube on his way from Naissus is equal to that which he traversed to reach the residence of the king of the Huns I see no good reason for not acceding to the relations of the Hungarian historians saint Martin vi one hundred ninety one M Footnote forty four The royal village of Attila may be compared to the city of Karacorum the residence of the successors of Zingis which though it appears to have been a more stable habitation did not equal the size or splendor of the town and abbey of saint Denys in the thirteenth century See Rubruquis in the Histoire Generale des Voyages tom vii p two hundred eighty six The camp of Aurengzebe as it is so agreeably described by Bernier tom ii p two hundred seventeen two hundred thirty five blended the manners of

Toncat the throne of Zingis was still covered with the original black felt carpet on which he had been seated when he was raised to the command of his warlike countrymen See Vie de Gengiscan v c nine When Attila first gave audience to the Roman ambassadors on the banks of the Danube his tent was encompassed with a formidable guard The monarch himself was seated in a wooden chair His stern countenance angry gestures and impatient tone astonished the firmness of Maximin but Vigilius had more reason to tremble since he distinctly understood the menace that if Attila did not respect the law of nations he would nail the deceitful interpreter to the cross and leave his body to the vultures The Barbarian condescended by producing an accurate list to expose the bold falsehood of Vigilius who had affirmed that no more than seventeen deserters could be found But he arrogantly declared that he apprehended only the disgrace of contending with his fugitive slaves since he despised their impotent efforts to defend the provinces which Theodosius had intrusted to their arms For what fortress added Attila what city in the wide extent of the Roman empire can hope to exist secure and impregnable if it is our pleasure that it should be erased from the earth He dismissed however the interpreter who returned to Constantinople with his peremptory demand of more complete restitution and a more splendid embassy His anger gradually subsided and his domestic satisfaction in a marriage which he celebrated on the road with the daughter of Eslam four thousand five hundred eleven might perhaps contribute to mollify the native fierceness of his temper The entrance of Attila into the royal village was marked by a very singular ceremony A numerous troop of women came out to meet their hero and their king They marched before him distributed into long and regular files the intervals between the files were filled by white veils of thin linen which the women on either side bore aloft in their hands and which formed a canopy for a chorus of young virgins who chanted hymns and songs in the Scythian language The wife of his favorite Onegesius with a train of female attendants saluted Attila at the door of her own house on his way to the palace and offered according to the custom of the country her respectful homage by entreating him to taste the wine and meat which she had prepared for his reception As soon as the monarch had graciously accepted her hospitable gift his domestics lifted a small silver table to a convenient height as he sat on horseback and Attila when he had touched the goblet with his lips again saluted the wife of Onegesius and continued his march During his residence at the seat of empire his hours were not wasted in the recluse idleness of a seraglio and the king of the Huns could maintain his superior dignity without concealing his person from the public view He frequently assembled his council and gave audience to the ambassadors of the nations and his people might appeal to the supreme tribunal which he held at stated times and according to the Eastern custom before the principal gate of his wooden palace The Romans both of the East and of the West were twice invited to the banquets where Attila feasted with the princes and nobles of Scythia Maximin and his colleagues were stopped on the threshold till they had made a devout libation to the health and prosperity of the king of the Huns and were conducted after this ceremony to their respective seats in a spacious hall The royal table and couch covered with carpets and fine linen was raised by several steps in the midst of the hall and a son an uncle or perhaps a favorite king were admitted to share the simple and homely repast of Attila Two lines of small tables each of which contained three or four guests were ranged in order on either hand the right was esteemed the most honorable but the Romans ingenuously confess that they were placed on the left and that Beric an unknown chieftain most probably of the Gothic race preceded the representatives of Theodosius and Valentinian The Barbarian monarch received from his cup bearer a goblet filled with wine and courteously drank to the health of the most distinguished guest who rose from his seat and expressed in the same manner his loyal and respectful vows This ceremony was successively performed for all or at least for the illustrious persons of the assembly and a considerable time must have been consumed since it was thrice repeated as each course or service was placed on the table But the wine still remained after the meat had been removed and the Huns continued to indulge their intemperance long after the sober and decent ambassadors of the two empires had withdrawn themselves from the nocturnal banquet Yet before they retired they enjoyed a singular opportunity of observing the manners of the nation in their convivial amusements Two Scythians stood before the couch of Attila and recited the verses which they had composed to celebrate his valor and his victories four thousand five hundred twelve A profound silence prevailed in the hall and the attention of the guests was captivated by the vocal harmony which revived and perpetuated the memory of their own exploits a martial ardor flashed from the eyes of the warriors who were impatient for battle and the tears of the old men expressed their generous despair that they could no longer partake the danger and glory of the field forty six This entertainment which might be considered as a school of military virtue was succeeded by a farce that debased the dignity of human nature A Moorish and a Scythian buffcon four thousand six hundred eleven successively excited the mirth of the rude spectators by their deformed figure ridiculous dress antic gestures absurd speeches and the strange unintelligible confusion of the Latin the Gothic and the Hunnic languages and the hall resounded with loud and licentious peals of laughter In the midst of this intemperate riot Attila alone without a change of countenance maintained his steadfast and inflexible gravity which was never relaxed except on the entrance of Irnac the youngest of his sons he embraced the boy with a smile of paternal tenderness gently pinched him by the cheek and betrayed a partial affection which was justified by the assurance of his prophets that Irnac would be the future support of his family and empire Two days afterwards the ambassadors received a second invitation and they had reason to praise the politeness as well as the hospitality of Attila The king of the Huns held a long and familiar conversation with Maximin but his civility was interrupted by rude expressions and haughty reproaches and he was provoked by a motive of interest to support with unbecoming zeal the private claims of his secretary Constantius The emperor said Attila has long promised him a rich wife Constantius must not be disappointed nor should a Roman emperor deserve the name of liar On the third day the ambassadors were dismissed the freedom of several captives was granted for a moderate ransom to their pressing entreaties and besides the royal presents they were permitted to accept from each of the Scythian nobles the honorable and useful gift of a horse Maximin returned by the same road to Constantinople and though he was involved in an accidental dispute with Beric the new ambassador of Attila he flattered himself that he had contributed by the laborious journey to confirm the peace and alliance of the two nations forty seven Footnote four thousand five hundred eleven Was this his own daughter or the daughter of a person named Escam Gibbon has written incorrectly Eslam an unknown name The officer of Attila called Eslas In either case the construction is imperfect a good Greek writer would have introduced an article to determine the sense Nor is it quite clear whether Scythian usage is adduced to excuse the polygamy or a marriage which would be considered incestuous in other countries The Latin version has carefully preserved the ambiguity filiam Escam uxorem I am not inclined to construe it his own daughter though I have too little confidence in the uniformity of the grammatical idioms of the Byzantines though Priscus is one of the best to express myself without hesitation M Footnote four thousand five hundred twelve This passage is remarkable from the connection of the name of Attila with that extraordinary cycle of poetry which is found in different forms in almost all the Teutonic languages A Latin poem de prima expeditione Attilae Regis Hunnorum in Gallias was published in the year seventeen eighty by Fischer at Leipsic It contains with the continuation fourteen fifty two lines It abounds in metrical faults but is occasionally not without some rude spirit and some copiousness of fancy in the variation of the circumstances in the different combats of the hero Walther prince of Aquitania It contains little which can be supposed historical and still less which is characteristic concerning Attila It relates to a first expedition of Attila into Europe which cannot be traced in history during which the kings of the Franks of the Burgundians and of Aquitaine submit themselves and give hostages to Attila the king of the Franks a personage who seems the same with the Hagen of Teutonic romance the king of Burgundy his daughter Heldgund the king of Aquitaine his son Walther The main subject of the poem is the escape of Walther and Heldgund from the camp of Attila and the combat between Walther and Gunthar king of the Franks with his twelve peers among whom is Hagen Walther had been betrayed while he passed through Worms the city of the Frankish king by paying for his ferry over the Rhine with some strange fish which he had caught during his flight and which were unknown in the waters of the Rhine Gunthar was desirous of plundering him of the treasure which Walther had carried off from the camp of Attila The author of this poem is unknown nor can I on the vague and rather doubtful allusion to Thule as Iceland venture to assign its date It was evidently recited in a monastery as appears by the first line and no doubt composed there The faults of metre would point out a late date and it may have been formed upon some local tradition as Walther the hero seems to have turned monk This poem however in its character and its incidents bears no relation to the Teutonic cycle of which the Nibelungen Lied is the most complete form In this in the Heldenbuch in some of the Danish Sagas in countess lays and ballads in all the dialects of Scandinavia appears King Etzel Attila in strife with the Burgundians and the Franks With these appears by a poetic anachronism Dietrich of Berne Theodoric of Verona the celebrated Ostrogothic king and many other very singular coincidences of historic names which appear in the poems See Lachman Kritik der Sage in his volume of various readings to the Nibelungen Berlin eighteen thirty six p three hundred thirty six Chapter XXXIV Attila Part III I must acknowledge myself unable to form any satisfactory theory as to the connection of these poems with the history of the time or the period from which they may date their origin notwithstanding the laborious investigations and critical sagacity of the Schlegels the Grimms of P E Muller and Lachman and a whole host of German critics and antiquaries not to omit our own countryman mister Herbert whose theory concerning Attila is certainly neither deficient in boldness nor originality I conceive the only way to obtain any thing like a clear conception on this point would be what Lachman has begun see above patiently to collect and compare the various forms which the traditions have assumed without any preconceived either mythical or poetical theory and if possible to discover the original basis of the whole rich and fantastic legend One point which to me is strongly in favor of the antiquity of this poetic cycle is that the manners are so clearly anterior to chivalry and to the influence exercised on the poetic literature of Europe by the chivalrous poems and romances I think I find some traces of that influence in the Latin poem though strained through the imagination of a monk The English reader will find an amusing account of the German Nibelungen and Heldenbuch and of some of the Scandinavian Sagas in the volume of Northern Antiquities published by Weber the friend of Sir Walter Scott Scott himself contributed a considerable no doubt far the most valuable part to the work forty six four thousand six hundred eleven forty seven See also the various German editions of the Nibelungen to which Lachman with true German perseverance has compiled a thick volume of various readings the Heldenbuch the old Danish poems by Grimm the Eddas c Herbert s Attila p five hundred ten et seq M Footnote forty six If we may believe

observations and was not susceptible of any collateral evidence may be found in Priscus p forty nine seventy But I have not confined myself to the same order and I had previously extracted the historical circumstances which were less intimately connected with the journey and business of the Roman ambassadors But the Roman ambassador was ignorant of the treacherous design which had been concealed under the mask of the public faith The surprise and satisfaction of Edecon when he contemplated the splendor of Constantinople had encouraged the interpreter Vigilius to procure for him a secret interview with the eunuch Chrysaphius forty eight who governed the emperor and the empire After some previous conversation and a mutual oath of secrecy the eunuch who had not from his own feelings or experience imbibed any exalted notions of ministerial virtue ventured to propose the death of Attila as an important service by which Edecon might deserve a liberal share of the wealth and luxury which he admired The ambassador of the Huns listened to the tempting offer and professed with apparent zeal his ability as well as readiness to execute the bloody deed the design was communicated to the master of the offices and the devout Theodosius consented to the assassination of his invincible enemy But this perfidious conspiracy was defeated by the dissimulation or the repentance of Edecon and though he might exaggerate his inward abhorrence for the treason which he seemed to approve he dexterously assumed the merit of an early and voluntary confession If we now review the embassy of Maximin and the behavior of Attila we must applaud the Barbarian who respected the laws of hospitality and generously entertained and dismissed the minister of a prince who had conspired against his life But the rashness of Vigilius will appear still more extraordinary since he returned conscious of his guilt and danger to the royal camp accompanied by his son and carrying with him a weighty purse of gold which the favorite eunuch had furnished to satisfy the demands of Edecon and to corrupt the fidelity of the guards The interpreter was instantly seized and dragged before the tribunal of Attila where he asserted his innocence with specious firmness till the threat of inflicting instant death on his son extorted from him a sincere discovery of the criminal transaction Under the name of ransom or confiscation the rapacious king of the Huns accepted two hundred pounds of gold for the life of a traitor whom he disdained to punish He pointed his just indignation against a nobler object His ambassadors Eslaw and Orestes were immediately despatched to Constantinople with a peremptory instruction which it was much safer for them to execute than to disobey They boldly entered the Imperial presence with the fatal purse hanging down from the neck of Orestes who interrogated the eunuch Chrysaphius as he stood beside the throne whether he recognized the evidence of his guilt But the office of reproof was reserved for the superior dignity of his colleague Eslaw who gravely addressed the emperor of the East in the following words Theodosius is the son of an illustrious and respectable parent Attila likewise is descended from a noble race and he has supported by his actions the dignity which he inherited from his father Mundzuk But Theodosius has forfeited his paternal honors and by consenting to pay tribute has degraded himself to the condition of a slave It is therefore just that he should reverence the man whom fortune and merit have placed above him instead of attempting like a wicked slave clandestinely to conspire against his master The son of Arcadius who was accustomed only to the voice of flattery heard with astonishment the severe language of truth he blushed and trembled nor did he presume directly to refuse the head of Chrysaphius which Eslaw and Orestes were instructed to demand A solemn embassy armed with full powers and magnificent gifts was hastily sent to deprecate the wrath of Attila and his pride was gratified by the choice of Nomius and Anatolius two ministers of consular or patrician rank of whom the one was great treasurer and the other was master general of the armies of the East He condescended to meet these ambassadors on the banks of the River Drenco and though he at first affected a stern and haughty demeanor his anger was insensibly mollified by their eloquence and liberality He condescended to pardon the emperor the eunuch and the interpreter bound himself by an oath to observe the conditions of peace released a great number of captives abandoned the fugitives and deserters to their fate and resigned a large territory to the south of the Danube which he had already exhausted of its wealth and inhabitants But this treaty was purchased at an expense which might have supported a vigorous and successful war and the subjects of Theodosius were compelled to redeem the safety of a worthless favorite by oppressive taxes which they would more cheerfully have paid for his destruction forty nine Footnote forty eight M de Tillemont has very properly given the succession of chamberlains who reigned in the name of Theodosius Chrysaphius was the last and according to the unanimous evidence of history the worst of these favorites see Hist des Empereurs tom vi p one hundred

This secret conspiracy and its important consequences may be traced in the fragments of Priscus p thirty seven thirty eight thirty nine fifty four seventy seventy one seventy two The chronology of that historian is not fixed by any precise date but the series of negotiations between Attila and the Eastern empire must be included within the three or four years which are terminated A D four hundred fifty by the death of Theodosius The emperor Theodosius did not long survive the most humiliating circumstance of an inglorious life As he was riding or hunting in the neighborhood of Constantinople he was thrown from his horse into the River Lycus the spine of the back was injured by the fall and he expired some days afterwards in the fiftieth year of his age and the forty third of his reign fifty His sister Pulcheria whose authority had been controlled both in civil and ecclesiastical affairs by the pernicious influence of the eunuchs was unanimously proclaimed Empress of the East and the Romans for the first time submitted to a female reign No sooner had Pulcheria ascended the throne than she indulged her own and the public resentment by an act of popular justice Without any legal trial the eunuch Chrysaphius was executed before the gates of the city and the immense riches which had been accumulated by the rapacious favorite served only to hasten and to justify his punishment fifty one Amidst the general acclamations of the clergy and people the empress did not forget the prejudice and disadvantage to which her sex was exposed and she wisely resolved to prevent their murmurs by the choice of a colleague who would always respect the superior rank and virgin chastity of his wife She gave her hand to Marcian a senator about sixty years of age and the nominal husband of Pulcheria was solemnly invested with the Imperial purple The zeal which he displayed for the orthodox creed as it was established by the council of Chalcedon would alone have inspired the grateful eloquence of the Catholics But the behavior of Marcian in a private life and afterwards on the throne may support a more rational belief that he was qualified to restore and invigorate an empire which had been almost dissolved by the successive weakness of two hereditary monarchs He was born in Thrace and educated to the profession of arms but Marcian s youth had been severely exercised by poverty and misfortune since his only resource when he first arrived at Constantinople consisted in two hundred pieces of gold which he had borrowed of a friend He passed nineteen years in the domestic and military service of Aspar and his son Ardaburius followed those powerful generals to the Persian and African wars and obtained by their influence the honorable rank of tribune and senator His mild disposition and useful talents without alarming the jealousy recommended Marcian to the esteem and favor of his patrons he had seen perhaps he had felt the abuses of a venal and oppressive administration and his own example gave weight and energy to the laws which he promulgated for the reformation of manners fifty two Footnote fifty Theodorus the Reader see Vales

we may safely give credit to Nicephorus Callistus a Greek of the fourteenth century Footnote fifty one Pulcheriae nutu says Count Marcellinus sua cum avaritia interemptus est She abandoned the eunuch to the pious revenge of a son whose father had suffered at his instigation Note Might not the execution of Chrysaphius have been a sacrifice to avert the anger of Attila whose assassination the eunuch had attempted to contrive M Footnote fifty two de Bell Vandal l i c four Evagrius l ii c one Theophanes p ninety ninety one Novell ad Calcem Cod Theod tom vi p thirty The praises which saint Leo and

Aetius And The Visigoths Attila Invades And Evacuates Italy The Deaths Of Attila Aetius And Valentinian The Third It was the opinion of Marcian that war should be avoided as long as it is possible to preserve a secure and honorable peace but it was likewise his opinion that peace cannot be honorable or secure if the sovereign betrays a pusillanimous aversion to war This temperate courage dictated his reply to the demands of Attila who insolently pressed the payment of the annual tribute The emperor signified to the Barbarians that they must no longer insult the majesty of Rome by the mention of a tribute that he was disposed to reward with becoming liberality the faithful friendship of his allies but that if they presumed to violate the public peace they should feel that he possessed troops and arms and resolution to repel their attacks The same language even in the camp of the Huns was used by his ambassador Apollonius whose bold refusal to deliver the presents till he had been admitted to a personal interview displayed a sense of dignity and a contempt of danger which Attila was not prepared to expect from the degenerate Romans one He threatened to chastise the rash successor of Theodosius but he hesitated whether he should first direct his invincible arms against the Eastern or the Western empire While mankind awaited his decision with awful suspense he sent an equal defiance to the courts of Ravenna and Constantinople and his ministers saluted the two emperors with the same haughty declaration Attila my lord and thy lord commands thee to provide a palace for his immediate reception two But as the Barbarian despised or affected to despise the Romans of the East whom he had so often vanquished he soon declared his resolution of suspending the easy conquest till he had achieved a more glorious and important enterprise In the memorable invasions of Gaul and Italy the Huns were naturally attracted by the wealth and fertility of those provinces but the particular motives and provocations of Attila can only be explained by the state of the Western empire under the reign of Valentinian or to speak more correctly under the administration of Aetius three Footnote one See Priscus p thirty nine seventy two Footnote two The Alexandrian or Paschal Chronicle which introduces this haughty message during the lifetime of Theodosius may have anticipated the date but the dull annalist was incapable of inventing the original and genuine style of Attila Footnote three The second book of the Histoire Critique de l Etablissement de la Monarchie Francoise tom i p one hundred eighty nine four hundred twenty four throws great light on the state of Gaul when it was invaded by Attila but the ingenious author the Abbe Dubos too often bewilders himself in system and conjecture After the death of his rival Boniface Aetius had prudently retired to the tents of the Huns and he was indebted to their alliance for his safety and his restoration Instead of the suppliant language of a guilty exile he solicited his pardon at the head of sixty thousand Barbarians and the empress Placidia confessed by a feeble resistance that the condescension which might have been ascribed to clemency was the effect of weakness or fear She delivered herself her son Valentinian and the Western empire into the hands of an insolent subject nor could Placidia protect the son in law of Boniface the virtuous and faithful Sebastian four from the implacable persecution which urged him from one kingdom to another till he miserably perished in the service of the Vandals The fortunate Aetius who was immediately promoted to the rank of patrician and thrice invested with the honors of the consulship assumed with the title of master of the cavalry and infantry the whole military power of the state and he is sometimes styled by contemporary writers the duke or general of the Romans of the West His prudence rather than his virtue engaged him to leave the grandson of Theodosius in the possession of the purple and Valentinian was permitted to enjoy the peace and luxury of Italy while the patrician appeared in the glorious light of a hero and a patriot who supported near twenty years the ruins of the Western empire The Gothic historian ingenuously confesses that Aetius was born for the salvation of the Roman republic five and the following portrait though it is drawn in the fairest colors must be allowed to contain a much larger proportion of truth than of flattery four hundred eleven His mother was a wealthy and noble Italian and his father Gaudentius who held a distinguished rank in the province of Scythia gradually rose from the station of a military domestic to the dignity of master of the cavalry Their son who was enrolled almost in his infancy in the guards was given as a hostage first to Alaric and afterwards to the Huns four hundred twelve and he successively obtained the civil and military honors of the palace for which he was equally qualified by superior merit The graceful figure of Aetius was not above the middle stature but his manly limbs were admirably formed for strength beauty and agility and he excelled in the martial exercises of managing a horse drawing the bow and darting the javelin He could patiently endure the want of food or of sleep and his mind and body were alike capable of the most laborious efforts He possessed the genuine courage that can despise not only dangers but injuries and it was impossible either to corrupt or deceive or intimidate the firm integrity of his soul six The Barbarians who had seated themselves in the Western provinces were insensibly taught to respect the faith and valor of the patrician Aetius He soothed their passions consulted their prejudices balanced their interests and checked their ambition six hundred eleven A seasonable treaty which he concluded with Genseric protected Italy from the depredations of the Vandals the independent Britons implored and acknowledged his salutary aid the Imperial authority was restored and maintained in Gaul and Spain and he compelled the Franks and the Suevi whom he had vanquished in the field to become the useful confederates of the republic Footnote four Victor Vitensis de Persecut Vandal l i six p eight edit Ruinart calls him acer consilio et strenuus in bello but his courage when he became unfortunate was

hostage or an exile he had familiarly conversed with Attila himself the nephew of his benefactor and the two famous antagonists appeared to have been connected by a personal and military friendship which they afterwards confirmed by mutual gifts frequent embassies and the education of Carpilio the son of Aetius in the camp of Attila By the specious professions of gratitude and voluntary attachment the patrician might disguise his apprehensions of the Scythian conqueror who pressed the two empires with his innumerable armies His demands were obeyed or eluded When he claimed the spoils of a vanquished city some vases of gold which had been fraudulently embezzled the civil and military governors of Noricum were immediately despatched to satisfy his complaints seven and it is evident from their conversation with Maximin and Priscus in the royal village that the valor and prudence of Aetius had not saved the Western Romans from the common ignominy of tribute Yet his dexterous policy prolonged the advantages of a salutary peace and a numerous army of Huns and Alani whom he had attached to his person was employed in the defence of Gaul Two colonies of these Barbarians were judiciously fixed in the territories of Valens and Orleans eight and their active cavalry secured the important passages of the Rhone and of the Loire These savage allies were not indeed less formidable to the subjects than to the enemies of Rome Their original settlement was enforced with the licentious violence of conquest and the province through which they marched was exposed to all the calamities of a hostile invasion nine Strangers to the emperor or the republic the Alani of Gaul was devoted to the ambition of Aetius and though he might suspect that in a contest with Attila himself they would revolt to the standard of their national king the patrician labored to restrain rather than to excite their zeal and resentment against the Goths the Burgundians and the Franks Footnote seven The embassy consisted of Count Romulus of Promotus president of Noricum and of Romanus the military duke They were accompanied by Tatullus an illustrious citizen of Petovio in the same

ferre queas qui durior hoste See Dubos tom i p three hundred thirty The kingdom established by the Visigoths in the southern provinces of Gaul had gradually acquired strength and maturity and the conduct of those ambitious Barbarians either in peace or war engaged the perpetual vigilance of Aetius After the death of Wallia the Gothic sceptre devolved to Theodoric the son of the great Alaric ten and his prosperous reign of more than thirty years over a turbulent people may be allowed to prove that his prudence was supported by uncommon vigor both of mind and body Impatient of his narrow limits Theodoric aspired to the possession of Arles the wealthy seat of government and commerce but the city was saved by the timely approach of Aetius and the Gothic king who had raised the siege with some loss and disgrace was persuaded for an adequate subsidy to divert the martial valor of his subjects in a Spanish war Yet Theodoric still watched and eagerly seized the favorable moment of renewing his hostile attempts The Goths besieged Narbonne while the Belgic provinces were invaded by the Burgundians and the public safety was threatened on every side by the apparent union of the enemies of Rome On every side the activity of Aetius and his Scythian cavalry opposed a firm and successful resistance Twenty thousand Burgundians were slain in battle and the remains of the nation humbly accepted a dependent seat in the mountains of Savoy eleven The walls of Narbonne had been shaken by the battering engines and the inhabitants had endured the last extremities of famine when Count Litorius approaching in silence and directing each horseman to carry behind him two sacks of flour cut his way through the intrenchments of the besiegers The siege was immediately raised and the more decisive victory which is ascribed to the personal conduct of Aetius himself was marked with the blood of eight thousand Goths But in the absence of the patrician who was hastily summoned to Italy by some public or private interest Count Litorius succeeded to the command and his presumption soon discovered that far different talents are required to lead a wing of cavalry or to direct the operations of an important war At the head of an army of Huns he rashly advanced to the gates of Thoulouse full of careless contempt for an enemy whom his misfortunes had rendered prudent and his situation made desperate The predictions of the augurs had inspired Litorius with the profane confidence that he should enter the Gothic capital in triumph and the trust which he reposed in his Pagan allies encouraged him to reject the fair conditions of peace which were repeatedly proposed by the bishops in the name of Theodoric The king of the Goths exhibited in his distress the edifying contrast of Christian piety and moderation nor did he lay aside his sackcloth and ashes till he was prepared to arm for the combat His soldiers animated with martial and religious enthusiasm assaulted the camp of Litorius The conflict was obstinate the slaughter was mutual The Roman general after a total defeat which could be imputed only to his unskilful rashness was actually led through the streets of Thoulouse not in his own but in a hostile triumph and the misery which he experienced in a long and ignominious captivity excited the compassion of the Barbarians themselves twelve Such a loss in a country whose spirit and finances were long since exhausted could not easily be repaired and the Goths assuming in their turn the sentiments of ambition and revenge would have planted their victorious standards on the banks of the Rhone if the presence of Aetius had not restored strength and discipline to the Romans thirteen The two armies expected the signal of a decisive action but the generals who were conscious of each other s force and doubtful of their own superiority prudently sheathed their swords in the field of battle and their reconciliation was permanent and sincere Theodoric king of the Visigoths appears to have deserved the love of his subjects the confidence of his allies and the esteem of mankind His throne was surrounded by six valiant sons who were educated with equal care in the exercises of the Barbarian camp and in those of the Gallic schools from the study of the Roman jurisprudence they acquired the theory at least of law and justice and the harmonious sense of Virgil contributed to soften the asperity of their native manners fourteen The two daughters of the Gothic king were given in marriage to the eldest sons of the kings of the Suevi and of the Vandals who reigned in Spain and Africa but these illustrious alliances were pregnant with guilt and discord The queen of the Suevi bewailed the death of a husband inhumanly massacred by her brother The princess of the Vandals was the victim of a jealous tyrant whom she called her father The cruel Genseric suspected that his son s wife had conspired to poison him the supposed crime was punished by the amputation of her nose and ears and the unhappy daughter of Theodoric was ignominiously returned to the court of Thoulouse in that deformed and mutilated condition This horrid act which must seem incredible to a civilized age drew tears from every spectator but Theodoric was urged by the feelings of a parent and a king to revenge such irreparable injuries The Imperial ministers who always cherished the discord of the Barbarians would have supplied the Goths with arms and ships and treasures for the African war and the cruelty of Genseric might have been fatal to himself if the artful Vandal had not armed in his cause the formidable power of the Huns His rich gifts and pressing solicitations inflamed the ambition of Attila and the designs of Aetius and Theodoric were prevented by the invasion of Gaul fifteen Footnote ten Theodoric II the son of Theodoric I declares to Avitus his resolution of repairing or expiating the faults which his grandfather had committed

fashion of long hair was the ensign of their birth and dignity Their flaxen locks which they combed and dressed with singular care hung down in flowing ringlets on their back and shoulders while the rest of the nation were obliged either by law or custom to shave the hinder part of their head to comb their hair over the forehead and to content themselves with the ornament of two small whiskers eighteen The lofty stature of the Franks and their blue eyes denoted a Germanic origin their close apparel accurately expressed the figure of their limbs a weighty sword was suspended from a broad belt their bodies were protected by a large shield and these warlike Barbarians were trained from their earliest youth to run to leap to swim to dart the javelin or battle axe with unerring aim to advance without hesitation against a superior enemy and to maintain either in life or death the invincible reputation of their ancestors nineteen Clodion the first of their long haired kings whose name and actions are mentioned in authentic history held his residence at Dispargum twenty a village or fortress whose place may be assigned between Louvain and Brussels From the report of his spies the king of the Franks was informed that the defenceless state of the second Belgic must yield on the slightest attack to the valor of his subjects He boldly penetrated through the thickets and morasses of the Carbonarian forest twenty one occupied Tournay and Cambray the only cities which existed in the fifth century and extended his conquests as far as the River Somme over a desolate

security the marriage perhaps of his son the nuptial feast was interrupted by the unexpected and unwelcome presence of Aetius who had passed the Somme at the head of his light cavalry The tables which had been spread under the shelter of a hill along the banks of a pleasant stream were rudely overturned the Franks were oppressed before they could recover their arms or their ranks and their unavailing valor was fatal only to themselves The loaded wagons which had followed their march afforded a rich booty and the virgin bride with her female attendants submitted to the new lovers who were imposed on them by the chance of war This advance which had been obtained by the skill and activity of Aetius might reflect some disgrace on the military prudence of Clodion but the king of the Franks soon regained his strength and reputation and still maintained the possession of his Gallic kingdom from the Rhine to the Somme twenty four Under his reign and most probably from the thee enterprising spirit of his subjects his three capitals Mentz Treves and Cologne experienced the effects of hostile cruelty and avarice The distress of Cologne was prolonged by the perpetual dominion of the same Barbarians who evacuated the ruins of Treves and Treves which in the space of forty years had been four times besieged and pillaged was disposed to lose the memory of her afflictions in

splendid gifts and the strongest assurances of friendship and support During his absence his elder brother had solicited with equal ardor the formidable aid of Attila and the king of the Huns embraced

resolution of supporting the cause of his allies the Vandals and the Franks at the same time and almost in the spirit of romantic chivalry the savage monarch professed himself the lover and the champion of the princess Honoria The sister of Valentinian was educated in the palace of Ravenna and as her marriage might be productive of some danger to the state she was raised by the title of Augusta twenty eight above the hopes of the most presumptuous subject But the fair Honoria had no sooner attained the sixteenth year of her age than she detested the importunate greatness which must forever exclude her from the comforts of honorable love in the midst of vain and unsatisfactory pomp Honoria sighed yielded to the impulse of nature and threw herself into the arms of her chamberlain Eugenius Her guilt and shame such is the absurd language of imperious man were soon betrayed by the appearances of pregnancy but the disgrace of the royal family was published to the world by the imprudence of the empress Placidia who dismissed her daughter after a strict and shameful confinement to a remote exile at Constantinople The unhappy princess passed twelve or fourteen years in the irksome society of the sisters of Theodosius and their chosen virgins to whose crown Honoria could no longer aspire and whose monastic assiduity of prayer fasting and vigils she reluctantly imitated Her impatience of long and hopeless celibacy urged her to embrace a strange and desperate resolution The name of Attila was familiar and formidable at Constantinople and his frequent embassies entertained a perpetual intercourse between his camp and the Imperial palace In the pursuit of love or rather of revenge the daughter of Placidia sacrificed every duty and every prejudice and offered to deliver her person into the arms of a Barbarian of whose language she was ignorant whose figure was scarcely human and whose religion and manners she abhorred By the ministry of a faithful eunuch she transmitted to Attila a ring the pledge of her affection and earnestly conjured him to claim her as a lawful spouse to whom he had been secretly betrothed These indecent advances were received however with coldness and disdain and the king of the Huns continued to multiply the number of his wives till his love was awakened by the more forcible passions of ambition and avarice The invasion of Gaul was preceded and justified by a formal demand of the princess Honoria with a just and equal share of the Imperial patrimony His predecessors the ancient Tanjous had often addressed in the same hostile and peremptory manner the daughters of China and the pretensions of Attila were not less offensive to the majesty of Rome A firm but temperate refusal was communicated to his ambassadors The right of female succession though it might derive a specious argument from the recent examples of Placidia and Pulcheria was strenuously denied and the indissoluble engagements of Honoria were opposed to the claims of her Scythian lover twenty nine On the discovery of her connection with the king of the Huns the guilty princess had been sent away as an object of horror from Constantinople to Italy her life was spared but the ceremony of her marriage was performed with some obscure and nominal husband before she was immured in a perpetual prison to bewail those crimes and misfortunes which Honoria might have escaped had she not been born the daughter of an emperor thirty Footnote twenty eight A medal is still extant which exhibits the pleasing countenance of Honoria with the title of Augusta and on the reverse the improper legend of Salus Reipublicoe round the monogram of Christ See Ducange Famil Byzantin p sixty seven seventy three Footnote twenty nine See Priscus p thirty nine

Chronicles of Prosper and Marcellinus but they cannot be made consistent or probable unless we separate by an interval of time and place her intrigue with Eugenius and her invitation of Attila A native of Gaul and a contemporary the learned and eloquent Sidonius who was afterwards bishop of Clermont had made a promise to one of his friends that he would compose a regular history of the war of Attila If the modesty of Sidonius had not discouraged him from the prosecution of this interesting work thirty one the historian would have related with the simplicity of truth those memorable events to which the poet in vague and doubtful metaphors has concisely alluded thirty two The kings and nations of Germany and Scythia from the Volga perhaps to the Danube obeyed the warlike summons of Attila From the royal village in the plains of Hungary his standard moved towards the West and after a march of seven or eight hundred miles he reached the conflux of the Rhine and the Neckar where he was joined by the Franks who adhered to his ally the elder of the sons of Clodion A troop of light Barbarians who roamed in quest of plunder might choose the winter for the convenience of passing the river on the ice but the innumerable cavalry of the Huns required such plenty of forage and provisions as could be procured only in a milder season the Hercynian forest supplied materials for a bridge of boats and the hostile myriads were poured with resistless violence into the Belgic provinces thirty three The consternation of Gaul was universal and the various fortunes of its cities have been adorned by tradition with martyrdoms and miracles thirty four Troyes was saved by the merits of saint Lupus saint Servatius was removed from the world that he might not behold the ruin of Tongres and the prayers of saint Genevieve diverted the march of Attila from the neighborhood of Paris But as the greatest part of the Gallic cities were alike destitute of saints and soldiers they were besieged and stormed by the Huns who practised in the example of Metz thirty five their customary maxims of war They involved in a promiscuous massacre the priests who served at the altar and the infants who in the hour of danger had been providently baptized by the bishop the flourishing city was delivered to the flames and a solitary chapel of saint Stephen marked the place where it formerly stood From the Rhine and the Moselle Attila advanced into the heart of Gaul crossed the Seine at Auxerre and after a long and laborious march fixed his camp under the walls of Orleans He was desirous of securing his conquests by the possession of an advantageous post which commanded the passage of the Loire and he depended on the secret invitation of Sangiban king of the Alani who had promised to betray the city and to revolt from the service of the empire But this treacherous conspiracy was detected and disappointed Orleans had been strengthened with recent fortifications and the assaults of the Huns were vigorously repelled by the faithful valor of the soldiers or citizens who defended the place The pastoral diligence of Anianus a bishop of primitive sanctity and consummate prudence exhausted every art of religious policy to support their courage till the arrival of the expected succors After an obstinate siege the walls were shaken by the battering rams the Huns had already occupied the suburbs and the people who were incapable of bearing arms lay prostrate in prayer Anianus who anxiously counted the days and hours despatched a trusty messenger to observe from the rampari the face of the distant country He returned twice without any intelligence that could inspire hope or comfort but in his third report he mentioned a small cloud which he had faintly descried at the extremity of the horizon It is the aid of God exclaimed the bishop in a tone of pious confidence and the whole multitude repeated after him It is the aid of God The remote object on which every eye was fixed became each moment larger and more distinct the Roman and Gothic banners were gradually perceived and a favorable wind blowing aside the dust discovered in deep array the impatient squadrons of Aetius

undertaken the apology of Attila and the Barbarians appeals to the false Idatius parcens Germaniae et Galliae and forgets that the true Idatius had explicitly affirmed plurimae civitates effractoe among which he enumerates Metz The facility with which Attila had penetrated into the heart of Gaul may be ascribed to his insidious policy as well as to the terror of his arms His public declarations were skilfully mitigated by his private assurances he alternately soothed and threatened the Romans and the Goths and the courts of Ravenna and Thoulouse mutually suspicious of each other s intentions beheld with supine indifference the approach of their common enemy Aetius was the sole guardian of the public safety but his wisest measures were embarrassed by a faction which since the death of Placidia infested the Imperial palace the youth of Italy trembled at the sound of the trumpet and the Barbarians who from fear or affection were inclined to the cause of Attila awaited with doubtful and venal faith the event of the war The patrician passed the Alps at the head of some troops whose strength and numbers scarcely deserved the name of an army thirty six But on his arrival at Arles or Lyons he was confounded by the intelligence that the Visigoths refusing to embrace the defence of Gaul had determined to expect within their own territories the formidable invader whom they professed to despise The senator Avitus who after the honorable exercise of the Praetorian praefecture had retired to his estate in Auvergne was persuaded to accept the important embassy which he executed with ability and success He represented to Theodoric that an ambitious conqueror who aspired to the dominion of the earth could be resisted only by the firm and unanimous alliance of the powers whom he labored to oppress The lively eloquence of Avitus inflamed the Gothic warriors by the description of the injuries which their ancestors had suffered from the Huns whose implacable fury still pursued them from the Danube to the foot of the Pyrenees He strenuously urged that it was the duty of every Christian to save from sacrilegious violation the churches of God and the relics of the saints that it was the interest of every Barbarian who had acquired a settlement in Gaul to defend the fields and vineyards which were cultivated for his use against the desolation of the Scythian shepherds Theodoric yielded to the evidence of truth adopted the measure at once the most prudent and the most honorable and declared that as the faithful ally of Aetius and the Romans he was ready to expose his life and kingdom for the common safety of Gaul thirty seven The Visigoths who at that time were in the mature vigor of their fame and power obeyed with alacrity the signal of war prepared their arms and horses and assembled under the standard of their aged king who was resolved with his two eldest sons Torismond and Theodoric to command in person his numerous and valiant people The example of the Goths determined several tribes or nations that seemed to fluctuate between the Huns and the Romans The indefatigable diligence of the patrician gradually collected the troops of Gaul and Germany who had formerly acknowledged themselves the subjects or soldiers of the republic but who now claimed the rewards of voluntary service and the rank of independent allies the Laeti the Armoricans the Breones the Saxons the Burgundians the Sarmatians or Alani the Ripuarians and the Franks who followed Meroveus as their lawful prince Such was the various army which under the conduct of Aetius and Theodoric advanced by rapid marches to relieve Orleans and to give battle to the innumerable host of Attila thirty eight Footnote thirty six Vix liquerat Alpes Aetius tenue et rarum sine

former exalts the merit and importance of Avitus orbis Avite salus c The latter is anxious to show the Goths in the most favorable light Yet their agreement when they are fairly interpreted is a proof of their veracity Footnote thirty eight The review of the army of Aetius is made by Jornandes c thirty six p six hundred sixty four edit Grot tom ii p twenty three of the Historians of France with the notes of the Benedictine editor The Loeti were a promiscuous race of Barbarians born or naturalized in Gaul and the Riparii or Ripuarii derived their name from their post on the three rivers the Rhine the Meuse and the Moselle the Armoricans possessed the independent cities between the Seine and the Loire A colony of Saxons had been planted in the diocese of Bayeux the Burgundians were settled in Savoy and the Breones were a warlike tribe of Rhaetians to the east of the Lake of Constance On their approach the king of the Huns immediately raised the siege and sounded a retreat to recall the foremost of his troops from the pillage of a city which they had already entered thirty nine The valor of Attila was always guided by his prudence and as he foresaw the fatal consequences of a defeat in the heart of Gaul he repassed the Seine and expected the enemy in the plains of Chalons whose smooth and level surface was adapted to the operations of his Scythian cavalry But in this tumultuary retreat the vanguard of the Romans and their allies continually pressed and sometimes engaged the troops whom Attila had posted in the rear the hostile columns in the darkness of the night and the perplexity of the roads might encounter each other without design and the bloody conflict of the Franks and Gepidae in which fifteen thousand forty Barbarians were slain was a prelude to a more general and decisive action The Catalaunian fields forty one spread themselves round Chalons and extend according to the vague measurement of Jornandes to the length of one hundred and fifty and the breadth of one hundred miles over the whole province which is entitled to the appellation of a champaign country forty two This spacious plain was distinguished however by some inequalities of ground and the importance of a height which commanded the camp of Attila was understood and disputed by the two generals The young and valiant Torismond first occupied the summit the Goths rushed with irresistible weight on the Huns who labored to ascend from the opposite side and the possession of this advantageous post inspired both the troops and their leaders with a fair assurance of victory The anxiety of Attila prompted him to consult his priests and haruspices It was reported that after scrutinizing the entrails of victims and scraping their bones they revealed in mysterious language his own defeat with the death of his principal adversary and that the Barbarians by accepting the equivalent expressed his involuntary esteem for the superior merit of Aetius But the unusual despondency which seemed to prevail among the Huns engaged Attila to use the expedient so familiar to the generals of antiquity of animating his troops by a military oration and his language was that of a king who had often fought and conquered at their head forty three He pressed them to consider their past glory their actual danger and their future hopes The same fortune which opened the deserts and morasses of Scythia to their unarmed valor which had laid so many warlike nations prostrate at their feet had reserved the joys of this memorable field for the consummation of their victories The cautious steps of their enemies their strict alliance and their advantageous posts he artfully represented as the effects not of prudence but of fear The Visigoths alone were the strength and nerves of the opposite army and the Huns might securely trample on the degenerate Romans whose close and compact order betrayed their apprehensions and who were equally incapable of supporting the dangers or the fatigues of a day of battle The doctrine of predestination so favorable to martia virtue was carefully inculcated by the king of the Huns who assured his subjects that the warriors protected by Heaven were safe and invulnerable amidst the darts of the enemy but that the unerring Fates would strike their victims in the bosom of inglorious peace I myself continued Attila will throw the first javelin and the wretch who refuses to imitate the example of his sovereign is devoted to inevitable death The spirit of the Barbarians was rekindled by the presence the voice and the example of their intrepid leader and Attila yielding to their impatience immediately formed his order of battle At the head of his brave and faithful Huns he occupied in person the centre of the line The nations subject to his empire the Rugians the Heruli the Thuringians the Franks the Burgundians were extended on either hand over the ample space of the Catalaunian fields the right wing was commanded by Ardaric king of the Gepidae and the three valiant brothers who reigned over the Ostrogoths were posted on the left to oppose the kindred tribes of the Visigoths The disposition of the allies was regulated by a different principle Sangiban the faithless king of the Alani was placed in the centre where his motions might be strictly watched and that the treachery might be instantly punished Aetius assumed the command of the left and Theodoric of the right wing while Torismond still continued to occupy the heights which appear to have stretched on the flank and perhaps the rear of the Scythian army The nations from the Volga to the Atlantic were assembled on the plain of Chalons but many of these nations had been divided by faction or conquest or emigration and the appearance of similar arms and ensigns which threatened each other presented the image of a civil war Footnote thirty nine Aurelianensis urbis obsidio oppugnatio irruptio nec direptio l v Sidon Apollin l viii Epist

repeat his discourse to Cassiodorus the ideas and even the expressions have an original Scythian cast and I doubt whether an Italian of the sixth century would have thought of the hujus certaminis

are described by the same genius which conceived and executed them may tend to improve if such improvement can be wished the art of destroying the human species But the battle of Chalons can only excite our curiosity by the magnitude of the object since it was decided by the blind impetuosity of Barbarians and has been related by partial writers whose civil or ecclesiastical profession secluded them from the knowledge of military affairs Cassiolorus however had familiarly conversed with many Gothic warriors who served in that memorable engagement a conflict as they informed him fierce various obstinate and bloody such as could not be paralleled either in the present or in past ages The number of the slain amounted to one hundred and sixty two thousand or according to another account three hundred thousand persons forty four and these incredible exaggerations suppose a real and effective loss sufficient to justify the historian s remark that whole generations may be swept away by the madness of kings in the space of a single hour After the mutual and repeated discharge of missile weapons in which the archers of Scythia might signalize their superior dexterity the cavalry and infantry of the two armies were furiously mingled in closer combat The Huns who fought under the eyes of their king pierced through the feeble and doubtful centre of the allies separated their wings from each other and wheeling with a rapid effort to the left directed their whole force against the Visigoths As Theodoric rode along the ranks to animate his troops he received a mortal stroke from the javelin of Andages a noble Ostrogoth and immediately fell from his horse The wounded king was oppressed in the general disorder and trampled under the feet of his own cavalry and this important death served to explain the ambiguous prophecy of the haruspices Attila already exulted in the confidence of victory when the valiant Torismond descended from the hills and verified the remainder of the prediction The Visigoths who had been thrown into confusion by the flight or defection of the Alani gradually restored their order of battle and the Huns were undoubtedly vanquished since Attila was compelled to retreat He had exposed his person with the rashness of a private soldier but the intrepid troops of the centre had pushed forwards beyond the rest of the line their attack was faintly supported their flanks were unguarded and the conquerors of Scythia and Germany were saved by the approach of the night from a total defeat They retired within the circle of wagons that fortified their camp and the dismounted squadrons prepared themselves for a defence to which neither their arms nor their temper were adapted The event was doubtful but Attila had secured a last and honorable resource The saddles and rich furniture of the cavalry were collected by his order into a funeral pile and the magnanimous Barbarian had resolved if his intrenchments should be forced to rush headlong into the flames and to deprive his enemies of the glory which they might have acquired by the death or captivity of Attila forty five Footnote forty four The expressions of Jornandes or rather of Cassiodorus are extremely strong Bellum atrox multiplex immane pertinax cui simile nulla usquam narrat antiquitas ubi talia gesta referuntur ut nihil esset quod in vita sua conspicere

people c Footnote forty five The count de Buat Hist des Peuples c tom vii p five hundred fifty four five hundred seventy three still depending on the false and again rejecting the true Idatius has divided the defeat of Attila into two great battles the former near Orleans the latter in Champagne in the one Theodoric was slain in the other he was revenged But his enemies had passed the night in equal disorder and anxiety The inconsiderate courage of Torismond was tempted to urge the pursuit till he unexpectedly found himself with a few followers in the midst of the Scythian wagons In the confusion of a nocturnal combat he was thrown from his horse and the Gothic prince must have perished like his father if his youthful strength and the intrepid zeal of his companions had not rescued him from this dangerous situation In the same manner but on the left of the line Aetius himself separated from his allies ignorant of their victory and anxious for their fate encountered and escaped the hostile troops that were scattered over the plains of Chalons and at length reached the camp of the Goths which he could only fortify with a slight rampart of shields till the dawn of day The Imperial general was soon satisfied of the defeat of Attila who still remained inactive within his intrenchments and when he contemplated the bloody scene he observed with secret satisfaction that the loss had principally fallen on the Barbarians The body of Theodoric pierced with honorable wounds was discovered under a heap of the slain is subjects bewailed the death of their king and father but their tears were mingled with songs and acclamations and his funeral rites were performed in the face of a vanquished enemy The Goths clashing their arms elevated on a buckler his eldest son Torismond to whom they justly ascribed the glory of their success and the new king accepted the obligation of revenge as a sacred portion of his paternal inheritance Yet the Goths themselves were astonished by the fierce and undaunted aspect of their formidable antagonist and their historian has compared Attila to a lion encompassed in his den and threatening his hunters with redoubled fury The kings and nations who might have deserted his standard in the hour of distress were made sensible that the displeasure of their monarch was the most imminent and inevitable danger All his instruments of martial music incessantly sounded a loud and animating strain of defiance and the foremost troops who advanced to the assault were checked or destroyed by showers of arrows from every side of the intrenchments It was determined in a general council of war to besiege the king of the Huns in his camp to intercept his provisions and to reduce him to the alternative of a disgraceful treaty or an unequal combat But the impatience of the Barbarians soon disdained these cautious and dilatory measures and the mature policy of Aetius was apprehensive that after the extirpation of the Huns the republic would be oppressed by the pride and power of the Gothic nation The patrician exerted the superior ascendant of authority and reason to calm the passions which the son of Theodoric considered as a duty represented with seeming affection and real truth the dangers of absence and delay and persuaded Torismond to disappoint by his speedy return the ambitious designs of his brothers who might occupy the throne and treasures of Thoulouse forty six After the departure of the Goths and the separation of the allied army Attila was surprised at the vast silence that reigned over the plains of Chalons the suspicion of some hostile stratagem detained him several days within the circle of his wagons and his retreat beyond the Rhine confessed the last victory which was achieved in the name of the Western empire Meroveus and his Franks observing a prudent distance and magnifying the opinion of their strength by the numerous fires which they kindled every night continued to follow the rear of the Huns till they reached the confines of Thuringia The Thuringians served in the army of Attila they traversed both in their march and in their return the territories of the Franks and it was perhaps in this war that they exercised the cruelties which about fourscore years afterwards were revenged by the son of Clovis They massacred their hostages as well as their captives two hundred young maidens were tortured with exquisite and unrelenting rage their bodies were torn asunder by wild horses or their bones were crushed under the weight of rolling wagons and their unburied limbs were abandoned on the public roads as a prey to dogs and vultures Such were those savage ancestors whose imaginary virtues have sometimes excited the praise and envy of civilized ages forty seven Footnote forty six Jornandes de Rebus Geticis c forty one p six hundred seventy one The policy of Aetius and the behavior of Torismond are extremely natural and the patrician according to Gregory of Tours l ii c seven p one hundred sixty three dismissed the prince of the Franks by suggesting to him a similar apprehension The false Idatius ridiculously pretends that Aetius paid a clandestine nocturnal visit to the kings of the Huns and of the Visigoths from each of whom he obtained a bribe of ten thousand pieces of gold as the price of an undisturbed retreat Footnote forty seven These cruelties which are passionately deplored by Theodoric the son of Clovis Gregory of Tours l iii c ten p one hundred ninety suit the time and circumstances of the invasion of Attila His residence in

the failure of the Gallic expedition In the ensuing spring he repeated his demand of the princess Honoria and her patrimonial treasures The demand was again rejected or eluded and the indignant lover immediately took the field passed the Alps invaded Italy and besieged Aquileia with an innumerable host of Barbarians Those Barbarians were unskilled in the methods of conducting a regular siege which even among the ancients required some knowledge or at least some practice of the mechanic arts But the labor of many thousand provincials and captives whose lives were sacrificed without pity might execute the most painful and dangerous work The skill of the Roman artists might be corrupted to the destruction of their country The walls of Aquileia were assaulted by a formidable train of battering rams movable turrets and engines that threw stones darts and fire forty eight and the monarch of the Huns employed the forcible impulse of hope fear emulation and interest to subvert the only barrier which delayed the conquest of Italy Aquileia was at that period one of the richest the most populous and the strongest of the maritime cities of the Adriatic coast The Gothic auxiliaries who appeared to have served under their native princes Alaric and Antala communicated their intrepid spirit and the citizens still remembered the glorious and successful resistance which their ancestors had opposed to a fierce inexorable Barbarian who disgraced the majesty of the Roman purple Three months were consumed without effect in the siege of the Aquileia till the want of provisions and the clamors of his army compelled Attila to relinquish the enterprise and reluctantly to issue his orders that the troops should strike their tents the next morning and begin their retreat But as he rode round the walls pensive angry and disappointed he observed a stork preparing to leave her nest in one of the towers and to fly with her infant family towards the country He seized with the ready penetration of a statesman this trifling incident which chance had offered to superstition and exclaimed in a loud and cheerful tone that such a domestic bird so constantly attached to human society would never have abandoned her ancient seats unless those towers had been devoted to impending ruin and solitude forty nine The favorable omen inspired an assurance of victory the siege was renewed and prosecuted with fresh vigor a large breach was made in the part of the wall from whence the stork had taken her flight the Huns mounted to the assault with irresistible fury and the succeeding generation could scarcely discover the ruins of Aquileia fifty After this dreadful chastisement Attila pursued his march and as he passed the cities of Altinum Concordia and Padua were reduced into heaps of stones and ashes The inland towns Vicenza Verona and Bergamo were exposed to the rapacious cruelty of the Huns Milan and Pavia submitted without resistance to the loss of their wealth and applauded the unusual clemency which preserved from the flames the public as well as private buildings and spared the lives of the captive multitude The popular traditions of Comum Turin or Modena may justly be suspected yet they concur with more authentic evidence to prove that Attila spread his ravages over the rich plains of modern Lombardy which are divided by the Po and bounded by the Alps and Apennine fifty one When he took possession of the royal palace of Milan he was surprised and offended at the sight of a picture which represented the Caesars seated on their throne and the princes of Scythia prostrate at their feet The revenge which Attila inflicted on this monument of Roman vanity was harmless and ingenious He commanded a painter to reverse the figures and the attitudes and the emperors were delineated on the same canvas approaching in a suppliant posture to empty their bags of tributary gold before the throne of the Scythian monarch fifty two The spectators must have confessed the truth and propriety of the alteration and were perhaps tempted to apply on this singular occasion the well known fable of the dispute between the lion and the man

omitted this most lame and impotent conclusion It is a saying worthy of the ferocious pride of Attila that the grass never grew on the spot where his horse had trod Yet the savage destroyer undesignedly laid the foundation of a republic which revived in the feudal state of Europe the art and spirit of commercial industry The celebrated name of Venice or Venetia fifty four was formerly diffused over a large and fertile province of Italy from the confines of Pannonia to the River Addua and from the Po to the Rhaetian and Julian Alps Before the irruption of the Barbarians fifty Venetian cities flourished in peace and prosperity Aquileia was placed in the most conspicuous station but the ancient dignity of Padua was supported by agriculture and manufactures and the property of five hundred citizens who were entitled to the equestrian rank must have amounted at the strictest computation to one million seven hundred thousand pounds Many families of Aquileia Padua and the adjacent towns who fled from the sword of the Huns found a safe though obscure refuge in the neighboring islands fifty five At the extremity of the Gulf where the Adriatic feebly imitates the tides of the ocean near a hundred small islands are separated by shallow water from the continent and protected from the waves by several long slips of land which admit the entrance of vessels through some secret and narrow channels fifty six Till the middle of the fifth century these remote and sequestered spots remained without cultivation with few inhabitants and almost without a name But the manners of the Venetian fugitives their arts and their government were gradually formed by their new situation and one of the epistles of Cassiodorus fifty seven which describes their condition about seventy years afterwards may be considered as the primitive monument of the republic five hundred seventy one The minister of Theodoric compares them in his quaint declamatory style to water fowl who had fixed their nests on the bosom of the waves and though he allows that the Venetian provinces had formerly contained many noble families he insinuates that they were now reduced by misfortune to the same level of humble poverty Fish was the common and almost the universal food of every rank their only treasure consisted in the plenty of salt which they extracted from the sea and the exchange of that commodity so essential to human life was substituted in the neighboring markets to the currency of gold and silver A people whose habitations might be doubtfully assigned to the earth or water soon became alike familiar with the two elements and the demands of avarice succeeded to those of necessity The islanders who from Grado to Chiozza were intimately connected with each other penetrated into the heart of Italy by the secure though laborious navigation of the rivers and inland canals Their vessels which were continually increasing in size and number visited all the harbors of the Gulf and the marriage which Venice annually celebrates with the Adriatic was contracted in her early infancy The epistle of Cassiodorus the Praetorian praefect is addressed to the maritime tribunes and he exhorts them in a mild tone of authority to animate the zeal of their countrymen for the public service which required their assistance to transport the magazines of wine and oil from the province of

islands scattered upon the coast and that from thence arose the names of Venetia prima and secunda of which the first applied to the main land and the second to the islands and lagunes From the time of the Pelasgi and of the Etrurians the first Veneti inhabiting a fertile and pleasant country devoted themselves to agriculture the second placed in the midst of canals at the mouth of several rivers conveniently situated with regard to the islands of Greece as well as the fertile plains of Italy applied themselves to navigation and commerce Both submitted to the Romans a short time before the second Punic war yet it was not till after the victory of Marius over the Cimbri that their country was reduced to a Roman province Under the emperors Venetia Prima obtained more than once by its calamities a place in history But the maritime province was occupied in salt works fisheries and commerce The Romans have considered the inhabitants of this part as beneath the dignity of history and have left them in obscurity They dwelt there until the period when their islands afforded a retreat to their ruined and fugitive compatriots Sismondi Hist des Rep Italiens v i p three hundred thirteen

Squittinio This book which has been exalted far above its merits is stained in every line with the disingenuous malevolence of party but the principal evidence genuine and apocryphal is brought together and the reader will easily choose the fair medium The Italians who had long since renounced the exercise of arms were surprised after forty years peace by the approach of a formidable Barbarian whom they abhorred as the enemy of their religion as well as of their republic Amidst the general consternation Aetius alone was incapable of fear but it was impossible that he should achieve alone and unassisted any military exploits worthy of his former renown The Barbarians who had defended Gaul refused to march to the relief of Italy and the succors promised by the Eastern emperor were distant and doubtful Since Aetius at the head of his domestic troops still maintained the field and harassed or retarded the march of Attila he never showed himself more truly great than at the time when his conduct was blamed by an ignorant and ungrateful people fifty nine If the mind of Valentinian had been susceptible of any generous sentiments he would have chosen such a general for his example and his guide But the timid grandson of Theodosius instead of sharing the dangers escaped from the sound of war and his hasty retreat from Ravenna to Rome from an impregnable fortress to an open capital betrayed his secret intention of abandoning Italy as soon as the danger should approach his Imperial person This shameful abdication was suspended however by the spirit of doubt and delay which commonly adheres to pusillanimous counsels and sometimes corrects their pernicious tendency The Western emperor with the senate and people of Rome embraced the more salutary resolution of deprecating by a solemn and suppliant embassy the wrath of Attila This important commission was accepted by Avienus who from his birth and riches his consular dignity the numerous train of his clients and his personal abilities held the first rank in the Roman senate The specious and artful character of Avienus sixty was admirably qualified to conduct a negotiation either of public or private interest his colleague Trigetius had exercised the Praetorian praefecture of Italy and Leo bishop of Rome consented to expose his life for the safety of his flock The genius of Leo sixty one was exercised and displayed in the public misfortunes and he has deserved the appellation of Great by the successful zeal with which he labored to establish his opinions and his authority under the venerable names of orthodox faith and ecclesiastical discipline The Roman ambassadors were introduced to the tent of Attila as he lay encamped at the place where the slow winding Mincius is lost in the foaming waves of the Lake Benacus sixty two and trampled with his Scythian cavalry the farms of Catullus and Virgil sixty three The Barbarian monarch listened with favorable and even respectful attention and the deliverance of Italy was purchased by the immense ransom or dowry of the princess Honoria The state of his army might facilitate the treaty and hasten his retreat Their martial spirit was relaxed by the wealth and idolence of a warm climate The shepherds of the North whose ordinary food consisted of milk and raw flesh indulged themselves too freely in the use of bread of wine and of meat prepared and seasoned by the arts of cookery and the progress of disease revenged in some measure the injuries of the Italians sixty four When Attila declared his resolution of carrying his victorious arms to the gates of Rome he was admonished by his friends as well as by his enemies that Alaric had not long survived the conquest of the eternal city His mind superior to real danger was assaulted by imaginary terrors nor could he escape the influence of superstition which had so often been subservient to his designs sixty five The pressing eloquence of Leo his majestic aspect and sacerdotal robes excited the veneration of Attila for the spiritual father of the Christians The apparition of the two apostles saint Peter and saint Paul who menaced the Barbarian with instant death if he rejected the prayer of their successor is one of the noblest legends of ecclesiastical tradition The safety of Rome might deserve the interposition of celestial beings and some indulgence is due to a fable which has been represented by the pencil of Raphael and the chisel of Algardi sixty six Footnote fifty nine Sirmond Not ad Sidon Apollin p nineteen has published a curious passage from the Chronicle of Prosper Attila redintegratis viribus quas in Gallia amiserat Italiam ingredi per Pannonias intendit nihil duce nostro Aetio secundum prioris belli opera

and Isidore Footnote sixty See the original portraits of Avienus and his rival Basilius delineated and contrasted in the epistles i nine p twenty two of Sidonius He had studied the characters of the two chiefs of the senate but he attached himself to Basilius as the more solid and disinterested friend Footnote sixty one The character and principles of Leo may be traced in one hundred and forty

may serve as a commentary on the celestial plague with which Idatius and Isidore have afflicted the troops of Attila Footnote sixty five The historian Priscus had positively mentioned the effect which this example produced on the mind of Attila Jornandes c forty two p six hundred seventy three Footnote sixty six The picture of Raphael is in the Vatican the basso or perhaps the alto relievo of Algardi on one of the altars of saint Peter see Dubos Reflexions sur la Poesie et sur la Peinture tom i p five hundred nineteen five hundred twenty Baronius Annal Eccles A D four hundred fifty two No fifty seven fifty eight bravely sustains the truth of the apparition which is rejected however by the most learned and pious Catholics Before the king of the Huns evacuated Italy he threatened to return more dreadful and more implacable if his bride the princess Honoria were not delivered to his ambassadors within the term stipulated by the treaty Yet in the mean while Attila relieved his tender anxiety by adding a beautiful maid whose name was Ildico to the list of his innumerable wives sixty seven Their marriage was celebrated with barbaric pomp and festivity at his wooden palace beyond the Danube and the monarch oppressed with wine and sleep retired at a late hour from the banquet to the nuptial bed His attendants continued to respect his pleasures or his repose the greatest part of the ensuing day till the unusual silence alarmed their fears and suspicions and after attempting to awaken Attila by loud and repeated cries they at length broke into the royal apartment They found the trembling bride sitting by the bedside hiding her face with her veil and lamenting her own danger as well as the death of the king who had expired during the night sixty eight An artery had suddenly burst and as Attila lay in a supine posture he was suffocated by a torrent of blood which instead of finding a passage through the nostrils regurgitated into the lungs and stomach His body was solemnly exposed in the midst of the plain under a silken pavilion and the chosen squadrons of the Huns wheeling round in measured evolutions chanted a funeral song to the memory of a hero glorious in his life invincible in his death the father of his people the scourge of his enemies and the terror of the world According to their national custom the Barbarians cut off a part of their hair gashed their faces with unseemly wounds and bewailed their valiant leader as he deserved not with the tears of women but with the blood of warriors The remains of Attila were enclosed within three coffins of gold of silver and of iron and privately buried in the night the spoils of nations were thrown into his grave the captives who had opened the ground were inhumanly massacred and the same Huns who had indulged such excessive grief feasted with dissolute and intemperate mirth about the recent sepulchre of their king It was reported at Constantinople that on the fortunate night on which he expired Marcian beheld in a dream the bow of Attila broken asunder and the report may be allowed to prove how seldom the image of that formidable Barbarian was absent from the mind of a Roman emperor sixty nine Footnote sixty seven Attila ut Priscus historicus refert extinctionis suae tempore puellam Ildico nomine decoram valde sibi matrimonium post innumerabiles uxores socians Jornandes c

eight The report of her guilt reached Constantinople where it obtained a very different name and Marcellinus observes that the tyrant of Europe was slain in the night by the hand and the knife of a woman Corneille who has adapted the genuine account to his tragedy describes the irruption of blood in forty bombast lines and Attila exclaims with ridiculous fury S il ne veut s arreter his blood Dit il on me payera ce qui m en va couter Footnote sixty nine The curious circumstances of the death and funeral of Attila are related by Jornandes c forty nine p six hundred eighty three six hundred eighty four six hundred eighty five and were probably transcribed from Priscus The revolution which subverted the empire of the Huns established the fame of Attila whose genius alone had sustained the huge and disjointed fabric After his death the boldest chieftains aspired to the rank of kings the most powerful kings refused to acknowledge a superior and the numerous sons whom so many various mothers bore to the deceased monarch divided and disputed like a private inheritance the sovereign command of the nations of Germany and Scythia The bold Ardaric felt and represented the disgrace of this servile partition and his subjects the warlike Gepidae with the Ostrogoths under the conduct of three valiant brothers encouraged their allies to vindicate the rights of freedom and royalty In a bloody and decisive conflict on the banks of the River Netad in Pannonia the lance of the Gepidae the sword of the Goths the arrows of the Huns the Suevic infantry the light arms of the Heruli and the heavy weapons of the Alani encountered or supported each other and the victory of the Ardaric was accompanied with the slaughter of thirty thousand of his enemies Ellac the eldest son of Attila lost his life and crown in the memorable battle of Netad his early valor had raised him to the throne of the Acatzires a Scythian people whom he subdued and his father who loved the superior merit would have envied the death of Ellac seventy His brother Dengisich with an army of Huns still formidable in their flight and ruin maintained his ground above fifteen years on the banks of the Danube The palace of Attila with the old country of Dacia from the Carpathian hills to the Euxine became the seat of a new power which was erected by Ardaric king of the Gepidae The Pannonian conquests from Vienna to Sirmium were occupied by the Ostrogoths and the settlements of the tribes who had so bravely asserted their native freedom were irregularly distributed according to the measure of their respective strength Surrounded and oppressed by the multitude of his father s slaves the kingdom of Dengisich was confined to the circle of his wagons his desperate courage urged him to invade the Eastern empire he fell in battle and his head ignominiously exposed in the Hippodrome exhibited a grateful spectacle to the people of Constantinople Attila had fondly or superstitiously believed that Irnac the youngest of his sons was destined to perpetuate the glories of his race The character of that prince who attempted to moderate the rashness of his brother Dengisich was more suitable to the declining condition of the Huns and Irnac with his subject hordes retired into the heart of the Lesser Scythia They were soon overwhelmed by a torrent of new Barbarians who followed the same road which their own ancestors had formerly discovered The Geougen or Avares whose residence is assigned by the Greek writers to the shores of the ocean impelled the adjacent tribes till at length the Igours of the North issuing from the cold Siberian regions which produce the most valuable furs spread themselves over the desert as far as the Borysthenes and the Caspian gates and finally extinguished the empire of the Huns seventy one Footnote seventy See Jornandes de Rebus Geticis c fifty p six hundred eighty five six hundred eighty six six hundred eighty seven six hundred eighty

Guignes by his extraordinary knowledge of the Chinese language and writers See Hist des Huns tom ii p three hundred fifteen three hundred nineteen Such an event might contribute to the safety of the Eastern empire under the reign of a prince who conciliated the friendship without forfeiting the esteem of the Barbarians But the emperor of the West the feeble and dissolute Valentinian who had reached his thirty fifth year without attaining the age of reason or courage abused this apparent security to undermine the foundations of his own throne by the murder of the patrician Aetius From the instinct of a base and jealous mind he hated the man who was universally celebrated as the terror of the Barbarians and the support of the republic seven hundred eleven and his new favorite the eunuch Heraclius awakened the emperor from the supine lethargy which might be disguised during the life of Placidia seventy two by the excuse of filial piety The fame of Aetius his wealth and dignity the numerous and martial train of Barbarian followers his powerful dependants who filled the civil offices of the state and the hopes of his son Gaudentius who was already contracted to Eudoxia the emperor s daughter had raised him above the rank of a subject The ambitious designs of which he was secretly accused excited the fears as well as the resentment of Valentinian Aetius himself supported by the consciousness of his merit his services and perhaps his innocence seems to have maintained a haughty and indiscreet behavior The patrician offended his sovereign by a hostile declaration he aggravated the offence by compelling him to ratify with a solemn oath a treaty of reconciliation and alliance he proclaimed his suspicions he neglected his safety and from a vain confidence that the enemy whom he despised was incapable even of a manly crime he rashly ventured his person in the palace of Rome Whilst he urged perhaps with intemperate vehemence the marriage of his son Valentinian drawing his sword the first sword he had ever drawn plunged it in the breast of a general who had saved his empire his courtiers and eunuchs ambitiously struggled to imitate their master and Aetius pierced with a hundred wounds fell dead in the royal presence Boethius the Praetorian praefect was killed at the same moment and before the event could be divulged the principal friends of the patrician were summoned to the palace and separately murdered The horrid deed palliated by the specious names of justice and necessity was immediately communicated by the emperor to his soldiers his subjects and his allies The nations who were strangers or enemies to Aetius generously deplored the unworthy fate of a hero the Barbarians who had been attached to his service dissembled their grief and resentment and the public contempt which had been so long entertained for Valentinian was at once converted into deep and universal abhorrence Such sentiments seldom pervade the walls of a palace yet the emperor was confounded by the honest reply of a Roman whose approbation he had not disdained to solicit I am ignorant sir of your motives or provocations I only know that you have acted like a man who cuts off his right hand with his left seventy three Footnote seven hundred eleven The praises awarded by Gibbon to the character of Aetius have been animadverted upon with great severity See mister Herbert s Attila p three hundred twenty one I am not aware that Gibbon has dissembled or palliated any of the crimes or treasons of Aetius but his position at the time of his murder was certainly that of the preserver of the empire the conqueror of the most dangerous of the barbarians it is by no means clear that he was not innocent of any treasonable designs against Valentinian If the early acts of his life the introduction of the Huns into Italy and of the Vandals into Africa were among the proximate causes of the ruin of the empire his murder was the signal for its almost immediate downfall M Footnote seventy two Placidia died at Rome November twenty seven A D four hundred fifty She was buried at Ravenna where her sepulchre and even her corpse seated in a chair of cypress wood were preserved for ages The empress received many compliments from the orthodox clergy and saint Peter Chrysologus assured her that her zeal for the Trinity had been recompensed by an august trinity of children See Tillemont Uist Jer Emp tom vi p two hundred forty Footnote seventy three Aetium Placidus mactavit semivir amens is the expression of Sidonius Panegyr Avit three hundred fifty nine The poet knew the world and was not inclined to flatter a minister who had injured or disgraced Avitus and Majorian the successive heroes of his song The luxury of Rome seems to have attracted the long and frequent visits of Valentinian who was consequently more despised at Rome than in any other part of his dominions A republican spirit was insensibly revived in the senate as their authority and even their supplies became necessary for the support of his feeble government The stately demeano of an hereditary monarch offended their pride and the pleasures of Valentinian were injurious to the peace and honor of noble families The birth of the empress Eudoxia was equal to his own and her charms and tender affection deserved those testimonies of love which her inconstant husband dissipated in vague and unlawful amours Petronius Maximus a wealthy senator of the Anician family who had been twice consul was possessed of a chaste and beautiful wife her obstinate resistance served only to irritate the desires of Valentinian and he resolved to accomplish them either by stratagem or force Deep gaming was one of the vices of the court the emperor who by chance or contrivance had gained from Maximus a considerable sum uncourteously exacted his ring as a security for the debt and sent it by a trusty messenger to his wife with an order in her husband s name that she should immediately attend the empress Eudoxia The unsuspecting wife of Maximus was conveyed in her litter to the Imperial palace the emissaries of her impatient lover conducted her to a remote and silent bed chamber and Valentinian violated without remorse the laws of hospitality Her tears when she returned home her deep affliction and her bitter reproaches against a husband whom she considered as the accomplice of his own shame excited Maximus to a just revenge the desire of revenge was stimulated by ambition and he might reasonably aspire by the free suffrage of the Roman senate to the throne of a detested and despicable rival Valentinian who supposed that every human breast was devoid like his own of friendship and gratitude had imprudently admitted among his guards several domestics and followers of Aetius Two of these of Barbarian race were persuaded to execute a sacred and honorable duty by punishing with death the assassin of their patron and their intrepid courage did not long expect a favorable moment Whilst Valentinian amused himself in the field of Mars with the spectacle of some military sports they suddenly rushed upon him with drawn weapons despatched the guilty Heraclius and stabbed the emperor to the heart without the least opposition from his numerous train who seemed to rejoice in the tyrant s death Such was the fate of Valentinian the Third seventy four the last Roman emperor of the family of Theodosius He faithfully imitated the hereditary weakness of his cousin and his two uncles without inheriting the gentleness the purity the innocence which alleviate in their characters the want of spirit and ability Valentinian was less excusable since he had passions without virtues even his religion was questionable and though he never deviated into the paths of heresy he scandalized the pious Christians by his attachment to the profane arts of magic and divination Footnote seventy four With regard to the cause and circumstances of the deaths of Aetius and Valentinian our information is dark and imperfect Procopius de Bell Vandal l i c four p one hundred eighty six one hundred eighty seven one hundred eighty eight is a fabulous writer for the events which precede his own memory His narrative must therefore be supplied and corrected by five or six Chronicles none of which were composed in Rome or Italy and which can only express in broken sentences the popular rumors as they were conveyed to Gaul Spain Africa Constantinople or Alexandria As early as the time of Cicero and Varro it was the opinion of the Roman augurs that the twelve vultures which Romulus had seen represented the twelve centuries assigned for the fatal period of his city seventy five This prophecy disregarded perhaps in the season of health and prosperity inspired the people with gloomy apprehensions when the twelfth century clouded with disgrace and misfortune was almost elapsed seventy six and even posterity must acknowledge with some surprise that the arbitrary interpretation of an accidental or fabulous circumstance has been seriously verified in the downfall of the Western empire But its fall was announced by a clearer omen than the flight of vultures the Roman government appeared every day less formidable to its enemies more odious and oppressive to its subjects seventy seven The taxes were multiplied with the public distress economy was neglected in proportion as it became necessary and the injustice of the rich shifted the unequal burden from themselves to the people whom they defrauded of the indulgences that might sometimes have alleviated their misery The severe inquisition which confiscated their goods and tortured their persons compelled the subjects of Valentinian to prefer the more simple tyranny of the Barbarians to fly to the woods and mountains or to embrace the vile and abject condition of mercenary servants They abjured and abhorred the name of Roman citizens which had formerly excited the ambition of mankind The Armorican provinces of Gaul and the greatest part of Spain were thrown into a state of disorderly independence by the confederations of the Bagaudae and the Imperial ministers pursued with proscriptive laws and ineffectual arms the rebels whom they had made seventy eight If all the Barbarian conquerors had been annihilated in the same hour their total destruction would not have restored the empire of the West and if Rome still survived she survived the loss of freedom of virtue and of honor Footnote seventy five This interpretation of Vettius a celebrated augur was quoted by Varro in the xviiith book of his Antiquities Censorinus de Die Natali c seventeen p ninety ninety one edit Havercamp Footnote seventy six According to Varro the twelfth century would expire

His Naval Depredations Succession Of The Last Emperors Of The West Maximus Avitus Majorian Severus Anthemius Olybrius Glycerius Nepos Augustulus Total Extinction Of The Western Empire Reign Of Odoacer The First Barbarian King Of Italy The loss or desolation of the provinces from the Ocean to the Alps impaired the glory and greatness of Rome her internal prosperity was irretrievably destroyed by the separation of Africa The rapacious Vandals confiscated the patrimonial estates of the senators and intercepted the regular subsidies which relieved the poverty and encouraged the idleness of the plebeians The distress of the Romans was soon aggravated by an unexpected attack and the province so long cultivated for their use by industrious and obedient subjects was armed against them by an ambitious Barbarian The Vandals and Alani who followed the successful standard of Genseric had acquired a rich and fertile territory which stretched along the coast above ninety days journey from Tangier to Tripoli but their narrow limits were pressed and confined on either side by the sandy desert and the Mediterranean The discovery and conquest of the Black nations that might dwell beneath the torrid zone could not tempt the rational ambition of Genseric but he cast his eyes towards the sea he resolved to create a naval power and his bold resolution was executed with steady and active perseverance The woods of Mount Atlas afforded an inexhaustible nursery of timber his new subjects were skilled in the arts of navigation and ship building he animated his daring Vandals to embrace a mode of warfare which would render every maritime country accessible to their arms the Moors and Africans were allured by the hopes of plunder and after an interval of six centuries the fleets that issued from the port of Carthage again claimed the empire of the Mediterranean The success of the Vandals the conquest of Sicily the sack of Palermo and the frequent descents on the coast of Lucania awakened and alarmed the mother of Valentinian and the sister of Theodosius Alliances were formed and armaments expensive and ineffectual were prepared for the destruction of the common enemy who reserved his courage to encounter those dangers which his policy could not prevent or elude The designs of the Roman government were repeatedly baffled by his artful delays ambiguous promises and apparent concessions and the interposition of his formidable confederate the king of the Huns recalled the emperors from the conquest of Africa to the care of their domestic safety The revolutions of the palace which left the Western empire without a defender and without a lawful prince dispelled the apprehensions and stimulated the avarice of Genseric He immediately equipped a numerous fleet of Vandals and Moors and cast anchor at the mouth of the Tyber about three months after the death of Valentinian and the elevation of Maximus to the Imperial throne The private life of the senator Petronius Maximus one was often alleged as a rare example of human felicity His birth was noble and illustrious since he descended from the Anician family his dignity was supported by an adequate patrimony in land and money and these advantages of fortune were accompanied with liberal arts and decent manners which adorn or imitate the inestimable gifts of genius and virtue The luxury of his palace and table was hospitable and elegant Whenever Maximus appeared in public he was surrounded by a train of grateful and obsequious clients two and it is possible that among these clients he might deserve and possess some real friends His merit was rewarded by the favor of the prince and senate he thrice exercised the office of Praetorian praefect of Italy he was twice invested with the consulship and he obtained the rank of patrician These civil honors were not incompatible with the enjoyment of leisure and tranquillity his hours according to the demands of pleasure or reason were accurately distributed by a water clock and this avarice of time may be allowed to prove the sense which Maximus entertained of his own happiness The injury which he received from the emperor Valentinian appears to excuse the most bloody revenge Yet a philosopher might have reflected that if the resistance of his wife had been sincere her chastity was still inviolate and that it could never be restored if she had consented to the will of the adulterer A patriot would have hesitated before he plunged himself and his country into those inevitable calamities which must follow the extinction of the royal house of Theodosius The imprudent Maximus disregarded these salutary considerations he gratified his resentment and ambition he saw the bleeding corpse of Valentinian at his feet and he heard himself saluted Emperor by the unanimous voice of the senate and people But the day of his inauguration was the last day of his happiness He was imprisoned such is the lively expression of Sidonius in the palace and after passing a sleepless night he sighed that he had attained the summit of his wishes and aspired only to descend from the dangerous elevation Oppressed by the weight of the diadem he communicated his anxious thoughts to his friend and quaestor Fulgentius and when he looked back with unavailing regret on the secure pleasures of his former life the emperor exclaimed O fortunate Damocles three thy reign began and ended with the same dinner a well known allusion which Fulgentius afterwards repeated as an instructive lesson for princes and subjects Footnote one Sidonius Apollinaris composed the thirteenth epistle of the second book to refute the paradox of his friend Serranus who entertained a singular though generous enthusiasm for the deceased emperor This epistle with some indulgence may claim the praise of an elegant composition and it throws much light on the character of Maximus Footnote two Clientum praevia pedisequa circumfusa

reign of Maximus continued about three months His hours of which he had lost the command were disturbed by remorse or guilt or terror and his throne was shaken by the seditions of the soldiers the people and the confederate Barbarians The marriage of his son Paladius with the eldest daughter of the late emperor might tend to establish the hereditary succession of his family but the violence which he offered to the empress Eudoxia could proceed only from the blind impulse of lust or revenge His own wife the cause of these tragic events had been seasonably removed by death and the widow of Valentinian was compelled to violate her decent mourning perhaps her real grief and to submit to the embraces of a presumptuous usurper whom she suspected as the assassin of her deceased husband These suspicions were soon justified by the indiscreet confession of Maximus himself and he wantonly provoked the hatred of his reluctant bride who was still conscious that she was descended from a line of emperors From the East however Eudoxia could not hope to obtain any effectual assistance her father and her aunt Pulcheria were dead her mother languished at Jerusalem in disgrace and exile and the sceptre of Constantinople was in the hands of a stranger She directed her eyes towards Carthage secretly implored the aid of the king of the Vandals and persuaded Genseric to improve the fair opportunity of disguising his rapacious designs by the specious names of honor justice and compassion four Whatever abilities Maximus might have shown in a subordinate station he was found incapable of administering an empire and though he might easily have been informed of the naval preparations which were made on the opposite shores of Africa he expected with supine indifference the approach of the enemy without adopting any measures of defence of negotiation or of a timely retreat When the Vandals disembarked at the mouth of the Tyber the emperor was suddenly roused from his lethargy by the clamors of a trembling and exasperated multitude The only hope which presented itself to his astonished mind was that of a precipitate flight and he exhorted the senators to imitate the example of their prince But no sooner did Maximus appear in the streets than he was assaulted by a shower of stones a Roman or a Burgundian soldier claimed the honor of the first wound his mangled body was

reality of this invitation and observes with great truth Non si puo dir quanto sia facile il popolo a sognare e spacciar voci false But his argument from the interval of time and place is extremely

Avit four hundred forty two A remarkable line which insinuates that Rome and Maximus were betrayed by their Burgundian mercenaries On the third day after the tumult Genseric boldly advanced from the port of Ostia to the gates of the defenceless city Instead of a sally of the Roman youth there issued from the gates an unarmed and venerable procession of the bishop at the head of his clergy six The fearless spirit of Leo his authority and eloquence again mitigated the fierceness of a Barbarian conqueror the king of the Vandals promised to spare the unresisting multitude to protect the buildings from fire and to exempt the captives from torture and although such orders were neither seriously given nor strictly obeyed the mediation of Leo was glorious to himself and in some degree beneficial to his country But Rome and its inhabitants were delivered to the licentiousness of the Vandals and Moors whose blind passions revenged the injuries of Carthage The pillage lasted fourteen days and nights and all that yet remained of public or private wealth of sacred or profane treasure was diligently transported to the vessels of Genseric Among the spoils the splendid relics of two temples or rather of two religions exhibited a memorable example of the vicissitudes of human and divine things Since the abolition of Paganism the Capitol had been violated and abandoned yet the statues of the gods and heroes were still respected and the curious roof of gilt bronze was reserved for the rapacious hands of Genseric seven The holy instruments of the Jewish worship eight the gold table and the gold candlestick with seven branches originally framed according to the particular instructions of God himself and which were placed in the sanctuary of his temple had been ostentatiously displayed to the Roman people in the triumph of Titus They were afterwards deposited in the temple of Peace and at the end of four hundred years the spoils of Jerusalem were transferred from Rome to Carthage by a Barbarian who derived his origin from the shores of the Baltic These ancient monuments might attract the notice of curiosity as well as of avarice But the Christian churches enriched and adorned by the prevailing superstition of the times afforded more plentiful materials for sacrilege and the pious liberality of Pope Leo who melted six silver vases the gift of Constantine each of a hundred pounds weight is an evidence of the damage which he attempted to repair In the forty five years that had elapsed since the Gothic invasion the pomp and luxury of Rome were in some measure restored and it was difficult either to escape or to satisfy the avarice of a conqueror who possessed leisure to collect and ships to transport the wealth of the capital The Imperial ornaments of the palace the magnificent furniture and wardrobe the sideboards of massy plate were accumulated with disorderly rapine the gold and silver amounted to several thousand talents yet even the brass and copper were laboriously removed Eudoxia herself who advanced to meet her friend and deliverer soon bewailed the imprudence of her own conduct She was rudely stripped of her jewels and the unfortunate empress with her two daughters the only surviving remains of the great Theodosius was compelled as a captive to follow the haughty Vandal who immediately hoisted sail and returned with a prosperous navigation to the port of Carthage nine Many thousand Romans of both sexes chosen for some useful or agreeable qualifications reluctantly embarked on board the fleet of Genseric and their distress was aggravated by the unfeeling Barbarians who in the division of the booty separated the wives from their husbands and the children from their parents The charity of Deogratias bishop of Carthage ten was their only consolation and support He generously sold the gold and silver plate of the church to purchase the freedom of some to alleviate the slavery of others and to assist the wants and infirmities of a captive multitude whose health was impaired by the hardships which they had suffered in their passage from Italy to Africa By his order two spacious churches were converted into hospitals the sick were distributed into convenient beds and liberally supplied with food and medicines and the aged prelate repeated his visits both in the day and night with an assiduity that surpassed his strength and a tender sympathy which enhanced the value of his services Compare this scene with the field of Cannae and judge between Hannibal and the successor of saint Cyprian eleven Footnote six The apparant success of Pope Leo may be justified by Prosper and the Historia Miscellan but the improbable notion of Baronius A D four hundred fifty five No thirteen that Genseric spared the three

and Theophanes under the proper year The deaths of Aetius and Valentinian had relaxed the ties which held the Barbarians of Gaul in peace and subordination The sea coast was infested by the Saxons the Alemanni and the Franks advanced from the Rhine to the Seine and the ambition of the Goths seemed to meditate more extensive and permanent conquests The emperor Maximus relieved himself by a judicious choice from the weight of these distant cares he silenced the solicitations of his friends listened to the voice of fame and promoted a stranger to the general command of the forces of Gaul Avitus twelve the stranger whose merit was so nobly rewarded descended from a wealthy and honorable family in the diocese of Auvergne The convulsions of the times urged him to embrace with the same ardor the civil and military professions and the indefatigable youth blended the studies of literature and jurisprudence with the exercise of arms and hunting Thirty years of his life were laudably spent in the public service he alternately displayed his talents in war and negotiation and the soldier of Aetius after executing the most important embassies was raised to the station of Praetorian praefect of Gaul Either the merit of Avitus excited envy or his moderation was desirous of repose since he calmly retired to an estate which he possessed in the neighborhood of Clermont A copious stream issuing from the mountain and falling headlong in many a loud and foaming cascade discharged its waters into a lake about two miles in length and the villa was pleasantly seated on the margin of the lake The baths the porticos the summer and winter apartments were adapted to the purposes of luxury and use and the adjacent country afforded the various prospects of woods pastures and meodows thirteen In this retreat where Avitus amused his leisure with books rural sports the practice of husbandry and the society of his friends fourteen he received the Imperial diploma which constituted him master general of the cavalry and infantry of Gaul He assumed the military command the Barbarians suspended their fury and whatever means he might employ whatever concessions he might be forced to make the people enjoyed the benefits of actual tranquillity But the fate of Gaul depended on the Visigoths and the Roman general less attentive to his dignity than to the public interest did not disdain to visit Thoulouse in the character of an ambassador He was received with courteous hospitality by Theodoric the king of the Goths but while Avitus laid the foundations of a solid alliance with that powerful nation he was astonished by the intelligence that the emperor Maximus was slain and that Rome had been pillaged by the Vandals A vacant throne which he might ascend without guilt or danger tempted his ambition fifteen and the Visigoths were easily persuaded to support his claim by their irresistible suffrage They loved the person of Avitus they respected his virtues and they were not insensible of the advantage as well as honor of giving an emperor to the West The season was now approaching in which the annual assembly of the seven provinces was held at Arles their deliberations might perhaps be influenced by the presence of Theodoric and his martial brothers but their choice would naturally incline to the most illustrious of their countrymen Avitus after a decent resistance accepted the Imperial diadem from the representatives of Gaul and his election was ratified by the acclamations of the Barbarians and provincials The formal consent of Marcian emperor of the East was solicited and obtained but the senate Rome and Italy though humbled by their recent calamities submitted with a secret murmur to the presumption of the Gallic usurper Footnote twelve The private life and elevation of Avitus must be deduced with becoming suspicion from the panegyric pronounced by Sidonius Apollinaris his subject and his son in law Footnote thirteen After the example of the younger Pliny Sidonius l ii c two has labored the florid prolix and obscure description of his villa which bore the name Avitacum and had been the property of Avitus The precise situation is not ascertained Consult however the notes of Savaron and Sirmond Footnote fourteen Sidonius l ii epist nine has described the country life of the Gallic nobles in a visit which he made to his friends whose estates were in the neighborhood of Nismes The morning hours were spent in the sphoeristerium or tennis court or in the library which was furnished with Latin authors profane and religious the former for the men the latter for the ladies The table was twice served at dinner and supper with hot meat boiled and roast and wine During the intermediate time the company slept took the air on horseback and need the warm bath Footnote fifteen Seventy lines of panegyric five hundred five five hundred seventy five which describe the importunity of Theodoric and of Gaul struggling to overcome the modest reluctance of Avitus are blown away by three words of an honest historian Romanum ambisset Imperium Greg Turon l ii c onel in tom ii p one hundred sixty eight Theodoric to whom Avitus was indebted for the purple had acquired the Gothic sceptre by the murder of his elder brother Torismond and he justified this atrocious deed by the design which his predecessor had formed of violating his alliance with the empire sixteen Such a crime might not be incompatible with the virtues of a Barbarian but the manners of Theodoric were gentle and humane and posterity may contemplate without terror the original picture of a Gothic king whom Sidonius had intimately observed in the hours of peace and of social intercourse In an epistle dated from the court of Thoulouse the orator satisfies the curiosity of one of his friends in the following description seventeen By the majesty of his appearance Theodoric would command the respect of those who are ignorant of his merit and although he is born a prince his merit would dignify a private station He is of a middle stature his body appears rather plump than fat and in his well proportioned limbs agility is united with muscular strength eighteen If you examine his countenance you will distinguish a high forehead large shaggy eyebrows an aquiline nose thin lips a regular set of white teeth and a fair complexion that blushes more frequently from modesty than from anger The ordinary distribution of his time as far as it is exposed to the public view may be concisely represented Before daybreak he repairs with a small train to his domestic chapel where the service is performed by the Arian clergy but those who presume to interpret his secret sentiments consider this assiduous devotion as the effect of habit and policy The rest of the morning is employed in the administration of his kingdom His chair is surrounded by some military officers of decent aspect and behavior the noisy crowd of his Barbarian guards occupies the hall of audience but they are not permitted to stand within the veils or curtains that conceal the council chamber from vulgar eyes The ambassadors of the nations are successively introduced Theodoric listens with attention answers them with discreet brevity and either announces or delays according to the nature of their business his final resolution About eight the second hour he rises from his throne and visits either his treasury or his stables If he chooses to hunt or at least to exercise himself on horseback his bow is carried by a favorite youth but when the game is marked he bends it with his own hand and seldom misses the object of his aim as a king he disdains to bear arms in such ignoble warfare but as a soldier he would blush to accept any military service which he could perform himself On common days his dinner is not different from the repast of a private citizen but every Saturday many honorable guests are invited to the royal table which on these occasions is served with the elegance of Greece the plenty of Gaul and the order and diligence of Italy nineteen The gold or silver plate is less remarkable for its weight than for the brightness and curious workmanship the taste is gratified without the help of foreign and costly luxury the size and number of the cups of wine are regulated with a strict regard to the laws of temperance and the respectful silence that prevails is interrupted only by grave and instructive conversation After dinner Theodoric sometimes indulges himself in a short slumber and as soon as he wakes he calls for the dice and tables encourages his friends to forget the royal majesty and is delighted when they freely express the passions which are excited by the incidents of play At this game which he loves as the image of war he alternately displays his eagerness his skill his patience and his cheerful temper If he loses he laughs he is modest and silent if he wins Yet notwithstanding this seeming indifference his courtiers choose to solicit any favor in the moments of victory and I myself in my applications to the king have derived some benefit from my losses twenty About the ninth hour three o clock the tide of business again returns and flows incessantly till after sunset when the signal of the royal supper dismisses the weary crowd of suppliants and pleaders At the supper a more familiar repast buffoons and pantomimes are sometimes introduced to divert not to offend the company by their ridiculous wit but female singers and the soft effeminate modes of music are severely banished and such martial tunes as animate the soul to deeds of valor are alone grateful to the ear of Theodoric He retires from table and the nocturnal guards are immediately posted at the entrance of the treasury the palace and the private apartments Footnote sixteen Isidore archbishop of Seville who was himself of the blood royal of the Goths acknowledges and almost justifies Hist Goth p seven hundred eighteen the crime

Visigoths encouraged Avitus to assume the purple he offered his person and his forces as a faithful soldier of the republic twenty one The exploits of Theodoric soon convinced the world that he had not degenerated from the warlike virtues of his ancestors After the establishment of the Goths in Aquitain and the passage of the Vandals into Africa the Suevi who had fixed their kingdom in Gallicia aspired to the conquest of Spain and threatened to extinguish the feeble remains of the Roman dominion The provincials of Carthagena and Tarragona afflicted by a hostile invasion represented their injuries and their apprehensions Count Fronto was despatched in the name of the emperor Avitus with advantageous offers of peace and alliance and Theodoric interposed his weighty mediation to declare that unless his brother in law the king of the Suevi immediately retired he should be obliged to arm in the cause of justice and of Rome Tell him replied the haughty Rechiarius that I despise his friendship and his arms but that I shall soon try whether he will dare to expect my arrival under the walls of Thoulouse Such a challenge urged Theodoric to prevent the bold designs of his enemy he passed the Pyrenees at the head of the Visigoths the Franks and Burgundians served under his standard and though he professed himself the dutiful servant of Avitus he privately stipulated for himself and his successors the absolute possession of his Spanish conquests The two armies or rather the two nations encountered each other on the banks of the River Urbicus about twelve miles from Astorga and the decisive victory of the Goths appeared for a while to have extirpated the name and kingdom of the Suevi From the field of battle Theodoric advanced to Braga their metropolis which still retained the splendid vestiges of its ancient commerce and dignity twenty two His entrance was not polluted with blood and the Goths respected the chastity of their female captives more especially of the consecrated virgins but the greatest part of the clergy and people were made slaves and even the churches and altars were confounded in the universal pillage The unfortunate king of the Suevi had escaped to one of the ports of the ocean but the obstinacy of the winds opposed his flight he was delivered to his implacable rival and Rechiarius who neither desired nor expected mercy received with manly constancy the death which he would probably have inflicted After this bloody sacrifice to policy or resentment Theodoric carried his victorious arms as far as Merida the principal town of Lusitania without meeting any resistance except from the miraculous powers of saint Eulalia but he was stopped in the full career of success and recalled from Spain before he could provide for the security of his conquests In his retreat towards the Pyrenees he revenged his disappointment on the country through which he passed and in the sack of Pollentia and Astorga he showed himself a faithless ally as well as a cruel enemy Whilst the king of the Visigoths fought and vanquished in the name of Avitus the reign of Avitus had expired and both the honor and the interest of Theodoric were deeply wounded by the disgrace of a friend whom he had seated on the throne of the Western empire twenty three Footnote twenty one Theodoric himself had given a solemn and voluntary promise of fidelity which was understood both in Gaul and Spain Romae sum te duce Amicus Principe te Miles Sidon Panegyr Avit five hundred eleven Footnote twenty two Quaeque sinu pelagi jactat se Bracara dives

Idatius who as bishop of Iria Flavia was himself a spectator and a sufferer Jornandes c forty four p six hundred seventy five six hundred seventy six six hundred seventy seven has expatiated with pleasure on the Gothic victory Chapter XXXVI Total Extinction Of The Western Empire Part II The pressing solicitations of the senate and people persuaded the emperor Avitus to fix his residence at Rome and to accept the consulship for the ensuing year On the first day of January his son in law Sidonius Apollinaris celebrated his praises in a panegyric of six hundred verses but this composition though it was rewarded with a brass statue twenty four seems to contain a very moderate proportion either of genius or of truth The poet if we may degrade that sacred name exaggerates the merit of a sovereign and a father and his prophecy of a long and glorious reign was soon contradicted by the event Avitus at a time when the Imperial dignity was reduced to a preeminence of toil and danger indulged himself in the pleasures of Italian luxury age had not extinguished his amorous inclinations and he is accused of insulting with indiscreet and ungenerous raillery the husbands whose wives he had seduced or violated twenty five But the Romans were not inclined either to excuse his faults or to acknowledge his virtues The several parts of the empire became every day more alienated from each other and the stranger of Gaul was the object of popular hatred and contempt The senate asserted their legitimate claim in the election of an emperor and their authority which had been originally derived from the old constitution was again fortified by the actual weakness of a declining monarchy Yet even such a monarchy might have resisted the votes of an unarmed senate if their discontent had not been supported or perhaps inflamed by the Count Ricimer one of the principal commanders of the Barbarian troops who formed the military defence of Italy The daughter of Wallia king of the Visigoths was the mother of Ricimer but he was descended on the father s side from the nation of the Suevi twenty six his pride or patriotism might be exasperated by the misfortunes of his countrymen and he obeyed with reluctance an emperor in whose elevation he had not been consulted His faithful and important services against the common enemy rendered him still more formidable twenty seven and after destroying on the coast of Corsica a fleet of Vandals which consisted of sixty galleys Ricimer returned in triumph with the appellation of the Deliverer of Italy He chose that moment to signify to Avitus that his reign was at an end and the feeble emperor at a distance from his Gothic allies was compelled after a short and unavailing struggle to abdicate the purple By the clemency however or the contempt of Ricimer twenty eight he was permitted to descend from the throne to the more desirable station of bishop of Placentia but the resentment of the senate was still unsatisfied and their inflexible severity pronounced the sentence of his death He fled towards the Alps with the humble hope not of arming the Visigoths in his cause but of securing his person and treasures in the sanctuary of Julian one of the tutelar saints of Auvergne twenty nine Disease or the hand of the executioner arrested him on the road yet his remains were decently transported to Brivas or Brioude in his native province and he reposed at the feet of his holy patron thirty Avitus left only one daughter the wife of Sidonius Apollinaris who inherited the patrimony of his father in law lamenting at the same time the disappointment of his public and private expectations His resentment prompted him to join or at least to countenance the measures of a rebellious faction in Gaul and the poet had contracted some guilt which it was incumbent on him to expiate by a new tribute of flattery to the succeeding emperor thirty one Footnote twenty four In one of the porticos or galleries belonging to

Sidon Apoll Carm iv p three hundred eight See Dubos Hist Critique tom i p four hundred forty eight c The successor of Avitus presents the welcome discovery of a great and heroic character such as sometimes arise in a degenerate age to vindicate the honor of the human species The emperor Majorian has deserved the praises of his contemporaries and of posterity and these praises may be strongly expressed in the words of a judicious and disinterested historian That he was gentle to his subjects that he was terrible to his enemies and that he excelled in every virtue all his predecessors who had reigned over the Romans thirty two Such a testimony may justify at least the panegyric of S donius and we may acquiesce in the assurance that although the obsequious orator would have flattered with equal zeal the most worthless of princes the extraordinary merit of his object confined him on this occasion within the bounds of truth thirty three Majorian derived his name from his maternal grandfather who in the reign of the great Theodosius had commanded the troops of the Illyrian frontier He gave his daughter in marriage to the father of Majorian a respectable officer who administered the revenues of Gaul with skill and integrity and generously preferred the friendship of Aetius to the tempting offer of an insidious court His son the future emperor who was educated in the profession of arms displayed from his early youth intrepid courage premature wisdom and unbounded liberality in a scanty fortune He followed the standard of Aetius contributed to his success shared and sometimes eclipsed his glory and at last excited the jealousy of the patrician or rather of his wife who forced him to retire from the service thirty four Majorian after the death of Aetius was recalled and promoted and his intimate connection with Count Ricimer was the immediate step by which he ascended the throne of the Western empire During the vacancy that succeeded the abdication of Avitus the ambitious Barbarian whose birth excluded him from the Imperial dignity governed Italy with the title of Patrician resigned to his friend the conspicuous station of master general of the cavalry and infantry and after an interval of some months consented to the unanimous wish of the Romans whose favor Majorian had solicited by a recent victory over the Alemanni thirty five He was invested with the purple at Ravenna and the epistle which he addressed to the senate will best describe his situation and his sentiments Your election Conscript Fathers and the ordinance of the most valiant army have made me your emperor thirty six May the propitious Deity direct and prosper the counsels and events of my administration to your advantage and to the public welfare For my own part I

imposed by the republic Assist therefore the prince whom you have made partake the duties which you have enjoined and may our common endeavors promote the happiness of an empire which I have accepted from your hands Be assured that in our times justice shall resume her ancient vigor and that virtue shall become not only innocent but meritorious Let none except the authors themselves be apprehensive of delations thirty seven which as a subject I have always condemned and as a prince will severely punish Our own vigilance and that of our father the patrician Ricimer shall regulate all military affairs and provide for the safety of the Roman world which we have saved from foreign and domestic enemies thirty eight You now understand the maxims of my government you may confide in the faithful love and sincere assurances of a prince who has formerly been the companion of your life and dangers who still glories in the name of senator and who is anxious that you should never repent the judgment which you have pronounced in his favor The emperor who amidst the ruins of the Roman world revived the ancient language of law and liberty which Trajan would not have disclaimed must have derived those generous sentiments from his own heart since they were not suggested to his imitation by the customs of his age or the example of his predecessors thirty nine Footnote thirty two The

hundred sixty nine Footnote thirty nine See the whole edict or epistle of Majorian to the senate Novell tit iv p thirty four Yet the expression regnum nostrum bears some taint of the age and does not mix kindly with the word respublica which he frequently repeats The private and public actions of Majorian are very imperfectly known but his laws remarkable for an original cast of thought and expression faithfully represent the character of a sovereign who loved his people who sympathized in their distress who had studied the causes of the decline of the empire and who was capable of applying as far as such reformation was practicable judicious and effectual remedies to the public disorders forty His regulations concerning the finances manifestly tended to remove or at least to mitigate the most intolerable grievances I From the first hour of his reign he was solicitous I translate his own words to relieve the weary fortunes of the provincials oppressed by the accumulated weight of indictions and superindictions forty one With this view he granted a universal amnesty a final and absolute discharge of all arrears of tribute of all debts which under any pretence the fiscal officers might demand from the people This wise dereliction of obsolete vexatious and unprofitable claims improved and purified the sources of the public revenue and the subject who could now look back without despair might labor with hope and gratitude for himself and for his country II In the assessment and collection of taxes Majorian restored the ordinary jurisdiction of the provincial magistrates and suppressed the extraordinary commissions which had been introduced in the name of the emperor himself or of the Praetorian praefects The favorite servants who obtained such irregular powers were insolent in their behavior and arbitrary in their demands they affected to despise the subordinate tribunals and they were discontented if their fees and profits did not twice exceed the sum which they condescended to pay into the treasury One instance of their extortion would appear incredible were it not authenticated by the legislator himself They exacted the whole payment in gold but they refused the current coin of the empire and would accept only such ancient pieces as were stamped with the names of Faustina or the Antonines The subject who was unprovided with these curious medals had recourse to the expedient of compounding with their rapacious demands or if he succeeded in the research his imposition was doubled according to the weight and value of the money of former times forty two III The municipal corporations says the emperor the lesser senates so antiquity has justly styled them deserve to be considered as the heart of the cities and the sinews of the republic And yet so low are they now reduced by the injustice of magistrates and the venality of collectors that many of their members renouncing their dignity and their country have taken refuge in distant and obscure exile He urges and even compels their return to their respective cities but he removes the grievance which had forced them to desert the exercise of their municipal functions They are directed under the authority of the provincial magistrates to resume their office of levying the tribute but instead of being made responsible for the whole sum assessed on their district they are only required to produce a regular account of the payments which they have actually received and of the defaulters who are still indebted to the public IV But Majorian was not ignorant that these corporate bodies were too much inclined to retaliate the injustice and oppression which they had suffered and he therefore revives the useful office of the defenders of cities He exhorts the people to elect in a full and free assembly some man of discretion and integrity who would dare to assert their privileges to represent their grievances to protect the poor from the tyranny of the rich and to inform the emperor of the abuses that were committed under the sanction of his name and authority Footnote forty See the laws of Majorian they are only nine in number but very long and various at the end of the Theodosian Code Novell l iv p thirty two thirty seven Godefroy has not given any commentary on these additional pieces Footnote forty one Fessas provincialium varia atque multiplici

ancient Rome is tempted to accuse the memory of the Goths and Vandals for the mischief which they had neither leisure nor power nor perhaps inclination to perpetrate The tempest of war might strike some lofty turrets to the ground but the destruction which undermined the foundations of those massy fabrics was prosecuted slowly and silently during a period of ten centuries and the motives of interest that afterwards operated without shame or control were severely checked by the taste and spirit of the emperor Majorian The decay of the city had gradually impaired the value of the public works The circus and theatres might still excite but they seldom gratified the desires of the people the temples which had escaped the zeal of the Christians were no longer inhabited either by gods or men the diminished crowds of the Romans were lost in the immense space of their baths and porticos and the stately libraries and halls of justice became useless to an indolent generation whose repose was seldom disturbed either by study or business The monuments of consular or Imperial greatness were no longer revered as the immortal glory of the capital they were only esteemed as an inexhaustible mine of materials cheaper and more convenient than the distant quarry Specious petitions were continually addressed to the easy magistrates of Rome which stated the want of stones or bricks for some necessary service the fairest forms of architecture were rudely defaced for the sake of some paltry or pretended repairs and the degenerate Romans who converted the spoil to their own emolument demolished with sacrilegious hands the labors of their ancestors Majorian who had often sighed over the desolation of the city applied a severe remedy to the growing evil forty three He reserved to the prince and senate the sole cognizance of the extreme cases which might justify the destruction of an ancient edifice imposed a fine of fifty pounds of gold two thousand pounds sterling on every magistrate who should presume to grant such illegal and scandalous license and threatened to chastise the criminal obedience of their subordinate officers by a severe whipping and the amputation of both their hands In the last instance the legislator might seem to forget the proportion of guilt and punishment but his zeal arose from a generous principle and Majorian was anxious to protect the monuments of those ages in which he would have desired and deserved to live The emperor conceived that it was his interest to increase the number of his subjects and that it was his duty to guard the purity of the marriage bed but the means which he employed to accomplish these salutary purposes are of an ambiguous and perhaps exceptionable kind The pious maids who consecrated their virginity to Christ were restrained from taking the veil till they had reached their fortieth year Widows under that age were compelled to form a second alliance within the term of five years by the forfeiture of half their wealth to their nearest relations or to the state Unequal marriages were condemned or annulled The punishment of confiscation and exile was deemed so inadequate to the guilt of adultery that if the criminal returned to Italy he might by the express declaration of Majorian be slain with impunity forty four Footnote forty three The whole edict Novell Majorian tit vi p thirty five is

The law of Majorian which punished obstinate widows was soon afterwards repealed by his successor Severus Novell Sever tit i p thirty seven While the emperor Majorian assiduously labored to restore the happiness and virtue of the Romans he encountered the arms of Genseric from his character and situation their most formidable enemy A fleet of Vandals and Moors landed at the mouth of the Liris or Garigliano but the Imperial troops surprised and attacked the disorderly Barbarians who were encumbered with the spoils of Campania they were chased with slaughter to their ships and their leader the king s brother in law was found in the number of the slain forty five Such vigilance might announce the character of the new reign but the strictest vigilance and the most numerous forces were insufficient to protect the long extended coast of Italy from the depredations of a naval war The public opinion had imposed a nobler and more arduous task on the genius of Majorian Rome expected from him alone the restitution of Africa and the design which he formed of attacking the Vandals in their new settlements was the result of bold and judicious policy If the intrepid emperor could have infused his own spirit into the youth of Italy if he could have revived in the field of Mars the manly exercises in which he had always surpassed his equals he might have marched against Genseric at the head of a Roman army Such a reformation of national manners might be embraced by the rising generation but it is the misfortune of those princes who laboriously sustain a declining monarchy that to obtain some immediate advantage or to avert some impending danger they are forced to countenance and even to multiply the most pernicious abuses Majorian like the weakest of his predecessors was reduced to the disgraceful expedient of substituting Barbarian auxiliaries in the place of his unwarlike subjects and his superior abilities could only be displayed in the vigor and dexterity with which he wielded a dangerous instrument so apt to recoil on the hand that used it Besides the confederates who were already engaged in the service of the empire the fame of his liberality and valor attracted the nations of the Danube the Borysthenes and perhaps of the Tanais Many thousands of the bravest subjects of Attila the Gepidae the Ostrogoths the Rugians the Burgundians the Suevi the Alani assembled in the plains of Liguria and their formidable strength was balanced by their mutual animosities forty six They passed the Alps in a severe winter The emperor led the way on foot and in complete armor sounding with his long staff the depth of the ice or snow and encouraging the Scythians who complained of the extreme cold by the cheerful assurance that they should be satisfied with the heat of Africa The citizens of Lyons had presumed to shut their gates they soon implored and experienced the clemency of Majorian He vanquished Theodoric in the field and admitted to his friendship and alliance a king whom he had found not unworthy of his arms The beneficial though precarious reunion of the greater part of Gaul and Spain was the effect of persuasion as well as of force forty seven and the independent Bagaudae who had escaped or resisted the oppression of former reigns were disposed to confide in the virtues of Majorian His camp was filled with Barbarian allies his throne was supported by the zeal of an affectionate people but the emperor had foreseen that it was impossible without a maritime power to achieve the conquest of Africa In the first Punic war the republic had exerted such incredible diligence that within sixty days after the first stroke of the axe had been given in the forest a fleet of one hundred and sixty galleys proudly rode at anchor in the sea forty eight Under circumstances much less favorable Majorian equalled the spirit and perseverance of the ancient Romans The woods of the Apennine were felled the arsenals and manufactures of Ravenna and Misenum were restored Italy and Gaul vied with each other in liberal contributions to the public service and the Imperial navy of three hundred large galleys with an adequate proportion of transports and smaller vessels was collected in the secure and capacious harbor of Carthagena in Spain forty nine The intrepid countenance of Majorian animated his troops with a confidence of victory and if we might credit the historian Procopius his courage sometimes hurried him beyond the bounds of prudence Anxious to explore with his own eyes the state of the Vandals he ventured after disguising the color of his hair to visit Carthage in the character of his own ambassador and Genseric was afterwards mortified by the discovery that he had entertained and dismissed the emperor of the Romans Such an anecdote may be rejected as an improbable fiction but it is a fiction which would not have been imagined unless in the life of a hero fifty Footnote forty five Sidon Panegyr

guest into the arsenal of Carthage the arms clashed of their own accord Majorian had tinged his yellow locks with a black color Chapter XXXVI Total Extinction Of The Western Empire Part III Without the help of a personal interview Genseric was sufficiently acquainted with the genius and designs of his adversary He practiced his customary arts of fraud and delay but he practiced them without success His applications for peace became each hour more submissive and perhaps more sincere but the inflexible Majorian had adopted the ancient maxim that Rome could not be safe as long as Carthage existed in a hostile state The king of the Vandals distrusted the valor of his native subjects who were enervated by the luxury of the South fifty one he suspected the fidelity of the vanquished people who abhorred him as an Arian tyrant and the desperate measure which he executed of reducing Mauritania into a desert fifty two could not defeat the operations of the Roman emperor who was at liberty to land his troops on any part of the African coast But Genseric was saved from impending and inevitable ruin by the treachery of some powerful subjects envious or apprehensive of their master s success Guided by their secret intelligence he surprised the unguarded fleet in the Bay of Carthagena many of the ships were sunk or taken or burnt and the preparations of three years were destroyed in a single day fifty three After this event the behavior of the two antagonists showed them superior to their fortune The Vandal instead of being elated by this accidental victory immediately renewed his solicitations for peace The emperor of the West who was capable of forming great designs and of supporting heavy disappointments consented to a treaty or rather to a suspension of arms in the full assurance that before he could restore his navy he should be supplied with provocations to justify a second war Majorian returned to Italy to prosecute his labors for the public happiness and as he was conscious of his own integrity he might long remain ignorant of the dark conspiracy which threatened his throne and his life The recent misfortune of Carthagena sullied the glory which had dazzled the eyes of the multitude almost every description of civil and military officers were exasperated against the Reformer since they all derived some advantage from the abuses which he endeavored to suppress and the patrician Ricimer impelled the inconstant passions of the Barbarians against a prince whom he esteemed and hated The virtues of Majorian could not protect him from the impetuous sedition which broke out in the camp near Tortona at the foot of the Alps He was compelled to abdicate the Imperial purple five days after his abdication it was reported that he died of a dysentery fifty four and the humble tomb which covered his remains was consecrated by the respect and gratitude of succeeding generations fifty five The private character of Majorian inspired love and respect Malicious calumny and satire excited his indignation or if he himself were the object his contempt but he protected the freedom of wit and in the hours which the emperor gave to the familiar society of his friends he could indulge his taste for pleasantry without degrading the majesty of his rank fifty six Footnote fifty one Spoliisque potitus Immensis robux luxu jam perdidit omne Quo valuit dum

by Majorian a short time before his death He had no intention of praising a deceased emperor but a casual disinterested remark Subrisit Augustus ut erat auctoritate servata cum se communioni dedisset joci plenus outweighs the six hundred lines of his venal panegyric It was not perhaps without some regret that Ricimer sacrificed his friend to the interest of his ambition but he resolved in a second choice to avoid the imprudent preference of superior virtue and merit At his command the obsequious senate of Rome bestowed the Imperial title on Libius Severus who ascended the throne of the West without emerging from the obscurity of a private condition History has scarcely deigned to notice his birth his elevation his character or his death Severus expired as soon as his life became inconvenient to his patron fifty seven and it would be useless to discriminate his nominal reign in the vacant interval of six years between the death of Majorian and the elevation of Anthemius During that period the government was in the hands of Ricimer alone and although the modest Barbarian disclaimed the name of king he accumulated treasures formed a separate army negotiated private alliances and ruled Italy with the same independent and despotic authority which was afterwards exercised by Odoacer and Theodoric But his dominions were bounded by the Alps and two Roman generals Marcellinus and Aegidius maintained their allegiance to the republic by rejecting with disdain the phantom which he styled an emperor Marcellinus still adhered to the old religion and the devout Pagans who secretly disobeyed the laws of the church and state applauded his profound skill in the science of divination But he possessed the more valuable qualifications of learning virtue and courage fifty eight the study of the Latin literature had improved his taste and his military talents had recommended him to the esteem and confidence of the great Aetius in whose ruin he was involved By a timely flight Marcellinus escaped the rage of Valentinian and boldly asserted his liberty amidst the convulsions of the Western empire His voluntary or reluctant submission to the authority of Majorian was rewarded by the government of Sicily and the command of an army stationed in that island to oppose or to attack the Vandals but his Barbarian mercenaries after the emperor s death were tempted to revolt by the artful liberality of Ricimer At the head of a band of faithful followers the intrepid Marcellinus occupied the province of Dalmatia assumed the title of patrician of the West secured the love of his subjects by a mild and equitable reign built a fleet which claimed the dominion of the Adriatic and alternately alarmed the coasts of Italy and of Africa fifty nine Aegidius the master general of Gaul who equalled or at least who imitated the heroes of ancient Rome sixty proclaimed his immortal resentment against the assassins of his beloved master A brave and numerous army was attached to his standard and though he was prevented by the arts of Ricimer and the arms of the Visigoths from marching to the gates of Rome he maintained his independent sovereignty beyond the Alps and rendered the name of Aegidius respectable both in peace and war The Franks who had punished with exile the youthful follies of Childeric elected the Roman general for their king his vanity rather than his ambition was gratified by that singular honor and when the nation at the end of four years repented of the injury which they had offered to the Merovingian family he patiently acquiesced in the restoration of the lawful prince The authority of Aegidius ended only with his life and the suspicions of poison and secret violence which derived some countenance from the character of Ricimer were eagerly entertained by the passionate credulity of the Gauls sixty one Footnote fifty seven Sidonius Panegyr Anthem three hundred seventeen dismisses him to heaven Auxerat Augustus naturae lege

Aegidius beyond the date assigned by the Chronicle of Idatius or to correct the text of Gregory by reading quarto anno instead of octavo The kingdom of Italy a name to which the Western empire was gradually reduced was afflicted under the reign of Ricimer by the incessant depredations of the Vandal pirates sixty two In the spring of each year they equipped a formidable navy in the port of Carthage and Genseric himself though in a very advanced age still commanded in person the most important expeditions His designs were concealed with impenetrable secrecy till the moment that he hoisted sail When he was asked by his pilot what course he should steer Leave the determination to the winds replied the Barbarian with pious arrogance they will transport us to the guilty coast whose inhabitants have provoked the divine justice but if Genseric himself deigned to issue more precise orders he judged the most wealthy to be the most criminal The Vandals repeatedly visited the coasts of Spain Liguria Tuscany Campania Lucania Bruttium Apulia Calabria Venetia Dalmatia Epirus Greece and Sicily they were tempted to subdue the Island of Sardinia so advantageously placed in the centre of the Mediterranean and their arms spread desolation or terror from the columns of Hercules to the mouth of the Nile As they were more ambitious of spoil than of glory they seldom attacked any fortified cities or engaged any regular troops in the open field But the celerity of their motions enabled them almost at the same time to threaten and to attack the most distant objects which attracted their desires and as they always embarked a sufficient number of horses they had no sooner landed than they swept the dismayed country with a body of light cavalry Yet notwithstanding the example of their king the native Vandals and Alani insensibly declined this toilsome and perilous warfare the hardy generation of the first conquerors was almost extinguished and their sons who were born in Africa enjoyed the delicious baths and gardens which had been acquired by the valor of their fathers Their place was readily supplied by a various multitude of Moors and Romans of captives and outlaws and those desperate wretches who had already violated the laws of their country were the most eager to promote the atrocious acts which disgrace the victories of Genseric In the treatment of his unhappy prisoners he sometimes consulted his avarice and sometimes indulged his cruelty and the massacre of five hundred noble citizens of Zant or Zacynthus whose mangled bodies he cast into the Ionian Sea was imputed by the public indignation to his latest posterity Footnote sixty two The naval war of Genseric is described by Priscus Excerpta Legation p forty two Procopius de Bell Vandal l i

Majorian Carm v three hundred twenty seven three hundred fifty three hundred eighty five four hundred forty Anthem Carm ii three hundred forty eight three hundred eighty six In one passage the poet seems inspired by his subject and expresses a strong idea by a lively image Hinc Vandalus hostis Urget et in nostrum numerosa classe quotannis Militat excidium conversoque ordine Fati Torrida Caucaseos infert mihi Byrsa furoree Such crimes could not be excused by any provocations but the war which the king of the Vandals prosecuted against the Roman empire was justified by a specious and reasonable motive The widow of Valentinian Eudoxia whom he had led captive from Rome to Carthage was the sole heiress of the Theodosian house her elder daughter Eudocia became the reluctant wife of Hunneric his eldest son and the stern father asserting a legal claim which could not easily be refuted or satisfied demanded a just proportion of the Imperial patrimony An adequate or at least a valuable compensation was offered by the Eastern emperor to purchase a necessary peace Eudoxia and her younger daughter Placidia were honorably restored and the fury of the Vandals was confined to the limits of the Western empire The Italians destitute of a naval force which alone was capable of protecting their coasts implored the aid of the more fortunate nations of the East who had formerly acknowledged in peace and war the supremacy of Rome But the perpetual divisions of the two empires had alienated their interest and their inclinations the faith of a recent treaty was alleged and the Western Romans instead of arms and ships could only obtain the assistance of a cold and ineffectual mediation The haughty Ricimer who had long struggled with the difficulties of his situation was at length reduced to address the throne of Constantinople in the humble language of a subject and Italy submitted as the price and security to accept a master from the choice of the emperor of the East sixty three It is not the purpose of the present chapter or even of the present volume to continue the distinct series of the Byzantine history but a concise view of the reign and character of the emperor Leo may explain the last efforts that were attempted to save the falling empire of the West sixty four Footnote sixty three The poet himself is compelled to acknowledge the distress of Ricimer Praeterea invictus Ricimer quem publica fata Respiciunt proprio solas vix Marte repellit Piratam per rura vagum Italy addresses her complaint to the Tyber and Rome at the solicitation of the river god transports herself to Constantinople renounces her ancient claims and implores the friendship of Aurora the goddess of the East This fabulous machinery which the genius of Claudian had used and abused is the constant and miserable resource of the muse of Sidonius Footnote sixty four The original authors of the reigns of Marcian Leo and Zeno are reduced to some imperfect fragments whose deficiencies must be supplied from the more recent compilations of Theophanes Zonaras and Cedrenus Since the death of the younger Theodosius the domestic repose of Constantinople had never been interrupted by war or faction Pulcheria had bestowed her hand and the sceptre of the East on the modest virtue of Marcian he gratefully reverenced her august rank and virgin chastity and after her death he gave his people the example of the religious worship that was due to the memory of the Imperial saint sixty five Attentive to the prosperity of his own dominions Marcian seemed to behold with indifference the misfortunes of Rome and the obstinate refusal of a brave and active prince to draw his sword against the Vandals was ascribed to a secret promise which had formerly been exacted from him when he was a captive in the power of Genseric sixty six The death of Marcian after a reign of seven years would have exposed the East to the danger of a popular election if the superior weight of a single family had not been able to incline the balance in favor of the candidate whose interest they supported The patrician Aspar might have placed the diadem on his own head if he would have subscribed the Nicene creed sixty seven During three generations the armies of the East were successively commanded by his father by himself and by his son Ardaburius his Barbarian guards formed a military force that overawed the palace and the capital and the liberal distribution of his immense treasures rendered Aspar as popular as he was powerful He recommended the obscure name of Leo of Thrace a military tribune and the principal steward of his household His nomination was unanimously ratified by the senate and the servant of Aspar received the Imperial crown from the hands of the patriarch or bishop who was permitted to express by this unusual ceremony the suffrage of the Deity sixty eight This emperor the first of the name of Leo has been distinguished by the title of the Great from a succession of princes who gradually fixed in the opinion of the Greeks a very humble standard of heroic or at least of royal perfection Yet the temperate firmness with which Leo resisted the oppression of his benefactor showed that he was conscious of his duty and of his prerogative Aspar was astonished to find that his influence could no longer appoint a praefect of Constantinople he presumed to reproach his sovereign with a breach of promise and insolently shaking his purple It is not proper said he that the man who is invested with this garment should be guilty of lying Nor is it proper replied Leo that a prince should be compelled to resign his own judgment and the public interest to the will of a subject sixty nine After this extraordinary scene it was impossible that the reconciliation of the emperor and the patrician could be sincere or at least that it could be solid and permanent An army of Isaurians seventy was secretly levied and introduced into Constantinople and while Leo undermined the authority and prepared the disgrace of the family of Aspar his mild and cautious behavior restrained them from any rash and desperate attempts which might have been fatal to themselves or their enemies The measures of peace and war were affected by this internal revolution As long as Aspar degraded the majesty of the throne the secret correspondence of religion and interest engaged him to favor the cause of Genseric When Leo had delivered himself from that ignominious servitude he listened to the complaints of the Italians resolved to extirpate the tyranny of the Vandals and declared his alliance with his colleague Anthemius whom he solemnly invested with the diadem and purple of the West Footnote sixty five saint Pulcheria died A D four hundred fifty three four years before her nominal husband and her festival is celebrated on the tenth of September by the modern Greeks she bequeathed an immense patrimony to pious or at least to ecclesiastical uses See Tillemont Memoires Eccles tom xv p one hundred eighty one one hundred eighty four Footnote sixty six See Procopius de Bell Vandal l i c four p one hundred eighty five Footnote sixty seven From this disability of Aspar to ascend the throne it may be inferred that the stain of Heresy was perpetual and indelible while that of Barbarism disappeared in the second generation Footnote sixty eight Theophanes p ninety five This appears to be the first origin of a ceremony which all the Christian princes of the world have since adopted and from which the clergy have deduced the most formidable consequences Footnote sixty nine Cedrenus p three hundred forty five three hundred forty six who was conversant with the writers of better days has preserved the remarkable words of Aspar Footnote seventy The power of the Isaurians agitated the Eastern empire in the two succeeding reigns of Zeno and Anastasius but it ended in the destruction of those Barbarians who maintained their fierce independences about two hundred and thirty years The virtues of Anthemius have perhaps been magnified since the Imperial descent which he could only deduce from the usurper Procopius has been swelled into a line of emperors seventy one But the merit of his immediate parents their honors and their riches rendered Anthemius one of the most illustrious subjects of the East His father Procopius obtained after his Persian embassy the rank of general and patrician and the name of Anthemius was derived from his maternal grandfather the celebrated praefect who protected with so much ability and success the infant reign of Theodosius The grandson of the praefect was raised above the condition of a private subject by his marriage with Euphemia the daughter of the emperor Marcian This splendid alliance which might supersede the necessity of merit hastened the promotion of Anthemius to the successive dignities of count of master general of consul and of patrician and his merit or fortune claimed the honors of a victory which was obtained on the banks of the Danube over the Huns Without indulging an extravagant ambition the son in law of Marcian might hope to be his successor but Anthemius supported the disappointment with courage and patience and his subsequent elevation was universally approved by the public who esteemed him worthy to reign till he ascended the throne seventy two The emperor of the West marched from Constantinople attended by several counts of high distinction and a body of guards almost equal to the strength and numbers of a regular army he entered Rome in triumph and the choice of Leo was confirmed by the senate the people and the Barbarian confederates of Italy seventy three The solemn inauguration of Anthemius was followed by the nuptials of his daughter and the patrician Ricimer a fortunate event which was considered as the firmest security of the union and happiness of the state The wealth of two empires was ostentatiously displayed and many senators completed their ruin by an expensive effort to disguise their poverty All serious business was suspended during this festival the courts of justice were shut the streets of Rome the theatres the places of public and private resort resounded with hymeneal songs and dances and the royal bride clothed in silken robes with a crown on her head was conducted to the palace of Ricimer who had changed his military dress for the habit of a consul and a senator On this memorable occasion Sidonius whose early ambition had been so fatally blasted appeared as the orator of Auvergne among the provincial deputies who addressed the throne with congratulations or complaints seventy four The calends of January were now approaching and the venal poet who had loved Avitus and esteemed Majorian was persuaded by his friends to celebrate in heroic verse the merit the felicity the second consulship and the future triumphs of the emperor Anthemius Sidonius pronounced with assurance and success a panegyric which is still extant and whatever might be the imperfections either of the subject or of the composition the welcome flatterer was immediately rewarded with the praefecture of Rome a dignity which placed him among the illustrious personages of the empire till he wisely preferred the more respectable character of a bishop and a saint seventy five Footnote seventy one Tali tu civis

to observe that when he left Constantinople he converted his palace into the pious foundation of a public bath a church and a hospital for old men seventy six Yet some suspicious appearances are found to sully the theological fame of Anthemius From the conversation of Philotheus a Macedonian sectary he had imbibed the spirit of religious toleration and the Heretics of Rome would have assembled with impunity if the bold and vehement censure which Pope Hilary pronounced in the church of saint Peter had not obliged him to abjure the unpopular indulgence seventy seven Even the Pagans a feeble and obscure remnant conceived some vain hopes from the indifference or partiality of Anthemius and his singular friendship for the philosopher Severus whom he promoted to the consulship was ascribed to a secret project of reviving the ancient worship of the gods seventy eight These idols were crumbled into dust and the mythology which had once been the creed of nations was so universally disbelieved that it might be employed without scandal or at least without suspicion by Christian poets seventy nine Yet the vestiges of superstition were not absolutely obliterated and the festival of the Lupercalia whose origin had preceded the foundation of Rome was still celebrated under the reign of Anthemius The savage and simple rites were expressive of an early state of society before the invention of arts and agriculture The rustic deities who presided over the toils and pleasures of the pastoral life Pan Faunus and their train of satyrs were such as the fancy of shepherds might create sportive petulant and lascivious whose power was limited and whose malice was inoffensive A goat was the offering the best adapted to their character and attributes the flesh of the victim was roasted on willow spits and the riotous youths who crowded to the feast ran naked about the fields with leather thongs in their hands communicating as it was supposed the blessing of fecundity to the women whom they touched eighty The altar of Pan was erected perhaps by Evander the Arcadian in a dark recess in the side of the Palantine hill watered by a perpetual fountain and shaded by a hanging grove A tradition that in the same place Romulus and Remus were suckled by the wolf rendered it still more sacred and venerable in the eyes of the Romans and this sylvan spot was gradually surrounded by the stately edifices of the Forum eighty one After the conversion of the Imperial city the Christians still continued in the month of February the annual celebration of the Lupercalia to which they ascribed a secret and mysterious influence on the genial powers of the animal and vegetable world The bishops of Rome were solicitous to abolish a profane custom so repugnant to the spirit of Christianity but their zeal was not supported by the authority of the civil magistrate the inveterate abuse subsisted till the end of the fifth century and Pope Gelasius who purified the capital from the last stain of idolatry appeased by a formal apology the murmurs of the senate and people eighty two Footnote seventy six The palace of Anthemius stood on the banks of the Propontis In the ninth

eight forty five which is entitled Adversus Andromachum Senatorem caeterosque Romanos qui Lupercalia secundum morem pristinum colenda constituebant Gelasius always supposes that his adversaries are nominal Christians and that he may not yield to them in absurd prejudice he imputes to this harmless festival all the calamities of the age Chapter XXXVI Total Extinction Of The Western Empire Part IV In all his public declarations the emperor Leo assumes the authority and professes the affection of a father for his son Anthemius with whom he had divided the administration of the universe eighty three The situation and perhaps the character of Leo dissuaded him from exposing his person to the toils and dangers of an African war But the powers of the Eastern empire were strenuously exerted to deliver Italy and the Mediterranean from the Vandals and Genseric who had so long oppressed both the land and sea was threatened from every side with a formidable invasion The campaign was opened by a bold and successful enterprise of the praefect Heraclius eighty four The troops of Egypt Thebais and Libya were embarked under his command and the Arabs with a train of horses and camels opened the roads of the desert Heraclius landed on the coast of Tripoli surprised and subdued the cities of that province and prepared by a laborious march which Cato had formerly executed eighty five to join the Imperial army under the walls of Carthage The intelligence of this loss extorted from Genseric some insidious and ineffectual propositions of peace but he was still more seriously alarmed by the reconciliation of Marcellinus with the two empires The independent patrician had been persuaded to acknowledge the legitimate title of Anthemius whom he accompanied in his journey to Rome the Dalmatian fleet was received into the harbors of Italy the active valor of Marcellinus expelled the Vandals from the Island of Sardinia and the languid efforts of the West added some weight to the immense preparations of the Eastern Romans The expense of the naval armament which Leo sent against the Vandals has been distinctly ascertained and the curious and instructive account displays the wealth of the declining empire The Royal demesnes or private patrimony of the prince supplied seventeen thousand pounds of gold forty seven thousand pounds of gold and seven hundred thousand of silver were levied and paid into the treasury by the Praetorian praefects But the cities were reduced to extreme poverty and the diligent calculation of fines and forfeitures as a valuable object of the revenue does not suggest the idea of a just or merciful administration The whole expense by whatsoever means it was defrayed of the African campaign amounted to the sum of one hundred and thirty thousand pounds of gold about five millions two hundred thousand pounds sterling at a time when the value of money appears from the comparative price of corn to have been somewhat higher than in the present age eighty six The fleet that sailed from Constantinople to Carthage consisted of eleven hundred and thirteen ships and the number of soldiers and mariners exceeded one hundred thousand men Basiliscus the brother of the empress Vorina was intrusted with this important command His sister the wife of Leo had exaggerated the merit of his former exploits against the Scythians But the discovery of his guilt or incapacity was reserved for the African war and his friends could only save his military reputation by asserting that he had conspired with Aspar to spare Genseric and to betray the last hope of the Western empire Footnote eighty three Itaque nos quibus totius mundi regimen commisit superna provisio Pius et triumphator semper Augustus filius noster Anthemius licet

in the province of Cyrene was much longer than that of Heraclius from Tripoli He passed the deep sandy desert in thirty days and it was found necessary to provide besides the ordinary supplies a great number of skins filled with water and several Psylli who were supposed to possess the art of sucking the wounds which had been made by the serpents of their native country See Plutarch in Caton Uticens tom iv p two hundred seventy five Straben Geograph l xxii p eleven ninety three Footnote eighty six The principal sum is clearly expressed by Procopius de Bell Vandal l i c six p one hundred

The historian Malchus laments the public misery Excerpt ex Suida in Corp Hist Byzant p fifty eight but he is surely unjust when he charges Leo with hoarding the treasures which he extorted from the people Note Compare likewise the newly discovered work of Lydus de Magistratibus ed Hase Paris eighteen twelve and in the new collection of the Byzantines l iii c forty three Lydus states the expenditure at sixty five thousand lbs of gold seven hundred thousand of silver But Lydus exaggerates the fleet to the incredible number of ten thousand long ships Liburnae and the troops to four hundred thousand men Lydus describes this fatal measure of which he charges the blame on Basiliscus as the shipwreck of the state From that time all the revenues of the empire were anticipated and the finances fell into inextricable confusion M Experience has shown that the success of an invader most commonly depends on the vigor and celerity of his operations The strength and sharpness of the first impression are blunted by delay the health and spirit of the troops insensibly languish in a distant climate the naval and military force a mighty effort which perhaps can never be repeated is silently consumed and every hour that is wasted in negotiation accustoms the enemy to contemplate and examine those hostile terrors which on their first appearance he deemed irresistible The formidable navy of Basiliscus pursued its prosperous navigation from the Thracian Bosphorus to the coast of Africa He landed his troops at Cape Bona or the promontory of Mercury about forty miles from Carthage eighty seven The army of Heraclius and the fleet of Marcellinus either joined or seconded the Imperial lieutenant and the Vandals who opposed his progress by sea or land were successively vanquished eighty eight If Basiliscus had seized the moment of consternation and boldly advanced to the capital Carthage must have surrendered and the kingdom of the Vandals was extinguished Genseric beheld the danger with firmness and eluded it with his veteran dexterity He protested in the most respectful language that he was ready to submit his person and his dominions to the will of the emperor but he requested a truce of five days to regulate the terms of his submission and it was universally believed that his secret liberality contributed to the success of this public negotiation Instead of obstinately refusing whatever indulgence his enemy so earnestly solicited the guilty or the credulous Basiliscus consented to the fatal truce and his imprudent security seemed to proclaim that he already considered himself as the conqueror of Africa During this short interval the wind became favorable to the designs of Genseric He manned his largest ships of war with the bravest of the Moors and Vandals and they towed after them many large barks filled with combustible materials In the obscurity of the night these destructive vessels were impelled against the unguarded and unsuspecting fleet of the Romans who were awakened by the sense of their instant danger Their close and crowded order assisted the progress of the fire which was communicated with rapid and irresistible violence and the noise of the wind the crackling of the flames the dissonant cries of the soldiers and mariners who could neither command nor obey increased the horror of the nocturnal tumult Whilst they labored to extricate themselves from the fire ships and to save at least a part of the navy the galleys of Genseric assaulted them with temperate and disciplined valor and many of the Romans who escaped the fury of the flames were destroyed or taken by the victorious Vandals Among the events of that disastrous night the heroic or rather desperate courage of John one of the principal officers of Basiliscus has rescued his name from oblivion When the ship which he had bravely defended was almost consumed he threw himself in his armor into the sea disdainfully rejected the esteem and pity of Genso the son of Genseric who pressed him to accept honorable quarter and sunk under the waves exclaiming with his last breath that he would never fall alive into the hands of those impious dogs Actuated by a far different spirit Basiliscus whose station was the most remote from danger disgracefully fled in the beginning of the engagement returned to Constantinople with the loss of more than half of his fleet and army and sheltered his guilty head in the sanctuary of saint Sophia till his sister by her tears and entreaties could obtain his pardon from the indignant emperor Heraclius effected his retreat through the desert Marcellinus retired to Sicily where he was assassinated perhaps at the instigation of Ricimer by one of his own captains and the king of the Vandals expressed his surprise and satisfaction that the Romans themselves should remove from the world his most formidable antagonists eighty nine After the failure of this great expedition eight hundred ninety one Genseric again became the tyrant of the sea the coasts of Italy Greece and Asia were again exposed to his revenge and avarice Tripoli and Sardinia returned to his obedience he added Sicily to the number of his provinces and before he died in the fulness of years and of glory he beheld the final extinction of the empire of the West ninety Footnote eighty seven This promontory is forty

observation on the failure of these great naval armaments During his long and active reign the African monarch had studiously cultivated the friendship of the Barbarians of Europe whose arms he might employ in a seasonable and effectual diversion against the two empires After the death of Attila he renewed his alliance with the Visigoths of Gaul and the sons of the elder Theodoric who successively reigned over that warlike nation were easily persuaded by the sense of interest to forget the cruel affront which Genseric had inflicted on their sister ninety one The death of the emperor Majorian delivered Theodoric the Second from the restraint of fear and perhaps of honor he violated his recent treaty with the Romans and the ample territory of Narbonne which he firmly united to his dominions became the immediate reward of his perfidy The selfish policy of Ricimer encouraged him to invade the provinces which were in the possession of Aegidius his rival but the active count by the defence of Arles and the victory of Orleans saved Gaul and checked during his lifetime the progress of the Visigoths Their ambition was soon rekindled and the design of extinguishing the Roman empire in Spain and Gaul was conceived and almost completed in the reign of Euric who assassinated his brother Theodoric and displayed with a more savage temper superior abilities both in peace and war He passed the Pyrenees at the head of a numerous army subdued the cities of Saragossa and Pampeluna vanquished in battle the martial nobles of the Tarragonese province carried his victorious arms into the heart of Lusitania and permitted the Suevi to hold the kingdom of Gallicia under the Gothic monarchy of Spain ninety two The efforts of Euric were not less vigorous or less successful in Gaul and throughout the country that extends from the Pyrenees to the Rhone and the Loire Berry and Auvergne were the only cities or dioceses which refused to acknowledge him as their master ninety three In the defence of Clermont their principal town the inhabitants of Auvergne sustained with inflexible resolution the miseries of war pestilence and famine and the Visigoths relinquishing the fruitless siege suspended the hopes of that important conquest The youth of the province were animated by the heroic and almost incredible valor of Ecdicius the son of the emperor Avitus ninety four who made a desperate sally with only eighteen horsemen boldly attacked the Gothic army and after maintaining a flying skirmish retired safe and victorious within the walls of Clermont His charity was equal to his courage in a time of extreme scarcity four thousand poor were fed at his expense and his private influence levied an army of Burgundians for the deliverance of Auvergne From his virtues alone the faithful citizens of Gaul derived any hopes of safety or freedom and even such virtues were insufficient to avert the impending ruin of their country since they were anxious to learn from his authority and example whether they should prefer the alternative of exile or servitude ninety five The public confidence was lost the resources of the state were exhausted and the Gauls had too much reason to believe that Anthemius who reigned in Italy was incapable of protecting his distressed subjects beyond the Alps The feeble emperor could only procure for their defence the service of twelve thousand British auxiliaries Riothamus one of the independent kings or chieftains of the island was persuaded to transport his troops to the continent of Gaul he sailed up the Loire and established his quarters in Berry where the people complained of these oppressive allies till they were destroyed or dispersed by the arms of the Visigoths ninety six Footnote ninety one Jornandes is our best

c eighteen in tom ii p one hundred seventy Sidonius who styles these mercenary troops argutos armatos tumultuosos virtute numero contul ernio contumaces addresses their general in a tone of friendship and familiarity One of the last acts of jurisdiction which the Roman senate exercised over their subjects of Gaul was the trial and condemnation of Arvandus the Praetorian praefect Sidonius who rejoices that he lived under a reign in which he might pity and assist a state criminal has expressed with tenderness and freedom the faults of his indiscreet and unfortunate friend ninety seven From the perils which he had escaped Arvandus imbibed confidence rather than wisdom and such was the various though uniform imprudence of his behavior that his prosperity must appear much more surprising than his downfall The second praefecture which he obtained within the term of five years abolished the merit and popularity of his preceding administration His easy temper was corrupted by flattery and exasperated by opposition he was forced to satisfy his importunate creditors with the spoils of the province his capricious insolence offended the nobles of Gaul and he sunk under the weight of the public hatred The mandate of his disgrace summoned him to justify his conduct before the senate and he passed the Sea of Tuscany with a favorable wind the presage as he vainly imagined of his future fortunes A decent respect was still observed for the Proefectorian rank and on his arrival at Rome Arvandus was committed to the hospitality rather than to the custody of Flavius Asellus the count of the sacred largesses who resided in the Capitol ninety eight He was eagerly pursued by his accusers the four deputies of Gaul who were all distinguished by their birth their dignities or their eloquence In the name of a great province and according to the forms of Roman jurisprudence they instituted a civil and criminal action requiring such restitution as might compensate the losses of individuals and such punishment as might satisfy the justice of the state Their charges of corrupt oppression were numerous and weighty but they placed their secret dependence on a letter which they had intercepted and which they could prove by the evidence of his secretary to have been dictated by Arvandus himself The author of this letter seemed to dissuade the king of the Goths from a peace with the Greek emperor he suggested the attack of the Britons on the Loire and he recommended a division of Gaul according to the law of nations between the Visigoths and the Burgundians ninety nine These pernicious schemes which a friend could only palliate by the reproaches of vanity and indiscretion were susceptible of a treasonable interpretation and the deputies had artfully resolved not to produce their most formidable weapons till the decisive moment of the contest But their intentions were discovered by the zeal of Sidonius He immediately apprised the unsuspecting criminal of his danger and sincerely lamented without any mixture of anger the haughty presumption of Arvandus who rejected and even resented the salutary advice of his friends Ignorant of his real situation Arvandus showed himself in the Capitol in the white robe of a candidate accepted indiscriminate salutations and offers of service examined the shops of the merchants the silks and gems sometimes with the indifference of a spectator and sometimes with the attention of a purchaser and complained of the times of the senate of the prince and of the delays of justice His complaints were soon removed An early day was fixed for his trial and Arvandus appeared with his accusers before a numerous assembly of the Roman senate The mournful garb which they affected excited the compassion of the judges who were scandalized by the gay and splendid dress of their adversary and when the praefect Arvandus with the first of the Gallic deputies were directed to take their places on the senatorial benches the same contrast of pride and modesty was observed in their behavior In this memorable judgment which presented a lively image of the old republic the Gauls exposed with force and freedom the grievances of the province and as soon as the minds of the audience were sufficiently inflamed they recited the fatal epistle The obstinacy of Arvandus was founded on the strange supposition that a subject could not be convicted of treason unless he had actually conspired to assume the purple As the paper was read he repeatedly and with a loud voice acknowledged it for his genuine composition and his astonishment was equal to his dismay when the unanimous voice of the senate declared him guilty of a capital offence By their decree he was degraded from the rank of a praefect to the obscure condition of a plebeian and ignominiously dragged by servile hands to the public prison After a fortnight s adjournment the senate was again convened to pronounce the sentence of his death but while he expected in the Island of Aesculapius the expiration of the thirty days allowed by an ancient law to the vilest malefactors one hundred his friends interposed the emperor Anthemius relented and the praefect of Gaul obtained the milder punishment of exile and confiscation The faults of Arvandus might deserve compassion but the impunity of Seronatus accused the justice of the republic till he was condemned and executed on the complaint of the people of Auvergne That flagitious minister the Catiline of his age and country held a secret correspondence with the Visigoths to betray the province which he oppressed his industry was continually exercised in the discovery of new taxes and obsolete offences and his extravagant vices would have inspired contempt if they had not excited fear and abhorrence one hundred one Footnote ninety seven See Sidonius l i epist seven p fifteen twenty with Sirmond s notes This letter does honor to his heart as well as to his understanding The prose of Sidonius however vitiated by a false and affected taste is much superior to his insipid verses Footnote ninety eight When the Capitol ceased to be a temple it was appropriated to the use of the civil

applauds the punishment of Seronatus perhaps with the indignation of a virtuous citizen perhaps with the resentment of a personal enemy Such criminals were not beyond the reach of justice but whatever might be the guilt of Ricimer that powerful Barbarian was able to contend or to negotiate with the prince whose alliance he had condescended to accept The peaceful and prosperous reign which Anthemius had promised to the West was soon clouded by misfortune and discord Ricimer apprehensive or impatient of a superior retired from Rome and fixed his residence at Milan an advantageous situation either to invite or to repel the warlike tribes that were seated between the Alps and the Danube one hundred two Italy was gradually divided into two independent and hostile kingdoms and the nobles of Liguria who trembled at the near approach of a civil war fell prostrate at the feet of the patrician and conjured him to spare their unhappy country For my own part replied Ricimer in a tone of insolent moderation I am still inclined to embrace the friendship of the Galatian one hundred three but who will undertake to appease his anger or to mitigate the pride which always rises in proportion to our submission They informed him that Epiphanius bishop of Pavia one hundred four united the wisdom of the serpent with the innocence of the dove and appeared confident that the eloquence of such an ambassador must prevail against the strongest opposition either of interest or passion Their recommendation was approved and Epiphanius assuming the benevolent office of mediation proceeded without delay to Rome where he was received with the honors due to his merit and reputation The oration of a bishop in favor of peace may be easily supposed he argued that in all possible circumstances the forgiveness of injuries must be an act of mercy or magnanimity or prudence and he seriously admonished the emperor to avoid a contest with a fierce Barbarian which might be fatal to himself and must be ruinous to his dominions Anthemius acknowledged the truth of his maxims but he deeply felt with grief and indignation the behavior of Ricimer and his passion gave eloquence and energy to his discourse What favors he warmly exclaimed have we refused to this ungrateful man What provocations have we not endured Regardless of the majesty of the purple I gave my daughter to a Goth I sacrificed my own blood to the safety of the republic The liberality which ought to have secured the eternal attachment of Ricimer has exasperated him against his benefactor What wars has he not excited against the empire How often has he instigated and assisted the fury of hostile nations Shall I now accept his perfidious friendship Can I hope that he will respect the engagements of a treaty who has already violated the duties of a son But the anger of Anthemius evaporated in these passionate exclamations he insensibly yielded to the proposals of Epiphanius and the bishop returned to his diocese with the satisfaction of restoring the peace of Italy by a reconciliation one hundred five of which the sincerity and continuance might be reasonably suspected The clemency of the emperor was extorted from his weakness and Ricimer suspended his ambitious designs till he had secretly prepared the engines with which he resolved to subvert the throne of Anthemius The mask of peace and moderation was then thrown aside The army of Ricimer was fortified by a numerous reenforcement of Burgundians and Oriental Suevi he disclaimed all allegiance to the Greek emperor marched from Milan to the Gates of Rome and fixing his camp on the banks of the Anio impatiently expected the arrival of Olybrius his Imperial candidate Footnote one hundred two Ricimer under the reign of Anthemius defeated and slew in battle Beorgor king of the Alani Jornandes c forty five p six hundred seventy eight His sister had married the king of the Burgundians and he maintained an intimate connection with the Suevic colony established in Pannonia and Noricum Footnote one hundred three Galatam concitatum Sirmond in his notes to Ennodius applies this appellation to Anthemius himself The emperor was probably born in the province of Galatia whose inhabitants the Gallo Grecians were supposed to unite the vices of a savage and a corrupted people Footnote one hundred four Epiphanius was

posterity if Ennodius one of his successors had not written his life Sirmond Opera tom i p sixteen forty seven sixteen ninety two in which he represents him as one of the greatest characters of the age Footnote one hundred five Ennodius p sixteen fifty nine sixteen sixty four has related this embassy of Epiphanius and his narrative verbose and turgid as it must appear illustrates some curious passages in the fall of the Western empire The senator Olybrius of the Anician family might esteem himself the lawful heir of the Western empire He had married Placidia the younger daughter of Valentinian after she was restored by Genseric who still detained her sister Eudoxia as the wife or rather as the captive of his son The king of the Vandals supported by threats and solicitations the fair pretensions of his Roman ally and assigned as one of the motives of the war the refusal of the senate and people to acknowledge their lawful prince and the unworthy preference which they had given to a stranger one hundred six The friendship of the public enemy might render Olybrius still more unpopular to the Italians but when Ricimer meditated the ruin of the emperor Anthemius he tempted with the offer of a diadem the candidate who could justify his rebellion by an illustrious name and a royal alliance The husband of Placidia who like most of his ancestors had been invested with the consular dignity might have continued to enjoy a secure and splendid fortune in the peaceful residence of Constantinople nor does he appear to have been tormented by such a genius as cannot be amused or occupied unless by the administration of an empire Yet Olybrius yielded to the importunities of his friends perhaps of his wife rashly plunged into the dangers and calamities of a civil war and with the secret connivance of the emperor Leo accepted the Italian purple which was bestowed and resumed at the capricious will of a Barbarian He landed without obstacle for Genseric was master of the sea either at Ravenna or the port of Ostia and immediately proceeded to the camp of Ricimer where he was received as the sovereign of the Western world one hundred seven Footnote one

consulship of Olybrius A D four hundred sixty four was bestowed as a nuptial present Footnote one hundred seven The hostile appearance of Olybrius is fixed notwithstanding the opinion of Pagi by the duration of his reign The secret connivance of Leo is acknowledged by Theophanes and the Paschal Chronicle We are ignorant of his motives but in this obscure period our ignorance extends to the most public and important facts The patrician who had extended his posts from the Anio to the Melvian bridge already possessed two quarters of Rome the Vatican and the Janiculum which are separated by the Tyber from the rest of the city one hundred eight and it may be conjectured that an assembly of seceding senators imitated in the choice of Olybrius the forms of a legal election But the body of the senate and people firmly adhered to the cause of Anthemius and the more effectual support of a Gothic army enabled him to prolong his reign and the public distress by a resistance of three months which produced the concomitant evils of famine and pestilence At length Ricimer made a furious assault on the bridge of Hadrian or saint Angelo and the narrow pass was defended with equal valor by the Goths till the death of Gilimer their leader The victorious troops breaking down every barrier rushed with irresistible violence into the heart of the city and Rome if we may use the language of a contemporary pope was subverted by the civil fury of Anthemius and Ricimer one hundred nine The unfortunate Anthemius was dragged from his concealment and inhumanly massacred by the command of his son in law who thus added a third or perhaps a fourth emperor to the number of his victims The soldiers who united the rage of factious citizens with the savage manners of Barbarians were indulged without control in the license of rapine and murder the crowd of slaves and plebeians who were unconcerned in the event could only gain by the indiscriminate pillage and the face of the city exhibited the strange contrast of stern cruelty and dissolute intemperance one hundred ten Forty days after this calamitous event the subject not of glory but of guilt Italy was delivered by a painful disease from the tyrant Ricimer who bequeathed the command of his army to his nephew Gundobald one of the princes of the Burgundians In the same year all the principal actors in this great revolution were removed from the stage and the whole reign of Olybrius whose death does not betray any symptoms of violence is included within the term of seven months He left one daughter the offspring of his marriage with Placidia and the family of the great Theodosius transplanted from Spain to Constantinople was propagated in the female line as far as the eighth generation one hundred eleven Footnote one hundred eight Of the fourteen regions or quarters into which Rome was divided by Augustus only one the Janiculum lay on the Tuscan side of the Tyber But in the fifth century the Vatican suburb formed a considerable city and in the ecclesiastical distribution which had been recently made by Simplicius the reigning pope two of the seven regions or parishes of Rome depended on the church of saint Peter

colleague was seriously agitated in the council of Leo The empress Verina studious to promote the greatness of her own family had married one of her nieces to Julius Nepos who succeeded his uncle Marcellinus in the sovereignty of Dalmatia a more solid possession than the title which he was persuaded to accept of Emperor of the West But the measures of the Byzantine court were so languid and irresolute that many months elapsed after the death of Anthemius and even of Olybrius before their destined successor could show himself with a respectable force to his Italian subjects During that interval Glycerius an obscure soldier was invested with the purple by his patron Gundobald but the Burgundian prince was unable or unwilling to support his nomination by a civil war the pursuits of domestic ambition recalled him beyond the Alps one hundred thirteen and his client was permitted to exchange the Roman sceptre for the bishopric of Salona After extinguishing such a competitor the emperor Nepos was acknowledged by the senate by the Italians and by the provincials of Gaul his moral virtues and military talents were loudly celebrated and those who derived any private benefit from his government announced in prophetic strains the restoration of the public felicity one hundred fourteen Their hopes if such hopes had been entertained were confounded within the term of a single year and the treaty of peace which ceded Auvergue to the Visigoths is the only event of his short and inglorious reign The most faithful subjects of Gaul were sacrificed by the Italian emperor to the hope of domestic security one hundred fifteen but his repose was soon invaded by a furious sedition of the Barbarian confederates who under the command of Orestes their general were in full march from Rome to Ravenna Nepos trembled at their approach and instead of placing a just confidence in the strength of Ravenna he hastily escaped to his ships and retired to his Dalmatian principality on the opposite coast of the Adriatic By this shameful abdication he protracted his life about five years in a very ambiguous state between an emperor and an exile till he was assassinated at Salona by the ungrateful Glycerius who was translated perhaps as the reward of his crime to the archbishopric of Milan one hundred sixteen Footnote one hundred twelve The last revolutions of the Western empire are

His birth and fortunes rendered him one of the most illustrious subjects of Pannonia When that province was ceded to the Huns he entered into the service of Attila his lawful sovereign obtained the office of his secretary and was repeatedly sent ambassador to Constantinople to represent the person and signify the commands of the imperious monarch The death of that conqueror restored him to his freedom and Orestes might honorably refuse either to follow the sons of Attila into the Scythian desert or to obey the Ostrogoths who had usurped the dominion of Pannonia He preferred the service of the Italian princes the successors of Valentinian and as he possessed the qualifications of courage industry and experience he advanced with rapid steps in the military profession till he was elevated by the favor of Nepos himself to the dignities of patrician and master general of the troops These troops had been long accustomed to reverence the character and authority of Orestes who affected their manners conversed with them in their own language and was intimately connected with their national chieftains by long habits of familiarity and friendship At his solicitation they rose in arms against the obscure Greek who presumed to claim their obedience and when Orestes from some secret motive declined the purple they consented with the same facility to acknowledge his son Augustulus as the emperor of the West By the abdication of Nepos Orestes had now attained the summit of his ambitious hopes but he soon discovered before the end of the first year that the lessons of perjury and ingratitude which a rebel must inculcate will be resorted to against himself and that the precarious sovereign of Italy was only permitted to choose whether he would be the slave or the victim of his Barbarian mercenaries The dangerous alliance of these strangers had oppressed and insulted the last remains of Roman freedom and dignity At each revolution their pay and privileges were augmented but their insolence increased in a still more extravagant degree they envied the fortune of their brethren in Gaul Spain and Africa whose victorious arms had acquired an independent and perpetual inheritance and they insisted on their peremptory demand that a third part of the lands of Italy should be immediately divided among them Orestes with a spirit which in another situation might be entitled to our esteem chose rather to encounter the rage of an armed multitude than to subscribe the ruin of an innocent people He rejected the audacious demand and his refusal was favorable to the ambition of Odoacer a bold Barbarian who assured his fellow soldiers that if they dared to associate under his command they might soon extort the justice which had been denied to their dutiful petitions From all the camps and garrisons of Italy the confederates actuated by the same resentment and the same hopes impatiently flocked to the standard of this popular leader and the unfortunate patrician overwhelmed by the torrent hastily retreated to the strong city of Pavia the episcopal seat of the holy Epiphanites Pavia was immediately besieged the fortifications were stormed the town was pillaged and although the bishop might labor with much zeal and some success to save the property of the church and the chastity of female captives the tumult could only be appeased by the execution of Orestes one hundred nineteen His brother Paul was slain in an action near Ravenna and the helpless Augustulus who could no longer command the respect was reduced to implore the clemency of Odoacer Footnote one hundred seventeen Our knowledge of these mercenaries who subverted the Western empire is derived from Procopius de Bell Gothico l i c i p three hundred eight The popular opinion and the recent historians represent Odoacer in the false light of a stranger and a king who invaded Italy with an army of foreigners his native subjects Footnote one hundred eighteen Orestes

secretary of Attila was the father of Augustulus Footnote one hundred nineteen See Ennodius in Vit Epiphan Sirmond tom i p sixteen sixty nine sixteen seventy He adds weight to the narrative of Procopius though we may doubt whether the devil actually contrived the siege of Pavia to distress the bishop and his flock That successful Barbarian was the son of Edecon who in some remarkable transactions particularly described in a preceding chapter had been the colleague of Orestes himself eleven ninety one The honor of an ambassador should be exempt from suspicion and Edecon had listened to a conspiracy against the life of his sovereign But this apparent guilt was expiated by his merit or repentance his rank was eminent and conspicuous he enjoyed the favor of Attila and the troops under his command who guarded in their turn the royal village consisted of a tribe of Scyrri his immediate and hereditary subjects In the revolt of the nations they still adhered to the Huns and more than twelve years afterwards the name of Edecon is honorably mentioned in their unequal contests with the Ostrogoths which was terminated after two bloody battles by the defeat and dispersion of the Scyrri one hundred twenty Their gallant leader who did not survive this national calamity left two sons Onulf and Odoacer to struggle with adversity and to maintain as they might by rapine or service the faithful followers of their exile Onulf directed his steps towards Constantinople where he sullied by the assassination of a generous benefactor the fame which he had acquired in arms His brother Odoacer led a wandering life among the Barbarians of Noricum with a mind and a fortune suited to the most desperate adventures and when he had fixed his choice he piously visited the cell of Severinus the popular saint of the country to solicit his approbation and blessing The lowness of the door would not admit the lofty stature of Odoacer he was obliged to stoop but in that humble attitude the saint could discern the symptoms of his future greatness and addressing him in a prophetic tone Pursue said he your design proceed to Italy you will soon cast away this coarse garment of skins and your wealth will be adequate to the liberality of your mind one hundred twenty one The Barbarian whose daring spirit accepted and ratified the prediction was admitted into the service of the Western empire and soon obtained an honorable rank in the guards His manners were gradually polished his military skill was improved and the confederates of Italy would not have elected him for their general unless the exploits of Odoacer had established a high opinion of his courage and capacity one hundred twenty two Their military acclamations saluted him with the title of king but he abstained during his whole reign from the use of the purple and diadem one hundred twenty three lest he should offend those princes whose subjects by their accidental mixture had formed the victorious army

to exercise as the vicegerent of the emperor of the West But Odoacer had resolved to abolish that useless and expensive office and such is the weight of antique prejudice that it required some boldness and penetration to discover the extreme facility of the enterprise The unfortunate Augustulus was made the instrument of his own disgrace he signified his resignation to the senate and that assembly in their last act of obedience to a Roman prince still affected the spirit of freedom and the forms of the constitution An epistle was addressed by their unanimous decree to the emperor Zeno the son in law and successor of Leo who had lately been restored after a short rebellion to the Byzantine throne They solemnly disclaim the necessity or even the wish of continuing any longer the Imperial succession in Italy since in their opinion the majesty of a sole monarch is sufficient to pervade and protect at the same time both the East and the West In their own name and in the name of the people they consent that the seat of universal empire shall be transferred from Rome to Constantinople and they basely renounce the right of choosing their master the only vestige that yet remained of the authority which had given laws to the world The republic they repeat that name without a blush might safely confide in the civil and military virtues of Odoacer and they humbly request that the emperor would invest him with the title of Patrician and the administration of the diocese of Italy The deputies of the senate were received at Constantinople with some marks of displeasure and indignation and when they were admitted to the audience of Zeno he sternly reproached them with their treatment of the two emperors Anthemius and Nepos whom the East had successively granted to the prayers of Italy The first continued he you have murdered the second you have expelled but the second is still alive and whilst he lives he is your lawful sovereign But the prudent Zeno soon deserted the hopeless cause of his abdicated colleague His vanity was gratified by the title of sole emperor and by the statues erected to his honor in the several quarters of Rome he entertained a friendly though ambiguous correspondence with the patrician Odoacer and he gratefully accepted the Imperial ensigns the sacred ornaments of the throne and palace which the Barbarian was not unwilling to remove from the sight of the people one hundred twenty four Footnote one hundred twenty four Malchus whose loss excites our regret has preserved in Excerpt Legat p ninety three this extraordinary embassy from the senate to Zeno The anonymous fragment p seven hundred seventeen and the extract from Candidus apud Phot p one hundred seventy six are likewise of some use In the space of twenty years since the death of Valentinian nine emperors had successively disappeared and the son of Orestes a youth recommended only by his beauty would be the least entitled to the notice of posterity if his reign which was marked by the extinction of the Roman empire in the West did not leave a memorable era in the history of mankind one hundred twenty five The patrician Orestes had married the daughter of Count Romulus of Petovio in Noricum the name of Augustus notwithstanding the jealousy of power was known at Aquileia as a familiar surname and the appellations of the two great founders of the city and of the monarchy were thus strangely united in the last of their successors one hundred twenty six The son of Orestes assumed and disgraced the names of Romulus Augustus but the first was corrupted into Momyllus by the Greeks and the second has been changed by the Latins into the contemptible diminutive Augustulus The life of this inoffensive youth was spared by the generous clemency of Odoacer who dismissed him with his whole family from the Imperial palace fixed his annual allowance at six thousand pieces of gold and assigned the castle of Lucullus in Campania for the place of his exile or retirement one hundred twenty seven As soon as the Romans breathed from the toils of the Punic war they were attracted by the beauties and the pleasures of Campania and the country house of the elder Scipio at Liternum exhibited a lasting model of their rustic simplicity one hundred twenty eight The delicious shores of the Bay of Naples were crowded with villas and Sylla applauded the masterly skill of his rival who had seated himself on the lofty promontory of Misenum that commands on every side the sea and land as far as the boundaries of the horizon one hundred twenty nine The villa of Marius was purchased within a few years by Lucullus and the price had increased from two thousand five hundred to more than fourscore thousand pounds sterling one hundred thirty It was adorned by the new proprietor with Grecian arts and Asiatic treasures and the houses and gardens of Lucullus obtained a distinguished rank in the list of Imperial palaces one hundred thirty one When the Vandals

an authentic piece Odoacer was the first Barbarian who reigned in Italy over a people who had once asserted their just superiority above the rest of mankind The disgrace of the Romans still excites our respectful compassion and we fondly sympathize with the imaginary grief and indignation of their degenerate posterity But the calamities of Italy had gradually subdued the proud consciousness of freedom and glory In the age of Roman virtue the provinces were subject to the arms and the citizens to the laws of the republic till those laws were subverted by civil discord and both the city and the province became the servile property of a tyrant The forms of the constitution which alleviated or disguised their abject slavery were abolished by time and violence the Italians alternately lamented the presence or the absence of the sovereign whom they detested or despised and the succession of five centuries inflicted the various evils of military license capricious despotism and elaborate oppression During the same period the Barbarians had emerged from obscurity and contempt and the warriors of Germany and Scythia were introduced into the provinces as the servants the allies and at length the masters of the Romans whom they insulted or protected The hatred of the people was suppressed by fear they respected the spirit and splendor of the martial chiefs who were invested with the honors of the empire and the fate of Rome had long depended on the sword of those formidable strangers The stern Ricimer who trampled on the ruins of Italy had exercised the power without assuming the title of a king and the patient Romans were insensibly prepared to acknowledge the royalty of Odoacer and his Barbaric successors The king of Italy was not unworthy of the high station to which his valor and fortune had exalted him his savage manners were polished by the habits of conversation and he respected though a conqueror and a Barbarian the institutions and even the prejudices of his subjects After an interval of seven years Odoacer restored the consulship of the West For himself he modestly or proudly declined an honor which was still accepted by the emperors of the East but the curule chair was successively filled by eleven of the most illustrious senators one hundred thirty three and the list is adorned by the respectable name of Basilius whose virtues claimed the friendship and grateful applause of Sidonius his client one hundred thirty four The laws of the emperors were strictly enforced and the civil administration of Italy was still exercised by the Praetorian praefect and his subordinate officers Odoacer devolved on the Roman magistrates the odious and oppressive task of collecting the public revenue but he reserved for himself the merit of seasonable and popular indulgence one hundred thirty five Like the rest of the Barbarians he had been instructed in the Arian heresy but he revered the monastic and episcopal characters and the silence of the Catholics attest the toleration which they enjoyed The peace of the city required the interposition of his praefect Basilius in the choice of a Roman pontiff the decree which restrained the clergy from alienating their lands was ultimately designed for the benefit of the people whose devotions would have been taxed to repair the dilapidations of the church one hundred thirty six Italy was protected by the arms of its conqueror and its frontiers were respected by the Barbarians of Gaul and Germany who had so long insulted the feeble race of Theodosius Odoacer passed the Adriatic to chastise the assassins of the emperor Nepos and to acquire the maritime province of Dalmatia He passed the Alps to rescue the remains of Noricum from Fava or Feletheus king of the Rugians

cities of Bologna Modena Regium and Placentia one hundred forty Pope Gelasius was a subject of Odoacer and he affirms with strong exaggeration that in Aemilia Tuscany and the adjacent provinces the human species was almost extirpated one hundred forty one The plebeians of Rome who were fed by the hand of their master perished or disappeared as soon as his liberality was suppressed the decline of the arts reduced the industrious mechanic to idleness and want and the senators who might support with patience the ruin of their country bewailed their private loss of wealth and luxury fourteen

of actual sufferings was imbittered by the fear of more dreadful evils and as new lands were allotted to the new swarms of Barbarians each senator was apprehensive lest the arbitrary surveyors should approach his favorite villa or his most profitable farm The least unfortunate were those who submitted without a murmur to the power which it was impossible to resist Since they desired to live they owed some gratitude to the tyrant who had spared their lives and since he was the absolute master of their fortunes the portion which he left must be accepted as his pure and voluntary gift one hundred forty three The distress of Italy fourteen thirty one was mitigated by the prudence and humanity of Odoacer who had bound himself as the price of his elevation to satisfy the demands of a licentious and turbulent multitude The kings of the Barbarians were frequently resisted deposed or murdered by their native subjects and the various bands of Italian mercenaries who associated under the standard of an elective general claimed a larger privilege of freedom and rapine A monarchy destitute of national union and hereditary right hastened to its dissolution After a reign of fourteen

Christian Antiquities I Prosperity and peace introduced the distinction of the vulgar and the Ascetic Christians two The loose and imperfect practice of religion satisfied the conscience of the multitude The prince or magistrate the soldier or merchant reconciled their fervent zeal and implicit faith with the exercise of their profession the pursuit of their interest and the indulgence of their passions but the Ascetics who obeyed and abused the rigid precepts of the gospel were inspired by the savage enthusiasm which represents man as a criminal and God as a tyrant They seriously renounced the business and the pleasures of the age abjured the use of wine of flesh and of marriage chastised their body mortified their affections and embraced a life of misery as the price of eternal happiness In the reign of Constantine the Ascetics fled from a profane and degenerate world to perpetual solitude or religious society Like the first Christians of Jerusalem three three hundred eleven they resigned the use or the property of their temporal possessions established regular communities of the same sex and a similar disposition and assumed the names of Hermits Monks and Anachorets expressive of their lonely retreat in a natural or artificial desert They soon acquired the respect of the world which they despised and the loudest applause was bestowed on this Divine Philosophy four which surpassed without the aid of science or reason the laborious virtues of the Grecian schools The monks might indeed contend with the Stoics in the contempt of fortune of pain and of death the Pythagorean silence and submission were revived in their servile discipline and they disdained as firmly as the Cynics themselves all the forms and decencies of civil society But the votaries of this Divine Philosophy aspired to imitate a purer and more perfect model They trod in the footsteps of the prophets who had retired to the desert five and they restored the devout and contemplative life which had been instituted by the Essenians in Palestine and Egypt The philosophic eye of Pliny had surveyed with astonishment a solitary people who dwelt among the palm trees near

or three thousand anachorets whenever he visited the innumerable monasteries of Palestine The fame of Basil eighteen is immortal in the monastic history of the East With a mind that had tasted the learning and eloquence of Athens with an ambition scarcely to be satisfied with the archbishopric of Caesarea Basil retired to a savage solitude in Pontus and deigned for a while to give laws to the spiritual colonies which he profusely scattered along the coast of the Black Sea In the West Martin of Tours nineteen a soldier a hermit a bishop and a saint established the monasteries of Gaul two thousand of his disciples followed him to the grave and his eloquent historian challenges the deserts of Thebais to produce in a more favorable climate a champion of equal virtue The progress of the monks was not less rapid or universal than that of Christianity itself Every province and at last every city of the empire was filled with their increasing multitudes and the bleak and barren isles from Lerins to Lipari that arose out of the Tuscan Sea were chosen by the anachorets for the place of their voluntary exile An easy and perpetual intercourse by sea and land connected the provinces of the Roman world and the life of Hilarion displays the facility with which an indigent hermit of Palestine might traverse Egypt embark for Sicily escape to Epirus and finally settle in the Island of Cyprus twenty The Latin Christians embraced the religious institutions of Rome The pilgrims who visited Jerusalem eagerly copied in the most distant climates of the earth the faithful model of the

variously determined by the temper and situation of mankind Reason might subdue or passion might suspend their influence but they acted most forcibly on the infirm minds of children and females they were strengthened by secret remorse or accidental misfortune and they might derive some aid from the temporal considerations of vanity or interest It was naturally supposed that the pious and humble monks who had renounced the world to accomplish the work of their salvation were the best qualified for the spiritual government of the Christians The reluctant hermit was torn from his cell and seated amidst the acclamations of the people on the episcopal throne the monasteries of Egypt of Gaul and of the East supplied a regular succession of saints and bishops and ambition soon discovered the secret road which led to the possession of wealth and honors twenty six The popular monks whose reputation was connected with the fame and success of the order assiduously labored to multiply the

or confinement extraordinary fasts or bloody flagellation and disobedience murmur or delay were ranked in the catalogue of the most heinous sins thirty seven A blind submission to the commands of the abbot however absurd or even criminal they might seem was the ruling principle the first virtue of the Egyptian monks and their patience was frequently exercised by the most extravagant trials They were directed to remove an enormous rock assiduously to water a barren staff that was planted in the ground till at the end of three years it should vegetate and blossom like a tree to walk into a fiery furnace or to cast their infant into a deep pond and several saints or madmen have been immortalized in monastic story by their thoughtless and fearless obedience thirty eight The freedom of the mind the source of every generous and rational sentiment was destroyed by the habits of credulity and submission and the monk contracting the vices of a slave devoutly followed the faith and passions

revolutions of fashion have made ridiculous in the eyes of mankind The father of the Benedictines expressly disclaims all idea of choice of merit and soberly exhorts his disciples to adopt the coarse and convenient dress of the countries which they may inhabit forty one The monastic habits of the ancients varied with the climate and their mode of life and they assumed with the same indifference the sheep skin of the Egyptian peasants or the cloak of the Grecian philosophers They allowed themselves the use of linen in Egypt where it was a cheap and domestic manufacture but in the West they rejected such an expensive article of foreign luxury forty two It was the practice of the monks either to cut or shave their hair they wrapped their heads in a cowl to escape the sight of profane objects their legs and feet were naked except in the extreme cold of winter and their slow and feeble steps were supported by a long staff The aspect of a genuine anachoret was horrid and disgusting every sensation that is offensive to man was thought acceptable to God and the angelic rule of Tabenne condemned the salutary custom of bathing the limbs in water and of anointing them with oil forty three four hundred thirty one The austere monks slept on the ground on a hard mat or a rough blanket and the same bundle of palm leaves served them as a seat in the lay and a pillow in the night Their original cells were low narrow huts built of the slightest materials which formed by the regular distribution of the streets a large and populous village enclosing within the common wall a church a

preservatives against the impure desires of the flesh forty four The rules of abstinence which they imposed or practised were not uniform or perpetual the cheerful festival of the Pentecost was balanced by the extraordinary mortification of Lent the fervor of new monasteries was insensibly relaxed and the voracious appetite of the Gauls could not imitate the patient and temperate virtue of the Egyptians forty five The disciples of Antony and Pachomius were satisfied with their daily pittance forty six of twelve ounces of bread or rather biscuit forty seven which they divided into two frugal repasts of the afternoon and of the evening It was esteemed a merit and almost a duty to abstain from the boiled vegetables which were provided for the refectory but the extraordinary bounty of the abbot sometimes indulged them with the luxury of cheese fruit salad and the small dried fish of the Nile forty eight A more ample latitude of sea and river fish was gradually allowed or assumed but the use of flesh was long confined to the sick or travellers and when it gradually prevailed in the less rigid monasteries of Europe a singular distinction was introduced as if birds whether wild or domestic had been less profane than the grosser animals of the field Water was the pure and innocent beverage of the primitive monks and the founder of the Benedictines regrets the daily portion of half a pint of wine which had been extorted from him by the intemperance of the age forty nine Such an allowance might be easily supplied by the vineyards of Italy and his victorious disciples who passed the Alps the Rhine and the Baltic required in the place of wine an adequate compensation of strong beer or cider Footnote forty four saint Jerom in strong but indiscreet language expresses the

who aspired to the virtue of evangelical poverty abjured at his first entrance into a regular community the idea and even the name of all separate or exclusive possessions fifty The brethren were supported by their manual labor and the duty of labor was strenuously recommended as a penance as an exercise and as the most laudable means of securing their daily subsistence fifty one The garden and fields which the industry of the monks had often rescued from the forest or the morass were diligently cultivated by their hands They performed without reluctance the menial offices of slaves and domestics and the several trades that were necessary to provide their habits their utensils and their lodging were exercised within the precincts of the great monasteries The monastic studies have tended for the most part to darken rather than to dispel the cloud of superstition Yet the curiosity or zeal of some learned solitaries has cultivated the ecclesiastical and even the profane sciences and posterity must gratefully acknowledge that the monuments of Greek and Roman literature have been preserved and multiplied by their indefatigable pens fifty two But the more humble industry of the monks especially in Egypt was contented with the silent sedentary occupation of making wooden sandals or of twisting the leaves of the palm tree into mats and baskets The superfluous stock which was not consumed in domestic use supplied by trade the wants of the community the boats of Tabenne and the other monasteries of Thebais descended the Nile as far as Alexandria and in a Christian market

Chrysostom and Augustin to Homer and Virgil But the necessity of manual labor was insensibly superseded The novice was tempted to bestow his fortune on the saints in whose society he was resolved to spend the remainder of his life and the pernicious indulgence of the laws permitted him to receive for their use any future accessions of legacy or inheritance fifty three Melania contributed her plate three hundred pounds weight of silver and Paula contracted an immense debt for the relief of their favorite monks who kindly imparted the merits of their prayers and penance to a rich and liberal sinner fifty four Time continually increased and accidents could seldom diminish the estates of the popular monasteries which spread over the adjacent country and cities and in the first century of their institution the infidel Zosimus has maliciously observed that for the benefit of the poor the Christian monks had reduced a great part of mankind to a state of beggary fifty five As long as they maintained their original fervor they approved themselves however the faithful and benevolent stewards of the charity which was entrusted to their care But their discipline was corrupted by prosperity they gradually assumed the pride of wealth and at last indulged the luxury of expense Their public luxury might be excused by the magnificence of religious worship and the decent motive of erecting durable habitations for an immortal society But every age of the church has accused the licentiousness of the degenerate monks who no longer remembered the object of their institution embraced the vain and sensual pleasures of the world which they had renounced fifty six and scandalously abused the riches which had been acquired by the austere virtues of their founders fifty seven

penance and solitude undisturbed by the various occupations which fill the time and exercise the faculties of reasonable active and social beings Whenever they were permitted to step beyond the precincts of the monastery two jealous companions were the mutual guards and spies of each other s actions and after their return they were condemned to forget or at least to suppress whatever they had seen or heard in the world Strangers who professed the orthodox faith were hospitably entertained in a separate apartment but their dangerous conversation was restricted to some chosen elders of approved discretion and fidelity Except in their presence the monastic slave might not receive the visits of his friends or kindred and it was deemed highly meritorious if he afflicted a tender sister or an aged parent by the obstinate refusal of a word or look fifty eight The monks themselves passed their lives without personal attachments among a crowd which had been formed by accident and was detained in the same prison by force or prejudice Recluse fanatics have few ideas or sentiments to communicate a special license of the abbot regulated the time and duration of their familiar visits and at their silent meals they were enveloped in their cowls inaccessible and almost invisible to each other fifty nine Study is the resource of solitude but education had not prepared and qualified for any liberal studies the mechanics and peasants who filled the monastic communities They might work but the vanity of spiritual perfection was tempted to disdain the exercise of manual labor and the industry must be faint and languid which is not excited by the sense of personal interest Footnote fifty eight Pior an Egyptian monk allowed his sister to see him but he shut his eyes during the

which are seldom clouded in the serene sky of Egypt and a rustic horn or trumpet the signal of devotion twice interrupted the vast silence of the desert sixty Even sleep the last refuge of the unhappy was rigorously measured the vacant hours of the monk heavily rolled along without business or pleasure and before the close of each day he had repeatedly accused the tedious progress of the sun sixty one In this comfortless state superstition still pursued and tormented her wretched votaries sixty two The repose which they had sought in the cloister was disturbed by a tardy repentance profane doubts and guilty desires and while they considered each natural impulse as an unpardonable sin they perpetually trembled on the edge of a flaming and bottomless abyss From the painful struggles of disease and despair these unhappy victims were sometimes relieved by madness or death and in the sixth century a hospital was founded at Jerusalem for a small portion of the austere penitents who were deprived of their senses sixty three Their visions before they attained this extreme and acknowledged term of frenzy have afforded ample materials of supernatural history It was their firm persuasion that the air which they breathed was peopled with invisible enemies with innumerable demons who watched every occasion and assumed every form to terrify and above all to tempt their unguarded virtue The imagination and even the senses were deceived by the illusions of distempered fanaticism and the hermit whose midnight prayer was oppressed by involuntary slumber might easily confound the phantoms of horror or delight which had occupied his sleeping and his waking dreams sixty four Footnote sixty The diurnal and nocturnal prayers of the monks are copiously discussed by Cassian in the

demons were grown less active and numerous since the time of saint Antony Rosweyde s copious index to the Vitae Patrum will point out a variety of infernal scenes The devils were most formidable in a

most devout or the most ambitious of the spiritual brethren renounced the convent as they had renounced the world The fervent monasteries of Egypt Palestine and Syria were surrounded by a Laura sixty six a distant circle of solitary cells and the extravagant penance of Hermits was stimulated by applause and emulation sixty seven They sunk under the painful weight of crosses and chains and their emaciated limbs were confined by collars bracelets gauntlets and greaves of massy and rigid iron All superfluous encumbrance of dress they contemptuously cast away and some savage saints of both sexes have been admired whose naked bodies were only covered by their long hair They aspired to reduce themselves to the rude and miserable state in which the human brute is scarcely distinguishable above his kindred animals and the numerous sect of Anachorets derived their name from their humble practice of grazing in the fields of Mesopotamia with the common herd sixty eight They often usurped the den of some wild beast whom they affected to resemble they buried themselves in some gloomy cavern which art or nature had scooped out of the rock and the marble quarries of Thebais are still

Simeon Stylites seventy have been immortalized by the singular invention of an aerial penance At the age of thirteen the young Syrian deserted the profession of a shepherd and threw himself into an austere monastery After a long and painful novitiate in which Simeon was repeatedly saved from pious suicide he established his residence on a mountain about thirty or forty miles to the east of Antioch Within the space of a mandra or circle of stones to which he had attached himself by a ponderous chain he ascended a column which was successively raised from the height of nine to that of sixty feet from the ground seventy one In this last and lofty station the Syrian Anachoret resisted the heat of thirty summers and the cold of as many winters Habit and exercise instructed him to maintain his dangerous situation without fear or giddiness and successively to assume the different postures of devotion He sometimes prayed in an erect attitude with his outstretched arms in the figure of a cross but his most familiar practice was that of bending his meagre skeleton from the forehead to the feet and a curious spectator after numbering twelve hundred and forty four repetitions at length desisted from the endless account The progress of an ulcer in his thigh seventy two might shorten but it could not disturb this celestial life and the patient Hermit expired without descending from his column A prince who should capriciously inflict such tortures would be deemed a tyrant but it would surpass the power of a tyrant to impose a long and miserable existence on the reluctant victims of his cruelty This voluntary martyrdom must have gradually destroyed the sensibility both of the mind and body nor can it be presumed that the fanatics who torment themselves are susceptible of any lively affection for the rest of mankind A cruel unfeeling temper has distinguiseed the monks of every age and country their stern indifference which is seldom mollified by personal friendship is inflamed by religious hatred and their merciless zeal has strenuously administered the holy office of the Inquisition Footnote seventy See Theodoret in Vit Patrum l ix p eight hundred

Evagrius assigns for the summit of the column is inconsistent with reason with facts and with the rules of architecture The people who saw it from below might be easily deceived Footnote seventy two I must not conceal a piece of ancient scandal concerning the origin of this ulcer It has been reported that the Devil assuming an angelic form invited him to ascend like Elijah into a fiery chariot The saint too hastily raised his foot and Satan seized the moment of inflicting this chastisement on his vanity The monastic saints who excite only the contempt and pity of a philosopher were respected and almost adored by the prince and people Successive crowds of pilgrims from Gaul and India saluted the divine pillar of Simeon the tribes of Saracens disputed in arms the honor of his benediction the queens of Arabia and Persia gratefully confessed his supernatural virtue and the angelic Hermit was consulted by the younger Theodosius in the most important concerns of the church and state His remains were transported from the mountain of Telenissa by a solemn procession of the patriarch the master general of the East six bishops twenty one counts or tribunes and six thousand soldiers and Antioch revered his bones as her glorious ornament and impregnable defence The fame of the apostles and martyrs was gradually eclipsed by these recent and popular Anachorets the Christian world fell prostrate before their shrines and the miracles ascribed to their relics exceeded at least in number and duration the spiritual exploits of their lives But the golden legend of their lives seventy three was embellished by the artful credulity of their interested brethren and a believing age was easily persuaded that the slightest caprice of an Egyptian or a Syrian monk had been sufficient to interrupt the eternal laws of the universe The favorites of Heaven were accustomed to cure inveterate diseases with a touch a word or a distant message and to expel the most obstinate demons from the souls or bodies which they possessed They familiarly accosted or imperiously commanded the lions and serpents of the desert infused vegetation into a sapless trunk suspended iron on the surface of the water passed the Nile on the back of a crocodile and refreshed themselves in a fiery furnace These extravagant tales which display the fiction without the genius of poetry have seriously affected the reason the faith and the morals of the Christians Their credulity debased and vitiated the faculties of the mind they corrupted the evidence of history and superstition gradually extinguished the hostile light of philosophy and science Every mode of religious worship which had been practised by the saints every mysterious doctrine which they believed was fortified by the sanction of divine revelation and all the manly virtues were oppressed by the servile and pusillanimous reign of the monks If it be possible to measure the interval between the philosophic writings of Cicero and the sacred legend of Theodoret between the character of Cato and that of Simeon we may appreciate the memorable revolution which was accomplished in the Roman empire within a period of five hundred years Footnote seventy three I know not how to select or specify the miracles contained in the Vitae Patrum of Rosweyde as the number very much exceeds the thousand pages of that voluminous work An elegant specimen may be found in the dialogues of Sulpicius Severus and his Life of saint Martin He reveres the monks of Egypt yet he insults them with the remark that they never raised the dead whereas the bishop of Tours had restored three dead men to life II The progress of Christianity has been marked by two glorious and decisive victories over the learned and luxurious citizens of the Roman empire and over the warlike Barbarians of Scythia and Germany who subverted the empire and embraced the religion of the Romans The Goths were the foremost of these savage proselytes and the nation was indebted for its conversion to a countryman or at least to a subject worthy to be ranked among the inventors of useful arts who have deserved the remembrance and gratitude of posterity A great number of Roman provincials had been led away into captivity by the Gothic bands who ravaged Asia in the time of Gallienus and of these captives many were Christians and several belonged to the ecclesiastical order Those involuntary missionaries dispersed as slaves in the villages of Dacia successively labored for the salvation of their masters The seeds which they planted of the evangelic doctrine were gradually propagated and before the end of a century the pious work was achieved by the labors of Ulphilas whose ancestors had been transported beyond the Danube from a small town of Cappadocia Ulphilas the bishop and apostle of the Goths seventy four acquired their love and reverence by his blameless life and indefatigable zeal and they received with implicit confidence the doctrines of truth and virtue which he preached and practised He executed the arduous task of translating the Scriptures into their native tongue a dialect of the German or Teutonic language but he prudently suppressed the four books of Kings as they might tend to irritate the fierce and sanguinary spirit of the Barbarians The rude imperfect idiom of soldiers and shepherds so ill qualified to communicate any spiritual ideas was improved and modulated by his genius and Ulphilas before he could frame his version was obliged to compose a new alphabet of twenty four letters seven hundred forty one four of which he invented to express the peculiar sounds that were unknown to the Greek and Latin pronunciation seventy five But the prosperous state of the Gothic church was soon afflicted by war and intestine discord and the chieftains were divided by religion as well as by interest Fritigern the friend of the Romans became the proselyte of Ulphilas while the haughty soul of Athanaric disdained the yoke of the empire and of the gospel The faith of the new converts was tried by the persecution which he excited A wagon bearing aloft the shapeless image of Thor perhaps or of Woden was conducted in solemn procession through the streets of the camp and the rebels who refused to worship the god of their fathers were immediately burnt with their tents and families The character of Ulphilas recommended him to the esteem of the Eastern court where he twice appeared as the minister of peace he pleaded the cause of the distressed Goths who implored the protection of Valens and the name of Moses was applied to this spiritual guide who conducted his people through the deep waters of the Danube to the Land of Promise seventy six The devout shepherds who were attached to his person and tractable to his voice acquiesced in their settlement at the foot of the Maesian mountains in a country of woodlands and pastures which supported their flocks and herds and enabled them to purchase the corn and wine of the more plentiful provinces These harmless Barbarians multiplied in obscure peace and the profession of Christianity seventy seven Footnote seventy four On the subject of Ulphilas and the conversion of the Goths see Sozomen l vi c thirty seven Socrates l iv c thirty three Theodoret l iv c thirty seven Philostorg l ii c five The heresy of Philostorgius appears to have given him superior means of information Footnote seven hundred forty one This is the Moeso Gothic alphabet of which many of the letters are evidently formed from the Greek and Roman M saint Martin however contends that it is impossible but that some written alphabet must have been known long before among the Goths He supposes that their former letters were those inscribed on the runes which being inseparably connected with the old idolatrous superstitions were proscribed by the Christian missionaries Everywhere the runes so common among all the German tribes disappear after the propagation of Christianity S Martin iv p ninety seven ninety eight M Footnote seventy five A mutilated copy of the four Gospels in the Gothic version was published A D sixteen sixty five and is

populus immensus cum suo Pontifice ipsoque primate Wulfila The last words if they are not mere tautology imply some temporal jurisdiction Their fiercer brethren the formidable Visigoths universally adopted the religion of the Romans with whom they maintained a perpetual intercourse of war of friendship or of conquest In their long and victorious march from the Danube to the Atlantic Ocean they converted their allies they educated the rising generation and the devotion which reigned in the camp of Alaric or the court of Thoulouse might edify or disgrace the palaces of Rome and Constantinople seventy eight During the same period Christianity was embraced by almost all the Barbarians who established their kingdoms on the ruins of the Western empire the Burgundians in Gaul the Suevi in Spain the Vandals in Africa the Ostrogoths in Pannonia and the various bands of mercenaries that raised Odoacer to the throne of Italy The Franks and the Saxons still persevered in the errors of Paganism but the Franks obtained the monarchy of Gaul by their submission to the example of Clovis and the Saxon conquerors of Britain were reclaimed from their savage superstition by the missionaries of Rome These Barbarian proselytes displayed an ardent and successful zeal in the propagation of the faith The Merovingian kings and their successors Charlemagne and the Othos extended by their laws and victories the dominion of the cross England produced the apostle of Germany and the evangelic light was gradually diffused from the neighborhood of the Rhine to the nations of the Elbe the Vistula and the Baltic seventy nine Footnote seventy eight At non ita Gothi non ita Vandali malis licet doctoribus instituti meliores tamen etiam in hac parte quam nostri Salvian de Gubern Dei l vii p two hundred forty three Footnote seventy nine Mosheim has slightly sketched the progress of Christianity in the North from the fourth to the fourteenth century The subject would afford materials for an ecclesiastical and even philosophical history Chapter XXXVII Conversion Of The Barbarians To Christianity Part III The different motives which influenced the reason or the passions of the Barbarian converts cannot easily be ascertained They were often capricious and accidental a dream an omen the report of a miracle the example of some priest or hero the charms of a believing wife and above all the fortunate event of a prayer or vow which in a moment of danger they had addressed to the God of the Christians eighty The early prejudices of education were insensibly erased by the habits of frequent and familiar society the moral precepts of the gospel were protected by the extravagant virtues of the monks and a spiritual theology was supported by the visible power of relics and the pomp of religious worship But the rational and ingenious mode of persuasion which a Saxon bishop eighty one suggested to a popular saint might sometimes be employed by the missionaries who labored for the conversion of infidels Admit says the sagacious disputant whatever they are pleased to assert of the fabulous and carnal genealogy of their gods and goddesses who are propagated from each other From this principle deduce their imperfect nature and human infirmities the assurance they were born and the probability that they will die At what time by what means from what cause were the eldest of the gods or goddesses produced Do they still continue or have they ceased to propagate If they have ceased summon your antagonists to declare the reason of this strange alteration If they still continue the number of the gods must become infinite and shall we not risk by the indiscreet worship of some impotent deity to excite the resentment of his jealous superior The visible heavens and earth the whole system of the universe which may be conceived by the mind is it created or eternal If created how or where could the gods themselves exist before creation If eternal how could they assume the empire of an independent and preexisting world Urge these arguments with temper and moderation insinuate at seasonable intervals the truth and beauty of the Christian revelation and endeavor to make the unbelievers ashamed without making them angry This metaphysical reasoning too refined perhaps for the Barbarians of Germany was fortified by the grosser weight of authority and popular consent The advantage of temporal prosperity had deserted the Pagan cause and passed over to the service of Christianity The Romans themselves the most powerful and enlightened nation of the globe had renounced their ancient superstition and if the ruin of their empire seemed to accuse the efficacy of the new faith the disgrace was already retrieved by the conversion of the victorious Goths The valiant and fortunate Barbarians who subdued the provinces of the West successively received and reflected the same edifying example Before the age of Charlemagne the Christian nations of Europe might exult in the exclusive possession of the temperate climates of the fertile lands which produced corn wine and oil while the savage idolaters and their helpless idols were confined to the extremities of the earth the dark and frozen regions of the North eighty two Footnote eighty To such a cause has Socrates l vii c thirty ascribed the conversion of the Burgundians whose Christian piety is celebrated by Orosius l vii c nineteen Footnote eighty one See an original and curious epistle from Daniel the first bishop of Winchester Beda Hist Eccles Anglorum l v c eighteen p two hundred three edit Smith to saint Boniface who preached the gospel among the savages of Hesse and Thuringia Epistol Bonifacii lxvii in the Maxima Bibliotheca Patrum tom xiii p ninety three Footnote eighty two The sword of Charlemagne added weight to the argument but when Daniel wrote this epistle A D seven hundred twenty three the Mahometans who reigned from India to Spain might have retorted it against the Christians Christianity which opened the gates of Heaven to the Barbarians introduced an important change in their moral and political condition They received at the same time the use of letters so essential to a religion whose doctrines are contained in a sacred book and while they studied the divine truth their minds were insensibly enlarged by the distant view of history of nature of the arts and of society The version of the Scriptures into their native tongue which had facilitated their conversion must excite among their clergy some curiosity to read the original text to understand the sacred liturgy of the church and to examine in the writings of the fathers the chain of ecclesiastical tradition These spiritual gifts were preserved in the Greek and Latin languages which concealed the inestimable monuments of ancient learning The immortal productions of Virgil Cicero and Livy which were accessible to the Christian Barbarians maintained a silent intercourse between the reign of Augustus and the times of Clovis and Charlemagne The emulation of mankind was encouraged by the remembrance of a more perfect state and the flame of science was secretly kept alive to warm and enlighten the mature age of the Western world In the most corrupt state of Christianity the Barbarians might learn justice from the law and mercy from the gospel and if the knowledge of their duty was insufficient to guide their actions or to regulate their passions they were sometimes restrained by conscience and frequently punished by remorse But the direct authority of religion was less effectual than the holy communion which united them with their Christian brethren in spiritual friendship The influence of these sentiments contributed to secure their fidelity in the service or the alliance of the Romans to alleviate the horrors of war to moderate the insolence of conquest and to preserve in the downfall of the empire a permanent respect for the name and institutions of Rome In the days of Paganism the priests of Gaul and Germany reigned over the people and controlled the jurisdiction of the magistrates and the zealous proselytes transferred an equal or more ample measure of devout obedience to the pontiffs of the Christian faith The sacred character of the bishops was supported by their temporal possessions they obtained an honorable seat in the legislative assemblies of soldiers and freemen and it was their interest as well as their duty to mollify by peaceful counsels the fierce spirit of the Barbarians The perpetual correspondence of the Latin clergy the frequent pilgrimages to Rome and Jerusalem and the growing authority of the popes cemented the union of the Christian republic and gradually produced the similar manners and common jurisprudence which have distinguished from the rest of mankind the independent and even hostile nations of modern Europe But the operation of these causes was checked and retarded by the unfortunate accident which infused a deadly poison into the cup of Salvation Whatever might be the early sentiments of Ulphilas his connections with the empire and the church were formed during the reign of Arianism The apostle of the Goths subscribed the creed of Rimini professed with freedom and perhaps with sincerity that the Son was not equal or consubstantial to the Father eighty three communicated these errors to the clergy and people and infected the Barbaric world with a heresy eighty four which the great Theodosius proscribed and extinguished among the Romans The temper and understanding of the new proselytes were not adapted to metaphysical subtilties but they strenuously maintained what they had piously received as the pure and genuine doctrines of Christianity The advantage of preaching and expounding the Scriptures in the Teutonic language promoted the apostolic labors of Ulphilas and his successors and they ordained a competent number of bishops and presbyters for the instruction of the kindred tribes The Ostrogoths the Burgundians the Suevi and the Vandals who had listened to the eloquence of the Latin clergy eighty five preferred the more intelligible lessons of their domestic teachers and Arianism was adopted as the national faith of the warlike converts who were seated on the ruins of the Western empire This irreconcilable difference of religion was a perpetual source of jealousy and hatred and the reproach of Barbarian was imbittered by the more odious epithet of Heretic The heroes of the North who had submitted with some reluctance to believe that all their ancestors were in hell eighty six were astonished and exasperated to learn that they themselves had only changed the mode of their eternal condemnation Instead of the smooth applause which Christian kings are accustomed to expect from their royal prelates the orthodox bishops and their clergy were in a state of opposition to the Arian courts and their indiscreet opposition frequently became criminal and might sometimes be dangerous eighty seven The pulpit that safe and sacred organ of sedition resounded with the names of Pharaoh and Holofernes eighty eight the public discontent was inflamed by the hope or promise of a glorious deliverance and the seditious saints were tempted to promote the accomplishment of their own predictions Notwithstanding these provocations the Catholics of Gaul Spain and Italy enjoyed under the reign of the Arians the free and peaceful exercise of their religion Their haughty masters respected the zeal of a numerous people resolved to die at the foot of their altars and the example of their devout constancy was admired and imitated by the Barbarians themselves The conquerors evaded however the disgraceful reproach or confession of fear by attributing their toleration to the liberal motives of reason and humanity and while they affected the language they imperceptiby imbibed the spirit of genuine Christianity Footnote eighty three The opinions of Ulphilas and the Goths inclined to semi Arianism since they would not say that the Son was a creature though they held communion with those who maintained that heresy Their apostle represented the whole controversy as a question of trifling moment which had been raised by the passions of the clergy Theodoret l iv c thirty seven Footnote eighty four The Arianism of the Goths has been imputed to the emperor Valens Itaque justo Dei judicio ipsi eum vivum incenderunt qui propter eum etiam mortui vitio erroris arsuri sunt Orosius l vii c thirty three p five hundred fifty four This cruel sentence

Visigotha and of Avitus bishop of Vienna under the Burgundians explain sometimes in dark hints the general dispositions of the Catholics The history of Clovis and Theodoric will suggest some particular facts Footnote eighty eight Genseric confessed the resemblance by the severity with which he punished such indiscreet allusions Victor Vitensis l seven p ten The peace of the church was sometimes interrupted The Catholics were indiscreet the Barbarians were impatient and the partial acts of severity or injustice which had been recommended by the Arian clergy were exaggerated by the orthodox writers The guilt of persecution may be imputed to Euric king of the Visigoths who suspended the exercise of ecclesiastical or at least of episcopal functions and punished the popular bishops of Aquitain with imprisonment exile and confiscation eighty nine But the cruel and absurd enterprise of subduing the minds of a whole people was undertaken by the Vandals alone Genseric himself in his early youth had renounced the orthodox communion and the apostate could neither grant nor expect a sincere forgiveness He was exasperated to find that the Africans who had fled before him in the field still presumed to dispute his will in synods and churches and his ferocious mind was incapable of fear or of compassion His Catholic subjects were oppressed by intolerant laws and arbitrary punishments The language of Genseric was furious and formidable the knowledge of his intentions might justify the most unfavorable interpretation of his actions and the Arians were reproached with the frequent executions which stained the palace and the dominions of the tyrant Arms and ambition were however the ruling passions of the monarch of the sea But Hunneric his inglorious son who seemed to inherit only his vices tormented the Catholics with the same unrelenting fury which had been fatal to his brother his nephews and the friends and favorites of his father and even to the Arian patriarch who was inhumanly burnt alive in the midst of Carthage The religious war was preceded and prepared by an insidious truce persecution was made the serious and important business of the Vandal court and the loathsome disease which hastened the death of Hunneric revenged the injuries without contributing to the deliverance of the church The throne of Africa was successively filled by the two nephews of Hunneric by Gundamund who reigned about twelve and by Thrasimund who governed the nation about twenty seven years Their administration was hostile and oppressive to the orthodox party Gundamund appeared to emulate or even to surpass the cruelty of his uncle and if at length he relented if he recalled the bishops and restored the freedom of Athanasian worship a premature death intercepted the benefits of his tardy clemency His brother Thrasimund was the greatest and most accomplished of the Vandal kings whom he excelled in beauty prudence and magnanimity of soul But this magnanimous character was degraded by his intolerant zeal and deceitful clemency Instead of threats and tortures he employed the gentle but efficacious powers of seduction Wealth dignity and the royal favor were the liberal rewards of apostasy the Catholics who had violated the laws might purchase their pardon by the renunciation of their faith and whenever Thrasimund meditated any rigorous measure he patiently waited till the indiscretion of his adversaries furnished him with a specious opportunity Bigotry was his last sentiment in the hour of death and he exacted from his successor a solemn oath that he would never tolerate the sectaries of Athanasius But his successor Hilderic the gentle son of the savage Hunneric preferred the duties of humanity and justice to the vain obligation of an impious oath and his accession was gloriously marked by the restoration of peace and universal freedom The throne of that virtuous though feeble monarch was usurped by his cousin Gelimer a zealous Arian but the Vandal kingdom before he could enjoy or abuse his power was subverted by the arms of Belisarius and the orthodox party retaliated the injuries which they had endured ninety Footnote

sixteen ninety four The passionate declamations of the Catholics the sole historians of this persecution cannot afford any distinct series of causes and events any impartial view of the characters or counsels but the most remarkable circumstances that deserve either credit or notice may be referred to the following heads I In the original law which is still extant ninety one Hunneric expressly declares and the declaration appears to be correct that he had faithfully transcribed the regulations and penalties of the Imperial edicts against the heretical congregations the clergy and the people who dissented from the established religion If the rights of conscience had been understood the Catholics must have condemned their past conduct or acquiesced in their actual suffering But they still persisted to refuse the indulgence which they claimed While they trembled under the lash of persecution they praised the laudable severity of Hunneric himself who burnt or banished great numbers of Manichaeans ninety two and they rejected with horror the ignominious compromise that the disciples of Arius and of Athanasius should enjoy a reciprocal and similar toleration in the territories of the Romans and in those of the Vandals ninety three II The practice of a conference which the Catholics had so frequently used to insult and punish their obstinate antagonists was retorted against themselves ninety four At the command of Hunneric four hundred and sixty six orthodox bishops assembled at Carthage but when they were admitted into the hall of audience they had the mortification of beholding the Arian Cyrila exalted on the patriarchal throne The disputants were separated after the mutual and ordinary reproaches of noise and silence of delay and precipitation of military force and of popular clamor One martyr and one confessor were selected among the Catholic bishops twenty eight escaped by flight and eighty eight by conformity forty six were sent into Corsica to cut timber for the royal navy and three hundred and two were banished to the different parts of Africa exposed to the insults of their enemies and carefully deprived of all the temporal and spiritual comforts of life ninety five The hardships of ten years exile must have reduced their numbers and if they had complied with the law of Thrasimund which prohibited any episcopal consecrations the orthodox church of Africa must have expired with the lives of its actual members They disobeyed and their disobedience was punished by a second exile of two hundred and twenty bishops into Sardinia where they languished fifteen years till the accession of the gracious Hilderic ninety six The two islands were judiciously chosen by the malice of their Arian tyrants Seneca from his own experience has deplored and exaggerated the miserable state of Corsica ninety seven and the plenty of Sardinia was overbalanced by the unwholesome quality of the air ninety eight III The zeal of Generic and his successors for the conversion of the Catholics must have rendered them still more jealous to guard the purity of the Vandal faith Before the churches were finally shut it was a crime to appear in a Barbarian dress and those who presumed to neglect the royal mandate were rudely dragged backwards by their long hair ninety nine The palatine officers who refused to profess the religion of their prince were ignominiously stripped of their honors and employments banished to Sardinia and Sicily or condemned to the servile labors of slaves and peasants in the fields of Utica In the districts which had been peculiarly allotted to the Vandals the exercise of the Catholic worship was more strictly prohibited and severe penalties were denounced against the guilt both of the missionary and the proselyte By these arts the faith of the Barbarians was preserved and their zeal was inflamed they discharged with devout fury the office of spies informers or executioners and whenever their cavalry took the field it was the favorite amusement of the march to defile the churches and to insult the clergy of the adverse faction one hundred IV The citizens who had been educated in the luxury of the Roman province were delivered with exquisite cruelty to the Moors of the desert A venerable train of bishops presbyters and deacons with a faithful crowd of four thousand and ninety six persons whose guilt is not precisely ascertained were torn from their native homes by the command of Hunneric During the night they were confined like a herd of cattle amidst their own ordure during the day they pursued their march over the burning sands and if they fainted under the heat and fatigue they were goaded or dragged along till they expired in the hands of their tormentors one hundred one These unhappy exiles when they reached the Moorish huts might excite the compassion of a people whose native humanity was neither improved by reason nor corrupted by fanaticism but if they escaped the dangers they were condemned to share the distress of a savage life V It is incumbent on the authors of persecution previously to reflect whether they are determined to support it in the last extreme They excite the flame which they strive to extinguish and it soon becomes necessary to chastise the contumacy as well as the crime of the offender The fine which he is unable or unwilling to discharge exposes his person to the severity of the law and his contempt of lighter penalties suggests the use and propriety of capital punishment Through the veil of fiction and declamation we may clearly perceive that the Catholics more especially under the reign of Hunneric endured the most cruel and ignominious treatment one hundred two Respectable citizens noble matrons and consecrated virgins were stripped naked and raised in the air by pulleys with a weight suspended at their feet In this painful attitude their naked bodies were torn with scourges or burnt in the most tender parts with red hot plates of iron The amputation of the ears the nose the tongue and the right hand was inflicted by the Arians and although the precise number cannot be defined it is evident that many persons among whom a bishop one hundred three and a proconsul one hundred four may be named were entitled to the crown of martyrdom The same honor has been ascribed to the memory of Count Sebastian who professed the Nicene creed with unshaken constancy and Genseric might detest as a heretic the brave and ambitious fugitive whom he dreaded as a rival one hundred five VI A new mode of conversion which might subdue the feeble and alarm the timorous was employed by the Arian ministers They imposed by fraud or violence the rites of baptism and punished the apostasy of the Catholics if they disclaimed this odious and profane ceremony which scandalously violated the freedom of the will and the unity of the sacrament one hundred six The hostile sects had formerly allowed the validity of each other s baptism and the innovation so fiercely maintained by the Vandals can be imputed only to the example and advice of the Donatists VII The Arian clergy surpassed in religious cruelty the king and his Vandals but they were incapable of cultivating the spiritual vineyard which they were so desirous to possess A patriarch one hundred seven might seat himself on the throne of Carthage some bishops in the principal cities might usurp the place of their rivals but the smallness of their numbers and their ignorance of the Latin language one hundred eight disqualified the Barbarians for the ecclesiastical ministry of a great church and the Africans after the loss of their orthodox pastors were deprived of the public exercise of Christianity VIII The emperors were the natural protectors of the Homoousian doctrine and the faithful people of Africa both as Romans and as Catholics preferred their lawful sovereignty to the usurpation of the Barbarous heretics During an interval of peace and friendship Hunneric restored the cathedral of Carthage at the intercession of Zeno who reigned in the East and of Placidia the daughter and relict of emperors and the sister of the queen of the Vandals one hundred nine But this decent regard was of short duration and the haughty tyrant displayed his contempt for the religion of the empire by studiously arranging the bloody images of persecution in all the principal streets through which the Roman ambassador must pass in his way to the palace one hundred ten An oath was required from the bishops who were assembled at Carthage that they would support the succession of his son Hilderic and that they would renounce all foreign or transmarine correspondence This engagement consistent as it should seem with their moral and religious duties was refused by the more sagacious members one hundred eleven of the assembly Their refusal faintly colored by the pretence that it is unlawful for a Christian to swear must provoke the suspicions of a jealous tyrant Footnote ninety one Victor iv two p sixty five Hunneric refuses the name of Catholics to the Homoousians He describes as the veri Divinae Majestatis cultores his own

learning With the same weapons which the Greek one hundred twelve and Latin fathers had already provided for the Arian controversy they repeatedly silenced or vanquished the fierce and illiterate successors of Ulphilas The consciousness of their own superiority might have raised them above the arts and passions of religious warfare Yet instead of assuming such honorable pride the orthodox theologians were tempted by the assurance of impunity to compose fictions which must be stigmatized with the epithets of fraud and forgery They ascribed their own polemical works to the most venerable names of Christian antiquity the characters of Athanasius and Augustin were awkwardly personated by Vigilius and his disciples one hundred thirteen and the famous creed which so clearly expounds the mysteries of the Trinity and the Incarnation is deduced with strong probability from this African school one hundred fourteen Even the Scriptures themselves were profaned by their rash and sacrilegious hands The memorable text which asserts the unity of the three who bear witness in heaven one hundred fifteen is condemned by the universal silence of the orthodox fathers ancient versions and authentic manuscripts one hundred sixteen It was first alleged by the Catholic bishops whom Hunneric summoned to the conference of Carthage one hundred seventeen An allegorical interpretation in

defended the truth and justice of their cause may be ascribed with more reason to their own industry than to the visible protection of Heaven Yet the historian who views this religious conflict with an impartial eye may condescend to mention one preternatural event which will edify the devout and surprise the incredulous Tipasa one hundred twenty one a maritime colony of Mauritania sixteen miles to the east of Caesarea had been distinguished in every age by the orthodox zeal of its inhabitants They had braved the fury of the Donatists one hundred twenty two they resisted or eluded the tyranny of the Arians The town was deserted on the approach of an heretical bishop most of the inhabitants who could procure ships passed over to the coast of Spain and the unhappy remnant refusing all communion with the usurper still presumed to hold their pious but illegal assemblies Their disobedience exasperated the cruelty of Hunneric A military count was despatched from Carthage to Tipasa he collected the Catholics in the Forum and in the presence of the whole province deprived the guilty of their right hands and their tongues But the holy confessors continued to speak without tongues and this miracle is attested by Victor an African bishop who published a history of the persecution within two years after the event one hundred twenty three If any one says Victor should doubt of the truth let him repair to Constantinople and listen to the clear and perfect language of Restitutus the sub deacon one of these glorious sufferers who is now lodged in the palace of the emperor Zeno and is respected by the devout empress At Constantinople we are astonished to find a cool a learned and unexceptionable witness without interest and without passion Aeneas of Gaza a Platonic philosopher has accurately described his own observations on these African sufferers I saw them myself I heard them speak I diligently inquired by what means such an articulate voice could be formed without any organ of speech I used my eyes to examine the report of my ears I opened their mouth and saw that the whole tongue had been completely torn away by the roots an operation which the physicians generally suppose to be mortal one hundred twenty four The testimony of Aeneas of Gaza might be confirmed by the superfluous evidence of the emperor Justinian in a perpetual edict of Count Marcellinus in his Chronicle of the times and of Pope Gregory the First who had resided at Constantinople as the minister of the Roman pontiff one hundred twenty five They all lived within the compass of a century and they all appeal to their personal knowledge or the public notoriety for the truth of a miracle which was repeated in several instances displayed on the greatest theatre of the world and submitted during a series of years to the calm examination of the senses This supernatural gift of the African confessors who spoke without tongues will command the assent of those and of those only who already believe that their language was pure and orthodox But the stubborn mind of an infidel is guarded by secret incurable suspicion and the Arian or Socinian who has seriously rejected the

persevered in the profession of Arianism till the final ruin of the kingdoms which they had founded in Africa and Italy The Barbarians of Gaul submitted to the orthodox dominion of the Franks and Spain was restored to the Catholic church by the voluntary conversion of the Visigoths This salutary revolution one hundred twenty six was hastened by the example of a royal martyr whom our calmer reason may style an ungrateful rebel Leovigild the Gothic monarch of Spain deserved the respect of his enemies and the love of his subjects the Catholics enjoyed a free toleration and his Arian synods attempted without much success to reconcile their scruples by abolishing the unpopular rite of a second baptism His eldest son Hermenegild who was invested by his father with the royal diadem and the fair principality of Boetica contracted an honorable and orthodox alliance with a Merovingian princess the daughter of Sigebert king of Austrasia and of the famous Brunechild The beauteous Ingundis who was no more than thirteen years of age was received beloved and persecuted in the Arian court of Toledo and her religious constancy was alternately assaulted with blandishments and violence by Goisvintha the Gothic queen who abused the double claim of maternal authority one hundred twenty seven Incensed by her resistance Goisvintha seized the Catholic princess by her long hair inhumanly dashed her against the ground kicked her till she was covered with blood and at last gave orders that she should be stripped and thrown into a basin or fish pond one hundred twenty eight Love and honor might excite Hermenegild to resent this injurious treatment of his bride and he was gradually persuaded that Ingundis suffered for the cause of divine truth Her tender complaints and the weighty arguments of Le ander archbishop of Seville accomplished his conversion and the heir of the Gothic monarchy was initiated in the Nicene faith by the solemn rites of confirmation one hundred twenty nine The rash youth inflamed by zeal and perhaps by ambition was tempted to violate the duties of a son and a subject and the Catholics of Spain although they could not complain of persecution applauded his pious rebellion against an heretical father The civil war was protracted by the long and obstinate sieges of Merida Cordova and Seville which had strenuously espoused the party of Hermenegild He invited the orthodox Barbarians the Seuvi and the Franks to the destruction of his native land he solicited the dangerous aid of the Romans who possessed Africa and a part of the Spanish coast and his holy ambassador the archbishop Leander effectually negotiated in person with the Byzantine court But the hopes of the Catholics were crushed by the active diligence of the monarch who commanded the troops and treasures of Spain and the guilty Hermenegild after his vain attempts to resist or to escape was compelled to surrender himself into the hands of an incensed father Leovigild was still mindful of that sacred character and the rebel despoiled of the regal ornaments was still permitted in a decent exile to profess the Catholic religion His repeated and unsuccessful treasons at length provoked the indignation of the Gothic king and the sentence of death which he pronounced with apparent reluctance was privately executed in the tower of Seville The inflexible constancy with which he refused to accept the Arian communion as the price of his safety may excuse the honors that have been paid to the memory of saint Hermenegild His wife and infant son were detained by the Romans in ignominious captivity and this domestic misfortune tarnished the glories of Leovigild and imbittered the last moments of his life Footnote one hundred twenty six See the

prerogatives both visible and invisible See Chardon Hist des Sacremens tom one p four hundred five five hundred fifty two His son and successor Recared the first Catholic king of Spain had imbibed the faith of his unfortunate brother which he supported with more prudence and success Instead of revolting against his father Recared patiently expected the hour of his death Instead of condemning his memory he piously supposed that the dying monarch had abjured the errors of Arianism and recommended to his son the conversion of the Gothic nation To accomplish that salutary end Recared convened an assembly of the Arian clergy and nobles declared himself a Catholic and exhorted them to imitate the example of their prince The laborious interpretation of doubtful texts or the curious pursuit of metaphysical arguments would have excited an endless controversy and the monarch discreetly proposed to his illiterate audience two substantial and visible arguments the testimony of Earth and of Heaven The Earth had submitted to the Nicene synod the Romans the Barbarians and the inhabitants of Spain unanimously professed the same orthodox creed and the Visigoths resisted almost alone the consent of the Christian world A superstitious age was prepared to reverence as the testimony of Heaven the preternatural cures which were performed by the skill or virtue of the Catholic clergy the baptismal fonts of Osset in Boetica one hundred thirty which were spontaneously replenished every year on the vigil of Easter one hundred thirty one and the miraculous shrine of saint Martin of Tours which had already converted the Suevic prince and people of Gallicia one hundred thirty two The Catholic king encountered some difficulties on this important change of the national religion A conspiracy secretly fomented by the queen dowager was formed against his life and two counts excited a dangerous revolt in the Narbonnese Gaul But Recared disarmed the conspirators defeated the rebels and executed severe justice which the Arians in their turn might brand with the reproach of persecution Eight bishops whose names betray their Barbaric origin abjured their errors and all the books of Arian theology were reduced to ashes with the house in which they had been purposely collected The whole body of the Visigoths and Suevi were allured or driven into the pale of the Catholic communion the faith at least of the rising generation was fervent and sincere and the devout liberality of the Barbarians enriched the churches and monasteries of Spain Seventy bishops assembled in the council of Toledo received the submission of their conquerors and the zeal of the Spaniards improved the Nicene creed by declaring the procession of the Holy Ghost from the Son as well as from the Father a weighty point of doctrine which produced long afterwards the schism of the Greek and Latin churches one hundred thirty three The royal proselyte immediately saluted and consulted Pope Gregory surnamed the Great a learned and holy prelate whose reign was distinguished by the conversion of heretics and infidels The ambassadors of Recared respectfully offered on the threshold of the Vatican his rich

future missionaries and many cities of Italy were still disputed by hostile bishops But the cause of Arianism was gradually suppressed by the weight of truth of interest and of example and the

who preached the gospel to the Barbarians appealed to the evidence of reason and claimed the benefit of toleration one hundred thirty six But no sooner had they established their spiritual dominion than they exhorted the Christian kings to extirpate without mercy the remains of Roman or Barbaric superstition The successors of Clovis inflicted one hundred lashes on the peasants who refused to destroy their idols the crime of sacrificing to the demons was punished by the Anglo Saxon laws with the heavier penalties of imprisonment and confiscation and even the wise Alfred adopted as an indispensable duty the extreme rigor of the Mosaic institutions one hundred thirty seven But the punishment and the crime were gradually abolished among a Christian people the theological disputes of the schools were suspended by propitious ignorance and the intolerant spirit which could find neither idolaters nor heretics was reduced to the persecution of the Jews That exiled nation had founded some synagogues in the cities of Gaul but Spain since the time of Hadrian was filled with their numerous colonies one hundred thirty eight The wealth which they accumulated by trade and the management of the finances invited the pious avarice of their masters and they might be oppressed without danger as they had lost the use and even the remembrance of arms Sisebut a Gothic king who reigned in the beginning of the seventh century proceeded at once to the last extremes of persecution one hundred thirty nine Ninety thousand Jews were compelled to receive the sacrament of baptism the fortunes of the obstinate infidels were confiscated their bodies were tortured and it seems doubtful whether they were permitted to abandon their native country The excessive zeal of the Catholic king was moderated even by the clergy of Spain who solemnly pronounced an inconsistent sentence that the sacraments should not be forcibly imposed but that the Jews who had been baptized should be constrained for the honor of the church to persevere in the external practice of a religion which they disbelieved and detested Their frequent relapses provoked one of the successors of Sisebut to banish the whole nation from his dominions and a council of Toledo published a decree that every Gothic king should swear to maintain this salutary edict But the tyrants were unwilling to dismiss the victims whom they delighted to torture or to deprive themselves of the industrious slaves over whom they might exercise a lucrative oppression The Jews still continued in Spain under the weight of the civil and ecclesiastical laws which in the same country have been faithfully transcribed in the Code of the Inquisition The Gothic kings and bishops at length discovered that injuries will produce hatred and that hatred will find the opportunity of revenge A nation the secret or professed enemies of Christianity still multiplied in servitude and distress and the intrigues of the Jews promoted the

unpopular heresy of Arius sunk into contempt and oblivion But the Greeks still retained their subtle and loquacious disposition the establishment of an obscure doctrine suggested new questions and new disputes and it was always in the power of an ambitious prelate or a fanatic monk to violate the peace of the church and perhaps of the empire The historian of the empire may overlook those disputes which were confined to the obscurity of schools and synods The Manichaeans who labored to reconcile the religions of Christ and of Zoroaster had secretly introduced themselves into the provinces but these foreign sectaries were involved in the common disgrace of the Gnostics and the Imperial laws were executed by the public hatred The rational opinions of the Pelagians were propagated from Britain to Rome Africa and Palestine and silently expired in a superstitious age But the East was distracted by the Nestorian and Eutychian controversies which attempted to explain the mystery of the incarnation and hastened the ruin of Christianity in her native land These controversies were first agitated under the reign of the younger Theodosius but their important consequences extend far beyond the limits of the present volume The metaphysical chain of argument the contests of ecclesiastical ambition and their political influence on the decline of the Byzantine empire may afford an interesting and instructive series of history from the general councils of Ephesus and Chalcedon to the conquest of the East by the successors of Mahomet Chapter XXXVIII Reign Of Clovis Part I Reign And Conversion Of Clovis His Victories Over The Alemanni Burgundians And Visigoths Establishment Of The French Monarchy In Gaul Laws Of The Barbarians State Of The Romans The Visigoths Of Spain Conquest Of Britain By The Saxons The Gauls one who impatiently supported the Roman yoke received a memorable lesson from one of the lieutenants of Vespasian whose weighty sense has been refined and expressed by the genius of Tacitus two The protection of the republic has delivered Gaul from internal discord and foreign invasions By the loss of national independence you have acquired the name and privileges of Roman citizens You enjoy in common with yourselves the permanent benefits of civil government and your remote situation is less exposed to the accidental mischiefs of tyranny Instead of exercising the rights of conquest we have been contented to impose such tributes as are requisite for your own preservation Peace cannot be secured without armies and armies must be supported at the expense of the people It is for your sake not for our own that we guard the barrier of the Rhine against the ferocious Germans who have so often attempted and who will always desire to exchange the solitude of their woods and morasses for the wealth and fertility of Gaul The fall of Rome would be fatal to the provinces and you would be buried in the ruins of that mighty fabric which has been raised by the valor and wisdom of eight hundred years Your imaginary freedom would be insulted and oppressed by a savage master and the expulsion of the Romans would be succeeded by the eternal hostilities of the Barbarian conquerors three This salutary advice was accepted and this strange prediction was accomplished In the space of four hundred years the hardy Gauls who had encountered the arms of Caesar were imperceptibly melted into the general mass of citizens and subjects the Western empire was dissolved and the Germans who had passed the Rhine fiercely contended for the possession of Gaul and excited the contempt or abhorrence of its peaceful and polished inhabitants With that conscious pride which the preeminence of knowledge and luxury seldom fails to inspire they derided the hairy and gigantic savages of the North their rustic manners dissonant joy voracious appetite and their horrid appearance equally disgusting to the sight and to the smell The liberal studies were still cultivated in the schools of Autun and Bordeaux and the language of Cicero and Virgil was familiar to the Gallic youth Their ears were astonished by the harsh and unknown sounds of the Germanic dialect and they ingeniously lamented that the trembling muses fled from the harmony of a Burgundian lyre The Gauls were endowed with all the advantages of art and nature but as they wanted courage to defend them they were justly condemned to obey and even to flatter the victorious Barbarians by whose clemency they held their precarious fortunes and their lives four Footnote one In this chapter I

Apollinaris ridicules with affected wit and pleasantry the hardships of his situation Carm xii in tom i p eight hundred eleven As soon as Odoacer had extinguished the Western empire he sought the friendship of the most powerful of the Barbarians The new sovereign of Italy resigned to Euric king of the Visigoths all the Roman conquests beyond the Alps as far as the Rhine and the Ocean five and the senate might confirm this liberal gift with some ostentation of power and without any real loss of revenue and dominion The lawful pretensions of Euric were justified by ambition and success and the Gothic nation might aspire under his command to the monarchy of Spain and Gaul Arles and Marseilles surrendered to his arms he oppressed the freedom of Auvergne and the bishop condescended to purchase his recall from exile by a tribute of just but reluctant praise Sidonius waited before the gates of the palace among a crowd of ambassadors and suppliants and their various business at the court of Bordeaux attested the power and the renown of the king of the Visigoths The Heruli of the distant ocean who painted their naked bodies with its coerulean color implored his protection and the Saxons respected the maritime provinces of a prince who was destitute of any naval force The tall Burgundians submitted to his authority nor did he restore the captive Franks till he had imposed on that fierce nation the terms of an unequal peace The Vandals of Africa cultivated his useful friendship and the Ostrogoths of Pannonia were supported by his powerful aid against the oppression of the neighboring Huns The North such are the lofty strains of the poet was agitated or appeased by the nod of Euric the great king of Persia consulted the oracle of the West and the aged god of the Tyber was protected by the swelling genius of the Garonne six The fortune of nations has often depended on accidents and France may ascribe her greatness to the premature death of the Gothic king at a time when his son Alaric was a helpless infant and his adversary Clovis seven an ambitious and valiant youth Footnote five See Procopius de Bell Gothico l i c twelve in tom ii p eighty one The character of

While Childeric the father of Clovis lived an exile in Germany he was hospitably entertained by the queen as well as by the king of the Thuringians After his restoration Basina escaped from her husband s bed to the arms of her lover freely declaring that if she had known a man wiser stronger or more beautiful than Childeric that man should have been the object of her preference eight Clovis was the offspring of this voluntary union and when he was no more than fifteen years of age he succeeded by his father s death to the command of the Salian tribe The narrow limits of his kingdom were confined to the island of the Batavians with the ancient dioceses of Tournay and Arras ten and at the baptism of Clovis the number of his warriors could not exceed five thousand The kindred tribes of the Franks who had seated themselves along the Belgic rivers the Scheld the Meuse the Moselle and the Rhine were governed by their independent kings of the Merovingian race the equals the allies and sometimes the enemies of the Salic prince But the Germans who obeyed in peace the hereditary jurisdiction of their chiefs were free to follow the standard of a popular and victorious general and the superior merit of Clovis attracted the respect and allegiance of the national confederacy When he first took the field he had neither gold and silver in his coffers nor wine and corn in his magazine eleven but he imitated the example of Caesar who in the same country had acquired wealth by the sword and purchased soldiers with the fruits of conquest After each successful battle or expedition the spoils were accumulated in one common mass every warrior received his proportionable share and the royal prerogative submitted to the equal regulations of military law The untamed spirit of the Barbarians was taught to acknowledge the advantages of regular discipline twelve At the annual review of the month of March their arms were diligently inspected and when they traversed a peaceful territory they were prohibited from touching a blade of grass The justice of Clovis was inexorable and his careless or disobedient soldiers were punished with instant death It would be superfluous to praise the valor of a Frank but the valor of Clovis was directed by cool and consummate prudence thirteen In all his transactions with mankind he calculated the weight of interest of passion and of opinion and his measures were sometimes adapted to the sanguinary manners of the Germans and sometimes moderated by the milder genius of Rome and Christianity He was intercepted in the career of victory since he died in the forty fifth year of his age but he had already accomplished in a reign of thirty years the establishment of the French monarchy in Gaul Footnote eight Greg l ii c twelve

thirteen The duke of Nivernois a noble statesman who has managed weighty and delicate negotiations ingeniously illustrates Mem de l Acad des Inscriptions tom xx p one hundred forty seven one hundred eighty four the political system of Clovis The first exploit of Clovis was the defeat of Syagrius the son of Aegidius and the public quarrel might on this occasion be inflamed by private resentment The glory of the father still insulted the Merovingian race the power of the son might excite the jealous ambition of the king of the Franks Syagrius inherited as a patrimonial estate the city and diocese of Soissons the desolate remnant of the second Belgic Rheims and Troyes Beauvais and Amiens would naturally submit to the count or patrician fourteen and after the dissolution of the Western empire he might reign with the title or at least with the authority of king of the Romans fifteen As a Roman he had been educated in the liberal studies of rhetoric and jurisprudence but he was engaged by accident and policy in the familiar use of the Germanic idiom The independent Barbarians resorted to the tribunal of a stranger who possessed the singular talent of explaining in their

forth a body of fifty thousand horse and such an army might have been plentifully supplied with shields cuirasses and military engines from the three arsenals or manufactures of the city eighteen But the courage and numbers of the Gallic youth were long since exhausted and the loose bands of volunteers or mercenaries who marched under the standard of Syagrius were incapable of contending with the national valor of the Franks It would be ungenerous without some more accurate knowledge of his strength and resources to condemn the rapid flight of Syagrius who escaped after the loss of a battle to the distant court of Thoulouse The feeble minority of Alaric could not assist or protect an unfortunate fugitive the pusillanimous nineteen Goths were intimidated by the menaces of Clovis and the Roman king after a short confinement was delivered into the hands of the executioner The Belgic cities surrendered to the king of the Franks and his dominions were enlarged towards the East by the

name of the Alemanni has been absurdly derived from their imaginary settlement on the banks of the Leman Lake twenty one That fortunate district from the lake to the Avenche and Mount Jura was occupied by the Burgundians twenty two The northern parts of Helvetia had indeed been subdued by the ferocious Alemanni who destroyed with their own hands the fruits of their conquest A province improved and adorned by the arts of Rome was again reduced to a savage wilderness and some vestige of the stately Vindonissa may still be discovered in the fertile and populous valley of the Aar twenty three From the source of the Rhine to its conflux with the Mein and the Moselle the formidable swarms of the Alemanni commanded either side of the river by the right of ancient possession or recent victory They had spread themselves into Gaul over the modern provinces of Alsace and Lorraine and their bold invasion of the kingdom of Cologne summoned the Salic prince to the defence of his Ripuarian allies Clovis encountered the invaders of Gaul in the plain of Tolbiac about twenty four miles from Cologne and the two fiercest nations of Germany were mutually animated by the memory of past exploits and the prospect of future greatness The Franks after an obstinate struggle gave way and the Alemanni raising a shout of victory impetuously pressed their retreat But the battle was restored by the valor and the conduct and perhaps by the piety of Clovis and the event of the bloody day decided forever the alternative of empire or servitude The last king of the Alemanni was slain in the field and his people were slaughtered or pursued till they threw down their arms and yielded to the mercy of the conqueror Without discipline it was impossible for them to rally they had contemptuously demolished the walls and fortifications which might have protected their distress and they were followed into the heart of their forests by an enemy not less active or intrepid than themselves The great Theodoric congratulated the victory of Clovis whose sister Albofleda the king of Italy had lately married but he mildly interceded with his brother in favor of the suppliants and fugitives who had implored his protection The Gallic territories which were possessed by the Alemanni became the prize of their conqueror and the haughty nation invincible or rebellious to the arms of Rome acknowledged the sovereignty of the Merovingian kings who graciously permitted them to enjoy their peculiar manners and institutions under the government of official and at length of hereditary dukes After the conquest of the Western provinces the Franks alone maintained their ancient habitations beyond the Rhine They gradually subdued and civilized the exhausted countries as far as the Elbe

l ii c ten twelve p seventy two eighty Till the thirtieth year of his age Clovis continued to worship the gods of his ancestors twenty five His disbelief or rather disregard of Christianity might encourage him to pillage with less remorse the churches of a hostile territory but his subjects of Gaul enjoyed the free exercise of religious worship and the bishops entertained a more favorable hope of the idolater than of the heretics The Merovingian prince had contracted a fortunate alliance with the fair Clotilda the niece of the king of Burgundy who in the midst of an Arian court was educated in the profession of the Catholic faith It was her interest as well as her duty to achieve the conversion twenty six of a Pagan husband and Clovis insensibly listened to the voice of love and religion He consented perhaps such terms had been previously stipulated to the baptism of his eldest son and though the sudden death of the infant excited some superstitious fears he was persuaded a second time to repeat the dangerous experiment In the distress of the battle of Tolbiac Clovis loudly invoked the God of Clotilda and the Christians and victory disposed him to hear with respectful gratitude the eloquent twenty seven Remigius twenty eight bishop of Rheims who forcibly displayed the temporal and spiritual advantages of his conversion The king declared himself satisfied of the truth of the Catholic faith and the political reasons which might have suspended his public profession were removed by the devout or loyal acclamations of the Franks who showed themselves alike prepared to follow their heroic leader to the field of battle or to the baptismal font The important ceremony was performed in the cathedral of Rheims with every circumstance of magnificence and solemnity that could impress an awful sense of religion on the minds of its rude proselytes twenty nine The new Constantine was immediately baptized with three thousand of his warlike subjects and their example was imitated by the remainder of the gentle Barbarians who in obedience to the victorious prelate adored the cross which they had burnt and burnt the idols which they had formerly adored thirty The mind of Clovis was susceptible of transient fervor he was exasperated by the pathetic tale of the passion and death of Christ and instead of weighing the salutary consequences of that mysterious sacrifice he exclaimed with indiscreet fury Had I been present at the head of my valiant Franks I would have revenged his injuries thirty one But the savage conqueror of Gaul was incapable of examining the proofs of a religion which depends on the laborious investigation of historic evidence and speculative theology He was still more incapable of feeling the mild influence of the gospel which persuades and purifies the heart of a genuine convert His ambitious reign was a perpetual violation of moral and Christian duties his hands were stained with blood in peace as well as in war and as soon as Clovis had dismissed a synod of the Gallican church he calmly assassinated all the princes of the Merovingian race thirty two Yet the king of the Franks might sincerely worship the Christian God as a Being more excellent and powerful than his national deities and the signal deliverance and victory of Tolbiac encouraged Clovis to confide in the future protection of the Lord of Hosts Martin the most popular of the saints had filled the Western world with the fame of those miracles which were incessantly performed at his holy sepulchre of Tours His visible or invisible aid promoted the cause of a liberal and orthodox prince and the profane remark of Clovis himself that saint Martin was an expensive friend thirty three need not be interpreted as the symptom of any permanent or rational scepticism But earth as well as heaven rejoiced in the conversion of the Franks On the memorable day when Clovis ascended from the baptismal font he alone in the Christian world deserved the name and prerogatives of a Catholic king The emperor Anastasius entertained some dangerous errors concerning the nature of the divine incarnation and the Barbarians of Italy Africa Spain and Gaul were involved in the Arian heresy The eldest or rather the only son of the church was acknowledged by the clergy as their lawful sovereign or glorious deliverer and the armies of Clovis were strenuously supported by the zeal and fervor of the Catholic faction thirty four Footnote twenty five Clotilda or rather Gregory supposes that Clovis worshipped the gods of Greece and Rome The fact is incredible and the

bishop of Vienna addressed Clovis on the same subject p forty nine and many of the Latin bishops would assure him of their joy and attachment Under the Roman empire the wealth and jurisdiction of the bishops their sacred character and perpetual office their numerous dependants popular eloquence and provincial assemblies had rendered them always respectable and sometimes dangerous Their influence was augmented with the progress of superstition and the establishment of the French monarchy may in some degree be ascribed to the firm alliance of a hundred prelates who reigned in the discontented or independent cities of Gaul The slight foundations of the Armorican republic had been repeatedly shaken or overthrown but the same people still guarded their domestic freedom asserted the dignity of the Roman name and bravely resisted the predatory inroads and regular attacks of Clovis who labored to extend his conquests from the Seine to the Loire Their successful opposition introduced an equal and honorable union The Franks esteemed the valor of the Armoricans thirty five and the Armoricans were reconciled by the religion of the Franks The military force which had been stationed for the defence of Gaul consisted of one hundred different bands of cavalry or infantry and these troops while they assumed the title and privileges of Roman soldiers were renewed by an incessant supply of the Barbarian youth The extreme fortifications and scattered fragments of the empire were still defended by their hopeless courage But their retreat was intercepted and their communication was impracticable they were abandoned by the Greek princes of Constantinople and they piously disclaimed all connection with the Arian usurpers of Gaul They accepted without shame or reluctance the generous capitulation which was proposed by a Catholic hero and this spurious or legitimate progeny of the Roman legions was distinguished in the succeeding age by their arms their ensigns and their peculiar dress and institutions But the national strength was increased by these powerful and voluntary accessions and the neighboring kingdoms dreaded the numbers as well as the spirit of the Franks The reduction of the Northern provinces of Gaul instead of being decided by the chance of a single battle appears to have been slowly effected by the gradual operation of war and treaty and Clovis acquired each object of his ambition by such efforts or such concessions as were adequate to its real value His savage character and the virtues of Henry IV suggest the most opposite ideas of human

reduced the number of royal candidates by the death of two brothers one of whom was the father of Clotilda thirty eight but his imperfect prudence still permitted Godegesil the youngest of his brothers to possess the dependent principality of Geneva The Arian monarch was justly alarmed by the satisfaction and the hopes which seemed to animate his clergy and people after the conversion of Clovis and Gundobald convened at Lyons an assembly of his bishops to reconcile if it were possible their religious and political discontents A vain conference was agitated between the two factions The Arians upbraided the Catholics with the worship of three Gods the Catholics defended their cause by theological distinctions and the usual arguments objections and replies were reverberated with obstinate clamor till the king revealed his secret apprehensions by an abrupt but decisive question which he addressed to the orthodox bishops If you truly profess the Christian religion why do you not restrain the king of the Franks He has declared war against me and forms alliances with my enemies for my destruction A sanguinary and covetous mind is not the symptom of a sincere conversion let him show his faith by his works The answer of Avitus bishop of Vienna who spoke in the name of his brethren was delivered with the voice and countenance of an angel We are ignorant of the motives and intentions of the king of the Franks but we are taught by Scripture that the kingdoms which abandon the divine law are frequently subverted and that enemies will arise on every side against those who have made God their enemy Return with thy people to the law of God and he will give peace and security to thy dominions The king of Burgundy who was not prepared to accept the condition which the Catholics considered as essential to the treaty delayed and dismissed the ecclesiastical conference after reproaching his bishops that Clovis their friend and proselyte had privately tempted the

and works may be fouud in Dupin Bibliotheque Ecclesiastique tom v p five ten Chapter XXXVIII Reign Of Clovis Part II The allegiance of his brother was already seduced and the obedience of Godegesil who joined the royal standard with the troops of Geneva more effectually promoted the success of the conspiracy While the Franks and Burgundians contended with equal valor his seasonable desertion decided the event of the battle and as Gundobald was faintly supported by the disaffected Gauls he yielded to the arms of Clovis and hastily retreated from the field which appears to have been situate between Langres and Dijon He distrusted the strength of Dijon a quadrangular fortress encompassed by two rivers and by a wall thirty feet high and fifteen thick with four gates and thirty three towers forty he abandoned to the pursuit of Clovis the important cities of Lyons and Vienna and Gundobald still fled with precipitation till he had reached Avignon at the distance of two hundred and fifty miles from the field of battle A long siege and an artful negotiation admonished the king of the Franks of the danger and difficulty of his enterprise He imposed a tribute on the Burgundian prince compelled him to pardon and reward his brother s treachery and proudly returned to his own dominions with the spoils and captives of the southern provinces This splendid triumph was soon clouded by the intelligence that Gundobald had violated his recent obligations and that the unfortunate Godegesil who was left at Vienna with a garrison of five thousand Franks forty one had been besieged surprised and massacred by his inhuman brother Such an outrage might have exasperated the patience of the most peaceful sovereign yet the conqueror of Gaul dissembled the injury released the tribute and accepted the alliance and military service of the king of Burgundy Clovis no longer possessed those advantages which had assured the success of the preceding war and his rival instructed by adversity had found new resources in the affections of his people The Gauls or Romans applauded the mild and impartial laws of Gundobald which almost raised them to the same level with their conquerors The bishops were reconciled and flattered by the hopes which he artfully suggested of his approaching conversion and though he eluded their accomplishment to the last moment of his life his moderation secured the peace and suspended the ruin of the kingdom of Burgundy forty two Footnote forty Gregory of Tours l iii c nineteen in tom ii p one hundred ninety seven indulges his genius or

The Abbe Dubos Hist Critique c tom ii p one hundred twenty six one hundred sixty two has distinctly represented the causes and the events I am impatient to pursue the final ruin of that kingdom which was accomplished under the reign of Sigismond the son of Gundobald The Catholic Sigismond has acquired the honors of a saint and martyr forty three but the hands of the royal saint were stained with the blood of his innocent son whom he inhumanly sacrificed to the pride and resentment of a step mother He soon discovered his error and bewailed the irreparable loss While Sigismond embraced the corpse of the unfortunate youth he received a severe admonition from one of his attendants It is not his situation O king it is thine which deserves pity and lamentation The reproaches of a guilty conscience were alleviated however by his liberal donations to the monastery of Agaunum or saint Maurice in Vallais which he himself had founded in honor of the imaginary martyrs of the Thebaean legion forty four A full chorus of perpetual psalmody was instituted by the pious king he assiduously practised the austere devotion of the monks and it was his humble prayer that Heaven would inflict in this world the punishment of his sins His prayer was heard the avengers were at hand and the provinces of Burgundy were overwhelmed by an army of victorious Franks After the event of an unsuccessful battle Sigismond who wished to protract his life that he might prolong his penance concealed himself in the desert in a religious habit till he was discovered and betrayed by his subjects who solicited the favor of their new masters The captive monarch with his wife and two children was transported to Orleans and buried alive in a deep well by the stern command of the sons of Clovis whose cruelty might derive some excuse from the maxims and examples of their barbarous age Their ambition which urged them to achieve the conquest of Burgundy was inflamed or disguised by filial piety and Clotilda whose sanctity did not consist in the forgiveness of injuries pressed them to revenge her father s death on the family of his assassin The rebellious Burgundians for they attempted to break their chains were still permitted to enjoy their national laws under the obligation of tribute and military service and the Merovingian princes peaceably reigned over a kingdom whose glory and

tom ii p forty nine show their remote and imperfect knowledge The first victory of Clovis had insulted the honor of the Goths They viewed his rapid progress with jealousy and terror and the youthful fame of Alaric was oppressed by the more potent genius of his rival Some disputes inevitably arose on the edge of their contiguous dominions and after the delays of fruitless negotiation a personal interview of the two kings was proposed and accepted The conference of Clovis and Alaric was held in a small island of the Loire near Amboise They embraced familiarly conversed and feasted together and separated with the warmest professions of peace and brotherly love But their apparent confidence concealed a dark suspicion of hostile and treacherous designs and their mutual complaints solicited eluded and disclaimed a final arbitration At Paris which he already considered as his royal seat Clovis declared to an assembly of the princes and warriors the pretence and the motive of a Gothic war It grieves me to see that the Arians still possess the fairest portion of Gaul Let us march against them with the aid of God and having vanquished the heretics we will possess and divide their fertile provinces forty six The Franks who were inspired by hereditary valor and recent zeal applauded the generous design of their monarch expressed their resolution to conquer or die since death and conquest would be equally profitable and solemnly protested that they would never shave their beards till victory should absolve them from that inconvenient vow The enterprise was promoted by the public or private exhortations of Clotilda She reminded her husband how effectually some pious foundation would propitiate the Deity and his servants and the Christian hero darting his battle axe with a skilful and nervous band There said he on that spot where my Francisca forty seven shall fall will I erect a church in honor of the holy apostles This ostentatious piety confirmed and justified the attachment of the Catholics with whom he secretly corresponded and their devout wishes were gradually ripened into a formidable conspiracy The people of Aquitain were alarmed by the indiscreet reproaches of their Gothic tyrants who justly accused them of preferring the dominion of the Franks and their zealous adherent Quintianus bishop of Rodez forty eight preached more forcibly in his exile than in his diocese To resist these foreign and domestic enemies who were fortified by the alliance of the Burgundians Alaric collected his troops far more numerous than the military powers of Clovis The Visigoths resumed the exercise of arms which they had neglected in a long and luxurious peace forty nine a select band of valiant and robust slaves attended their masters to the field fifty and the cities of Gaul were compelled to furnish their doubtful and reluctant aid Theodoric king of the Ostrogoths who reigned in Italy had labored to maintain the tranquillity of Gaul and he assumed

the manifest declaration of the divine favor He marched from Paris and as he proceeded with decent reverence through the holy diocese of Tours his anxiety tempted him to consult the shrine of saint Martin the sanctuary and the oracle of Gaul His messengers were instructed to remark the words of the Psalm which should happen to be chanted at the precise moment when they entered the church Those words most fortunately expressed the valor and victory of the champions of Heaven and the application was easily transferred to the new Joshua the new Gideon who went forth to battle against the enemies of the Lord fifty one Orleans secured to the Franks a bridge on the Loire but at the distance of forty miles from Poitiers their progress was intercepted by an extraordinary swell of the River Vigenna or Vienne and the opposite banks were covered by the encampment of the Visigoths Delay must be always dangerous to Barbarians who consume the country through which they march and had Clovis possessed leisure and materials it might have been impracticable to construct a bridge or to force a passage in the face of a superior enemy But the affectionate peasants who were impatient to welcome their deliverer could easily betray some unknown or unguarded ford the merit of the discovery was enhanced by the useful interposition of fraud or fiction and a white hart of singular size and beauty appeared to guide and animate the march of the Catholic army The counsels of the Visigoths were irresolute and distracted A crowd of impatient warriors presumptuous in their strength and disdaining to fly before the robbers of Germany excited Alaric to assert in arms the name and blood of the conquerors of Rome The advice of the graver chieftains pressed him to elude the first ardor of the Franks and to expect in the southern provinces of Gaul the veteran and victorious Ostrogoths whom the king of Italy had already sent to his assistance The decisive moments were wasted in idle deliberation the Goths too hastily abandoned perhaps an advantageous post and the opportunity of a secure retreat was lost by their slow and disorderly motions After Clovis had passed the ford as it is still named of the Hart he advanced with bold and hasty steps to prevent the escape of the enemy His nocturnal march was directed by a flaming meteor suspended in the air above the cathedral of Poitiers and this signal which might be previously concerted with the orthodox successor of saint Hilary was compared to the column of fire that guided the Israelites in the desert At the third hour of the day about ten miles beyond Poitiers Clovis overtook and instantly attacked the Gothic army whose defeat was already prepared by terror and confusion Yet they rallied in their extreme distress and the martial youths who had clamorously demanded the battle refused to survive the ignominy of flight The two kings encountered each other in single combat Alaric fell by the hand of his rival and the victorious Frank was saved by the goodness of his cuirass and the vigor of his horse from the spears of two desperate Goths who furiously rode against him to revenge the death of their sovereign The vague expression of a mountain of the slain serves to indicate a cruel though indefinite slaughter but Gregory has carefully observed that his valiant countryman Apollinaris the son of Sidonius lost his life at the head of the nobles of Auvergne Perhaps these suspected Catholics had been maliciously exposed to the blind assault of the enemy and perhaps the influence of religion was superseded by personal attachment or military honor fifty two Footnote fifty one This mode of divination by accepting as an omen the first sacred words which in particular circumstances should be presented to the eye or ear was derived from the Pagans and the Psalter or Bible was substituted to the poems of Homer and Virgil From the fourth to the fourteenth century these sortes sanctorum as they are styled were repeatedly condemned by the decrees of councils and repeatedly practised by kings bishops and saints See a curious dissertation of the Abbe du Resnel in the Memoires de l Academie tom xix p two hundred eighty seven three hundred ten Footnote fifty two After correcting the text or excusing the mistake of Procopius who places the defeat of Alaric near Carcassone we may conclude from the evidence of Gregory Fortunatus and the author of the Gesta Francorum that the battle was fought in campo Vocladensi on the banks of the Clain about ten miles to the south of Poitiers Clovis overtook and attacked the Visigoths near Vivonne and the victory was decided near a village still named Champagne saint Hilaire See the Dissertations of the Abbe le Boeuf tom i p three hundred four three hundred thirty one Such is the empire of Fortune if we may still disguise our ignorance under that popular name that it is almost equally difficult to foresee the events of war or to explain their various consequences A bloody and complete victory has sometimes yielded no more than the possession of the field and the loss of ten thousand men has sometimes been sufficient to destroy in a single day the work of ages The decisive battle of Poitiers was followed by the conquest of Aquitain Alaric had left behind him an infant son a bastard competitor factious nobles and a disloyal people and the remaining forces of the Goths were oppressed by the general consternation or opposed to each other in civil discord The victorious king of the Franks proceeded without delay to the siege of Angouleme At the sound of his trumpets the walls of the city imitated the example of Jericho and instantly fell to the ground a splendid miracle which may be reduced to the supposition that some clerical engineers had secretly undermined the foundations of the rampart fifty three At Bordeaux which had submitted without resistance Clovis established his winter quarters and his prudent economy transported from Thoulouse the royal treasures which were deposited in the capital of the monarchy The conqueror penetrated as far as the confines of Spain fifty four restored the honors of the Catholic church fixed in Aquitain a colony of Franks fifty five and delegated to his lieutenants the easy task of subduing or extirpating the nation of the Visigoths But the Visigoths were protected by the wise and powerful monarch of Italy While the balance was still equal Theodoric had perhaps delayed the march of the Ostrogoths but their strenuous efforts successfully resisted the ambition of Clovis and the army of the Franks and their Burgundian allies was compelled to raise the siege of Arles with the loss as it is said of thirty thousand men These vicissitudes inclined the fierce spirit of Clovis to acquiesce in an advantageous treaty of peace The Visigoths were suffered to retain the possession of Septimania a narrow tract of sea coast from the Rhone to the Pyrenees but the ample province of Aquitain from those mountains to the Loire was indissolubly united to the kingdom of France fifty six Footnote fifty three Angouleme is in the road from Poitiers to Bordeaux and although Gregory delays the siege I can more readily believe that he confounded the order of history than that Clovis neglected the rules of war Footnote fifty four Pyrenaeos montes usque Perpinianum subjecit

monk of Amiens see the Abbe le Boeuf Mem de l Academie tom xvii p two hundred twenty eight two hundred forty five relates in the allegorical character of a shepherd the general history of his countrymen the Franks but his narrative ends with the death of Clovis Footnote fifty five The author of the Gesta Francorum positively affirms that Clovis fixed a body of Franks in the Saintonge and Bourdelois and he is not injudiciously followed by Rorico electos milites atque fortissimos cum parvulis atque mulieribus Yet it should seem that they soon mingled with the Romans of Aquitain till

of Theodoric the title and ensigns of that eminent dignity yet from some unknown cause the name of Clovis has not been inscribed in the Fasti either of the East or West fifty seven On the solemn day the monarch of Gaul placing a diadem on his head was invested in the church of saint Martin with a purple tunic and mantle From thence he proceeded on horseback to the cathedral of Tours and as he passed through the streets profusely scattered with his own hand a donative of gold and silver to the joyful multitude who incessantly repeated their acclamations of Consul and Augustus The actual or legal authority of Clovis could not receive any new accessions from the consular dignity It was a name a shadow an empty pageant and if the conqueror had been instructed to claim the ancient prerogatives of that high office they must have expired with the period of its annual duration But the Romans were disposed to revere in the person of their master that antique title which the emperors condescended to assume the Barbarian himself seemed to contract a sacred obligation to respect the majesty of the republic and the successors of Theodosius by soliciting his friendship tacitly forgave and almost ratified the usurpation of Gaul Footnote fifty seven The Fasti of Italy would naturally reject a consul the enemy of their sovereign but any ingenious hypothesis that might explain the silence of Constantinople and Egypt the Chronicle of Marcellinus and the Paschal is overturned by the similar silence of Marius bishop of Avenche who composed his Fasti in the kingdom of Burgundy If the evidence of Gregory of Tours were less weighty and positive l ii c thirty eight in tom ii p one hundred eighty three I could believe that Clovis like Odoacer received the lasting title and honors of Patrician Pagi Critica tom ii p four hundred seventy four four hundred ninety two Twenty five years after the death of Clovis this important concession was more formally declared in a treaty between his sons and the emperor Justinian The Ostrogoths of Italy unable to defend their distant acquisitions had resigned to the Franks the cities of Arles and Marseilles of Arles still adorned with the seat of a Praetorian praefect and of Marseilles enriched by the advantages of trade and navigation fifty eight This transaction was confirmed by the Imperial authority and Justinian generously yielding to the Franks the sovereignty of the countries beyond the Alps which they already possessed absolved the provincials from their allegiance and established on a more lawful though not more solid foundation the throne of the Merovingians fifty nine From that era they enjoyed the right of celebrating at Arles the games of the circus and by a singular privilege which was denied even to the Persian monarch the gold coin impressed with their name and image obtained a legal currency in the empire sixty A Greek historian of that age has praised the private and public virtues of the Franks with a partial enthusiasm which cannot be sufficiently justified by their domestic annals sixty one He celebrates their politeness and urbanity their regular government and orthodox religion and boldly asserts that these Barbarians could be distinguished only by their dress and language from the subjects of Rome Perhaps the Franks already displayed the social disposition and lively graces which in every age have disguised their vices and sometimes concealed their intrinsic merit Perhaps Agathias and the Greeks were dazzled by the rapid progress of their arms and the splendor of their empire Since the conquest of Burgundy Gaul except the Gothic province of Septimania was subject in its whole extent to the sons of Clovis They had extinguished the German kingdom of Thuringia and their vague dominion penetrated beyond the Rhine into the heart of their native forests The Alemanni and Bavarians who had occupied the Roman provinces of Rhaetia and Noricum to the south of the Danube confessed themselves the humble vassals of the Franks and the feeble barrier of the Alps was incapable of resisting their ambition When the last survivor of the sons of Clovis united the inheritance and conquests of the Merovingians his kingdom extended far beyond the limits of modern France Yet modern France such has been the progress of arts and policy far surpasses in wealth populousness and power the spacious but savage realms of Clotaire or Dagobert sixty two Footnote fifty eight Under the Merovingian kings Marseilles still imported from the East paper wine oil linen silk precious stones spices c The Gauls or Franks traded to Syria and the Syrians were established in Gaul See M de Guignes Mem de l Academie tom xxxvii p four hundred seventy one four hundred seventy five Footnote fifty nine This strong declaration of Procopius de Bell Gothic l iii cap thirty three in tom ii p forty one would almost suffice to justify the Abbe Dubos Footnote sixty The Franks who probably used the mints of Treves Lyons and Arles imitated the coinage of the Roman emperors of seventy two solidi or pieces to the pound of gold But as the Franks established only a decuple proportion of gold and silver ten shillings will be a sufficient valuation of their solidus of gold It was the common standard of the Barbaric fines and contained forty denarii or silver three pences Twelve of these denarii made a solidus or shilling the twentieth part of the ponderal and numeral livre or pound of silver which has been so strangely reduced in modern France See La Blanc Traite Historique des Monnoyes de France p thirty six forty three c Footnote sixty one Agathias in tom ii p forty seven Gregory of Tours exhibits a very different picture Perhaps it would not be easy within the same historical space to find more vice and less virtue We are continually shocked by the union of savage and corrupt manners Footnote sixty two M de Foncemagne has traced in a correct and elegant dissertation Mem de l Academie tom viii p five hundred five five hundred twenty eight the extent and limits of the French monarchy The Franks or French are the only people of Europe who can deduce a perpetual succession from the conquerors of the Western empire But their conquest of Gaul was followed by ten centuries of anarchy and ignorance On the revival of learning the students who had been formed in the schools of Athens and Rome disdained their Barbarian ancestors and a long period elapsed before patient labor could provide the requisite materials to satisfy or rather to excite the curiosity of more enlightened times sixty three At length the eye of criticism and philosophy was directed to the antiquities of France but even philosophers have been tainted by the contagion of prejudice and passion The most extreme and exclusive systems of the personal servitude of the Gauls or of their voluntary and equal alliance with the Franks have been rashly conceived and obstinately defended and the intemperate disputants have accused each other of conspiring against the prerogative of the crown the dignity of the nobles or the freedom of the people Yet the sharp conflict has usefully exercised the adverse powers of learning and genius and each antagonist alternately vanquished and victorious has extirpated some ancient errors and established some interesting truths An impartial stranger instructed by their discoveries their disputes and even their faults may describe from the same original materials the state of the Roman provincials after Gaul had submitted to the arms and laws of the Merovingian kings sixty four Footnote sixty three The Abbe Dubos Histoire Critique tom i p twenty nine thirty six has truly and agreeably represented the slow progress of these studies and he observes that Gregory of Tours was only once printed before the year fifteen sixty According to the complaint of Heineccius Opera tom iii Sylloge iii p two hundred forty eight c Germany received with indifference and contempt the codes of Barbaric laws which were published by Heroldus Lindenbrogius c At present those laws as far as they relate to Gaul the history of Gregory of Tours and all the monuments of the Merovingian race appear in a pure and perfect state in the first four volumes of the Historians of France Footnote sixty four In the space of about thirty years seventeen twenty eight seventeen sixty five this interesting subject has been agitated by the free spirit of the count de Boulainvilliers Memoires Historiques sur l Etat de la France particularly tom i p fifteen forty nine the learned ingenuity of the Abbe Dubos Histoire Critique de l Etablissement de la Monarchie Francoise dans les Gaules two vols in fourto the comprehensive genius of the president de Montesquieu Esprit des Loix particularly l xxviii xxx xxxi and the good sense and diligence of the Abbe de Mably Observations sur l Histoire de France two vols twelvemo The rudest or the most servile condition of human society is regulated however by some fixed and general rules When Tacitus surveyed the primitive simplicity of the Germans he discovered some permanent maxims or customs of public and private life which were preserved by faithful tradition till the introduction of the art of writing and of the Latin tongue sixty five Before the election of the Merovingian kings the most powerful tribe or nation of the Franks appointed four venerable chieftains to compose the Salic laws sixty six and their labors were examined and approved in three successive assemblies of the people After the baptism of Clovis he reformed several articles that appeared incompatible with Christianity the Salic law was again amended by his sons and at length under the reign of Dagobert the code was revised and promulgated in its actual form one hundred years after the establishment of the French monarchy Within the same period the customs of the Ripuarians were transcribed and published and Charlemagne himself the legislator of his age and country had accurately studied the two national laws which still prevailed among the Franks sixty seven The same care was extended to their vassals and the rude institutions of the Alemanni and Bavarians were diligently compiled and ratified by the supreme authority of the Merovingian kings The Visigoths and Burgundians whose conquests in Gaul preceded those of the Franks showed less impatience to attain one of the principal benefits of civilized society Euric was the first of the Gothic princes who expressed in writing the manners and customs of his people and the composition of the Burgundian laws was a measure of policy rather than of justice to alleviate the yoke and regain the affections of their Gallic subjects sixty eight Thus by a singular coincidence the Germans framed their artless institutions at a time when the elaborate system of Roman jurisprudence was finally consummated In the Salic laws and the Pandects of Justinian we may compare the first rudiments and the full maturity of civil wisdom and whatever prejudices may be suggested in favor of Barbarism our calmer reflections will ascribe to the Romans the superior advantages not only of science and reason but of humanity and justice Yet the laws six hundred eighty one of the Barbarians were adapted to their wants and desires their occupations and their capacity and they all contributed to preserve the peace and promote the improvement of the society for whose use they were originally established The Merovingians instead of imposing a uniform rule of conduct on their various subjects permitted each people and each family of their empire freely to enjoy their domestic institutions sixty nine nor were the Romans excluded from the common benefits of this legal toleration seventy The children embraced the law of their parents the wife that of her husband the freedman that of his patron and in all causes where the parties were of different nations the plaintiff or accuser was obliged to follow the tribunal of the defendant who may always plead a judicial presumption of right or innocence A more ample latitude was allowed if every citizen in the presence of the judge might declare the law under which he desired to live and the national society to which he chose to belong Such an indulgence would abolish the partial distinctions of victory and the Roman provincials might patiently acquiesce in the hardships of their condition since it depended on themselves to assume the privilege if they dared to assert the character of free and warlike Barbarians seventy one Footnote sixty five I have derived much instruction from two learned works of Heineccius the History and the Elements of the Germanic law In a judicious preface to the Elements he considers and tries to excuse the defects of that barbarous jurisprudence Footnote sixty six Latin appears to have been the original language of the Salic law It was probably composed in the beginning of the fifth century before the era A D four hundred twenty one of the real or fabulous Pharamond The preface mentions the

partial From a various reading in the Salic law tit xliv not xlv the Abbe de Mably tom i p two hundred ninety two hundred ninety three has conjectured that at first a Barbarian only and afterwards any

Charlemagne which is confirmed by the Royal and Wolfenbuttle MSS The looser interpretation hominem is authorized only by the MS of Fulda from from whence Heroldus published his edition See the four original texts of the Salic law in tom iv p one hundred forty seven one hundred seventy three one hundred ninety six two hundred twenty Note Gibbon appears to have doubted the evidence on which this liberty of choice rested His doubts have been confirmed by the researches of M Savigny who has not only confuted but traced with convincing sagacity the origin and progress of this error As a general principle though liable to some exceptions each lived according to his native law Romische Recht vol i p one hundred twenty three one hundred thirty eight M Note This constitution of Lothaire at first related only to the duchy of Rome it afterwards found its way into the Lombard code Savigny p one hundred thirty eight M Chapter XXXVIII Reign Of Clovis Part III When justice inexorably requires the death of a murderer each private citizen is fortified by the assurance that the laws the magistrate and the whole community are the guardians of his personal safety But in the loose society of the Germans revenge was always honorable and often meritorious the independent warrior chastised or vindicated with his own hand the injuries which he had offered or received and he had only to dread the resentment of the sons and kinsmen of the enemy whom he had sacrificed to his selfish or angry passions The magistrate conscious of his weakness interposed not to punish but to reconcile and he was satisfied if he could persuade or compel the contending parties to pay and to accept the moderate fine which had been ascertained as the price of blood seventy two The fierce spirit of the Franks would have opposed a more rigorous sentence the same fierceness despised these ineffectual restraints and when their simple manners had been corrupted by the wealth of Gaul the public peace was continually violated by acts of hasty or deliberate guilt In every just government the same penalty is inflicted or at least is imposed for the murder of a peasant or a prince But the national inequality established by the Franks in their criminal proceedings was the last insult and abuse of conquest seventy three In the calm moments of legislation they solemnly pronounced that the life of a Roman was of smaller value than that of a Barbarian The Antrustion seventy four a name expressive of the most illustrious birth or dignity among the Franks was appreciated at the sum of six hundred pieces of gold while the noble provincial who was admitted to the king s table might be legally murdered at the expense of three hundred pieces Two hundred were deemed sufficient for a Frank of ordinary condition but the meaner Romans were exposed to disgrace and danger by a trifling compensation of one hundred or even fifty pieces of gold Had these laws been regulated by any principle of equity or reason the public protection should have supplied in just proportion the want of personal strength But the legislator had weighed in the scale not of justice but of policy the loss of a soldier against that of a slave the head of an insolent and rapacious Barbarian was guarded by a heavy fine and the slightest aid was afforded to the most defenceless subjects Time insensibly abated the pride of the conquerors and the patience of the vanquished and the boldest citizen was taught by experience that he might suffer more injuries than he could inflict As the manners of the Franks became less ferocious their laws were rendered more severe and the Merovingian kings attempted to imitate the impartial rigor of the Visigoths and Burgundians seventy five Under the empire of Charlemagne murder was universally punished with death and the use of capital punishments has been liberally multiplied in the jurisprudence of modern Europe seventy six Footnote seventy two In the heroic times of Greece the guilt of murder was expiated by a pecuniary satisfaction to the family of the deceased Feithius Antiquitat Homeric l ii c eight Heineccius in his preface to the Elements of Germanic Law favorably suggests that at Rome and Athens homicide was only punished with exile It is true but exile was a capital punishment for a citizen of Rome or Athens Footnote seventy three This proportion is fixed by the Salic tit xliv in tom iv p one hundred forty seven and the Ripuarian tit vii xi xxxvi in tom iv p two hundred thirty seven two hundred forty one laws but the latter does not distinguish any difference of Romans Yet the orders of the clergy are placed above the Franks themselves and the Burgundians and Alemanni between the Franks and the Romans Footnote seventy four The Antrustiones qui in truste Dominica sunt leudi fideles undoubtedly represent the first order of Franks but it is a question whether their rank was personal or hereditary The Abbe de Mably tom i p three hundred thirty four three hundred forty seven is not displeased to mortify the pride of birth Esprit l xxx c twenty five by dating the origin of the French nobility from the reign Clotaire II A D six hundred fifteen Footnote seventy five See the Burgundian laws tit ii in tom iv p two hundred fifty seven the code of the Visigoths l vi tit v in tom p three hundred eighty four and the constitution of Childebert not of Paris but most evidently of Austrasia in tom iv p one hundred twelve Their premature severity was sometimes rash and excessive Childebert condemned not only murderers but robbers quomodo sine lege involavit sine lege moriatur and even the negligent judge was involved in the same sentence The Visigoths abandoned an unsuccessful surgeon to the family of his deceased patient ut quod de eo facere voluerint habeant potestatem l xi tit i in tom iv p four hundred thirty five Footnote seventy six See in the sixth volume of the works of Heineccius the Elementa Juris Germanici l ii p two No two hundred sixty one two hundred sixty two two hundred eighty two hundred eighty three Yet some vestiges of these pecuniary compositions for murder have been traced in Germany as late as the sixteenth century The civil and military professions which had been separated by Constantine were again united by the Barbarians The harsh sound of the Teutonic appellations was mollified into the Latin titles of Duke of Count or of Praefect and the same officer assumed within his district the command of the troops and the administration of justice seventy seven But the fierce and illiterate chieftain was seldom qualified to discharge the duties of a judge which required all the faculties of a philosophic mind laboriously cultivated by experience and study and his rude ignorance was compelled to embrace some simple and visible methods of ascertaining the cause of justice In every religion the Deity has been invoked to confirm the truth or to punish the falsehood of human testimony but this powerful instrument was misapplied and abused by the simplicity of the German legislators The party accused might justify his innocence by producing before their tribunal a number of friendly witnesses who solemnly declared their belief or assurance that he was not guilty According to the weight of the charge this legal number of compurgators was multiplied seventy two voices were required to absolve an incendiary or assassin and when the chastity of a queen of France was suspected three hundred gallant nobles swore without hesitation that the infant prince had been actually begotten by her deceased husband seventy eight The sin and scandal of manifest and frequent perjuries engaged the magistrates to remove these dangerous temptations and to supply the defects of human testimony by the famous experiments of fire and water These extraordinary trials were so capriciously contrived that in some cases guilt and innocence in others could not be proved without the interposition of a miracle Such miracles were really provided by fraud and credulity the most intricate causes were determined by this easy and infallible method and the turbulent Barbarians who might have disdained the sentence of the magistrate submissively acquiesced in the judgment of God seventy nine Footnote seventy seven The whole subject of the Germanic judges and their jurisdiction is copiously treated by Heineccius Element Jur Germ l iii No one seventy two I cannot find any proof that under the Merovingian race the scabini or assessors were chosen by the people Note The question of the scabini is treated at considerable length by Savigny He questions the existence of the scabini anterior to Charlemagne Before this time the decision was by an open court of the freemen the boni Romische Recht vol i p one hundred ninety five et seq M Footnote seventy eight Gregor Turon l viii c nine in tom ii p three hundred sixteen Montesquieu observes Esprit

grandson of Clovis must have followed the Salic law Footnote seventy nine Muratori in the Antiquities of Italy has given two Dissertations xxxvii xxxix on the judgments of God It was expected that fire would not burn the innocent and that the pure element of water would not allow the guilty to sink into its bosom But the trials by single combat gradually obtained superior credit and authority among a warlike people who could not believe that a brave man deserved to suffer or that a coward deserved to live eighty Both in civil and criminal proceedings the plaintiff or accuser the defendant or even the witness were exposed to mortal challenge from the antagonist who was destitute of legal proofs and it was incumbent on them either to desert their cause or publicly to maintain their honor in the lists of battle They fought either on foot or on horseback according to the custom of their nation eighty one and the decision of the sword or lance was ratified by the sanction of Heaven of the judge and of the people This sanguinary law was introduced into Gaul by the Burgundians and their legislator Gundobald eighty two condescended to answer the complaints and objections of his subject Avitus Is it not true said the king of Burgundy to the bishop that the event of national wars and private combats is directed by the judgment of God and that his providence awards the victory to the juster cause By such prevailing arguments the absurd and cruel practice of judicial duels which had been peculiar to some tribes of Germany was propagated and established in all the monarchies of Europe from Sicily to the Baltic At the end of ten centuries the reign of legal violence was not totally extinguished and the ineffectual censures of saints of popes and of synods may seem to prove that the influence of superstition is weakened by its unnatural alliance with reason and humanity The tribunals were stained with the blood perhaps of innocent and respectable citizens the law which now favors the rich then yielded to the strong and the old the feeble and the infirm were condemned either to renounce their fairest claims and possessions to sustain the dangers of an unequal conflict eighty three or to trust the doubtful aid of a mercenary champion This oppressive jurisprudence was imposed on the provincials of Gaul who complained of any injuries in their persons and property Whatever might be the strength or courage of individuals the victorious Barbarians excelled in the love and exercise of arms and the vanquished Roman was unjustly summoned to repeat in his own person the bloody contest which had been already decided against his country eighty four Footnote eighty Montesquieu Esprit des Loix l xxviii c seventeen has condescended to explain and excuse la maniere de penser de nos peres on the subject of judicial combats He follows this strange institution from the age of Gundobald to that of saint Lewis and the philosopher is some times lost in the

by the Burgundians Ripuarians Alemanni Bavarians Lombards Thuringians Frisons and Saxons is satisfied and Agobard seems to countenance the assertion that it was not allowed by the Salic law Yet the same custom at least in case of treason is mentioned by Ermoldus Nigellus l iii five hundred forty three in tom vi p forty eight and the anonymous biographer of Lewis the Pious c forty six in tom vi p one hundred twelve as the mos antiquus Francorum more Francis solito c expressions too general to exclude the noblest of their tribes A devouring host of one hundred and twenty thousand Germans had formerly passed the Rhine under the command of Ariovistus One third part of the fertile lands of the Sequani was appropriated to their use and the conqueror soon repeated his oppressive demand of another third for the accommodation of a new colony of twenty four thousand Barbarians whom he had invited to share the rich harvest of Gaul eighty five At the distance of five hundred years the Visigoths and Burgundians who revenged the defeat of Ariovistus usurped the same unequal proportion of two thirds of the subject lands But this distribution instead of spreading over the province may be reasonably confined to the peculiar districts where the victorious people had been planted by their own choice or by the policy of their leader In these districts each Barbarian was connected by the ties of hospitality with some Roman provincial To this unwelcome guest the proprietor was compelled to abandon two thirds of his patrimony but the German a shepherd and a hunter might sometimes content himself with a spacious range of wood and pasture and resign the smallest though most valuable portion to the toil of the industrious husbandman eighty six The silence of ancient and authentic testimony has encouraged an opinion that the rapine of the Franks was not moderated or disguised by the forms of a legal division that they dispersed themselves over the provinces of Gaul without order or control and that each victorious robber according to his wants his avarice and his strength measured with his sword the extent of his new inheritance At a distance from their sovereign the Barbarians might indeed be tempted to exercise such arbitrary depredation but the firm and artful policy of Clovis must curb a licentious spirit which would aggravate the misery of the vanquished whilst it corrupted the union and discipline of the conquerors eight hundred sixty one The memorable vase of Soissons is a monument and a pledge of the regular distribution of the Gallic spoils It was the duty and the interest of Clovis to provide rewards for a successful army settlements for a numerous people without inflicting any wanton or superfluous injuries on the loyal Catholics of Gaul The ample fund which he might lawfully acquire of the Imperial patrimony vacant lands and Gothic usurpations would diminish the cruel necessity of seizure and confiscation and the humble provincials would more patiently acquiesce in the equal and regular distribution of their loss eighty seven Footnote eighty five Caesar de Bell Gall l i c thirty one in tom i p two hundred thirteen Footnote eighty six

shall only add that among the Goths the division seems to have been ascertained by the judgment of the neighborhood that the Barbarians frequently usurped the remaining third and that the Romans might recover their right unless they were barred by a prescription of fifty years Footnote eight hundred sixty one Sismondi Hist des Francais vol i p one hundred ninety seven observes they were not a conquering people who had emigrated with their families like the Goths or Burgundians The women the children the old had not followed Clovis they remained in their ancient possessions on the Waal and the Rhine The adventurers alone had formed the invading force and they always considered themselves as an army not as a colony Hence their laws retained no traces of the partition of the Roman properties It is curious to observe the recoil from the national vanity of the French historians of the last century M Sismondi compares the position of the Franks with regard to the conquered people with that of the Dey of Algiers and his corsair troops to the peaceful inhabitants of that province M Thierry Lettres sur l Histoire de France p one hundred seventeen with that of the Turks towards

extensive domain After the conquest of Gaul they still delighted in the rustic simplicity of their ancestors the cities were abandoned to solitude and decay and their coins their charters and their synods are still inscribed with the names of the villas or rural palaces in which they successively resided One hundred and sixty of these palaces a title which need not excite any unseasonable ideas of art or luxury were scattered through the provinces of their kingdom and if some might claim the honors of a fortress the far greater part could be esteemed only in the light of profitable farms The mansion of the long haired kings was surrounded with convenient yards and stables for the cattle and the poultry the garden was planted with useful vegetables the various trades the labors of agriculture and even the arts of hunting and fishing were exercised by servile hands for the emolument of the sovereign his magazines were filled with corn and wine either for sale or consumption and the whole administration was conducted by the strictest maxims of private economy eighty eight This ample patrimony was appropriated to supply the hospitable plenty of Clovis and his successors and to reward the fidelity of their brave companions who both in peace and war were devoted to their persona service Instead of a horse or a suit of armor each companion according to his rank or merit or favor was invested with a benefice the primitive name and most simple form of the feudal possessions These gifts might be resumed at the pleasure of the sovereign and his feeble prerogative derived some support from the influence of his liberality eight hundred eighty one But this dependent tenure was gradually abolished eighty nine by the independent and rapacious nobles of France who established the perpetual property and hereditary succession of their benefices a revolution salutary to the earth which had been injured or neglected by its precarious masters ninety Besides these royal and beneficiary estates a large proportion had been assigned in the division of Gaul of allodial and Salic lands they were exempt from tribute and the Salic lands were equally shared among the male descendants of the Franks ninety one Footnote eighty eight See the rustic edict or rather code of Charlemagne which contains seventy distinct and minute regulations of that great monarch in tom v

two hundred fifty seven it is evident that a deserving son might expect to hold the lands which his father had received from the royal bounty of Gundobald The Burgundians would firmly maintain their privilege and their example might encourage the Beneficiaries of France Footnote ninety The revolutions of the benefices and fiefs are clearly fixed by the Abbe de Mably His accurate distinction of times gives him a merit to which even Montesquieu is a stranger Footnote ninety one See the Salic law tit lxii in tom iv p one hundred fifty six The origin and nature of these Salic lands which in times of ignorance were perfectly understood now perplex our most learned and sagacious critics Note No solution seems more probable than that the ancient lawgivers of the Salic Franks prohibited females from inheriting the lands assigned to the nation upon its conquest of Gaul both in compliance with their ancient usages and in order to secure the military service of every proprietor But lands subsequently acquired by purchase or other means though equally bound to the public defence were relieved from the severity of this rule and presumed not to belong to the class of Sallic Hallam s Middle Ages vol i p one hundred forty five Compare Sismondi vol i p one hundred ninety six M In the bloody discord and silent decay of the Merovingian line a new order of tyrants arose in the provinces who under the appellation of Seniors or Lords usurped a right to govern and a license to oppress the subjects of their peculiar territory Their ambition might be checked by the hostile resistance of an equal but the laws were extinguished and the sacrilegious Barbarians who dared to provoke the vengeance of a saint or bishop ninety two would seldom respect the landmarks of a profane and defenceless neighbor The common or public rights of nature such as they had always been deemed by the Roman jurisprudence ninety three were severely restrained by the German conquerors whose amusement or rather passion was the exercise of hunting The vague dominion which Man has assumed over the wild inhabitants of the earth the air and the waters was confined to some fortunate individuals of the human species Gaul was again overspread with woods and the animals who were reserved for the use or pleasure of the lord might ravage with impunity the fields of his industrious vassals The chase was the sacred privilege of the nobles and their domestic servants Plebeian transgressors were legally chastised with stripes and imprisonment ninety four but in an age which admitted a slight composition for the life of a citizen it was a capital crime to destroy a stag or a wild bull within the precincts of the royal forests ninety five Footnote ninety two Many of the

master of the enemy whom he had subdued and spared ninety six and the fruitful cause of personal slavery which had been almost suppressed by the peaceful sovereignty of Rome was again revived and multiplied by the perpetual hostilities of the independent Barbarians The Goth the Burgundian or the Frank who returned from a successful expedition dragged after him a long train of sheep of oxen and of human captives whom he treated with the same brutal contempt The youths of an elegant form and an ingenuous aspect were set apart for the domestic service a doubtful situation which alternately exposed them to the favorable or cruel impulse of passion The useful mechanics and servants smiths carpenters tailors shoemakers cooks gardeners dyers and workmen in gold and silver c employed their skill for the use or profit of their master But the Roman captives who were destitute of art but capable of labor were condemned without regard to their former rank to tend the cattle and cultivate the lands of the Barbarians The number of the hereditary bondsmen who were attached to the Gallic estates was continually increased by new supplies and the servile people according to the situation and temper of their lords was sometimes raised by precarious indulgence and more frequently depressed by capricious despotism ninety seven An absolute power of life and death was exercised by these lords and when they married their daughters a train of useful servants chained on the wagons to prevent their escape was sent as a nuptial present into a distant country ninety eight The majesty of the Roman laws protected the liberty of each citizen against the rash effects of his own distress or despair But the subjects of the Merovingian kings might alienate their personal freedom and this act of legal suicide which was familiarly practised is expressed in terms most disgraceful and afflicting to the dignity of human nature ninety nine The example of the poor who purchased life by the sacrifice of all that can render life desirable was gradually imitated by the feeble and the devout who in times of public disorder pusillanimously crowded to shelter themselves under the battlements of a powerful chief and around the shrine of a popular saint Their submission was accepted by these temporal or spiritual patrons and the hasty transaction irrecoverably fixed their own condition and that of their latest posterity From the reign of Clovis during five successive centuries the laws and manners of Gaul uniformly tended to promote the increase and to confirm the duration of personal servitude Time and violence almost obliterated the intermediate ranks of society and left an obscure and narrow interval between the noble and the slave This arbitrary and recent division has been transformed by pride and prejudice into a national distinction universally established by the arms and the laws of the Merovingians The nobles who claimed their genuine or fabulous descent from the independent and victorious Franks have asserted and abused the indefeasible right of conquest over a prostrate crowd of slaves and plebeians to whom they imputed the imaginary disgrace of Gallic or Roman extraction Footnote ninety six The custom of enslaving prisoners of war was totally extinguished in the thirteenth century by the prevailing influence of Christianity but it might be proved from

Auvergne had formerly maintained a just preeminence among the independent states and cities of Gaul The brave and numerous inhabitants displayed a singular trophy the sword of Caesar himself which he had lost when he was repulsed before the walls of Gergovia one hundred As the common offspring of Troy they claimed a fraternal alliance with the Romans one hundred one and if each province had imitated the courage and loyalty of Auvergne the fall of the Western empire might have been prevented or delayed They firmly maintained the fidelity which they had reluctantly sworn to the Visigoths out when their bravest nobles had fallen in the battle of Poitiers they accepted without resistance a victorious and Catholic sovereign This easy and valuable conquest was achieved and possessed by Theodoric the eldest son of Clovis but the remote province was separated from his Austrasian dominions by the intermediate kingdoms of Soissons Paris and Orleans which formed after their father s death the inheritance of his three brothers The king of Paris Childebert was tempted by the neighborhood and beauty of Auvergne one hundred two The Upper country which rises towards the south into the mountains of the Cevennes presented a rich and various prospect of woods and pastures the sides of the hills were clothed with vines and each eminence was crowned with a villa or castle In the Lower Auvergne the River Allier flows through the fair and spacious plain of Limagne and the inexhaustible fertility of the soil supplied and still supplies without any interval of repose the constant repetition of the same harvests one hundred three On the false report that their lawful sovereign had been slain in Germany the city and diocese of Auvergne were betrayed by the grandson of Sidonius Apollinaris Childebert enjoyed this clandestine victory and the free subjects of Theodoric threatened to desert his standard if he indulged his private resentment while the nation was engaged in the Burgundian war But the Franks of Austrasia soon yielded to the persuasive eloquence of their king Follow me said Theodoric into Auvergne I will lead you into a province where you may acquire gold silver slaves cattle and precious apparel to the full extent of your wishes I repeat my promise I give you the people and their wealth as your prey and you may transport them at pleasure into your own country By the execution of this promise Theodoric justly forfeited the allegiance of a people whom he devoted to destruction His troops reenforced by the fiercest Barbarians of Germany one hundred four spread desolation over the fruitful face of Auvergne and two places only a strong castle and a holy shrine were saved or redeemed from their licentious fury The castle of Meroliac one hundred five was seated on a lofty rock which rose a hundred feet above the surface of the plain and a large reservoir of fresh water was enclosed with some arable lands within the circle of its fortifications The Franks beheld with envy and despair this impregnable fortress but they surprised a party of fifty stragglers and as they were oppressed by the number of their captives they fixed at a trifling ransom the alternative of life or death for these wretched victims whom the cruel Baroarians were prepared to massacre on the refusal of the garrison Another detachment penetrated as far as Brivas or Brioude where the inhabitants with their valuable effects had taken refuge in the sanctuary of saint Julian The doors of the church resisted the assault but a daring soldier entered through a window of the choir and opened a passage to his companions The clergy and people the sacred and the profane spoils were rudely torn from the altar and the sacrilegious division was made at a small distance from the town of Brioude But this act of impiety was severely chastised by the devout son of Clovis He punished with death the most atrocious offenders left their secret accomplices to the vengeance of saint Julian released the captives restored the plunder and extended the rights of sanctuary five miles round the sepulchre of the holy martyr one hundred six Footnote one hundred When

XXXVIII Reign Of Clovis Part IV Before the Austrasian army retreated from Auvergne Theodoric exacted some pledges of the future loyalty of a people whose just hatred could be restrained only by their fear A select band of noble youths the sons of the principal senators was delivered to the conqueror as the hostages of the faith of Childebert and of their countrymen On the first rumor of war or conspiracy these guiltless youths were reduced to a state of servitude and one of them Attalus one hundred seven whose adventures are more particularly related kept his master s horses in the diocese of Treves After a painful search he was discovered in this unworthy occupation by the emissaries of his grandfather Gregory bishop of Langres but his offers of ransom were sternly rejected by the avarice of the Barbarian who required an exorbitant sum of ten pounds of gold for the freedom of his noble captive His deliverance was effected by the hardy stratagem of Leo an item belonging to the kitchens of the bishop of Langres one hundred eight An unknown agent easily introduced him into the same family The Barbarian purchased Leo for the price of twelve pieces of gold and was pleased to learn that he was deeply skilled in the luxury of an episcopal table Next Sunday said the Frank I shall invite my neighbors and kinsmen Exert thy art and force them to confess that they have never seen or tasted such an entertainment even in the king s house Leo assured him that if he would provide a sufficient quantity of poultry his wishes should be satisfied The master who already aspired to the merit of elegant hospitality assumed as his own the praise which the voracious guests unanimously bestowed on his cook and the dexterous Leo insensibly acquired the trust and management of his household After the patient expectation of a whole year he cautiously whispered his design to Attalus and exhorted him to prepare for flight in the ensuing night At the hour of midnight the intemperate guests retired from the table and the Frank s son in law whom Leo attended to his apartment with a nocturnal potation condescended to jest on the facility with which he might betray his trust The intrepid slave after sustaining this dangerous raillery entered his master s bedchamber removed his spear and shield silently drew the fleetest horses from the stable unbarred the ponderous gates and excited Attalus to save his life and liberty by incessant diligence Their apprehensions urged them to leave their horses on the banks of the Meuse one hundred nine they swam the river wandered three days in the adjacent forest and subsisted only by the accidental discovery of a wild plum tree As they lay concealed in a dark thicket they heard the noise of horses they were terrified by the angry countenance of their master and they anxiously listened to his declaration that if he could seize the guilty fugitives one of them he would cut in pieces with his sword and would expose the other on a gibbet A length Attalus and his faithful Leo reached the friendly habitation of a presbyter of Rheims who recruited their fainting strength with bread and wine concealed them from the search of their enemy and safely conducted them beyond the limits of the Austrasian kingdom to the episcopal palace of Langres Gregory embraced his grandson with tears of joy gratefully delivered Leo with his whole family from the yoke of servitude and bestowed on him the property of a farm where he might end his days in happiness and freedom Perhaps this singular adventure which is marked with so many circumstances of truth and nature was related by Attalus himself to his cousin or nephew the first historian of the Franks Gregory of Tours one hundred ten was born about sixty years after the death of Sidonius Apollinaris and their situation was almost similar since each of them was a native of Auvergne a senator and a bishop The difference of their style and sentiments may therefore express the decay of Gaul and clearly ascertain how much in so short a space the human mind had lost of its energy and refinement one hundred eleven Footnote one hundred seven The story of Attalus is related by Gregory of Tours l iii c sixteen tom ii p one hundred ninety three one hundred ninety five His editor the P Ruinart confounds this Attalus who was a youth puer in the year five hundred thirty two with a friend of Silonius of the same name who was count of Autun fifty or sixty years before Such an error which cannot be imputed to ignorance is excused in some degree by its own magnitude Footnote one hundred eight This Gregory the great grandfather of Gregory of Tours in tom ii p one hundred ninety seven four hundred ninety lived ninety two years of which he passed forty as count of Autun and thirty two as bishop of Langres According to the poet Fortunatus he displayed equal merit in these different stations Nobilis antiqua decurrens prole parentum Nobilior gestis nunc

Florentius Georgius were of noble extraction natalibus illustres and they possessed large estates latifundia both in Auvergne and Burgundy He was born in the year five hundred thirty nine was consecrated bishop of Tours in five hundred seventy three and died in five hundred ninety three or five hundred ninety five soon after he had terminated his history See his life by Odo abbot of Clugny

Decedente atque immo potius pereunte ab urbibus Gallicanis liberalium cultura literarum c in praefat in tom ii p one hundred thirty seven is the complaint of Gregory himself which he fully verifies by his own work His style is equally devoid of elegance and simplicity In a conspicuous station he still remained a stranger to his own age and country and in a prolific work the five last books contain ten years he has omitted almost every thing that posterity desires to learn I have tediously acquired by a painful perusal the right of pronouncing this unfavorable sentence We are now qualified to despise the opposite and perhaps artful misrepresentations which have softened or exaggerated the oppression of the Romans of Gaul under the reign of the Merovingians The conquerors never promulgated any universal edict of servitude or confiscation but a degenerate people who excused their weakness by the specious names of politeness and peace was exposed to the arms and laws of the ferocious Barbarians who contemptuously insulted their possessions their freedom and their safety Their personal injuries were partial and irregular but the great body of the Romans survived the revolution and still preserved the property and privileges of citizens A large portion of their lands was exacted for the use of the Franks but they enjoyed the remainder exempt from tribute one hundred twelve and the same irresistible violence which swept away the arts and manufactures of Gaul destroyed the elaborate and expensive system of Imperial despotism The Provincials must frequently deplore the savage jurisprudence of the Salic or Ripuarian laws but their private life in the important concerns of marriage testaments or inheritance was still regulated by the Theodosian Code and a discontented Roman might freely aspire or descend to the title and character of a Barbarian The honors of the state were accessible to his ambition the education and temper of the Romans more peculiarly qualified them for the offices of civil government and as soon as emulation had rekindled their military ardor they were permitted to march in the ranks or even at the head of the victorious Germans I shall not attempt to enumerate the generals and magistrates whose names one hundred thirteen attest the liberal policy of the Merovingians The supreme command of Burgundy with the title of Patrician was successively intrusted to three Romans and the last and most powerful Mummolus one hundred fourteen who alternately saved and disturbed the monarchy had supplanted his father in the station of count of Autun and left a treasury of thirty talents of gold and two hundred and fifty talents of silver The fierce and illiterate Barbarians were excluded during several generations from the dignities and even from the orders of the church one hundred fifteen The clergy of Gaul consisted almost entirely of native provincials the haughty Franks fell at the feet of their subjects who were dignified with the episcopal character and the power and riches which had been lost in war were insensibly recovered by superstition one hundred sixteen In all temporal affairs the Theodosian Code was the universal law of the clergy but the Barbaric jurisprudence had liberally provided for their personal safety a sub deacon was equivalent to two Franks the antrustion and priest were held in similar estimation and the life of a bishop was appreciated far above the common standard at the price of nine hundred pieces of gold one hundred seventeen The Romans communicated to their conquerors the use of the Christian religion and Latin language one hundred eighteen but their language and their religion had alike degenerated from the simple purity of the Augustan and Apostolic age The progress of superstition and Barbarism was rapid and universal the worship of the saints concealed from vulgar eyes the God of the Christians and the rustic dialect of peasants and soldiers was corrupted by a Teutonic idiom and pronunciation Yet such intercourse of sacred and social communion eradicated the distinctions of birth and victory and the nations of Gaul were gradually confounded under the name and government of the Franks Footnote one hundred twelve The Abbe de Mably tom p i two hundred forty seven two hundred sixty seven has diligently confirmed this opinion of the President de Montesquieu Esprit des Loix l xxx c thirteen Footnote one hundred thirteen See Dubos Hist Critique de la Monarchie Francoise tom ii l vi c nine ten The French antiquarians establish as a principle that the Romans

Academie des Inscriptions tom xxiv p five hundred eighty two six hundred seventy has ascertained the Lingua Romana Rustica which through the medium of the Romance has gradually been polished into the actual form of the French language Under the Carlovingian race the kings and nobles of France still understood the dialect of their German ancestors The Franks after they mingled with their Gallic subjects might have imparted the most valuable of human gifts a spirit and system of constitutional liberty Under a king hereditary but limited the chiefs and counsellors might have debated at Paris in the palace of the Caesars the adjacent field where the emperors reviewed their mercenary legions would have admitted the legislative assembly of freemen and warriors and the rude model which had been sketched in the woods of Germany one hundred nineteen might have been polished and improved by the civil wisdom of the Romans But the careless Barbarians secure of their personal independence disdained the labor of government the annual assemblies of the month of March were silently abolished and the nation was separated and almost dissolved by the conquest of Gaul one hundred twenty The monarchy was left without any regular establishment of justice of arms or of revenue The successors of Clovis wanted resolution to assume or strength to exercise the legislative and executive powers which the people had abdicated the royal prerogative was distinguished only by a more ample privilege of rapine and murder and the love of freedom so often invigorated and disgraced by private ambition was reduced among the licentious Franks to the contempt of order and the desire of impunity Seventy five years after the death of Clovis his grandson Gontran king of Burgundy sent an army to invade the Gothic possessions of Septimania or Languedoc The troops of Burgundy Berry Auvergne and the adjacent territories were excited by the hopes of spoil They marched without discipline under the banners of German or Gallic counts their attack was feeble and unsuccessful but the friendly and hostile provinces were desolated with indiscriminate rage The cornfields the villages the churches themselves were consumed by fire the inhabitants were massacred or dragged into captivity and in the disorderly retreat five thousand of these inhuman savages were destroyed by hunger or intestine discord When the pious Gontran reproached the guilt or neglect of their leaders and threatened to inflict not a legal sentence but instant and arbitrary execution they accused the universal and incurable corruption of the people No one they said any longer fears or respects his king his duke or his count Each man loves to do evil and freely indulges his criminal inclinations The most gentle correction provokes an immediate tumult and the rash magistrate who presumes to censure or restrain his seditious subjects seldom escapes alive from their revenge one hundred twenty one It has been reserved for the same nation to expose by their intemperate vices the most odious abuse of freedom and to supply its loss by the spirit of honor and humanity which now alleviates and dignifies their obedience to an absolute sovereign twelve eleven Footnote one hundred nineteen Ce beau systeme a ete trouve dans les bois Montesquieu Esprit des Loix l xi c six Footnote one hundred twenty See the

nine M The Visigoths had resigned to Clovis the greatest part of their Gallic possessions but their loss was amply compensated by the easy conquest and secure enjoyment of the provinces of Spain From the monarchy of the Goths which soon involved the Suevic kingdom of Gallicia the modern Spaniards still derive some national vanity but the historian of the Roman empire is neither invited nor compelled to pursue the obscure and barren series of their annals one hundred twenty two The Goths of Spain were separated from the rest of mankind by the lofty ridge of the Pyrenaean mountains their manners and institutions as far as they were common to the Germanic tribes have been already explained I have anticipated in the preceding chapter the most important of their ecclesiastical events the fall of Arianism and the persecution of the Jews and it only remains to observe some interesting circumstances which relate to the civil and ecclesiastical constitution of the Spanish kingdom Footnote one hundred twenty two Spain in these dark ages has been peculiarly unfortunate The Franks had a Gregory of Tours the Saxons or Angles a Bede the Lombards a Paul Warnefrid c But the history of the Visigoths is contained in the short and imperfect Chronicles of Isidore of Seville and John of Biclar After their conversion from idolatry or heresy the Frank and the Visigoths were disposed to embrace with equal submission the inherent evils and the accidental benefits of superstition But the prelates of France long before the extinction of the Merovingian race had degenerated into fighting and hunting Barbarians They disdained the use of synods forgot the laws of temperance and chastity and preferred the indulgence of private ambition and luxury to the general interest of the sacerdotal profession one hundred twenty three The bishops of Spain respected themselves and were respected by the public their indissoluble union disguised their vices and confirmed their authority and the regular discipline of the church introduced peace order and stability into the government of the state From the reign of Recared the first Catholic king to that of Witiza the immediate predecessor of the unfortunate Roderic sixteen national councils were successively convened The six metropolitans Toledo Seville Merida Braga Tarragona and Narbonne presided according to their respective seniority the assembly was composed of their suffragan bishops who appeared in person or by their proxies and a place was assigned to the most holy or opulent of the Spanish abbots During the first three days of the convocation as long as they agitated the ecclesiastical question of doctrine and discipline the profane laity was excluded from their debates which were conducted however with decent solemnity But on the morning of the fourth day the doors were thrown open for the entrance of the great officers of the palace the dukes and counts of the provinces the judges of the cities and the Gothic nobles and the decrees of Heaven were ratified by the consent of the people The same rules were observed in the provincial assemblies the annual synods which were empowered to hear complaints and to redress grievances and a legal government was supported by the prevailing influence of the Spanish clergy The bishops who in each revolution were prepared to flatter the victorious and to insult the prostrate labored with diligence and success to kindle the flames of persecution and to exalt the mitre above the crown Yet the national councils of Toledo in which the free spirit of the Barbarians was tempered and guided by episcopal policy have established some prudent laws for the common benefit of the king and people The vacancy of the throne was supplied by the choice of the bishops and palatines and after the failure of the line of Alaric the regal dignity was still limited to the pure and noble blood of the Goths The clergy who anointed their lawful prince always recommended and sometimes practised the duty of allegiance and the spiritual censures were denounced on the heads of the impious subjects who should resist his authority conspire against his life or violate by an indecent union the chastity even of his widow But the monarch himself when he ascended the throne was bound by a reciprocal oath to God and his people that he would faithfully execute this important trust The real or imaginary faults of his administration were subject to the control of a powerful aristocracy and the bishops and palatines were guarded by a fundamental privilege that they should not be degraded imprisoned tortured nor punished with death exile or confiscation unless by the free and public judgment of their peers one hundred twenty four Footnote one hundred twenty three Such are the complaints of saint Boniface the apostle of Germany and the reformer of Gaul in tom iv p ninety four The fourscore years which he deplores of license and corruption would seem to insinuate that the Barbarians were admitted into the clergy about the year six hundred sixty Footnote one hundred twenty four The acts of the councils of Toledo are still the most authentic records of the church and constitution of Spain The following passages are particularly important iii seventeen eighteen iv seventy five v two three four five eight vi eleven twelve thirteen fourteen seventeen eighteen vii one xiii two three six I have found Mascou Hist of the Ancient Germans xv twenty nine and Annotations xxvi and xxxiii and Ferreras Hist Generale de l Espagne tom ii very useful and accurate guides One of these legislative councils of Toledo examined and ratified the code of laws which had been compiled by a succession of Gothic kings from the fierce Euric to the devout Egica As long as the Visigoths themselves were satisfied with the rude customs of their ancestors they indulged their subjects of Aquitain and Spain in the enjoyment of the Roman law Their gradual improvement in arts in policy and at length in religion encouraged them to imitate and to supersede these foreign institutions and to compose a code of civil and criminal jurisprudence for the use of a great and united people The same obligations and the same privileges were communicated to the nations of the Spanish monarchy and the conquerors insensibly renouncing the Teutonic idiom submitted to the restraints of equity and exalted the Romans to the participation of freedom The merit of this impartial policy was enhanced by the situation of Spain under the reign of the Visigoths The provincials were long separated from their Arian masters by the irreconcilable difference of religion After the conversion of Recared had removed the prejudices of the Catholics the coasts both of the Ocean and Mediterranean were still possessed by the Eastern emperors who secretly excited a discontented people to reject the yoke of the Barbarians and to assert the name and dignity of Roman citizens The allegiance of doubtful subjects is indeed most effectually secured by their own persuasion that they hazard more in a revolt than they can hope to obtain by a revolution but it has appeared so natural to oppress those whom we hate and fear that the contrary system well deserves the praise of wisdom and moderation one hundred twenty five Footnote one hundred twenty five The Code of the Visigoths regularly divided into twelve books has been correctly published by Dom Bouquet in tom iv p two hundred seventy three four hundred sixty It has been treated by the President de Montesquieu Esprit des

society than that of the Burgundians or even of the Lombards While the kingdom of the Franks and Visigoths were established in Gaul and Spain the Saxons achieved the conquest of Britain the third great diocese of the Praefecture of the West Since Britain was already separated from the Roman empire I might without reproach decline a story familiar to the most illiterate and obscure to the most learned of my readers The Saxons who excelled in the use of the oar or the battle axe were ignorant of the art which could alone perpetuate the fame of their exploits the Provincials relapsing into barbarism neglected to describe the ruin of their country and the doubtful tradition was almost extinguished before the missionaries of Rome restored the light of science and Christianity The declamations of Gildas the fragments or fables of Nennius the obscure hints of the Saxon laws and chronicles and the ecclesiastical tales of the venerable Bede one hundred twenty six have been illustrated by the diligence and sometimes embellished by the fancy of succeeding writers whose works I am not ambitious either to censure or to transcribe one hundred twenty seven Yet the historian of the empire may be tempted to pursue the revolutions of a Roman province till it vanishes from his sight and an Englishman may curiously trace the establishment of the Barbarians from whom he derives his name his laws and perhaps his origin Footnote one hundred twenty six See Gildas de Excidio Britanniae c eleven twenty five p four nine edit Gale Nennius Hist Britonum c twenty eight thirty

Footnote one hundred twenty seven The laborious mister Carte and the ingenious mister Whitaker are the two modern writers to whom I am principally indebted The particular historian of Manchester embraces under that obscure title a subject almost as extensive as the general history of England Note Add the Anglo Saxon History of mister S Turner and Sir F Palgrave Sketch of the Early History of England M About forty years after the dissolution of the Roman government Vortigern appears to have obtained the supreme though precarious command of the princes and cities of Britain That unfortunate monarch has been almost unanimously condemned for the weak and mischievous policy of inviting one hundred twenty eight a formidable stranger to repel the vexatious inroads of a domestic foe His ambassadors are despatched by the gravest historians to the coast of Germany they address a pathetic oration to the general assembly of the Saxons and those warlike Barbarians resolve to assist with a fleet and army the suppliants of a distant and unknown island If Britain had indeed been unknown to the Saxons the measure of its calamities would have been less complete But the strength of the Roman government could not always guard the maritime province against the pirates of Germany the independent and divided states were exposed to their attacks and the Saxons might sometimes join the Scots and the Picts in a tacit or express confederacy of rapine and destruction Vortigern could only balance the various perils which assaulted on every side his throne and his people and his policy may deserve either praise or excuse if he preferred the alliance of those Barbarians whose naval power rendered them the most dangerous enemies and the most serviceable allies Hengist and Horsa as they ranged along the Eastern coast with three ships were engaged by the promise of an ample stipend to embrace the defence of Britain and their intrepid valor soon delivered the country from the Caledonian invaders The Isle of Thanet a secure and fertile district was allotted for the residence of these German auxiliaries and they were supplied according to the treaty with a plentiful allowance of clothing and provisions This favorable reception encouraged five thousand warriors to embark with their families in seventeen vessels and the infant power of Hengist was fortified by this strong and seasonable reenforcement The crafty Barbarian suggested to Vortigern the obvious advantage of fixing in the neighborhood of the Picts a colony of faithful allies a third fleet of forty ships under the command of his son and nephew sailed from Germany ravaged the Orkneys and disembarked a new army on the coast of Northumberland or Lothian at the opposite extremity of the devoted land It was easy to foresee but it was impossible to prevent the impending evils The two nations were soon divided and exasperated by mutual jealousies The Saxons magnified all that they had done and suffered in the cause of an ungrateful people while the Britons regretted the liberal rewards which could not satisfy the avarice of those haughty mercenaries The causes of fear and hatred were inflamed into an irreconcilable quarrel The Saxons flew to arms and if they perpetrated a treacherous massacre during the security of a feast they destroyed the reciprocal confidence which sustains the intercourse of peace and war one hundred twenty nine Footnote one hundred twenty eight This invitation which may derive some countenance from the loose expressions of Gildas and Bede is framed into a regular story by Witikind a Saxon monk of the tenth century see Cousin Hist de l Empire d Occident tom ii p three hundred fifty six Rapin and even Hume have too freely used this suspicious evidence without regarding the precise and probable testimony of Tennius Iterea venerunt tres Chinlae a exilio pulsoe in quibus erant Hors et Hengist Footnote one hundred twenty nine Nennius imputes to the Saxons the murder of three hundred British chiefs a crime not unsuitable to their savage manners But we are not obliged to believe see Jeffrey of Monmouth l viii c nine twelve that Stonehenge is their monument which the giants had formerly transported from Africa to Ireland and which was removed to Britain by the order of Ambrosius and the art of Merlin Note Sir f Palgrave Hist of England p thirty six is inclined to resolve the whole of these stories as Niebuhr the older Roman history into poetry To the editor they appeared in early youth so essentially poetic as to justify the rash attempt to embody them in an Epic Poem called Samor commenced at Eton and finished before he had arrived at the maturer taste of manhood M Hengist who boldly aspired to the conquest of Britain exhorted his countrymen to embrace the glorious opportunity he painted in lively colors the fertility of the soil the wealth of the cities the pusillanimous temper of the natives and the convenient situation of a spacious solitary island accessible on all sides to the Saxon fleets The successive colonies which issued in the period of a century from the mouths of the Elbe the Weser and the Rhine were principally composed of three valiant tribes or nations of Germany the Jutes the old Saxons and the Angles The Jutes who fought under the peculiar banner of Hengist assumed the merit of leading their countrymen in the paths of glory and of erecting in Kent the first independent kingdom The fame of the enterprise was attributed to the primitive Saxons and the common laws and language of the conquerors are described by the national appellation of a people which at the end of four hundred years produced the first monarchs of South Britain The Angles were distinguished by their numbers and their success and they claimed the honor of fixing a perpetual name on the country of which they occupied the most ample portion The Barbarians who followed the hopes of rapine either on the land or sea were insensibly blended with this triple confederacy the Frisians who had been tempted by their vicinity to the British shores might balance during a short space the strength and reputation of the native Saxons the Danes the Prussians the Rugians are faintly described and some adventurous Huns who had wandered as far as the Baltic might embark on board the German vessels for the conquest of a new world one hundred thirty But this arduous achievement was not prepared or executed by the union of national powers Each intrepid chieftain according to the measure of his fame and fortunes assembled his followers equipped a fleet of three or perhaps of sixty vessels chose the place of the attack and conducted his subsequent operations according to the events of the war and the dictates of his private interest In the invasion of Britain many heroes vanquished and fell but only seven victorious leaders assumed or at least maintained the title of kings Seven independent thrones the Saxon Heptarchy thirteen oh one were founded by the conquerors and seven families one of which has been continued by female succession to our present sovereign derived their equal and sacred lineage from Woden the god of war It has been pretended that this republic of kings was moderated by a general council and a supreme magistrate But such an artificial scheme of policy is repugnant to the rude and turbulent spirit of the Saxons their laws are silent and their imperfect annals afford only a dark and bloody prospect of intestine discord one hundred thirty one Footnote one hundred thirty All these tribes are expressly enumerated by Bede l i c fifteen p fifty two l v c nine p one hundred ninety and though I have considered mister Whitaker s remarks Hist of Manchester vol ii p five hundred thirty eight five hundred forty three I do not perceive the absurdity of supposing that the Frisians c were mingled with the Anglo Saxons Footnote thirteen oh one This term the Heptarchy must be rejected because an idea is conveyed thereby which is substantially wrong At no one period were there ever seven kingdoms independent of each other Palgrave vol i p forty six mister Sharon Turner has the merit of having first confuted the popular notion on this subject Anglo Saxon History vol i p three hundred two M Footnote one hundred thirty one Bede has enumerated seven kings two Saxons a Jute and four Angles who successively acquired in the heptarchy an indefinite supremacy of power and renown But their reign was the effect not of law but of conquest and he observes in similar terms that one of them subdued the Isles of Man and Anglesey and that another imposed a tribute on the Scots and Picts Hist Eccles l ii c five p eighty three A monk who in the profound ignorance of human life has presumed to exercise the office of historian strangely disfigures the state of Britain at the time of its separation from the Western empire Gildas one hundred thirty two describes in florid language the improvements of agriculture the foreign trade which flowed with every tide into the Thames and the Severn the solid and lofty construction of public and private edifices he accuses the sinful luxury of the British people of a people according to the same writer ignorant of the most simple arts and incapable without the aid of the Romans of providing walls of stone or weapons of iron for the defence of their native land one hundred thirty three Under the long dominion of the emperors Britain had been insensibly moulded into the elegant and servile form of a Roman province whose safety was intrusted to a foreign power The subjects of Honorius contemplated their new freedom with surprise and terror they were left destitute of any civil or military constitution and their uncertain rulers wanted either skill or courage or authority to direct the public force against the common enemy The introduction of the Saxons betrayed their internal weakness and degraded the character both of the prince and people Their consternation magnified the danger the want of union diminished their resources and the madness of civil factions was more solicitous to accuse than to remedy the evils which they imputed to the misconduct of their adversaries Yet the Britons were not ignorant they could not be ignorant of the manufacture or the use of arms the successive and disorderly attacks of the Saxons allowed them to recover from their amazement and the prosperous or adverse events of the war added discipline and experience to their native valor Footnote one hundred thirty two See Gildas de Excidio Britanniae c i p l edit Gale Footnote one hundred thirty three mister Whitaker Hist of Manchester vol ii p five hundred three five hundred sixteen has smartly exposed this glaring absurdity which had passed unnoticed by the general historians as they were hastening to more interesting and important events While the continent of Europe and Africa yielded without resistance to the Barbarians the British island alone and unaided maintained a long a vigorous though an unsuccessful struggle against the formidable pirates who almost at the same instant assaulted the Northern the Eastern and the Southern coasts The cities which had been fortified with skill were defended with resolution the advantages of ground hills forests and morasses were diligently improved by the inhabitants the conquest of each district was purchased with blood and the defeats of the Saxons are strongly attested by the discreet silence of their annalist Hengist might hope to achieve the conquest of Britain but his ambition in an active reign of thirty five years was confined to the possession of Kent and the numerous colony which he had planted in the North was extirpated by the sword of the Britons The monarchy of the West Saxons was laboriously founded by the persevering efforts of three martial generations The life of Cerdic one of the bravest of the children of Woden was consumed in the conquest of Hampshire and the Isle of Wight and the loss which he sustained in the battle of Mount Badon reduced him to a state of inglorious repose Kenric his valiant son advanced into Wiltshire besieged Salisbury at that time seated on a commanding eminence and vanquished an army which advanced to the relief of the city In the subsequent battle of Marlborough one hundred thirty four his British enemies displayed their military science Their troops were formed in three lines each line consisted of three distinct bodies and the cavalry the archers and the pikemen were distributed according to the principles of Roman tactics The Saxons charged in one weighty column boldly encountered with their shord swords the long lances of the Britons and maintained an equal conflict till the approach of night Two decisive victories the death of three British kings and the reduction of Cirencester Bath and Gloucester established the fame and power of Ceaulin the grandson of Cerdic who carried his victorious arms to the banks of the Severn Footnote one hundred thirty four At Beran birig or Barbury castle near Marlborough The Saxon chronicle assigns the name and date Camden Britannia vol i p one hundred twenty eight ascertains the place and Henry of Huntingdon Scriptores pest Bedam p three hundred fourteen relates the circumstances of this battle They are probable and characteristic and the historians of the twelfth century might consult some materials that no longer exist After a war of a hundred years the independent Britons still occupied the whole extent of the Western coast from the wall of Antoninus to the extreme promontory of Cornwall and the principal cities of the inland country still opposed the arms of the Barbarians Resistance became more languid as the number and boldness of the assailants continually increased Winning their way by slow and painful efforts the Saxons the Angles and their various confederates advanced from the North from the East and from the South till their victorious banners were united in the centre of the island Beyond the Severn the Britons still asserted their national freedom which survived the heptarchy and even the monarchy of the Saxons The bravest warriors who preferred exile to slavery found a secure refuge in the mountains of Wales the reluctant submission of Cornwall was delayed for some ages one hundred thirty five and a band of fugitives acquired a settlement in Gaul by their own valor or the liberality of the Merovingian kings one hundred thirty six The Western angle of Armorica acquired the new appellations of Cornwall and the Lesser Britain and the vacant lands of the Osismii were filled by a strange people who under the authority of their counts and bishops preserved the laws and language of their ancestors To the feeble descendants of Clovis and Charlemagne the Britons of Armorica refused the customary tribute subdued the neighboring dioceses of Vannes Rennes and Nantes and formed a powerful though vassal state which has been united to the crown of France one hundred thirty seven Footnote one hundred thirty five Cornwall was finally subdued by Athelstan A D nine hundred twenty seven nine hundred forty one who planted an English colony at Exeter and confined the Britons beyond the River Tamar See William of Malmsbury l ii in the Scriptores

Note Compare Gallet Memoires sur la Bretagne and Daru Histoire de Bretagne These authors appear to me to establish the point of the independence of Bretagne at the time that the insular Britons took

military colony formed of British soldiers Milites limitanei laeti during the usurpation of Maximus three hundred eighty one three hundred eighty eight who gave their name and peculiar civilization to Bretagne M Lappenberg expresses his surprise that Gibbon here rejects the authority which he follows elsewhere M Chapter XXXVIII Reign Of Clovis Part V In a century of perpetual or at least implacable war much courage and some skill must have been exerted for the defence of Britain Yet if the memory of its champions is almost buried in oblivion we need not repine since every age however destitute of science or virtue sufficiently abounds with acts of blood and military renown The tomb of Vortimer the son of Vortigern was erected on the margin of the sea shore as a landmark formidable to the Saxons whom he had thrice vanquished in the fields of Kent Ambrosius Aurelian was descended from a noble family of Romans one hundred thirty eight his modesty was equal to his valor and his valor till the last fatal action one hundred thirty nine was crowned with splendid success But every British name is effaced by the illustrious name of Arthur one hundred forty the hereditary prince of the Silures in South Wales and the elective king or general of the nation According to the most rational account he defeated in twelve successive battles the Angles of the North and the Saxons of the West but the declining age of the hero was imbittered by popular ingratitude and domestic misfortunes The events of his life are less interesting than the singular revolutions of his fame During a period of five hundred years the tradition of his exploits was preserved and rudely embellished by the obscure bards of Wales and Armorica who were odious to the Saxons and unknown to the rest of mankind The pride and curiosity of the Norman conquerors prompted them to inquire into the ancient history of Britain they listened with fond credulity to the tale of Arthur and eagerly applauded the merit of a prince who had triumphed over the Saxons their common enemies His romance transcribed in the Latin of Jeffrey of Monmouth and afterwards translated into the fashionable idiom of the times was enriched with the various though incoherent ornaments which were familiar to the experience the learning or the fancy of the twelfth century The progress of a Phrygian colony from the Tyber to the Thames was easily ingrafted on the fable of the Aeneid and the royal ancestors of Arthur derived their origin from Troy and claimed their alliance with the Caesars His trophies were decorated with captive provinces and Imperial titles and his Danish victories avenged the recent injuries of his country The gallantry and superstition of the British hero his feasts and tournaments and the memorable institution of his Knights of the Round Table were faithfully copied from the reigning manners of chivalry and the fabulous exploits of Uther s son appear less incredible than the adventures which were achieved by the enterprising valor of the Normans Pilgrimage and the holy wars introduced into Europe the specious miracles of Arabian magic Fairies and giants flying dragons and enchanted palaces were blended with the more simple fictions of the West and the fate of Britain depended on the art or the predictions of Merlin Every nation embraced and adorned the popular romance of Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table their names were celebrated in Greece and Italy and the voluminous tales of Sir Lancelot and Sir Tristram were devoutly studied by the princes and nobles who disregarded the genuine heroes and historians of antiquity At length the light of science and reason was rekindled the talisman was broken the visionary fabric melted into air and by a natural though unjust reverse of the public opinion the severity of the present age is inclined to question the existence of Arthur one hundred forty one Footnote one hundred thirty eight Bede who in his chronicle p

that Gibbon means Llywarch Hen or the Aged The Elegies of this Welsh prince and bard have been published by mister Owen to whose works and in the Myvyrian Archaeology slumbers much curious information on the subject of Welsh tradition and poetry But the Welsh antiquarians have never obtained a hearing from the public they have had no Macpherson to compensate for his corruption of their poetic legends by forcing them into popularity See also mister Sharon Turner s Essay on the Welsh Bards M Footnote one hundred forty one The progress of romance and the state of learning in the middle ages are illustrated by mister Thomas Warton with the taste of a poet and the minute diligence of an antiquarian I have derived much instruction from the two learned dissertations prefixed to the first volume of his History of English Poetry Note These valuable dissertations should not now be read without the notes and preliminary essay of the late editor mister Price which in point of taste and fulness of information are worthy of accompanying and completing those of Warton M Resistance if it cannot avert must increase the miseries of conquest and conquest has never appeared more dreadful and destructive than in the hands of the Saxons who hated the valor of their enemies disdained the faith of treaties and violated without remorse the most sacred objects of the Christian worship The fields of battle might be traced almost in every district by monuments of bones the fragments of falling towers were stained with blood the last of the Britons without distinction of age or sex was massacred one hundred forty two in the ruins of Anderida one hundred forty three and the repetition of such calamities was frequent and familiar under the Saxon heptarchy The arts and religion the laws and language which the Romans had so carefully planted in Britain were extirpated by their barbarous successors After the destruction of the principal churches the bishops who had declined the crown of martyrdom retired with the holy relics into Wales and Armorica the remains of their flocks were left destitute of any spiritual food the practice and even the remembrance of Christianity were abolished and the British clergy might obtain some comfort from the damnation of the idolatrous strangers The kings of France maintained the privileges of their Roman subjects but the ferocious Saxons trampled on the laws of Rome and of the emperors The proceedings of civil and criminal jurisdiction the titles of honor the forms of office the ranks of society and even the domestic rights of marriage testament and inheritance were finally suppressed and the indiscriminate crowd of noble and plebeian slaves was governed by the traditionary customs which had been coarsely framed for the shepherds and pirates of Germany The language of science of business and of conversation which had been introduced by the Romans was lost in the general desolation A sufficient number of Latin or Celtic words might be assumed by the Germans to express their new wants and ideas one hundred forty four but those illiterate Pagans preserved and established the use of their national dialect one hundred forty five Almost every name conspicuous either in the church or state reveals its Teutonic origin one hundred forty six and the geography of England was universally inscribed with foreign characters and appellations The example of a revolution so rapid and so complete may not easily be found but it will excite a probable suspicion that the arts of Rome were less deeply rooted in Britain than in Gaul or Spain and that the native rudeness of the country and its inhabitants was covered by a thin varnish of Italian manners Footnote one hundred forty two Hoc anno four hundred

Footnote one hundred forty four doctor Johnson affirms that few English words are of British extraction mister Whitaker who understands the British language has discovered more than three thousand and actually produces a long and various catalogue vol ii p two hundred thirty five three hundred twenty nine It is possible indeed that many of these words may have been imported from the Latin or Saxon into the native idiom of Britain Note doctor Prichard s very curious researches which connect the Celtic as well as the Teutonic languages with the Indo European class make it still more difficult to decide between the Celtic or Teutonic origin of English words See Prichard on the Eastern Origin of the Celtic Nations Oxford eighteen thirty one M Footnote one hundred forty five In the beginning of the seventh century the Franks and the Anglo Saxons mutually understood each other s language which was derived from the same Teutonic root Bede l i c twenty five p sixty Footnote one hundred forty six After the first generation of Italian or Scottish missionaries the dignities of the church were filled with Saxon proselytes This strange alteration has persuaded historians and even philosophers that the provincials of Britain were totally exterminated and that the vacant land was again peopled by the perpetual influx and rapid increase of the German colonies Three hundred thousand Saxons are said to have obeyed the summons of Hengist one hundred forty seven the entire emigation of the Angles was attested in the age of Bede by the solitude of their native country one hundred forty eight and our experience has shown the free propagation of the human race if they are cast on a fruitful wilderness where their steps are unconfined and their subsistence is plentiful The Saxon kingdoms displayed the face of recent discovery and cultivation the towns were small the villages were distant the husbandry was languid and unskilful four sheep were equivalent to an acre of the best land one hundred forty nine an ample space of wood and morass was resigned to the vague dominion of nature and the modern bishopric of Durham the whole territory from the Tyne to the Tees had returned to its primitive state of a savage and solitary forest one hundred fifty Such imperfect population might have been supplied in some generations by the English colonies but neither reason nor facts can justify the unnatural supposition that the Saxons of Britain remained alone in the desert which they had subdued After the sanguinary Barbarians had secured their dominion and gratified their revenge it was their interest to preserve the peasants as well as the cattle of the unresisting country In each successive revolution the patient herd becomes the property of its new masters and the salutary compact of food and labor is silently ratified by their mutual necessities Wilfrid the apostle of Sussex one hundred fifty one accepted from his royal convert the gift of the Vpeninsula of Selsey near Chichester with the persons and property of its inhabitants who then amounted to eighty seven families He released them at once from spiritual and temporal bondage and two hundred and fifty slaves of both sexes were baptized by their indulgent master The kingdom of Sussex which spread from the sea to the Thames contained seven thousand families twelve hundred were ascribed to the Isle of Wight and if we multiply this vague computation it may seem probable that England was cultivated by a million of servants or villains who were attached to the estates of their arbitrary landlords The indigent Barbarians were often tempted to sell their children or themselves into perpetual and even foreign bondage one hundred fifty two yet the special exemptions which were granted to national slaves one hundred fifty three sufficiently declare that they were much less numerous than the strangers and captives who had lost their liberty or changed their masters by the accidents of war When time and religion had mitigated the fierce spirit of the Anglo Saxons the laws encouraged the frequent practice of manumission and their subjects of Welsh or Cambrian extraction assumed the respectable station of inferior freemen possessed of lands and entitled to the rights of civil society one hundred fifty four Such gentle treatment might secure the allegiance of a fierce people who had been recently

fifty five See Carte s Hist of England vol i p two hundred seventy eight The independent Britons appear to have relapsed into the state of original barbarism from whence they had been imperfectly reclaimed Separated by their enemies from the rest of mankind they soon became an object of scandal and abhorrence to the Catholic world one hundred fifty six Christianity was still professed in the mountains of Wales but the rude schismatics in the form of the clerical tonsure and in the day of the celebration of Easter obstinately resisted the imperious mandates of the Roman pontiffs The use of the Latin language was insensibly abolished and the Britons were deprived of the art and learning which Italy communicated to her Saxon proselytes In Wales and Armorica the Celtic tongue the native idiom of the West was preserved and propagated and the Bards who had been the companions of the Druids were still protected in the sixteenth century by the laws of Elizabeth Their chief a respectable officer of the courts of Pengwern or Aberfraw or Caermarthen accompanied the king s servants to war the monarchy of the Britons which he sung in the front of battle excited their courage and justified their depredations and the songster claimed for his legitimate prize the fairest heifer of the spoil His subordinate ministers the masters and disciples of vocal and instrumental music visited in their respective circuits the royal the noble and the plebeian houses and the public poverty almost exhausted by the clergy was oppressed by the importunate demands of the bards Their rank and merit were ascertained by solemn trials and the strong belief of supernatural inspiration exalted the fancy of the poet and of his audience one hundred fifty seven The last retreats of Celtic freedom the extreme territories of Gaul and Britain were less adapted to agriculture than to pasturage the wealth of the Britons consisted in their flocks and herds milk and flesh were their ordinary food and bread was sometimes esteemed or rejected as a foreign luxury Liberty had peopled the mountains of Wales and the morasses of Armorica but their populousness has been maliciously ascribed to the loose practice of polygamy and the houses of these licentious barbarians have been supposed to contain ten wives and perhaps fifty children one hundred fifty eight Their disposition was rash and choleric they were bold in action and in speech one hundred fifty nine and as they were ignorant of the arts of peace they alternately indulged their passions in foreign and domestic war The cavalry of Armorica the spearmen of Gwent and the archers of Merioneth were equally formidable but their poverty could seldom procure either shields or helmets and the inconvenient weight would have retarded the speed and agility of their desultory operations One of the greatest of the English monarchs was requested to satisfy the curiosity of a Greek emperor concerning the state of Britain and Henry II could

reign of Honorius the gravest historian of the times one hundred sixty one describes the wonders of a remote isle whose eastern and western parts are divided by an antique wall the boundary of life and death or more properly of truth and fiction The east is a fair country inhabited by a civilized people the air is healthy the waters are pure and plentiful and the earth yields her regular and fruitful increase In the west beyond the wall the air is infectious and mortal the ground is covered with serpents and this dreary solitude is the region of departed spirits who are transported from

less than thirty miles from the continent that it is possessed by three nations the Frisians the Angles and the Britons and that some Angles had appeared at Constantinople in the train of the French ambassadors From these ambassadors Procopius might be informed of a singular though not improbable adventure which announces the spirit rather than the delicacy of an English heroine She had been betrothed to Radiger king of the Varni a tribe of Germans who touched the ocean and the Rhine but the perfidious lover was tempted by motives of policy to prefer his father s widow the sister of Theodebert king of the Franks one hundred sixty two The forsaken princess of the Angles instead of bewailing revenged her disgrace Her warlike subjects are said to have been ignorant of the use and even of the form of a horse but she boldly sailed from Britain to the mouth of the Rhine with a fleet of four hundred ships and an army of one hundred thousand men After the loss of a battle the captive Radiger implored the mercy of his victorious bride who generously pardoned his offence dismissed her rival and compelled the king of the Varni to discharge with honor and fidelity the duties of a husband one hundred sixty three This gallant exploit appears to be the last naval enterprise of the Anglo Saxons The arts of navigation by which they acquired the empire of Britain and of the sea were soon neglected by the indolent Barbarians who supinely renounced all the commercial advantages of their insular situation Seven independent kingdoms were agitated by perpetual discord and the British world was seldom connected either in peace or war with the nations of the Continent one hundred sixty four Footnote one hundred sixty one See Procopius de Bell Gothic l iv c twenty p six hundred twenty six hundred twenty five The Greek historian is himself so confounded by the wonders which he relates that he weakly attempts to distinguish the islands of Britia and Britain which he has identified by so many inseparable circumstances Footnote one hundred sixty two Theodebert grandson of Clovis and king of Austrasia was the most powerful and warlike prince of the age and this remarkable adventure may be placed between the years five hundred thirty four and five hundred forty seven the extreme terms of his reign His sister Theudechildis retired to Sens where she founded monasteries and distributed alms see the notes of the Benedictine editors in tom ii p two hundred sixteen If we may credit the praises of Fortunatus l vi carm five in tom ii p five hundred seven Radiger was deprived of a most valuable wife Footnote one hundred sixty three Perhaps she was the sister of one of the princes or chiefs of the Angles who landed in five hundred twenty seven and the following years between the Humber and the Thames and gradually founded the kingdoms of East Anglia and Mercia The English writers are ignorant of her name and existence but Procopius may have suggested to mister Rowe the character and situation of Rodogune in the tragedy of the Royal Convert Footnote one hundred sixty four In the copious history of Gregory of Tours we cannot find any traces of hostile or friendly intercourse between France and England except in the marriage of the daughter of Caribert king of Paris quam regis cujusdam in Cantia filius matrimonio copulavit l ix c twenty eight in tom ii p three hundred forty eight The bishop of Tours ended his history and his life almost immediately before the conversion of Kent I have now accomplished the laborious narrative of the decline and fall of the Roman empire from the fortunate age of Trajan and the Antonines to its total extinction in the West about five centuries after the Christian era At that unhappy period the Saxons fiercely struggled with the natives for the possession of Britain Gaul and Spain were divided between the powerful monarchies of the Franks and Visigoths and the dependent kingdoms of the Suevi and Burgundians Africa was exposed to the cruel persecution of the Vandals and the savage insults of the Moors Rome and Italy as far as the banks of the Danube were afflicted by an army of Barbarian mercenaries whose lawless tyranny was succeeded by the reign of Theodoric the Ostrogoth All the subjects of the empire who by the use of the Latin language more particularly deserved the name and privileges of Romans were oppressed by the disgrace and calamities of foreign conquest and the victorious nations of Germany established a new system of manners and government in the western countries of Europe The majesty of Rome was faintly represented by the princes of Constantinople the feeble and imaginary successors of Augustus Yet they continued to reign over the East from the Danube to the Nile and Tigris the Gothic and Vandal kingdoms of Italy and Africa were subverted by the arms of Justinian and the history of the Greek emperors may still afford a long series of instructive lessons and interesting revolutions Chapter XXXVIII Reign Of Clovis Part VI General Observations On The Fall Of The Roman Empire In The West The Greeks after their country had been reduced into a province imputed the triumphs of Rome not to the merit but to the fortune of the republic The inconstant goddess who so blindly distributes and resumes her favors had now consented such was the language of envious flattery to resign her wings to descend from her globe and to fix her firm and immutable throne on the banks of the Tyber one thousand A wiser Greek who has composed with a philosophic spirit the memorable history of his own times deprived his countrymen of this vain and delusive comfort by opening to their view the deep foundations of the greatness of Rome two thousand The fidelity of the citizens to each other and to the state was confirmed by the habits of education and the prejudices of religion Honor as well as virtue was the principle of the republic the ambitious citizens labored to deserve the solemn glories of a triumph and the ardor of the Roman youth was kindled into active emulation as often as they beheld the domestic images of their ancestors three thousand The temperate struggles of the patricians and plebeians had finally established the firm and equal balance of the constitution which united the freedom of popular assemblies with the authority and wisdom of a senate and the executive powers of a regal magistrate When the consul displayed the standard of the republic each citizen bound himself by the obligation of an oath to draw his sword in the cause of his country till he had discharged the sacred duty by a military service of ten years This wise institution continually poured into the field the rising generations of freemen and soldiers and their numbers were reenforced by the warlike and populous states of Italy who after a brave resistance had yielded to the valor and embraced the alliance of the Romans The sage historian who excited the virtue of the younger Scipio and beheld the ruin of Carthage four thousand has accurately described their military system their levies arms exercises subordination marches encampments and the invincible legion superior in active strength to the Macedonian phalanx of Philip and Alexander From these institutions of peace and war Polybius has deduced the spirit and success of a people incapable of fear and impatient of repose The ambitious design of conquest which might have been defeated by the seasonable conspiracy of mankind was attempted and achieved and the perpetual violation of justice was maintained by the political virtues of prudence and courage The arms of the republic sometimes vanquished in battle always victorious in war advanced with rapid steps to the Euphrates the Danube the Rhine and the Ocean and the images of gold or silver or brass that might serve to represent the nations and their kings were successively broken by the iron monarchy of Rome five thousand Footnote one thousand Such are the figurative expressions of Plutarch Opera tom ii p three hundred eighteen edit Wechel to whom on the faith of his son Lamprias Fabricius Bibliot Graec tom iii p three hundred forty one I shall boldly impute the malicious declamation The same opinions had prevailed among the Greeks two hundred and fifty years before Plutarch and to confute them is the professed intention of Polybius Hist l i p ninety edit Gronov Amstel sixteen seventy Footnote two thousand See the inestimable remains of the sixth book of Polybius and many other parts of his general history particularly a digression in the seventeenth book in which he compares the phalanx and the legion Footnote three thousand Sallust de Bell Jugurthin c four Such were the generous professions of P Scipio and Q Maximus The Latin historian had read and most probably transcribes Polybius their contemporary and friend Footnote four thousand While Carthage was in flames Scipio repeated two lines of the Iliad which express the destruction of Troy acknowledging to Polybius his friend and preceptor Polyb in Excerpt de Virtut et Vit tom ii p fourteen fifty five fourteen sixty five that while he recollected the vicissitudes of human affairs he inwardly applied them to the future calamities of Rome Appian in Libycis p one hundred thirty six edit Toll Footnote five thousand See Daniel ii thirty one forty And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things The remainder of the prophecy the mixture of iron and clay was accomplished according to saint Jerom in his own time Sicut enim in principio nihil Romano Imperio fortius et durius ita in fine rerum nihil imbecillius quum et in bellis civilibus et adversus diversas nationes aliarum gentium barbararum auxilio indigemus Opera tom v p five hundred seventy two The rise of a city which swelled into an empire may deserve as a singular prodigy the reflection of a philosophic mind But the decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness Prosperity ripened the principle of decay the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest and as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight The story of its ruin is simple and obvious and instead of inquiring why the Roman empire was destroyed we should rather be surprised that it had subsisted so long The victorious legions who in distant wars acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries first oppressed the freedom of the republic and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple The emperors anxious for their personal safety and the public peace were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy the vigor of the military government was relaxed and finally dissolved by the partial institutions of Constantine and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians The decay of Rome has been frequently ascribed to the translation of the seat of empire but this History has already shown that the powers of government were divided rather than removed The throne of Constantinople was erected in the East while the West was still possessed by a series of emperors who held their residence in Italy and claimed their equal inheritance of the legions and provinces This dangerous novelty impaired the strength and fomented the vices of a double reign the instruments of an oppressive and arbitrary system were multiplied and a vain emulation of luxury not of merit was introduced and supported between the degenerate successors of Theodosius Extreme distress which unites the virtue of a free people imbitters the factions of a declining monarchy The hostile favorites of Arcadius and Honorius betrayed the republic to its common enemies and the Byzantine court beheld with indifference perhaps with pleasure the disgrace of Rome the misfortunes of Italy and the loss of the West Under the succeeding reigns the alliance of the two empires was restored but the aid of the Oriental Romans was tardy doubtful and ineffectual and the national schism of the Greeks and Latins was enlarged by the perpetual difference of language and manners of interests and even of religion Yet the salutary event approved in some measure the judgment of Constantine During a long period of decay his impregnable city repelled the victorious armies of Barbarians protected the wealth of Asia and commanded both in peace and war the important straits which connect the Euxine and Mediterranean Seas The foundation of Constantinople more essentially contributed to the preservation of the East than to the ruin of the West As the happiness of a future life is the great object of religion we may hear without surprise or scandal that the introduction or at least the abuse of Christianity had some influence on the decline and fall of the Roman empire The clergy successfully preached the doctrines of patience and pusillanimity the active virtues of society were discouraged and the last remains of military spirit were buried in the cloister a large portion of public and private wealth was consecrated to the specious demands of charity and devotion and the soldiers pay was lavished on the useless multitudes of both sexes who could only plead the merits of abstinence and chastity five hundred eleven Faith zeal curiosity and the more earthly passions of malice and ambition kindled the flame of theological discord the church and even the state were distracted by religious factions whose conflicts were sometimes bloody and always implacable the attention of the emperors was diverted from camps to synods the Roman world was oppressed by a new species of tyranny and the persecuted sects became the secret enemies of their country Yet party spirit however pernicious or absurd is a principle of union as well as of dissension The bishops from eighteen hundred pulpits inculcated the duty of passive obedience to a lawful and orthodox sovereign their frequent assemblies and perpetual correspondence maintained the communion of distant churches and the benevolent temper of the gospel was strengthened though confined by the spiritual alliance of the Catholics The sacred indolence of the monks was devoutly embraced by a servile and effeminate age but if superstition had not afforded a decent retreat the same vices would have tempted the unworthy Romans to desert from baser motives the standard of the republic Religious precepts are easily obeyed which indulge and sanctify the natural inclinations of their votaries but the pure and genuine influence of Christianity may be traced in its beneficial though imperfect effects on the Barbarian proselytes of the North If the decline of the Roman empire was hastened by the conversion of Constantine his victorious religion broke the violence of the fall and mollified the ferocious temper of the conquerors Footnote five hundred eleven It might be a curious speculation how far the purer morals of the genuine and more active Christians may have compensated in the population of the Roman empire for the secession of such numbers into inactive and unproductive celibacy M This awful revolution may be usefully applied to the instruction of the present age It is the duty of a patriot to prefer and promote the exclusive interest and glory of his native country but a philosmay be permitted to enlarge his views and to consider Europe as one great republic whose various inhabitants have obtained almost the same level of politeness and cultivation The balance of power will continue to fluctuate and the prosperity of our own or the neighboring kingdoms may be alternately exalted or depressed but these partial events cannot essentially injure our general state of happiness the system of arts and laws and manners which so advantageously distinguish above the rest of mankind the Europeans and their colonies The savage nations of the globe are the common enemies of civilized society and we may inquire with anxious curiosity whether Europe is still threatened with a repetition of those calamities which formerly oppressed the arms and institutions of Rome Perhaps the same reflections will illustrate the fall of that mighty empire and explain the probable causes of our actual security I The Romans were ignorant of the extent of their danger and the number of their enemies Beyond the Rhine and Danube the Northern countries of Europe and Asia were filled with innumerable tribes of hunters and shepherds poor voracious and turbulent bold in arms and impatient to ravish the fruits of industry The Barbarian world was agitated by the rapid impulse of war and the peace of Gaul or Italy was shaken by the distant revolutions of China The Huns who fled before a victorious enemy directed their march towards the West and the torrent was swelled by the gradual accession of captives and allies The flying tribes who yielded to the Huns assumed in their turn the spirit of conquest the endless column of Barbarians pressed on the Roman empire with accumulated weight and if the foremost were destroyed the vacant space was instantly replenished by new assailants Such formidable emigrations can no longer issue from the North and the long repose which has been imputed to the decrease of population is the happy consequence of the progress of arts and agriculture Instead of some rude villages thinly scattered among its woods and morasses Germany now produces a list of two thousand three hundred walled towns the Christian kingdoms of Denmark Sweden and Poland have been successively established and the Hanse merchants with the Teutonic knights have extended their colonies along the coast of the Baltic as far as the Gulf of Finland From the Gulf of Finland to the Eastern Ocean Russia now assumes the form of a powerful and civilized empire The plough the loom and the forge are introduced on the banks of the Volga the Oby and the Lena and the fiercest of the Tartar hordes have been taught to tremble and obey The reign of independent Barbarism is now contracted to a narrow span and the remnant of Calmucks or Uzbecks whose forces may be almost numbered cannot seriously excite the apprehensions of the great republic of Europe six thousand Yet this apparent security should not tempt us to forget that new enemies and unknown dangers may possibly arise from some obscure people scarcely visible in the map of the world The Arabs or Saracens who spread their conquests from India to Spain had languished in poverty and contempt till Mahomet breathed into those savage bodies the soul of enthusiasm Footnote six thousand The French and English editors of the Genealogical History of the Tartars have subjoined a curious though imperfect description of their present state We might question the independence of the Calmucks or Eluths since they have been recently vanquished by the Chinese who in the year seventeen fifty nine subdued the Lesser Bucharia and advanced into the country of Badakshan near the source of the Oxus Memoires sur les Chinois tom i p three hundred twenty five four hundred But these conquests are precarious nor will I venture to insure the safety of the Chinese empire II The empire of Rome was firmly established by the singular and perfect coalition of its members The subject nations resigning the hope and even the wish of independence embraced the character of Roman citizens and the provinces of the West were reluctantly torn by the Barbarians from the bosom of their mother country seven thousand But this union was purchased by the loss of national freedom and military spirit and the servile provinces destitute of life and motion expected their safety from the mercenary troops and governors who were directed by the orders of a distant court The happiness of a hundred millions depended on the personal merit of one or two men perhaps children whose minds were corrupted by education luxury and despotic power The deepest wounds were inflicted on the empire during the minorities of the sons and grandsons of Theodosius and after those incapable princes seemed to attain the age of manhood they abandoned the church to the bishops the state to the eunuchs and the provinces to the Barbarians Europe is now divided into twelve powerful though unequal kingdoms three respectable commonwealths and a variety of smaller though independent states the chances of royal and ministerial talents are multiplied at least with the number of its rulers and a Julian or Semiramis may reign in the North while Arcadius and Honorius again slumber on the thrones of the South The abuses of tyranny are restrained by the mutual influence of fear and shame republics have acquired order and stability monarchies have imbibed the principles of freedom or at least of moderation and some sense of honor and justice is introduced into the most defective constitutions by the general manners of the times In peace the progress of knowledge and industry is accelerated by the emulation of so many active rivals in war the European forces are exercised by temperate and undecisive contests If a savage conqueror should issue from the deserts of Tartary he must repeatedly vanquish the robust peasants of Russia the numerous armies of Germany the gallant nobles of France and the intrepid freemen of Britain who perhaps might confederate for their common defence Should the victorious Barbarians carry slavery and desolation as far as the Atlantic Ocean ten thousand vessels would transport beyond their pursuit the remains of civilized society and Europe would revive and flourish in the American world which is already filled with her colonies and institutions eight thousand Footnote seven thousand The prudent reader will determine how far this general proposition is weakened by the revolt of the Isaurians the independence of Britain and Armorica the Moorish tribes or the Bagaudae of Gaul and Spain vol i p three hundred twenty eight vol iii p three hundred fifteen vol iii p three hundred seventy two four hundred eighty Footnote eight thousand America now contains about six millions of European blood and descent and their numbers at least in the North are continually increasing Whatever may be the changes of their political situation they must preserve the manners of Europe and we may reflect with some pleasure that the English language will probably be diffused ever an immense and populous continent III Cold poverty and a life of danger and fatigue fortify the strength and courage of Barbarians In every age they have oppressed the polite and peaceful nations of China India and Persia who neglected and still neglect to counterbalance these natural powers by the resources of military art The warlike states of antiquity Greece Macedonia and Rome educated a race of soldiers exercised their bodies disciplined their courage multiplied their forces by regular evolutions and converted the iron which they possessed into strong and serviceable weapons But this superiority insensibly declined with their laws and manners and the feeble policy of Constantine and his successors armed and instructed for the ruin of the empire the rude valor of the Barbarian mercenaries The military art has been changed by the invention of gunpowder which enables man to command the two most powerful agents of nature air and fire Mathematics chemistry mechanics architecture have been applied to the service of war and the adverse parties oppose to each other the most elaborate modes of attack and of defence Historians may indignantly observe that the preparations of a siege would found and maintain a flourishing colony nine thousand yet we cannot be displeased that the subversion of a city should be a work of cost and difficulty or that an industrious people should be protected by those arts which survive and supply the decay of military virtue Cannon and fortifications now form an impregnable barrier against the Tartar horse and Europe is secure from any future irruptions of Barbarians since before they can conquer they must cease to be barbarous Their gradual advances in the science of war would always be accompanied as we may learn from the example of Russia with a proportionable improvement in the arts of peace and civil policy and they themselves must deserve a place among the polished nations whom they subdue Footnote nine thousand On avoit fait venir for the siege of Turin one hundred forty pieces de canon et il est a remarquer que chaque gros canon monte revient a environ ecus il y avoit one hundred thousand boulets one hundred six thousand cartouches d une facon et three hundred thousand d une autre twenty one thousand bombes twenty seven thousand seven hundred grenades fifteen thousand sacs a terre thirty thousand instruments pour la pionnage one million two hundred thousand livres de poudre Ajoutez a ces munitions le plomb le fer et le fer blanc les cordages tout ce qui sert aux mineurs le souphre le salpetre les outils de toute espece Il est certain que les frais de tous ces preparatifs de destruction suffiroient pour fonder et pour faire fleurir la plus aombreuse colonie Voltaire Siecle de Louis XIV c xx in his Works tom xi p three hundred ninety one Should these speculations be found doubtful or fallacious there still remains a more humble source of comfort and hope The discoveries of ancient and modern navigators and the domestic history or tradition of the most enlightened nations represent the human savage naked both in body and mind and destitute of laws of arts of ideas and almost of language ten oh one From this abject condition perhaps the primitive and universal state of man he has gradually arisen to command the animals to fertilize the earth to traverse the ocean and to measure the heavens His progress in the improvement and exercise of his mental and corporeal faculties eleven oh one has been irregular and various infinitely slow in the beginning and increasing by degrees with redoubled velocity ages of laborious ascent have been followed by a moment of rapid downfall and the several climates of the globe have felt the vicissitudes of light and darkness Yet the experience of four thousand years should enlarge our hopes and diminish our apprehensions we cannot determine to what height the human species may aspire in their advances towards perfection but it may safely be presumed that no people unless the face of nature is changed will relapse into their original barbarism The improvements of society may be viewed under a threefold aspect one The poet or philosopher illustrates his age and country by the efforts of a single mind but those superior powers of reason or fancy are rare and spontaneous productions and the genius of Homer or Cicero or Newton would excite less admiration if they could be created by the will of a prince or the lessons of a preceptor two The benefits of law and policy of trade and manufactures of arts and sciences are more solid and permanent and many individuals may be qualified by education and discipline to promote in their respective stations the interest of the community But this general order is the effect of skill and labor and the complex machinery may be decayed by time or injured by violence three Fortunately for mankind the more useful or at least more necessary arts can be performed without superior talents or national subordination without the powers of one or the union of many Each village each family each individual must always possess both ability and inclination to perpetuate the use of fire twelve oh one and of metals the propagation and service of domestic animals the methods of hunting and fishing the rudiments of navigation the imperfect cultivation of corn or other nutritive grain and the simple practice of the mechanic trades Private genius and public industry may be extirpated but these hardy plants survive the tempest and strike an everlasting root into the most unfavorable soil The splendid days of Augustus and Trajan were eclipsed by a cloud of ignorance and the Barbarians subverted the laws and palaces of Rome But the scythe the invention or emblem of Saturn thirteen oh one still continued annually to mow the harvests of Italy and the human feasts of the Laestrigons fourteen oh one have never been renewed on the coast of Campania Footnote ten oh one It would be an easy though tedious task to produce the authorities of poets philosophers and historians I shall therefore content myself with appealing to the decisive and authentic testimony of Diodorus Siculus tom i l i p eleven twelve l iii p one hundred eighty four c edit Wesseling The Icthyophagi who in his time wandered along the shores of the Red Sea can only be compared to the natives of New Holland Dampier s Voyages vol i p four hundred sixty four four hundred

that the savage coast of Latium was first discovered and civilized by the Phoenicians Footnote fourteen oh one In the ninth and tenth books of the Odyssey Homer has embellished the tales of fearful and credulous sailors who transformed the cannibals of Italy and Sicily into monstrous giants Since the first discovery of the arts war commerce and religious zeal have diffused among the savages of the Old and New World these inestimable gifts they have been successively propagated they can never be lost We may therefore acquiesce in the pleasing conclusion that every age of the world has increased and still increases the real wealth the happiness the knowledge and perhaps the virtue of the human race fifteen oh one Footnote fifteen oh one The merit of discovery has too often been stained with avarice cruelty and fanaticism and the intercourse of nations has produced the communication of disease and prejudice A singular exception is due to the virtue of our own times and country The five great voyages successively undertaken by the command of his present Majesty were inspired by the pure and generous love of science and of mankind The same prince adapting his benefactions to the different stages of society has founded his school of painting in his capital and has introduced into the islands of the South Sea the vegetables and animals most useful to human
