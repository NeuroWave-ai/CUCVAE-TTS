none	none	Comer missus Gerould E Nesbit Jack London or indeed that whole luminous galaxy of skilled story writers many of them without fame who for the past sixty years have been contributing the best of their literary selves to the Atlantic Yet a study of these contributions of such varied types convinces one of certain large demands which each successive editor has with somewhat latitudinarian rigor pretty positively held in mind while he was determining the worth of the given product What we may be interested in asking are these larger and more persistent demands The unified impression Perhaps the most obvious requirement is that one upon which Edgar Allan Poe in his brilliant critical essays on the art of the short story laid the strongest stress the demand that the narrator produce an unquestioned unified effect or impression An examination of the narrative method of the old Metrical Romances and of many of the Arabian Nights Tales will by contrast illustrate Poe s comment In those writings there was often no apparent plan The hero started out and had an adventure This the story teller narrated as Episode No one The hero continued and had another adventure similar or dissimilar to the first This we recognize as Episode No two And thus the story continued until the narrator s powers of invention or endurance were exhausted We close the reading with no sense of satisfied unity no oneness of impression At the beginning of the story the writer of these Romances and Tales apparently had no definitely preconceived plan he allowed no foreshadowing of catastrophe he was careless alike of both beginning and end he made no conscious use of suspense setting character contrast reverting narrative climax or any of the numerous devices that make up the technique of modern short story writing More particularly did he ignore the principle of unified impression Unified impression secured by character domination While unity of impression is the sovereign demand in the modern short story the ways in which this impression may be secured possess interesting variety One of the most important of these ways is evident in the pervading or directing influence of some strongly dominant character Events move in accordance with the will of some one person or it may be some group of persons with closely related powers and aims An interesting example of single character domination is seen in Miss Sherwood s story The Clearest Voice Alice the wife has been dead five years yet it is her personality that still pervades and governs the home Her spirit of kindly interest her instinct for the aesthetic her household control all these have persisted through the long months that have intervened since her death But it is when the husband is faced by the temptation to accept an inheritance which legally though not justly belongs to him it is then that the influence of the wife s assertive character silently and determinedly dictates the correct decision The husband s pressing financial difficulties the urgings of the relatives the unquestioned legality of the bequest these are all finally swept aside by the subtle workings of a quietly persisting ethical force Sometimes an author reveals the strength and wisdom of one of his characters by allowing this character to yield to the wisdom and domination of another I am thinking of missus Comer s story The Wealth of Timmy Zimmerman one As we read the first part of this narrative we are interested only in Timmy Zimmerman and the personal character problems which the huge profits of the tobacco trust suddenly thrust upon this uncultured but good souled parvenu We watch him in his early struggles so full of energy and bold emprise we rejoice with him in his significant financial triumphs and later we watch him as he tries by an expensive building enterprise by tours through Europe by the rapid and careless driving of his ten thousand dollar red automobile to win back the nervous contentment that was the happy companion of those early years of adventurous poverty He dominates each separate situation but he does not solve his problem It is only when he meets Molly Betterton and sees himself as analyzed by her candid native acumen that he learns his own weakness and the true potentialities of his wealth Her character is strong enough to win dominion over him it is not strong enough to dominate the story and lure the reader away from the controlling interest in the personality whose career the reader has so intently watched The unity of impression is firmly and continuously centered in the portrayal of Timmy Zimmerman s character and it is that which tautly holds the reader s attention in leash A more recent story that secures its chief interest from character portrayal is mister Arthur Russell Taylor s Mr Squem mister Squem is a traveling man who sells Mercury rubber tires He wears clothes that arrest attention broad striped affairs that seemed stripes before they were clothes his talk is profusely interlarded with vulgar but picturesque slang he is far removed from the academy Brought into direct contrast with the Reverend Allan Dare and Professor William Emory Browne his crudity is the more grossly apparent It is later enhanced by the glimpse we get of his room extremely dennish smitingly red as to walls oppressive with plush upholstery A huge deerhead jutting from over the mantel divided honors with a highly colored September Morn affrontingly framed On a shelf stood a small bottle It contained a finger of mister Squem amputated years before in alcohol But in the midst of a railroad wreck we lose all thought of these banalities and crudities we take mister Squem for what he really is a genuine large hearted efficient minister unto his fellow men The impression he creates dominates the entire situation Of the classic stories which admirably illustrate this method of securing a unity of impression through concentrated character interest we like to revert to Bret Harte s Tennessee s Partner It is of small moment that we do not know this man s name of small moment indeed that he seems throughout his mining career at Sandy Bar to have been content to have his personality dimmed by the somewhat more luminous aura of Tennessee But when Tennessee s repeated offences bring him to trial before Judge Lynch and finally to his doom on the ominous tree at the top of Morley s Hill Tennessee s partner comes suddenly upon the scene and overpoweringly dominates the situation We close our reading of the story completely impressed by the devoted loyalty of Tennessee s partner the loyalty that creates the unified impression And this same unity of impression thus secured in The Clearest Voice The Wealth of Timmy Zimmerman Mr Squem and Tennessee s Partner by concentrated interest in character is easily discernible in scores of other stories The method is artistically employed by Hawthorne in The Great Stone Face in Maxim Gorky s Tchelkache Turgenef s A Lear of the Steppes J M Barrie s Cree Queery and Myra Drolby Thomas Nelson Page s Marse Chan Henry James s The Real Thing Joseph Conrad s The Informer and such well known Atlantic stories as Anna Fuller s The Boy Esther Tiffany s Anna Mareea Florence Gilmore s Little Brother Ellen Mackubin s Rosita Charles Dobie s The Failure Clarkson Crane s Snipe and Christina Krysto s Babanchik Indeed the list is well nigh inexhaustible and is constantly being increased by the many gifted writers who enriching our current literature see in personal character the germ of story interest Unified impression secured by plot Just as in looking at a finished piece of artistic tapestry we get a sense of harmonious design so in contemplating the events of a well told story our sense of artistic completeness is satisfied by the skill displayed in the weaving and interweaving of incident such weaving and interweaving as bring the significant events into the immediate foreground and group the items of lesser moment in such an unobtrusive manner as to merge them into harmony with the main design Preceding the beginning of any story we assume the existence of a state of repose Either there is nothing happening or if events are happening they are simply happening in the atmosphere of dull and inconsequential routine and are accordingly without the pale of narratable notice Then suddenly or gradually something happens to disturb this repose and to this initial exciting force are traceable the succeeding events with such varied culminations as prosperity or poverty or dejection tragedy or joy or restored calm or any one of the multitudinous finalities that life brings with her in her equipage The whole principle of plot as here briefly analyzed is simply and artistically revealed in mister Ernest Starr s The Clearer Sight an admirable example of a story whose unity is secured largely by the effective handling of situation and incident To Noakes the young scientist who is the central character in the story the master chemist Henry Maxineff has given certain general suggestions for a formula which will give an explosive of great value and of high potential power The young man following these general lines discovers that by slight additions and alterations he can successfully work out the formula and immediately sell his secret to a foreign government The sum he would thus secure would amply justify him in proposing marriage to

none	none	Noakes was working in secret He is blinded by the accident permanently he thinks Harassed by his sufferings more particularly by his spiritual sufferings he makes his confessions to mister Maxineff and Miss Hallam and looks despairingly toward the empty future The story closes with the physician s hope that the loss of his sight is after all but temporary As we end our reading and view the events in retrospect we are conscious of having seen the various threads of interest woven into a complete and unified design Again the principles of plot structure are clearly seen quietly creating their unified impression in A Sea Change one of Alice Brown s homely stories two Cynthia Miller a New England housewife had lived for years her life of dull routine in an isolated mountain farm eight miles from the nearest village Her husband Timothy was a son of the soil made out of the earth and not many generations removed from that maternity Cynthia gradually comes to despise her life and her husband s crude carelessness exemplified by his habitual animal aura and his newly greased boots by the open oven door With little ado but with grim determination she leaves him and goes to the sea side home of her sister Frances Cynthia is taken ill but is at length cured by the kindly village doctor and the silent ministrations of the neighboring sea Timothy changed by the sudden departure of his wife and the opportunity for introspection that his lonely life now brings him shakes off a bit of his earthiness and goes after several weeks to find his wife We listen to the brief reconciliation and see Timothy begin to breathe in new life of aroused love and appreciation The author s skillful manipulation of the action makes us live in the glow of a clearly perceived oneness of impression There are of course thousands of stories which secure this singleness of effect by a similar skill in the handling of situations and incidents Among these many we need mention only a few whose unity is largely secured by plot interest Thomas Bailey Aldrich s Marjorie Daw Maupassant s The Necklace Poe s Murders in the Rue Morgue Stockton s A Tale of Negative Gravity and The Lady or the Tiger Kipling s Without Benefit of Clergy Pushkin s The Shot A Conan Doyle s The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Jack London s A Day s Lodging Unified impression secured by setting Perhaps the most significant critical comment on setting the third important element in the story weaving process that secures oneness of impression is that frequently quoted conversation of Stevenson with Graham Balfour You may said Stevenson take a certain atmosphere and get action and persons to express it I ll give you an example The Merry Men There I began with the feeling of one of those islands on the west coast of Scotland and I gradually developed the story to express the sentiment with which the coast affected me There is no sensitive reader who will not sympathize with this feeling and immediately understand how the atmosphere of a particular place will act upon inventive genius and become the exciting force for the production of a story The squalid surroundings in the city slums the gay glamour of a garishly lighted casino the unending stretch of desert waste the dim twilight or the shrouded darkness of the pine forest the bleakness of the beaches in midwinter the sounding cataracts haunting one like a passion how rich in storied suggestiveness may be each of these to him who already has within him the instinct of story or romance How the mood of place may effect its influence is well expressed in the opening passages of John Galsworthy s Buttercup Night which sensitively analyzes the feelings for an unnamed bit of land in the West country as the author experienced them one Sunday night of a by gone early June Why is it that in some places there is such a feeling of life being all one not merely a long picture show for human eyes but a single breathing glowing growing thing of which we are no more important a part than the swallows and magpies the foals and sheep in the meadows the sycamores and ash trees and flowers in the fields the rocks and little bright streams or even the long fleecy clouds and their soft shouting drivers the winds True we register these parts of being and they so far as we know do not register us yet it is impossible to feel in such places as I speak of the busy dry complacent sense of being all that matters which in general we humans have so strongly In these rare spots that are always in the remote country untouched by the advantages of civilization one is conscious of an enwrapping web or mist of spirit the glamorous and wistful wraith of all the vanished shapes that once dwelt there in such close comradeship We can readily see as we read Buttercup Night that it is the atmosphere of the place that subtly dictates the telling of the story and at the end leaves the reader breathing this delicious June air and living within the charmed romance of this accumulated mass of magical yellow What happens is interesting but it is interesting largely because the incidents are fused and integrated with the hovering spirit of place and time here as dominating in their charm as is the weird mysterious Usher homestead in its gloom While such stories as Stevenson s Merry Men and Galsworthy s Buttercup Night and Poe s The Fall of the House of Usher illustrate in a particularly striking way the dominant influence of setting we recall scores upon scores of stories that have an added power because their authors have shown skill in the creation of a permeating and directing environment Among the more famous of these stories are Sarah Orne Jewett s The Queen s Twin three Israel Zangwill s They that Walk in Darkness Prosper Merimee s Mateo Falcone Hardy s Wessex Tales Lafcadio Hearn s Youma four Jack London s Children of the Frost John Fox s Christmas Eve on Lonesome Edith Wyatt s In November five and missus Gerould s The Moth of Peace six Unified impression secured by theme Another element of the story which we find interesting to discover and analyze is the author s dominant theme what in the older days we might have unapologetically called the moral of the story But along with the development of the technique of the short story there came a school of critics and writers that shied terribly at this mention of the word moral and such writers as Stevenson often seemed over conscious of its lurking danger In such consciousness Stevenson wrote wonderful stories of adventure and mystery such as Treasure Island and The Sire de Maletroit s Door Yet the native instinct toward emphasis upon theme allowed him to write such powerful ethical stories as Markheim and Dr Jekyll and mister Hyde But in these as in most of the modern thematic stories the ethical truth pervades rather than intrudes It is so firmly woven into incident and character and surroundings and natural dramaturgy that its identity is not exposed to naked bareness but combines with other elements to produce a perfect unity through harmony of tone and effect Among the recent Atlantic story writers this harmonious linking is seen happily existent in the deft workmanship of missus C A P Comer and Anne Douglas Sedgwick In each number of three notable trilogies which these gifted writers have contributed there is an artistic treatment of three notable themes In missus Comer s Preliminaries The Kinzer Portraits and The Long Inheritance we find the author s implied comments on Engagement Marriage and Divorce In Anne Douglas Sedgwick s unconnected floral trilogy Hepaticas Carnations and Pansies there is in turn reflected Miss Sedgwick s attitude toward three themes which are less concrete and which demand a longer phrasing In the first there is the world old story of a noble spirited woman s love and sacrifice and ardent wishings for her self victimized son In Carnations we have the story of a husband Rupert Wilson released from the bondage of an unfortunate infatuation and restored to the sanity of love In Pansies we have a generous tribute to quiet sentiment developed by a study in character contrasts the simple hearted woman loving a simple garden contrasted with the kindly disposed but worldly environed missus Lennard fond of display and Dorothy Perkins effects and laying a disproportioned stress upon the expensive and the modern In none of these six stories is there the slightest suggestion that the narrative has been conceived in the spirit of propaganda It would be impossible to say even that it was the underlying theme which gave the initial conception to the narrative and directed its progress Any one of these six stories I can fancy beginning in plot or in character or in setting Plot character setting and theme all are here but all are so happily combined that I feel no disproportionate emphasis and hence no forcing of a technical element I only know that personally when I think over these stories I find the theme of each leaving its strong and lingering impression What is true regarding this effective combination of elements in these stories of missus Comer s and Miss Sedgwick s is of course true of many of the Atlantic stories which I have been reading Perhaps in the majority of the best there is such a thorough merging of all the elements that the final impression falls upon neither character nor plot nor setting nor theme The author has had something worth while to relate and he has related it in a simple and natural way all unconscious of or happily triumphant over any studied technique in the art of narration It has indeed been a conviction in the minds of some of the Atlantic editors that most persons even though untrained in manipulating the story maker s gear have at least one experience real or imagined that is abundantly worth telling and worth writing Unconsciously of course this artless narrator might throw into bold relief theme character setting or plot Or he might unconsciously merge these separate interests The woman writers Aside from the mere contemplation of story element technique there are many other interesting observations which naturally come to one who reads critically the currently published fiction He who examines the recent Atlantic files will be immediately impressed by the dominant place held by women writers of the short story missus Wharton missus Comer missus Gerould Sarah Orne Jewett Alice Brown Mary Antin Zephine Humphrey Edith Ronald Merrielees Margaret Prescott Montague Kathleen Norris E Nesbit Laura Spencer Portor Anna Fuller Edith Wyatt Margaret Lynn Elizabeth Ashe Anne Douglas Sedgwick Elsie Singmaster Margaret Sherwood Among the Atlantic contributors we should find it difficult indeed to match this list with an equal number of men equally gifted in story telling power But even if we should succeed in such a fatuous pairing of talent we should still be impressed with the high place attained by the women writers high in contrast with the place which they have attained in painting sculpture architecture drama and music And why this high attainment in the realm of the short story Perhaps it is partially due to a lighter winged fancy native in the feminine mind a fancy that roves with more natural ease and grace among the animals and flowers of earth among the clouds and stars and spirits of the sky among the demon haunted grottoes of the underworld From all these easily directed journeys perhaps it turns more naturally to the penetrable secrets of human motive penetrable however only to those hearts which yield quickly spontaneously even wantonly to the springs of love hate beauty justice jealousy fear vengeance and the silent routine of daily duty Doing all this of its natural self the heart can more readily guide the mind in the deft record of vicarious action Leastwise to make a simple record of a real or an imagined experience is a task which can be more easily done by girls than by boys As boys and girls grow into maturity and the desire for contact with life increases the masculine mind finds its natural outlet in business in wrestlings with the soil in contests of law and at the present moment alas in the chaos of relentless war Woman s sphere though continually enlarging is still relatively narrowed and she seeks her freedom in the realm of imagination thus identifying herself oftentimes in the work a day contests of men This mental exercise within the wide gamut of imagined emotions naturally helps her to enter sympathetically into varied contests And it is perhaps because of her broadened understanding that she is fuller and truer in her written record The feminine mind moreover is more observant of detail and more ready to perceive a lack of harmony in arrangement and while mere fullness of observation might in isolated cases lead to incontinent garrulousness the generous flow is usually held in sufficient check by that nicer feminine perception of an aesthetic effect that dictates shearing and compression Perhaps the widening of the educational field the world s fuller acknowledgment of woman s varied ability her easier mastery of delicate technique a more habitual access to a writing pad perhaps all these combine with other facts and circumstances to encourage her in this prolific output of marketable fiction At any rate the fact is easily apparent The stamp of authenticity A further interesting fact revealed in an examination of Atlantic narratives is the encouragement of that type of story which carries with it the stamp of an authentic atmosphere More than a generation ago this magazine was printing the stories of Bret Harte stories that revealed with great accuracy and skill and sympathy the spirit of the California mining camp Bret Harte had lived and breathed the grim and romantic spirit of this environment Fusing this experience with an imagination that emotionalized a native instinct for story telling Bret Harte was able to lend to his writing a verisimilitude that easily won the reader s interest in the charm and novelty of that strenuous and elemental western life While the work of Bret Harte perhaps most strikingly illustrates this power of authentic portrayal of experience and place there are scores of Atlantic stories that employ the same general method Sarah Orne Jewett in such stories as The Queen s Twin The Life of Nancy and A Dummet Shepherd has admirably re created the simple life of rural New England Lafcadio Hearn has realistically brought to us the spirit of Japan Jacob Riis has portrayed for us many pictures of New York tenement life Joseph Husband has brought us into the atmosphere of industrialism H G Dwight and Charles Johnson have allowed us to breathe the spirit of Orientalism And scores of other writers such as Dallas Lore Sharp E Morlae Margaret Prescott Montague Abraham Rihbany Mary Antin Mildred Aldrich Simeon Strunsky after they have lived their separate experiences have shared with us the intimate memories which those personal experiences have bequeathed Sordidness rejected The Atlantic traditions for the most part have rejected the harrowing and the sordid and the meretricious Contrasted with the tone of tragic realism so often dominant in Gorky Dostoevsky Turgenef Maupassant and Zola we usually find in the pages of the Atlantic an emphasis upon themes which suggest a gentler and more humane spirit The winds of heaven do of course sometimes blow over places that are bleak barren and desolate They shriek and moan through winter wilds and sometimes the human mood that corresponds to this despair has found its reflection in stories which the Atlantic has printed But the mission of the magazine has in general been in the sunlit fields or near the hearthfire s glow If it sometimes has witnessed tragedy it has

none	none	found delight in the disclosure of grimness for grimness sake It has been more watchful of scenes within the commonplaces of human action here the writers have found themes of quiet pathos of homely humor and of rich romance Small wonder indeed if since August nineteen fourteen grimmer scenes than usual should not sometimes shadow the pages But even so the writers have not yet lost their sanity their hopefulness or their quiet sense of humor Possibilities within the future After these comments on the more dominant characteristics of the short story it is natural to inquire into the possible future of the art It is apparent that writers are paying careful attention to technique and there is real danger to the art if technique is to be too narrowly interpreted and too slavishly followed A credulous acceptance of a guide has always worked havoc in the field of creative literature Aristotle and Horace and Longinus to revert to a literary period now far distant showed admirable critical acumen but it may be sincerely questioned whether they enhanced the worth of Grecian and Roman literature We may be quite sure that the critical writings of neither Boileau nor Pope deepened or improved French or English poetry Will our short stories be any better here in America because Brander Matthews Bliss Perry Clayton Hamilton Henry S Canby W B Pitkin Miss Albright Miss Ashmun and a score of others have written so entertainingly about them As I have read these criticisms and as I have seen new writers apparently influenced by these criticisms and by the methods obvious in Poe Bret Harte Kipling and O Henry I have been reluctantly made to feel that we were perhaps on the verge of yielding to the technique of the telling rather than to the substance of the experience Where art becomes too self conscious and too critical it sacrifices spontaneity and elemental power and smothers itself in the wrappings of its self woven web Reliance upon technique and long practice in its use will help crudeness to rise to mediocrity but the process will never lift the mediocre writer to the plane of the supremely excellent or the austerely great Perhaps the present danger lies partly in the attitude of the magazine editor whose sceptre is his checkbook Let us not deceive ourselves Literature is now a business or if not wholly commercialized it is acutely sensitive to the laws of the trade The purely commercial editors with their eyes riveted to the main chance have come to recognize the power of technique and to it they have been paying bountiful tribute The public has in turn learned to expect the sudden start the swift pace the placarded climax the clever paradox the crisp repartee the pinchbeck style the bared realism the concluding click It is all very perfect and very regular and the editor in accepting the manuscript that adheres to each conventional requirement encloses his check for two hundred dollars in a letter that contains an order for a half dozen more of the identical type One of the deplorable adjuncts of this procedure is that the editor often realizes the emptiness of this technically correct story and his own best literary judgment spurns it But trying to objectify what his clientele would applaud he pays the price and

none	none	more Conversely a story with genuine substance and sincere feeling comes to his desk He reads it and approves Then he asks that fateful question What will my reading public say He concludes that they will note the utter lack of climax of cleverness of ingenuity of realistic contact with unadorned everydayness He closes the incident by a return of the manuscript with a printed rejection slip enclosed But this procedure is sometimes happily reversed an editor has had the fortitude to ignore the fancied judgment of his readers and has relied upon his own impressions of what constitutes literary worth He is conscious that the story he has accepted is written in utter ignorance or in total disregard of traditional propriety and the laws of modern technique yet it carries a message it reveals character it shows real thinking powers Accepted and published as was Arthur Russell Taylor s Mr Squem it has been enthusiastically received by its readers There is one final conviction that emerges from the varied and the multitudinous impressions that come from the reading of all these stories Every individual has an experience worth narrating and most individuals have scores upon scores of experiences real or imagined that are worth narrating To succeed in the attempt one does

none	none	Ollie I dare say she ll want to tell you what they are You mustn t think they re my views though I d rather hear yours Ruth She flashed a look at him that opened for him the heavenly deeps that lie before the young and the loving and he had a sudden vision of their life as a long sunlit road winding uphill winding down but sunlit always because looks like that illumine any dusk I ll tell you my views some day Ruth said softly But first First I must talk to my father your mother your father Oliver checked them off on his fingers Three of them Seems to me that s a lot of folks to consult about a thing that doesn t really concern anybody but you and me II After the fashion of self absorbed youth Oliver had never noticed missus Lannithorne especially She had been to him simply a sallow little figure in the background of Ruth s vivid young life someone to be spoken to very politely but otherwise of no particular moment If his marital negotiations did nothing else for him they were at least opening his eyes to the significance of the personalities of older people The things Ruth said about her mother had prepared him to find that lady querulous and difficult but essentially negligible Face to face with missus Lannithorne he had a very different impression She received him in the upstairs sitting room to which her semi invalid habits usually confined her Wrapped in a white wool shawl and lying in a long Canton lounging chair by a sunshiny window she put out a chilly hand in greeting and asked the young man to be seated Oliver scanning her countenance received an unexpected impression of dignity She was thin and nervous with big dark eyes peering out of a pale narrow face she might be a woman with a grievance but he apprehended something beyond mere fretfulness in the discontent of her expression There was suffering and thought in her face and even when the former is exaggerated and the latter erroneous these are impressive things missus Lannithorne have you any objection to letting Ruth marry me mister Pickersgill what are your qualifications for the care of a wife and family Oliver hesitated Why about what anybody s are I think he said and was immediately conscious of the feebleness of this response I mean he added flushing to the roots of his blond hair that my prospects in life are fair I am in my father s office you know I am to have a small share in the business next year I needn t tell you that the firm is a good one If you want to know about my qualifications as a lawyer why I can refer you to people who can tell you if they think I am promising Do your family approve of this marriage I haven t talked to them about it yet Have you ever saved any money of your own earning or have you any property in your own name Oliver thought guiltily of his bank account which had a surprising way of proving when balanced to be less than he expected Well not exactly In other words then mister Pickersgill you are a young and absolutely untried man you are in your father s employ and practically at his mercy you propose a great change in your life of which you do not know that he approves you have no resources of your own and you are not even sure of your earning capacity if your father s backing were withdrawn In these circumstances you plan to double your expenses and assume the whole responsibility of another person s life comfort and happiness Do you think that you have shown me that your qualifications are adequate All this was more than a little disconcerting Oliver was used to being accepted as old Pickersgill s only son which meant a cheerfully accorded background of eminence ability and comfortable wealth It had not occurred to him to detach himself from that background and see how he looked when separated from it He felt a little angry and also a little ashamed of the fact that he did not bulk larger as a personage apart from his environment Nevertheless he answered her question honestly No missus Lannithorne I don t think that I have She did not appear to rejoice in his discomfiture She even seemed a little sorry for it but she went on quietly Don t think I am trying to prove that you are the most ineligible young man in the city But it is absolutely necessary that a man should stand on his own feet and firmly before he undertakes to look after other lives than his own Otherwise there is nothing but misery for the woman and children who depend upon him It is a serious business getting married I begin to think it is muttered Oliver blankly I don t want my daughters to marry said missus Lannithorne The life is a thousand times harder than that of the self supporting woman harder work fewer rewards less enjoyment less security That is true even of an ordinarily happy marriage And if they are not happy Oh the bitterness of them She was speaking rapidly now with energy almost with anguish Oliver red in the face subdued but eager to refute her out of the depths and heights of his inexperience held himself rigidly still and listened Did you ever hear that epigram of Disraeli that all men should marry but no women That is what I believe At least if women must marry let others do it not my children not my little girls It is curious but that is how we always think of them When they are grown they are often uncongenial My daughter Ruth does not love me deeply nor am I greatly drawn to her now as an individual a personality but Ruth was such a dear baby I can t bear to have her suffer Oliver started to protest hesitated bit his lip and subsided After all did he dare say that his wife would never suffer The woman opposite looked at him with hostile accusing eyes as if he incarnated in his youthful person all the futile masculinity in the world Do you think a woman who has suffered willingly gives her children over to the same fate she demanded passionately I wish I could make you see it for five minutes as I see it you young careless foolish Why you know nothing nothing Listen to me The woman who marries gives up everything or at least jeopardizes everything her youth her health her life perhaps certainly her individuality She acquires the permanent possibility of self sacrifice She does it gladly but she does not know what she is doing In return is it too much to ask that she be assured a roof over her head food to her mouth clothes to her body How many men marry without being sure that they have even so much to offer You yourself of what are you sure Is your arm strong Is your heart loyal Can you shelter her soul as well as her body I know your father has money Perhaps you can care for her creature needs but that isn t all For some women life is one long affront one slow humiliation How do I know you are not like that Because I m not that s all said Oliver Pickersgill abruptly getting to his feet He felt badgered baited indignant yet he could not tell this frail excited woman what he thought There were things one didn t say although missus Lannithorne seemed to ignore the fact She went on ignoring it 
8699_291107_000286_000001	train-clean-360	I know what you 
none	none	are thinking she said that I would regard these matters differently if I had married another man That is not wholly true It is because Peter Lannithorne was a good man at heart and tried to play the man s part as well as he knew how and because it was partly my own fault that he failed so miserably that I have thought of it all so much And the end of all my thinking is that I don t want my daughters to marry Oliver was white now and a little unsteady He was also confused There was the note of truth in what she said but he felt that she said it with too much excitement with too great facility He had the justified masculine distrust of feminine fluency as hysterical Nothing so presented could carry full conviction And he felt physically bruised and battered as if he had been beaten with actual rods instead of stinging words but he was not yet defeated missus Lannithorne what do you wish me to understand from all this Do you forbid Ruth and me to marry is that it She looked at him dubiously She felt so fiercely the things she had been saying that she could not feel them continuously She too was exhausted Oliver Pickersgill had a fine head candid eyes a firm chin strong capable hands He was young and the young know nothing but it might be that there was the making of a man in him If Ruth must marry perhaps him as well as another But she did not trust her own judgment even of such hands such eyes and such a chin Oh if the girls would only believe her if they would only be content to trust the wisdom she had distilled from the bitterness of life But the young know nothing and believe only the lying voices in their own hearts I wish you would see Ruth s father she said suddenly I am prejudiced I ought not to have to deal with these questions I tell you I pray Heaven none of them may marry ever but just the same they will Go ask Peter Lannithorne if he thinks his daughter Ruth has a fighting chance for happiness as your wife Let him settle it I have told you what I think I am done I shall be very glad to talk with Ruth s father about the matter said Oliver with a certain emphasis on father Perhaps he and I shall be able to understand each other better Good morning missus Lannithorne III Oliver Pickersgill Senior turned his swivel chair about bit hard on the end of his cigar and stared at his only son What s that he said abruptly Say that again Oliver Junior winced not so much at the words as at his father s face I want to marry Ruth Lannithorne he repeated steadily There was a silence The elder Pickersgill looked at his son long and hard from under lowered brows Oliver had never seen his father look at him like that before as if he were a rank outsider some detached person whose doings were to be scrutinized coldly and critically and judged on their merits It is a hard hour for a beloved child when he first sees that look in heretofore indulgent parental eyes Young Oliver felt a weight at his heart but he sat the straighter and did not flinch before the appraising glance So you want to marry Peter Lannithorne s daughter do you Well now what is there in the idea of marrying a jail bird s child that you find especially attractive Of course I might say that I ve seen something of business men in this town Ross say and Worcester and Jim Stone and that if it came to a choice between their methods and Lannithorne s his were the squarer for he settled up and is paying the price besides But I don t know that there s any use saying that I don t want to marry any of their daughters and you wouldn t want me to You know what Ruth Lannithorne is as well as I do If there s a girl in town that s finer grained or smarter or prettier I d like to have you point her out And she has a sense of honor like a man s I don t know another girl like her in that She knows what s fair said the young man mister Pickersgill s face relaxed a little Oliver was making a good argument with no mushiness about it and he had a long settled habit of appreciating Ollie s arguments She knows what s fair does she Then what does she say about marrying you She says she won t marry anybody who doesn t respect her father as she does At this the parent grinned a little grimly it is true but appreciatively He looked past Oliver s handsome boyish head out of the window and was silent for a time When he spoke it was gravely not angrily Oliver you re young The things I m as sure of as two and two

none	none	yet believe at all Probably you won t believe em if I put them to you but it s up to me to do it Understand I m not getting angry and doing the heavy father over this I m just telling you how some things are in this world facts like gravitation and atmospheric pressure Ruth Lannithorne is a good girl I don t doubt This world is chuck full of good girls It makes some difference which one of em you marry but not nearly so much difference as you think it does What matters from forty on for the rest of your life is the kind of inheritance you ve given your children You don t know it yet but the thing that s laid on men and women to do is to give their children as good an inheritance as they can Take it from me that this is Gospel truth can t you Your mother and I have done the best we can for you and your sisters You come from good stock and by that I mean honest blood You ve got to pass it on untainted Now hold on he held up a warning hand as Oliver was about to interrupt hotly Wait till I m through and then think it over I m not saying that Peter Lannithorne s blood isn t as good as much that passes for untainted or that Ruth isn t a fine girl I m only telling you this when first you look into your son s face every failing of your own will rise up to haunt you because you will wish for nothing on God s earth so much as that that boy shall have a fair show in life and be a better man than you You will thank Heaven for every good thing you know of in your blood and in your wife s and you will regret every meanness every weakness that he may inherit more than you knew it was in you to regret anything Do you suppose when that hour comes to you that you ll want to remember his grandfather was a convict How will you face that down Young Oliver s face was pale He had never thought of things like this He made no response for a while At last he asked What kind of a man is Peter Lannithorne Eh What kind of Oh well as men go there have been worse ones You know how he came to get sent up He speculated and he borrowed some of another man s money without asking for twenty four hours to protect his speculation He didn t lose it either There s a point where his case differs from most He pulled the thing off and made enough to keep his family going in decent comfort and he paid the other money back but they concluded to make an example of him so they sent him up It was just yes and he said so himself At the same time there are a great many more dishonest men out of prison than Peter Lannithorne though he is in it I meet em every day and I ought to know But that s not the point As you said yourself you don t want to marry their daughters Heaven forbid that you should You want to marry his daughter And he was weak He was tempted and fell and got found out He is a convict and the taint sticks The Lord knows why the stain of unsuccessful dishonesty should stick longer than the stain of successful dishonesty I don t But we know it does That is the way things are Why not marry where there is no taint Father Yes Ollie Father see here He was weak and gave way once Are there any men in the world who haven t given way at least once about something or other are there father There was a note of anguish in the boy s voice Perhaps he was being pushed too far Oliver Pickersgill Senior cleared his throat paused and at last answered sombrely God knows Ollie I don t I won t say there are Well then See here his father interrupted sharply Of course I see your argument I won t meet it I shan t try It doesn t change my mind even if it is a good argument We ll never get anywhere arguing along those lines I ll propose something else Suppose you go ask Peter Lannithorne whether you shall marry his daughter or not Yes ask him He knows what s what as well as the next man Ask Peter Lannithorne what a man wants in the family of the woman he marries There was a note of finality in the older man s voice Ollie recognized it drearily All roads led to Lannithorne it seemed He rose oppressed with the sense that henceforward life was going to be full of unforeseen problems that things which from afar looked simple and easy and happy were going to prove quite otherwise missus Lannithorne had angered rather than frightened him and he had held his own with her but this was his very own father who was piling the load on his shoulders and filling his heart with terror of the future What was it after all this adventure of the married life whereof these seasoned travelers spoke so dubiously Could it really be that it was not the divine thing it seemed when he and Ruth looked into each other s eyes He crossed the floor dejectedly with the step of an older man but at the door he shook himself and looked back Say dad Yes Ollie Everybody is so terribly depressing about this thing it almost scares me Aren t there really any happy times for married people ever You and missus Lannithorne make me feel there aren t but somehow I have a hunch that Ruth and I know best Own up now Are you and mother miserable You never looked it His father surveyed him with an expression too wistful to be complacent Ah those broad young shoulders that must be fitted to the yoke Yet for what other end was their strength given them Each man must take his turn It s not a soft snap I don t know anything worth while that is But there are compensations You ll see what some of them are when your boys begin to grow up IV Across Oliver s young joy fell the shadow of fear If as his heart told him there was nothing to be afraid of why were his elders thus cautious and terrified He felt himself affected by their alarms all the more potently because his understanding of them was vague He groped his way in fog How much ought he to be influenced by missus Lannithorne s passionate protests and his father s stern warnings He realized all at once that the admonitory attitude of age to youth is rooted deep in immortal necessity Like most lads he had never thought of it before save as an unpleasant parental habit But fear changes the point of view and Oliver had begun to be afraid Then again before him loomed the prospect of his interview with Peter Lannithorne This was a very concrete unpleasantness Hang it all Ruth was worth any amount of trouble but still it was a tough thing to have to go down to the state capital and seek one s future father in law in his present boarding place One oughtn t to have to plough through that particular kind of difficulty on such an errand Dimly he felt that the path to the Most Beautiful should be rose lined and soft to the feet of the approaching bridegroom But apparently that wasn t the way such paths were laid out He resented this bitterly but he set his jaws and proceeded to make his arrangements It was not difficult to compass the necessary interview He knew a man who knew the warden intimately It was quickly arranged that he was to see Peter Lannithorne in the prison library quite by himself Oliver dragged himself to that conference by the sheer strength of his developing will Every fibre of his being seemed to protest and hold back Consequently he was not in the happiest imaginable temper for important conversation The prison library was a long narrow room with bookcases to the ceiling on one side and windows to the ceiling on the other There were red geraniums on brackets up the sides of the windows and a canary s cage on a hook gave the place a false air of domesticity contradicted by the barred sash Beneath there was a window seat and here Oliver Pickersgill awaited Lannithorne s coming Ollie did not know what he expected the man to be like but his irritated nerves were prepared to resent and dislike him whatever he might prove He held himself rigidly as he waited and he could feel the muscles of his face setting themselves into hard lines When the door opened and some one approached him he rose stiffly and held out his hand like an automaton How do you do mister Lannithorne I am Oliver Pickersgill and I have come I have come His voice trailed off into silence for he had raised his eyes perfunctorily to Peter Lannithorne s face and the things printed there made him forget himself and the speech he had prepared He saw a massive head topping an insignificant figure A fair man was Peter Lannithorne with heavy reddish hair a bulging forehead and deep set gray eyes with a light behind them His features were irregular and unnoticeable but the sum total of them gave the impression of force It was a strong face yet you could see that it had once been a weak one It was a tremendously human face a face like a battle ground scarred and seamed and lined with the stress of invisible conflicts There was so much of struggle and thought set forth in it that one involuntarily averted one s gaze It did not seem decent to inspect so much of the soul of a man as was shown in Peter Lannithorne s countenance Not a triumphant face at all and yet there was peace in it Somehow the man had achieved something arrived somewhere and the record of the journey was piteous and terrible Yet it drew the eyes in awe as much as in wonder and in pity not at all These things were startlingly clear to Oliver He saw them with a vividness not to be overestimated This was a prison This might be a convict but he was a man He was a man who knew things and would share his knowledge His wisdom was as patent as his suffering and both stirred young Oliver s heart to its depths His pride his irritation his rigidity vanished in a flash His fears were in abeyance Only his wonder and his will to learn were left Lannithorne did not take the offered hand yet did not seem to ignore it He came forward quietly and sat down on the window seat half turning so that he and Oliver faced each other Oliver Pickersgill he said Then you are Oliver Pickersgill s son Yes mister Lannithorne My father sent me here my father and missus Lannithorne and Ruth At his daughter s name a light leaped into Peter Lannithorne s eyes that made him look even more acutely and painfully alive than before And what have you to do with Ruth or her mother the man asked Here it was The great moment was facing him Oliver caught his breath then went straight to the point I want to marry your daughter mister Lannithorne We love each other very much But I haven t quite persuaded her and I haven t persuaded missus Lannithorne and my father at all They don t see it They say things all sorts of dreadful things said the boy You would think they had never been young and cared for anybody They seem to have forgotten what it means They try to make us afraid just plain afraid How am I to suppose that they know best about Ruth and me Lannithorne looked across at the young man long and fixedly Then a great kindliness came into his beaten face and a great comprehension Oliver meeting his eyes had a sudden sense of shelter and felt his haunting fears allayed It was absurd and incredible but this man made him feel comfortable yes and eager to talk things over They all said you would know They sent me to you Peter Lannithorne smiled faintly to himself He had not left his sense of humor behind him in the outside world They sent you to me did they boy And what did they tell you to ask me They had different motives I take it Rather Ruth said you were the best man she had ever known and if you said it was right for her to marry me she would missus Lannithorne said I should ask you if you thought Ruth had a fighting chance for happiness with me She doesn t want Ruth to marry anybody you see My father my father Oliver s voice shook with his consciousness of the cruelty of what was to follow but he forced himself to steadiness and got the words out said I was to ask you what a man wants in the family of the woman he marries He said you knew what was what and I should ask you what to do Lannithorne s face was very grave and his troubled gaze sought the floor Oliver convicted of brutality and conscience smitten hurried on And now that I ve seen you I want to ask you a few things for myself mister Lannithorne I I believe you know The man looked up and held up an arresting hand Let me clear the way for you a little he said It was a hard thing for you to come and seek me out in this place I like your coming Most young men would have refused or come in a different spirit I want you to understand that if in Ruth s eyes and my wife s and your father s my counsel has value it is because they think I see things as they are And that means first of all that I know myself for a man who committed a crime and is paying the penalty I am satisfied to be paying it As I see justice it is just So if I seem to wince at your necessary allusions to it that is part of the price I don t want you to feel that you are blundering or hurting me more than is necessary You have got to lay the thing before me as it is Something in the words in the dry patient manner in the endurance of the man s face touched Oliver to the quick and made him feel all manner of new things such as a sense of the moral poise of the universe acquiescence in its retributions and a curious pride akin to Ruth s own in a man who could meet him after this fashion in this place

none	none	mister Lannithorne he said You see it s this way sir missus Lannithorne says And he went on eagerly to set forth his new problems as they had been stated to him Well there you have it he concluded at last For myself the things they said opened chasms and abysses missus Lannithorne seemed to think I would hurt Ruth My father seemed to think Ruth would hurt me Is married life something to be afraid of When I look at Ruth I am sure everything is all right It may be miserable for other people but how could it be miserable for Ruth and me Peter Lannithorne looked at the young man long and thoughtfully again before he answered Oliver felt himself measured and estimated but not found wanting When the man spoke it was slowly and with difficulty as if the habit of intimate convincing speech had been so long disused that the effort was painful The sentences seemed wrung out of him one by one They haven t the point of view he said It is life that is the great adventure Not love not marriage not business They are just chapters in the book The main thing is to take the road fearlessly to have courage to live one s life Courage Lannithorne nodded That is the great word Don t you see what ails your father s point of view and my wife s One wants absolute security in one way for Ruth the other wants absolute security in another way for you And security why it s just the one thing a human being can t have the thing that s the damnation of him if he gets it The reason it is so hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of Heaven is that he has that false sense of security To demand it just disintegrates a man I don t know why It does Oliver shook his head uncertainly I don t quite follow you sir Oughtn t one to try to be safe One ought to try yes That is common prudence But the point is that whatever you do or get you aren t after all secure There is no such condition and the harder you demand it the more risk you run So it is up to a man to take all reasonable precautions about his money or his happiness or his life and trust the rest What every man in the world is looking for is the sense of having the mastery over life But I tell you boy there is only one thing that really gives it And that is Lannithorne hesitated perceptibly For the thing he was about to tell this undisciplined lad was his most precious possession it was the piece of wisdom for which he had paid with the years of his life No man parts lightly with such knowledge It comes he said with an effort with the knowledge of our power to endure That s it You are safe only when you can stand everything that can happen to you Then and then only Endurance is the measure of a man Oliver s heart swelled within him as he listened and his face shone for these words found his young soul where it lived The chasms and abysses in his path suddenly vanished and the road lay clear again winding uphill winding down but always lit for Ruth and him by the light in each other s eyes For surely neither Ruth nor he could ever fail in courage Sometimes I think it is harder to endure what we deserve like me said Lannithorne than what we don t I was afraid you see afraid for my wife and all of them Anyhow take my word for it Courage is security There is no other kind Then Ruth and I Ruth is the core of my heart said Lannithorne thickly I would rather die than have her suffer more than she must But she must take her chances like the rest It is the law of things If you know yourself fit for her and feel reasonably sure you can take care of her you have a right to trust the future Myself I believe there is Some One to trust it to As for the next generation God and the mothers look after that You may tell your father so from me And you may tell my wife I think there is the stuff of a man in you And Ruth tell Ruth He could not finish Oliver reached out and found his hand and wrung it hard I ll tell her sir that I feel about her father as she does And that he approves of our venture And I ll tell myself always what you ve just told me Why it must be true You needn t be afraid I ll forget when the time comes for remembering Finding his way out of the prison yard a few minutes later Oliver looked unseeing at the high walls that soared against the blue spring sky He could not realize them there was such a sense of light air space in his spirit Apparently he was just where he had been an hour before with all his battles still to fight but really he knew they were already won for his weapon had been forged and put in his hand He left his boyhood behind him as he passed that stern threshold for the last hour had made a man of him and a prisoner had given him the master key that opens every door BUTTERCUP NIGHT BY JOHN GALSWORTHY Why is it that in some places there is such a feeling of life being all one not merely a long picture show for human eyes but a single breathing glowing growing thing of which we are no more important a part than the swallows and magpies the foals and sheep in the meadows the sycamores and ash trees and flowers in the fields the rocks and little bright streams or even the long fleecy clouds and their soft shouting drivers the winds True we register these parts of being and they so far as we know do not register us yet it is impossible to feel in such places as I speak of the busy dry complacent sense of being all that matters which in general we humans have so strongly In these rare spots that are always in the remote country untouched by the advantages of civilization one is conscious of an enwrapping web or mist of spirit the glamorous and wistful wraith of all the vanished shapes which once dwelt there in such close comradeship It was Sunday of an early June when I first came on one such far down in the West country I had walked with my knapsack twenty miles and there being no room at the tiny inn of the very little village they directed me to a wicket gate through which by a path leading down a field I would come to a farmhouse where I might find lodging The moment I got into that field I felt within me a peculiar contentment and sat down on a rock to let the feeling grow In an old holly tree rooted to the bank about fifty yards away two magpies evidently had a nest for they were coming and going avoiding my view as much as possible yet with a certain stealthy confidence which made one feel that they had long prescriptive right to that dwelling place Around as far as one could see there was hardly a yard of level ground all was hill and hollow that long ago had been reclaimed from the moor and against the distant folds of the hills the farmhouse and its thatched barns were just visible embowered amongst beeches and some dark trees with a soft bright crown of sunlight over the whole A gentle wind brought a faint rustling up from those beeches and from a large lime tree that stood by itself on this wind some little snowy clouds very high and fugitive in that blue heaven were always moving over But what struck me most were the buttercups Never was field so lighted up by those tiny lamps those little bright pieces of flower china out of the Great Pottery They covered the whole ground as if the sunlight had fallen bodily from the sky in tens of millions of gold patines and the fields below as well down to what was evidently a stream were just as thick with the extraordinary warmth and glory of them Leaving the rock at last I went toward the house It was long and low and rather sad standing in a garden all mossy grass and buttercups with a few rhododendrons and flowery shrubs below a row of fine old Irish yews On the stone verandah a gray sheep dog and a very small golden haired child were sitting close together absorbed in each other A pleasant woman came in answer to my knock and told me in a soft slurring voice that I might stay the night and dropping my knapsack I went out again Through an old gate under a stone arch I came on the farmyard quite deserted save for a couple of ducks moving slowly down a gutter in the sunlight and noticing the upper half of a stable door open I went across in search of something living There in a rough loose box on thick straw lay a long tailed black mare with the skin and head of a thoroughbred She was swathed in blankets and her face all cut about the cheeks and over the eyes rested on an ordinary human s pillow held by a bearded man in shirt sleeves while leaning against the whitewashed walls sat fully a dozen other men perfectly silent very gravely and intently gazing The mare s eyes were half closed and what could be seen of them dull and blueish as though she had been through a long time of pain Save for her rapid breathing she lay quite still but her neck and ears were streaked with sweat and every now and then her hind legs quivered spasmodically Seeing me at the door she raised her head uttering a queer half human noise but the bearded man at once put his hand on her forehead and with a Woa my dear woa my pretty pressed it down again while with the other hand he plumped up the pillow for her cheek And as the mare obediently let fall her head one of the men said in a low voice I never see anything so like a Christian and the others echoed in chorus Like a Christian like a Christian It went to one s heart to watch her and I moved off down the farm lane into an old orchard where the apple trees were still in bloom with bees very small ones busy on the blossoms whose petals were dropping on the dock leaves and buttercups in the long grass Climbing over the bank at the far end I found myself in a meadow the like of which so wild and yet so lush I think I have never seen Along one hedge of its meandering length was a mass of pink mayflower and between two little running streams grew quantities of yellow water iris daggers as they call them the print frock orchid too was everywhere in the grass and always the buttercups Great stones coated with yellowish moss were strewn among the ash trees and dark hollies and through a grove of beeches on the far side such as Corot might have painted a girl was running with a youth after her who jumped down over the bank and vanished Thrushes blackbirds yaffles cuckoos and one other very monotonous little bird were in full song and this with the sound of the streams and the wind and the shapes of the rocks and trees the colors of the flowers and the warmth of the sun gave one a feeling of being lost in a very wilderness of nature Some ponies came slowly from the far end tangled gypsy headed little creatures stared and went off again at speed It was just one of those places where any day the Spirit of all Nature might start up in one of those white gaps that separate the trees and rocks But though I sat a long time waiting hoping She did not come They were all gone from the stable when I went back up to the farm except the bearded nurse and one tall fellow who might have been the Dying Gaul as he crouched there in the straw and the mare was sleeping her head between her nurse s knees That night I woke at two o clock to find it almost as bright as day with moonlight coming in through the flimsy curtains And smitten with the feeling that comes to us creatures of routine so rarely of what beauty and strangeness we let slip by without ever stretching out hand to grasp it I got up dressed stole downstairs and out Never was such a night of frozen beauty never such dream tranquillity The wind had dropped and the silence was such that one hardly liked to tread even on the grass From the lawn and fields there seemed to be a mist rising in truth the moonlight caught on the dewy buttercups and across this ghostly radiance the shadows of the yew trees fell in dense black bars Suddenly I bethought me of the mare How was she faring this marvelous night Very softly opening the door into the yard I tiptoed across A light was burning in her box And I could hear her making the same half human noise she had made in the afternoon as if wondering at her feelings and instantly the voice of the bearded man talking to her as one might talk to a child Oover my darlin yu ve a been long enough o that side Wa ay my swate yu let old Jack turn yu then Then came a scuffling in the straw a thud that half human sigh and his voice again Putt your ead to piller that s my dandy gel Old Jack wouldn urt yu no more n if yu was the Queen Then only her quick breathing could be heard and his cough and mutter as he settled down once more to his long vigil I crept very softly up to the window but she heard me at once and at the movement of her head the old fellow sat up blinking his eyes out of the bush of his grizzled hair and beard Opening the door I said May I come in Oo ay Come in zurr if yu m a mind tu I sat down beside him on a sack And for some time we did not speak taking each other in One of his legs was lame so that he had to keep it stretched out all the time and awfully tired he looked gray tired You re a great nurse I said at last It must be tiring work watching out here all night His eyes twinkled they were of that bright gray kind through which the soul looks out Aw no he said Ah don t grudge it vur a dumb animal Poor things they can t elp theirzelves Many s the naight ah ve zat up with orses and beasts tu T es en me can t bear to zee dumb creatures zuffer And laying his hand on the mare s ears They zay orses aven t no souls T es my belief they ve souls zame as us Many s the Christian ah ve seen ain t got the soul of an orse Same with the beasts an the ship t es only they m can t spake their minds And where I said do you think they go to when they die He looked at me a little queerly fancying perhaps that I was leading him into some trap making sure too that I was a real stranger without power over his body or soul for humble folk must be careful in the country then reassured and nodding in his beard he answered knowingly Ah don t think they goes so very far Why Do you ever see their spirits Naw naw I never zeen none but for all they zay ah don t think none of us goes such a brave way off There s room for all dead or alive An there s Christians ah ve zeen well ef they m not dead for gude then neither aren t dumb animals for sure And rabbits squirrels birds even insects How about them He was silent as if I had carried him a little beyond the confines of his philosophy then shook his head T es all a bit dimsy But you watch dumb animals even the laste littlest one an yu ll zee they knows a lot more n what we du an they du s things tu that putts shame on a man s often as not They ve a got that in them as passes show Not noticing my stare at that unconscious plagiarism he went on Ah d zooner zet up of a naight with an orse than with an uman they ve more zense and patience And stroking the mare s forehead he added Now my dear time for yu t ave yure bottle I waited to see her take her draft and lay her head down once more on the pillow Then hoping he would get a sleep I rose to go Aw t es nothin much he said this time o year not like in winter T will come day before yu know these buttercup nights And twinkling up at me out of his kindly bearded face he settled himself again into the straw I stole a look back at his rough figure propped against the sack with the mare s head down beside his knee at her swathed black body and the gold of the straw the white walls and dusky nooks and shadows of that old stable illumined by the dimsy light of the old lantern And with the sense of having seen something holy I crept away up into the field where I had lingered the day before and sat down on the same halfway rock Close on dawn it was the moon still sailing wide over the moor and the flowers of this buttercup night fast closed not taken in at all by her cold glory Most silent hour of all the twenty four when the soul slips half out of sheath and hovers in the cool when the spirit is most in tune with what soon or late happens to all spirits hour when a man cares least whether or no he be alive as we understand the word None of us goes such a brave way off there s room for all dead or alive Though it was almost unbearably colorless and quiet there was warmth in thinking of those words of his in the thought too of the millions of living things snugly asleep all round warmth in realizing that unanimity of sleep Insects and flowers birds men beasts the very leaves on the trees away in slumberland Waiting for the first bird to chirrup one had perhaps even a stronger feeling than in daytime of the unity and communion of all life of the subtle brotherhood of living things that fall all together into oblivion and all together wake When dawn comes while moonlight is still powdering the world s face quite a long time passes before one realizes how the quality of the light has changed so it was day before I knew it Then the sun came up above the hills dew began to sparkle and color to stain the sky That first praise of the sun from every bird and leaf and blade of grass the tremulous flush and chime of dawn One has strayed so far from the heart of things that it comes as something strange and wonderful Indeed I noticed that the beasts and birds gazed at me as if I simply could not be there at this hour that so belonged to them And to me too they seemed strange and new with that in them that passed show and as of a world where man did not exist or existed only as just another form of life another sort of beast It was one of those revealing moments when we see our proper place in the scheme go past our truly irreligious thought Man hub of the Universe which has founded most religions One of those moments when our supreme importance will not wash either in the bath of purest spiritual ecstasy or in the clear fluid of scientific knowledge and one sees clear with the eyes of true religion man playing his little not unworthy part in the great game of Perfection But just then began the crowning glory of that dawn the opening and lighting of the buttercups Not one did I actually see unclose yet all of a sudden they were awake the fields once more a blaze of gold HEPATICAS BY ANNE DOUGLAS SEDGWICK I Other people s sons were coming home for the three or four days leave The first gigantic struggle furious onslaught and grim resistance was over Paris pale and slightly shuddering still stood safe Calais was not taken and dug into their trenches it was evident that the opposing armies would lie face to face with no decisive encounter possible until the spring There was with all their beauty and terror an element of the facetious in these unexpected holidays of the matter of factness the freedom from strain or sentiment that was the English oddity and the English strength Men who had known the horrors of the retreat from Mons or the carnage of Ypres who had not taken off their clothes for ten days at a stretch or slept for four nights came home from trenches knee deep in mud from battlefields heaped with unburied dead and appeared immaculate and cheerful at breakfast a little sober and preoccupied perhaps touched perhaps with strangeness but ready for the valorous family jest and alluding to the war as if while something too solemn for adequate comment it were yet something that lent itself to laughter One did such funny things and saw them of the other things one did not speak and there was the huge standing joke of an enemy who actually hated one These grave and cheerful young men hated nobody but they were very eager to go back again and they were all ready not only to die but to die good humoredly From the demeanor of mothers and wives and sisters it was evident that nothing would be said or done to make this readiness difficult but missus Bradley who showed serenity to the world and did not even when alone allow herself to cry suspected that the others beneath their smiles carried hearts as heavy with dread as her own It had been heavy with hope now as well as with dread for the past week It was a week since she had last heard from Jack missus Crawley over the hill had had her wire and her husband was now with her and Lady Wrexham expected her boy to morrow There was no certainty at all as regarded herself yet at any moment she might have a wire and feeling to day the stress of waiting too great to be borne in passivity she left her books and letters and put on her gardening shoes and gloves and went out to her borders For weeks now the incessant rain had made the relief and solace of gardening almost an impossibility but to day was mild and clear There was no radiance in the air curtains of pearly mist shut out the sky yet here and there a soft opening in the white showed a pale far blue gentle and remote as the gaze of a wandering goddess and the hills seemed to smile quietly up at the unseen sun missus Bradley as she went along the river path could look across at the hills the river path and the hills were the great feature of Dorrington the placid comely red brick house to which she and Jack had come fifteen years ago after the death of her husband in India Enclosed by woods and almost catching sight of the road from its upper windows and over its old brick wall the house could have seemed to her too commonplace and almost suburban in spite of the indubitably old oak paneling of the drawing room had it not been for the river and the hills Stepping out on to the lawn from the windows of the drawing room she and Jack on that April day had found themselves confronting both the limpid rapid little stream spanned near the house by its mossy bridge and the hills beyond the meadows streaked with purple woodlands and rising above the woods to slopes russet fawn and azure Jack holding her by the hand had pointed at once with an eager Isn t it pretty mummy even at eight he had cared almost as much as she and extraordinarily in the same way for the sights of the country and if the hills had not settled the question it was settled quite finally ten minutes later by the white hepaticas They had come upon them suddenly after their tour of the walled kitchen garden and their survey of the lawn with its ugly shrubberies now long forgotten penetrating a thicket of hazels and finding themselves in an opening under trees where neighboring woods looked at them over an old stone wall and where from an old stone bench one could see the river The ground was soft with the fallen leaves of many an autumn a narrow path ran half obliterated down to the river and among the faded brown everywhere rose the thick clusters the dark leaves and the snowy flowers poignant amazing in their beauty She and Jack had stopped short to gaze She had never seen such white hepaticas or so many or so placed And Jack presently lifting his dear nut brown head and nut brown eyes had said gazing up at her as he had gazed at the flowers They are just like you mummy She had felt at once that they were like her more like than the little boy s instinct could grasp He had thought of the darkness and whiteness her widow s weeds and pale face had suggested that but he could not know the sorrow the longing the earthly sense of irreparable loss the heavenly sense of a possession unalterably hers that the dark melancholy leaves and celestial whiteness of the flowers expressed to her Tears had risen to her eyes and she had stooped and kissed her child how like her husband s that little face and had said after a moment We must never leave them Jack They had never left them Dorrington had been their home for fifteen years and the hepaticas the heart of it it had always seemed to them both the loveliest ritual of the year that early spring one when in the hazel copse they would find the white hepaticas again in flower And of all the autumnal labors none were sweeter than those which cherished and divided and protected the beloved flowers missus Bradley to day worked in her long border weeding troweling placing belated labels She was dressed in black her straw hat bound beneath her chin by a ribbon and her soft gardening gloves rolling back from her firm white wrists Her gestures expressed a calm energy an accurate grace She was tall and when she raised herself to look over the meadows at the hills she showed small decisive features all marked in the pallor of her face as if with the delicate neutral emphasis of an etching the gray scrutinizing eyes the charming yet ugly nose the tranquil mouth which had at the corners a little drop half sweet half bitter as if with tears repressed or a summoned smile Squared at brow and chin it would but for the mildness of the gaze have been an imperious face and her head its whitened hair drawn back and looped in wide braids behind had an air at once majestic and unworldly She had worked for over an hour and the last label was set beside a precious clump of iris The hazel copse lay near by and gathering up her tools drawing off her wet gloves she followed the path under the leafless branches and among the hepaticas to the stone bench where sinking down she knew that she was very tired She could see below the bank the dark quick stream a pale diffused light in the sky showed where the sun was dropping toward the hills Where was Jack at this moment this quiet moment of a monotonous English winter day so like the days of all the other years that it was impossible to think of what was happening a few hours journey away across the Channel Impossible to think of it yet the thick throb of her heart spoke to the full of its significance She had told herself from the beginning passionate rebellious creature as at bottom she knew herself to be always in need of discipline and only in these later years schooled to a control and submission that in her youth she would have believed impossible to her she had told herself when he had gone from her that as a soldier s widow she must see her soldier son go to death She must give him to that be ready for it and if he came back to her it would be as if he were born again a gift a grace unexpected and unclaimed She must feel for herself as well as for her country that these days of dread were also days of a splendor and beauty unmatched by any in England s history and that a soldier s widow must ask for no more glorious fate for her son than death in such a cause She had told herself all this many times yet as she sat there her hands folded on her lap her eyes on the stream below she felt that she was now merely motherhood tense huddled throbbing and longing longing for its child Then suddenly she heard Jack s footsteps They came quick and light along the garden path they entered the wood they were near but softened by the fallen leaves And half rising afraid of her own joy she hardly knew that she saw him before she was in his arms and it was better to meet thus in the blindness and darkness of their embrace her cheek pressed against his hair his head buried close between her neck and shoulder Jack Jack she heard herself say He said nothing holding her tightly to him with quick breaths and even after she had opened her eyes and could look down at him her own her dear beautiful Jack could see the nut brown head the smooth brown cheek the firm brown hand which grasped her he did not for a long time raise his head and look at her When at last he did look up she could not tell through her tears whether like herself he was trying to smile They sat down together on the bench She did not ask him why he had not wired That question pressed too sharply on her heart to ask might seem to reproach Darling you are so thin so much older but you look strong and well We re all of us extraordinarily fit mummy It s wholesome living in mud And wholesome living among bursting shells I had your last letter telling of that miraculous escape There have been a lot more since then Every day seems a miracle that one s alive at the end of it But you get used to it All except the noise That always seems to daze me still Some of our fellows are deaf from it You heard of Toppie mother Jack asked Toppie was Alan Thorpe Jack s nearest friend He had been killed ten days ago I heard it Jack Were you with him Yes It was in a bayonet charge He didn t suffer A bullet went right through him He just gave a little cry and fell Jack s voice had the mildness of a sorrow which has passed beyond the capacity for emotion We found him afterwards He is buried out there You must tell Frances about it Jack I went to her at once Frances was Toppie s sister She is bearing it so bravely I must write to her She would be sure to be plucky He answered all her questions sitting closely against her his arm around her looking down while he spoke and twisting as had always been his boyish way a button on her coat He was at that enchanting moment of young manhood when the child is still apparent in the man His glance was shy yet candid his small firm lips had a child s gravity With his splendid shoulders long legs and noble little head he was yet as endearing as he was impressive His mother s heart ached with love and pride and fear as she gazed at him And a question came near the sharp one yet hoping to evade it Jack dearest how long will you be with me How long is the leave He raised his eyes then and looked at her a curious look Something in it blurred her mind with a sense of some other sort of fear Only till to night he said It seemed confusion rather than pain that she felt Only till to night Jack But Richard Crawley has been back for three days already I thought they gave you longer I know mummy His eyes were dropped again and his hand at the button did it tremble twisted and untwisted I ve been back for three days already I ve been in London In London Her breath failed her The sense of alien fear became a fog horrible suffocating But Jack why I didn t wire mummy because I knew I d have to be there for most of my time I felt that I couldn t wire and tell you I felt that I had to see you when I told you Mother I m married I came back to get married I was married this morning O mother can you ever forgive me His shaking hands held her and his eyes could not meet hers She felt the blood rush as if her heart had been divided with a sword to her throat to her eyes choking her burning her and as if from far away she heard her own voice saying after a little time had passed There s nothing I couldn t forgive you Jack

none	none	Don t be afraid of hurting me He held her tightly still looking down as he said She is a dancer mother a little dancer It was in London last summer A lot of us came up from Aldershot together She was in the chorus of one of those musical comedies Mother you can never understand But it wasn t just low and vulgar She was so lovely so very young with the most wonderful golden hair and the sweetest eyes I don t know I simply went off my head when I saw her We all had supper together afterwards Toppie knew one of the other girls and Dollie was there That s her name Dollie Vaughan her stage name Her real name was Byles Her people I think were little tradespeople and she d lost her father and mother and an aunt had been very unkind She told me all about it that night Mother please believe just this it wasn t only the obvious thing I know I can t explain But you remember when we read War and Peace his broken voice groped for the analogy you remember Natacha when she falls in love with Anatole and nothing that was real before seems real and she is ready for anything It was like that It was all fairyland like that No one thought it wrong It didn t seem wrong Everything went together She had gathered his hand closely in hers and she sat there quiet looking at her hopes lying slain before her Her Jack The wife who was perhaps to have been his The children that she perhaps should have seen All dead The future blotted out Only this wraith like present only this moment of decision Jack and his desperate need the only real things left And after a moment for his laboring breath had failed she said Yes dear and smiled at him He covered his face with his hands Mother I ve ruined your life He had of course in ruining his own yet even at that moment of wreckage she was able to remember if not to feel that life could mend from terrible wounds could marvelously grow from compromises and defeats No dearest no she said While I have you nothing is ruined We shall see what can be done Go on Tell me the rest He put out his hand to hers again and sat now a little turned away from her speaking on in his deadened bitter voice There wasn t any glamour after that first time I only saw her once or twice again I was awfully sorry and ashamed over the whole thing Her company left London on tour and then the war came and I simply forgot all about her And the other day over there I had a letter from her She was in terrible trouble She was ill and had no money and no work And she was going to have a child my child and she begged me to send her a little money to help her through or she didn t know what would become of her The fog the horrible confusion even the despair had passed now The sense of ruin of wreckage almost irreparable was there yet with it too was the strangest sense of gladness He was her own Jack completely hers for she saw now why he had done it she could be glad that he had done it she could be glad that he had done it Go on dear she said I understand I understand perfectly O mother bless you He put her hand to his lips bowing his head upon it for a moment I was afraid you couldn t I was afraid you couldn t forgive me But I had to do it I thought it all over out there Everything had become so different after what one had been through One saw everything differently Some things didn t matter at all and other things mattered tremendously This was one of them I knew I couldn t just send her money I knew I couldn t bear to have the poor child born without a name and with only that foolish little mother to take care of it And when I found I could get this leave I knew I must marry her That was why I didn t wire I thought I might not have time to come to you at all Where is she Jack Her voice her eyes her smile at him showed him that indeed she understood perfectly In lodgings that I found for her nice and quiet with a kind landlady She was in such an awful place in Ealing She is so changed poor little thing I should hardly have known her Mother darling I wonder could you just go and see her once or twice She s frightfully lonely and so very young If you could if you would just help things along a little till the baby comes I should be so grateful And then if I don t come back will you for my sake see that they are safe But Jack she said smiling at him she is coming here of course I shall go and get her to morrow He stared at her and his color rose Get her Bring her here to stay Of course darling And if you don t come back I will take care of them always But mother said Jack and there were tears in his eyes you don t know you don t realize I mean she s a dear little thing but you couldn t be happy with her She d get most frightfully on your nerves She s just just a silly little dancer who has got into trouble Jack was clear sighted Every vestige of fairyland had vanished And she was deeply thankful that they should see alike while she answered It s not exactly a time for considering one s nerves is it Jack I hope I won t get on hers I must just try and make her as happy as I can She made it all seem natural and almost sweet The tears were in his eyes yet he had to smile back at her when she said You know that I am good at managing people I ll manage her And perhaps when you come back my darling she won t be a silly little dancer They sat now for a little while in silence While they had talked a golden sunset slowly had illuminated the western sky The river below them was golden and the wintry woodlands bathed in light Jack held her hands and gazed at her Love could say no more than his eyes in their trust and sorrow said to her she could never more completely possess her son Sitting there with him hand in hand while the light slowly ebbed and twilight fell about them she felt it to be in its accepted sorrow the culminating and transfiguring moment of her maternity When they at last rose to go it was the hour for Jack s departure and it had become almost dark Far away through the trees they could see the lighted windows of the house which waited for them but to which she must return alone With his arms around her shoulders Jack paused a moment looking about him Do you remember that day when we first came here mummy he asked She felt in him suddenly a sadness deeper than any he had yet shown her The burden of the past she had lifted from him but he must bear now the burden of what he had done to her to their life to all the future And protesting against his pain her mother s heart strove still to shelter him while she answered as if she did not feel his sadness Yes dear and do you remember the hepaticas on that day Like you said Jack in a gentle voice I can hardly see the plants Are they all right They are doing beautifully I wish the flowers were out said Jack I wish it were the time for the flowers to be out so that I could have seen you and them together like that first day And then putting his head down on her shoulder he murmured It will never be the same again I ve spoiled everything for you But he was not to go from her uncomforted She found the firmest voice in which to answer him stroking his hair and pressing him to her with the full reassurance of her resolution Nothing is spoiled Jack nothing You have never been so near me so how can anything be spoiled And when you come back darling you ll find your son perhaps and the hepaticas may be in flower waiting for you II missus Bradley and her daughter in law sat together in the drawing room They sat opposite each other on the two chintz chesterfields placed at right angles to the pleasantly blazing fire the chintz curtains drawn against a rainy evening It was a long low room with paneled walls and like missus Bradley s head it had an air at once majestic decorated and old fashioned It was a rather crowded room with many deep chairs and large couches many tables with lamps and books and photographs upon them many porcelains prints and pots of growing flowers missus Bradley her tea table before her was in her evening black silk lace ruffles rose about her throat she wore her accustomed necklace of old enamel blue black and white set with small diamonds and the enamel locket which had within it Jack s face on one side and his father s on the other her white hands moving gently among the teacups showed an ancient cluster of diamonds above the slender wedding ring From time to time she lifted her eyes and smiled quietly over at her daughter in law It was the first time that she had really seen Dollie that is in any sense that meant contemplative observation Dollie had spent her first week at Dorrington in bed sodden with fatigue rather than ill What you need missus Bradley had said is to go to sleep for a fortnight and Dollie had almost literally carried out the prescription Stealing carefully into the darkened room with its flowers and opened windows and steadily glowing fire missus Bradley had stood and looked for long moments at all that she could see of her daughter in law a flushed almost babyish face lying on the pillow between thick golden braids sleeping so deeply so unconsciously her sleep making her mother in law think of a little boat gliding slowly yet steadily on and on between new shores so that when she was to awake and look about her it would be as if with no bewilderment or readjustment she found herself transformed a denizen of an altered world That was what missus Bradley wanted that Dollie should become an inmate of Dorrington with as little effort or consciousness for any of them as possible and the drowsy days and nights of infantine slumbers seemed indeed to have brought her very near She and Pickering the admirable woman who filled so skillfully the combined positions of lady s maid and parlormaid in her little establishment had braided Dollie s thick tresses one on either side missus Bradley laughing a little and both older women touched almost happy in their sense of something so young and helpless to take care of Pickering understood nearly as well as Jack s mother that Master Jack as he had remained to her had married very much beneath him but at this time of tragic issues and primitive values she nearly as much as Jack s mother felt only the claim the pathos of youth and helplessness It was as if they had a singularly appealing case of a refugee to take care of social and even moral appraisals were inapplicable to such a case and missus Bradley felt that she had never so admired Pickering as when seeing that for her too they were in abeyance It was a comfort to feel so fond of Pickering at a time when one was in need of any comfort one could get and to feel that creature of codes and discriminations as she was to a degree that had made her mistress sometimes think of her as a sort of Samurai of service a function rather than a person she was even more fundamentally a kind and Christian woman Between them cook intelligently sustaining them from below and the housemaids helpful in their degree they fed and tended and nursed Dollie and by that eighth day she was more than ready to get up and go down and investigate her new surroundings She sat there now in the pretty tea gown her mother in law had bought for her leaning back against her cushions one arm lying along the back of the couch and one foot in its patent leather shoe with its sparkling buckle and alarming heel thrusting forward a carefully arched instep The attitude made one realize however completely tenderer preoccupations held the foreground of one s consciousness how often and successfully she must have sat to theatrical photographers Her way of smiling too very softly yet with the effect of a calculated and dazzling display of pearly teeth was impersonal and directed as it were to the public via the camera rather than to any individual interlocutor missus Bradley even imagined unversed as she was in the methods of Dollie s world that of allurement in its conscious and determined sense she was almost innocent She placed herself she adjusted her arm and her foot and she smiled gently intention hardly went further than that wish to look her best Pink and white and gold as she was and draped there on the chesterfield in a profusion of youth and a frivolity that was yet all passivity she made her mother in law think and with a certain sinking of the heart of a Dorothy Perkins rose a flower she had never cared for and Dollie carried on the analogy in the sense she gave that there were such myriads more just like her On almost every page of every illustrated weekly paper one saw the ingenuous limpid eyes the display of eyelash the lips their outline emphasized by just that touch of rouge those copious waves of hair Like the Dorothy Perkins roses on their pergolas so these pretty faces seemed looped draped festooned to climb over all the available spaces of the modern press But this missus Bradley told herself was to see Dollie with a dry hard eye was to see her superficially from the social rather than from the human point of view Under the photographic creature must lie the young young girl so young so harmless that it would be very possible to mould her with all discretion all tenderness into some suitability as Jack s wife Dollie from the moment that she had found her a sodden battered rose indeed in the London lodging house had shown herself grateful even humble and endlessly acquiescent She had not shown herself at all abashed or apologetic and that had been a relief had counted for her indeed in her mother in law s eyes as a sort of innocence a sort of dignity But if Dollie were contented with her new mother and very grateful to her she was also contented with herself missus Bradley had been aware of this at once and she knew now that if she were being carefully and commendingly watched while she poured out the tea this concentration did not imply unqualified approval Dollie was the type of young woman to whom she herself stood as the type of the perfect lady but with the appreciation went the proviso of the sharp little London mind versed in the whole ritual of smartness as it displayed itself at theatre or restaurant that she was a rather dowdy one She was a lady perfect but not smart while at the same time the quality of her defect was she imagined a little bewildering and therefore a little impressive Actually to awe Dollie and to make her shy it would be necessary to be smart but it was far more pleasant and perhaps as efficacious merely to impress her and it was as well that Dollie should be impressed for anything in the nature of an advantage that she could recognize would make it easier to direct protect and mould her She asked her a good many leisurely and unstressed questions on this first evening and drew Dollie to ask others in return and she saw herself stooping thoughtfully over a flourishing young plant which yet needed transplanting softly moving the soil about its roots softly finding out if there were any very deep tap root that would have to be dealt with But Dollie so far as tastes and ideas went hardly seemed to have any roots at all so few that it was a question if any change of soil could affect a creature so shallow She smiled she was at ease she showed her complete assurance that a young lady so lavishly endowed with all the most significant gifts need not occupy herself with mental adornments You re a great one for books I see she commented looking about the room I suppose you do a great deal of reading down here to keep from feeling too dull and she added that she herself if there was nothing doing liked a good novel especially if she had a box of sweets to eat while she read it You shall have a box of sweets to morrow missus Bradley told her with or without the novel as you like And Dollie thanked her watching her cut the cake and as the rain lashed against the windows remarking on the bad weather and cheerfully hoping that poor old Jack wasn t in those horrid trenches I think war s a wicked thing don t you missus Bradley she added When Dollie talked in this conventionally solicitous tone of Jack her mother in law could but wish her upstairs again merely young merely the tired and battered refugee She had not much tenderness for Jack that was evident nor much imaginativeness in regard to the feelings of Jack s mother But she soon passed from the theme of Jack and his danger Her tea was finished and she got up and went to the piano remarking that there was one thing she could do Poor mother used to always say I was made of music From the time I was a mere tot I could pick out anything on the piano And placing herself pressing down the patent leather shoe on the loud pedal she surged into a waltz as foolish and as conventionally alluring as her own eyes Her inaccuracy was equaled only by her facility Smiling swaying over the keys with alternate speed and languor she addressed her audience with altogether the easy mastery of a music hall artiste It s a lovely thing one of my favorites I ll often play missus Bradley and cheer us up There is nothing like music for that is there it speaks so to the heart And whole heartedly indeed she accompanied the melody by a passionate humming The piano was Jack s and it was poor Jack who was made of music How was he to bear it his mother asked herself as she sat listening Dollie after that initiation spent many hours at the piano every day so many and such noisy hours that her mother in law unnoticed could shut herself in the little morning room that overlooked the brick wall at the front of the house and had the morning sun It was difficult to devise other occupations for Dollie She earnestly disclaimed any wish to have proper music lessons and when her mother in law patiently persistent arranged for a skillful mistress to come down twice a week from London Dollie showed such apathy and dullness that any hope of developing such musical ability as she possessed had to be abandoned She did not like walking and the sober pageant of the winter days was a blank book to her Sewing she said had always given her frightful fidgets and it was with the strangest sense of a privilege a joy unhoped for and now thrust upon her that missus Bradley sat alone working at the little garments which meant all her future and all Jack s The baby seemed already more hers than Dollie s Sometimes on a warm afternoon Dollie wrapped in her fur cloak would emerge for a little while and watch her mother in law at work in her borders The sight amused and surprised but hardly interested her and she soon went tottering back to the house on the preposterous heels which missus Bradley had as yet found no means of tactfully banishing And sometimes when the piano again resounded missus Bradley would leave her borders and retreat to the hazel copse where as she sat on the stone bench she could hear through the soft sound of the running water hardly more than the distant beat and hum of Dollie s waltzes and where with more and more the sense of escape and safety she could find a refuge from the sight and sound and scent of Dollie the thick sweet penetrating scent which was always to be indelibly associated in her mother in law s mind with this winter of foreboding of hope and of growing hopelessness In her letters to Jack she found herself involuntarily at first and then deliberately altering suppressing even falsifying While Dollie had been in bed when so much hope had been possible of a creature so unrevealed she had written very tenderly and she continued now to write tenderly and it was not false to do that she could feel no hardness or antagonism against poor Dollie But she continued to write hopefully as every day hope grew less Jack himself did not say much of Dollie though there was always the affectionate message and the affectionate inquiry But what was difficult to deal with were the hints of his anxiety and fear that stole among the terse cheerful descriptions of his precarious days What was she doing with herself How were she and Dollie getting on Did Dollie care about any of the things she cared about She told him that they got on excellently well that Dollie spent a good deal of time at the piano and that when they went out to tea people were perfectly nice and understanding She knew indeed that she could depend on her friends to be that They accepted Dollie on the terms she asked for her From friends so near as missus Crawley and Lady Wrexham she had not concealed the fact that Dollie was a misfortune but if others thought so they were not to show it She still hoped by degrees to make Dollie a figure easier to deal with at such neighborly gatherings She had abandoned any hope that Dollie would grow anything so feeble and so foolish could not grow there was no other girl under the little dancer she was simply no more and no less than she showed herself to be but at this later stage of their relationship missus Bradley essayed now and then a deliberate if kindly severity as to heels as to scents as to touches of rouge Oh but I m as careful just as careful missus Bradley Dollie protested I can t walk in lower heels They hurt my instep I ve a very high instep and it needs support She was genuinely amazed that any one could dislike her scent and that any one could think the rouge unbecoming She seemed to acquiesce but the acquiescence was followed by moods of mournfulness and even by tears There was no capacity in her for temper or rebellion and she was all unconscious of giving a warning as she sobbed It s nothing really nothing missus Bradley I m sure you mean to be kind Only it s rather quiet and lonely here I ve always been used to so many people to having everything so bright and jolly She was not rapacious she was not dissolute she could be kept respectable and even contented if she were not made too aware of the contrast between her past existence and her present lot With an air only of pensive pride she would sometimes point out to missus Bradley in the pages of those same illustrated weeklies with which her mother in law associated her the face of some former companion One of these young ladies had recently married the son of a peer She is in luck Floss said Dollie We always thought it would come to that He s been gone on her for ages but his people were horrid missus Bradley felt that at all events Dollie had no ground for thinking her horrid yet she imagined that there lay drowsing at the back of her mind a plaintive little sense of being caught and imprisoned Floss had stepped triumphant from the footlights to the registrar s office and apparently had succeeded in uniting the radiance of her past and present status No Dollie could be kept respectable and contented only if the pressure were of the lightest She could not change she could only shift and although missus Bradley felt that for herself her life behind her her story told she could manage to put up with a merely shifted Dollie she could not see how Jack was to manage it What was Jack to do with her was the thought that pressed with a growing weight on her mother s heart She could never be of Jack s life yet here she was in it planted there by his own generous yet inevitable act and by hers in its very centre and not to be evaded or forgotten And the contrast between what Jack s life might have been and what it now must be was made more poignantly apparent to her when Frances Thorpe came down to stay from a Saturday to Monday Frances in her black tired and thin from Red Cross work in London bereaved in more her old friend knew than dear Toppie s death yet with her leisurely unstressed cheerfulness almost unaltered the lightness that went with so much tenderness the drollery that went with so much depth Dearest most charming of girls but for Jack s wretched stumble into fairyland last summer destined obviously to be his wife could any presence have shown more disastrously in its contrast with poor Dollie how Jack had done for himself She watched the two together that evening Frances with her thick crinkled hair and clearly curved brow and her merry

none	none	eyes leaning elbow on knee to talk and listen to Dollie and Dollie poor Dollie flushed touched with an unbecoming sulkiness aware swiftly and unerringly of a rival type Frances was of the type that young men married when they did not do for themselves There was now no gulf of age or habit to veil from Dollie her disadvantage She answered shortly with now and then a dry ironic little laugh and getting up at last she went to the piano and loudly played He couldn t have done differently It was the only thing he could do Frances said that night before her bedroom fire She did not hide her recognition of Jack s plight but she was staunch I wouldn t have had him do differently But it will ruin his life said the mother If he comes back it will ruin his life No no said Frances looking at the flames Why should it A man does n t depend on his marriage like that He has his career Yes He has his career A career isn t a life Isn t it The girl gazed down But it s what so many people have to put up with And so many haven t even a career Something came into her voice and she turned from it quickly He s crippled in a sense of course But you are here He will have you to come back to always I shall soon be old dear and she will always be here That s inevitable Some day I shall have to leave her to Jack to bear with alone She may become more of a companion No no she won t The bitterness of the mother s heart expressed itself in the dry light utterance It was a comfort to express bitterness for once to somebody She is a harmless little thing Frances offered after a moment Harmless missus Bradley turned it over dryly and lightly I can t feel her that I feel her blameless if you like And it will be easy to keep her contented That is really the best that one can say of poor Dollie And then there will be the child I am pinning all my hopes to the child Frances Frances understood that Dollie as the winter wore on kept remarkably well She had felt it the proper thing to allude to Jack and his danger and so now she more and more frequently felt it the proper thing to allude humorously if with a touch of melancholy to baby Her main interest in baby missus Bradley felt was an alarmed one She was a good deal frightened poor little soul and in need of constant reassurances and it was when one need only pet and pity Dollie that she was easier to deal with missus Bradley tried to interest her in plans for the baby what it should be named and how its hair should be done if it were a little girl for only on this assumption could Dollie s interest be at all vividly roused and missus Bradley hoped more than ever for a boy when she found Dollie s idle yet stubborn thoughts fixed on the name of Gloria She was able to evade discussion of this point and when the baby came fortunately and robustly into the world on a fine March morning she could feel it as a minor but very real cause for thanksgiving that Dollie need now never know what she thought of Gloria as a name The baby was a boy and now that he was here Dollie seemed as well pleased that he should be a commonplace Jack and that there should be no question of tying his hair with cockades of ribbon over each ear Smiling and rosy and languid she lay in her charming room not at all more maternal though she showed a bland satisfaction in her child and noted that his eyes were just like Jack s yet subtly more wifely Baby she no doubt felt with the dim instinct that did duty for thought with her placed and rooted her and gave her final rights She referred now to Jack with the pensive but open affection of their shared complacency and made her mother in law think as she lay there of a soft and sleepy and tenacious creeper fixing tentacle after tentacle in the walls of Jack s house of life If only one could feel that she had furnished it with a treasure Gravely with a sad fondness the grandmother studied the little face so unfamiliar for signs of Jack She was a helplessly clear sighted woman and remembrance was poignantly vivid in her of Jack s face at a week old Already she loved the baby since its eyes indubitably were his but she could find no other trace of him It was not a Bradley baby and in the dreamy foreboding flickers of individuality that pass uncannily across an infant s features her melancholy and steady discernment could see only the Byles ancestry She was to do all she could for the baby to save him so far as might be from his Byles ancestry and to keep him so far as might be Jack s and hers That was to be her task But with all the moulding that could mercifully be applied from the very beginning she could not bring herself to believe that this was ever to be a very significant human being She sent Jack his wire A son Dollie doing splendidly And she had his answer Best thanks Love to Dollie It was curious indeed this strange new fact they had now always to deal with this light little Dollie that must be passed between them The baby might have made Jack happy but it had not solved the problem of his future III A week later the telegram was brought to her telling her that he had been killed in action It was a beautiful spring day just such a day as that on which she and Jack had first seen Dorrington and she had been working in the garden When she had read she turned and walked down the path that led to the hazel copse She hardly knew what had happened to her there was only an instinct for flight concealment secrecy but as she walked there rose in her without sound as if in a nightmare the terrible cry of her loneliness The dark wet earth that covered him seemed heaped upon her heart The hazel copse was tasseled thickly with golden green and as she entered it she saw that the hepaticas were in flower They seemed to shine with their own celestial whiteness set in their melancholy green among the fallen leaves She had never seen them look so beautiful She followed the path looking down at them and she seemed to feel Jack s little hand in hers and to see at her side his nut brown head It had been on just such a morning She came to the stone bench but the impulse that had led her here was altered She did not sink down and cover her face but stood looking around her at the flowers the telegram still open in her hand and slowly with stealing calm the sense of sanctuary fell about her She had lost him and with him went all her life He was dead his youth and strength and beauty Yet what was this strange up welling of relief deep deep relief for Jack this gladness poignant and celestial like that of the hepaticas He was dead and the dark earth covered him yet he was here with her safe in his youth and strength and beauty forever He had died the glorious death and no future tangled perplexed fretful with its foolish burden lay before him There was no loss for Jack no fading no waste The burden was for her and he was free Later when pain should have dissolved thought her agony would come to her unalleviated but this hour was hers and his She heard the river and the soft whisperings of spring A bird dropped lightly unafraid from branch to branch of a tree near by From the woods came the rapid insistent tapping of a woodpecker and as in so many springs she seemed to hear Jack say Hark mummy and his little hand was always held in hers And everywhere telling of irreparable loss of a possession unalterable the tragic the celestial hepaticas She sat down on the stone bench now and closed her eyes for a little while so holding them more closely Jack and the hepaticas together POSSESSING PRUDENCE BY AMY WENTWORTH STONE I A lie s an abomination unto the Lord a hundred and twenty four a lie s an abomination unto the Lord a hundred and twenty five a lie s an abomination unto the Lord a hundred and twenty six recited Prudence Jane and paused Go on said Aunt Annie looking up from her sewing and fixing her eyes severely on the small blue back across the room Prudence Jane with the heels of her little ankle ties together and her hands clasped tightly behind her was standing in the corner saying what was known in the family as her punish sentence Whenever she had been unusually naughty she had to say one four hundred times up in Aunt Annie s room It was no doubt a silly sort of punishment but it was one that Prudence Jane strongly objected to and that after all is the essence of a punishment Prudence Jane had seven teasing mimicking brothers and whenever one of them caught her saying a punish sentence it was days before she heard the last of it Already in the garden below there was audible a shrill voice singing A lie is an a bom i na tion un to the Lord to the tune of Has anybody here seen Kelly And out of the corner of her eye which was supposed to be fastened on the rosebuds of Aunt Annie s wall paper Prudence Jane could see an impudent little person in corduroys straddling the gravel walk and squinting up at the window Is a lie s an abomination in the Bible inquired Prudence Jane Yes said Aunt Annie go on Where demanded Prudence Jane Where repeated Aunt Annie a little blankly Why why in the middle of the Bible Don t you listen to the minister Prudence Jane The middle of the minister s Bible pursued Prudence Jane Yes of course said Aunt Annie Prudence Jane if you don t go on at once I shall have you say it five hundred times A lie s an abomination unto the Lord a hundred and twenty seven resumed Prudence Jane hastily Prudence Jane s sentences varied from day to day it being Aunt Annie s idea to fit the sentence to the crime whenever possible Thus for being late to school it was naturally Procrastination is the thief of time While for telling Lena the cook that Uncle Arthur had said she was more of a lady than Aunt Annie the sentence had been nothing less than Truth crushed to earth will rise again This particular fib had been very disastrous in its consequences We will not dwell upon them here They make a story in themselves Suffice it to say that there was no possible excuse for Prudence Jane It was otherwise with the fib for which she was this morning serving a sentence up in Aunt Annie s room Those who also have been named after their two grandmothers will at once forgive Prudence Jane for telling the new minister the very first time she met him that her name was Imogen Rose It was to be sure a stupid little fib and was therefore quite unworthy of Prudence Jane For Prudence Jane almost never told stupid little fibs The fibs of Prudence Jane were little masterpieces with a finish and distinction all their own Her brother Will who adored her and had a large mind declared when he came home from college that she was the greatest mistress of imaginative fiction since George Eliot Her Aunt Annie who had not had the advantages of a college course and who roomed with Prudence Jane said that she was a simple little liar Now this was unfair of Aunt Annie for whatever else Prudence Jane might be she was not simple Even her looks belied her With her big confiding eyes as round and blue as two forget me nots and her pale yellow hair held demurely back from her forehead by a blue ribbon fillet she gave an impression of gentle innocence that was altogether misleading She is so like little Bertie dear old Grandma Piper would say that same frail flower like look that he had toward the last I almost tremble sometimes Haven t you noticed a transparency about her lately Annie But Aunt Annie never had It may be said in passing that there was only one person to whom Prudence Jane was really transparent and that was her youngest brother Peter Peter was a square solid little person with a vacant countenance but nothing important that Prudence Jane did escaped him Just to look into that sweet little face is enough for me Grandma Goodwin would declare I don t want anybody to tell me that Prudence Jane is untruthful No child could look straight at you out of her little soul as she always does and tell a fib The trouble is they don t understand her at home I ve always said Annie Piper had a suspicious nature To do Aunt Annie justice it should be said that rooming with Prudence Jane did not tend to cultivate in one a nature that was trustful and confiding And yet at heart Prudence Jane was really not at all the incorrigible little fibber that she seemed She told fibs not because she wished to deceive but because the dull facts of life were so much less interesting than the lively little romances which she could make up out of her own head When one is a creative genius one naturally rebels at being shackled to anything so tedious as a fact Prudence Jane looking back over a day could rarely separate the things which had really happened from those she had invented Her brother Horace who was studying law said that he would give a hundred dollars to see Prudence Jane on the witness stand This was one night at supper when she was being cross examined by Aunt Annie For five minutes she had kept the family spellbound by a circumstantial account of how that afternoon she had seen an automobile truck loaded with a thousand boxes of eggs go over the embankment With eggs at sixty five cents a dozen this was really a very shocking tale Prudence Jane said Aunt Annie who had private sources of information you know well enough that no truck went over the embankment Whatever do you mean by telling such an outrageous fib Prudence Jane looked across the supper table at her aunt out of two round candid eyes That wasn t a fib that was just a story she explained Well it wasn t true and stories that aren t true are very wicked said Aunt Annie with decision Are all the stories in books true inquired Prudence Jane the picture of innocence behind her bowl of bread and milk No Aunt Annie was forced to admit but stories written in books are different The writers don t mean for us to believe them Do they say so in the books went on Prudence Jane relentlessly Of course not said Aunt Annie we know their stories aren t true so they don t deceive us But you always know my stories aren t true too objected Prudence Jane so I don t deceive you either Prudence Jane said Aunt Annie I shan t argue with you You are a very naughty little girl I sometimes think that you don t belong to us at all you re so different from your brothers This was true All the other little Pipers had been simple virtuous children with imaginations under perfect control a remarkable family everybody had said until the Pipers became quite complacent about themselves This was why Prudence Jane seemed like such a judgment upon them They had waited long and patiently as Aunt Annie put it for Providence to see fit to send them a dear little girl to inherit her grandmothers names and they received Prudence Jane Had she appeared at an earlier date or had there been another girl in the family she might have escaped either the Prudence or the Jane But for fifteen years little masculine Pipers had arrived in the household with unbroken regularity and been named one by one after all the available grandfathers and uncles For the last one indeed there had not been even a cousin left and he had been christened by common consent Peter Piper And still the grandmothers waited From the moment therefore when bluff old Doctor Jones looked in upon a parlor full of aunts and announced that it was a girl at last by Jove there had been no choice left for Prudence Jane The only point discussed in the solemn family conclave was as to whether she should not be Jane Prudence Oh for mercy s sake call the poor little kid Jurisprudence and be done with it said a flippant uncle and that had settled it Prudence Jane was duly entered at the end of the list in the middle of the Family Bible and her career began Through eight years she was just unmitigated Prudence Jane not a syllable of it could ever be omitted lest one grandmother or the other be slighted and then suddenly one day she decided that it was a combination no longer to be borne She hated her name with all her little soul therefore she would discard it and take another This sounded simple but there were in fact several complications The most important was Aunt Annie Never a really progressive spirit in this matter of names Aunt Annie showed herself to be an out and out stand patter You wish that you had been called Gwendolin she echoed in horror as she combed out the pale yellow hair at bed time Why Prudence Jane I m ashamed of you Gwendolin is a very silly name indeed and you have two such noble ones I only hope that you will grow up to be like the beautiful grandmammas who gave them to you which was a truly lovely little bit of optimism on Aunt Annie s part II Prudence Jane did not consult Aunt Annie further That very night however staring up into the darkness from her little white bed she decided upon a new combination And when the Reverend mister Sanders came up to her the next day after Sunday School and inquired kindly what little girl this was Prudence Jane was quite prepared to tell him with the transparent look which so frightened dear old Grandma Piper that it was Imogen Rose She fully meant to inform her family of this interesting change as soon as she got home from Sunday School but when she tiptoed into the parlor Aunt Annie in all the majesty of her plum colored satin was sitting in a straight backed chair reading The Christian Word and Work and looked unreceptive to new ideas So Prudence Jane tiptoed out again to await a more favorable moment Unfortunately before that moment arrived she had a falling out with her brother Peter This was a mistake for it was the part of prudence always to make an ally of Peter Piper He had discovered Prudence Jane flat on the floor in a corner of the library scratching her name out of the Family Bible with an ink eraser Did the minister tell you to write Imogen in he inquired blandly as he stood in the doorway with his hands in his corduroys None of your business retorted Prudence Jane closing the Bible with a bang and sitting down upon it The result was that Peter Piper from whom nothing was ever hidden went off and told Aunt Annie all about Imogen Rose and the minister Whereupon Aunt Annie with her usual limited point of view had pronounced it a very monstrous fib indeed and had sent Prudence Jane instantly into the corner A lie s an abomination unto the Lord three hundred and ninety eight a lie s an abomination unto the Lord three hundred and ninety nine a lie s an abomination unto the Lord four hundred finished Prudence Jane at a canter and whisked around from her corner Aunt Annie beckoned with solemn finger To morrow Prudence Jane she said looking across the sewing table I am going to take you to see the minister and you must tell him yourself what your real name is and what a dreadful story you have told him I shall ask him what he thinks should be done with a little girl who cannot speak the truth I m sure I don t know what he will say But we can t deceive a minister They always know when they hear a fib Do they asked Prudence Jane openly interested her round eyes fastened upon her aunt Always replied Aunt Annie rashly Then why do I have to go and tell him asked Prudence Jane Prudence Jane said Aunt Annie you are a very saucy little girl and I m sure I don t know what is going to become of you Prudence Jane walked slowly out of the room She was considering what Aunt Annie had said about ministers and she wondered if it were true As she went tripping down the stairs she decided to put the Reverend mister Sanders to a test the very next time she met him And that was why it was so surprising when she peeked through the hall window at the foot of the stairs to behold him diligently wiping his feet on the door mat How do you do said Prudence Jane politely as she opened the door Why good afternoon Imogen said the minister shaking hands cordially Prudence Jane made the little knix that she had learned at German school It was always the finishing touch to Prudence Jane The Reverend mister Sanders looked down upon it with a most friendly smile Is your aunt at home he asked placing his hat on the table and following Prudence Jane into the parlor Yes she said with simple candor A fib of that sort was quite beneath Prudence Jane Then she sat down on a velvet sofa spread out her little blue skirt folded her hands in her lap and crossed her ankle ties She had never in her life looked so much like little Bertie The Reverend mister Sanders regarding her from an opposite chair waited for her to open her lips and say Speak Lord for thy servant heareth Instead this is what she said Is Eliza Anna Bomination your grandmother I beg pardon said the Reverend mister Sanders Is she dead and gone to heaven and that s why you say unto the Lord continued Prudence Jane I wonder Imogen he said if you would mind beginning over again I say is Eliza Anna Bomination your grandmother repeated Prudence Jane Aunt Annie says she s written down in the middle of your Bible where all people s relations are and she sounded like a grandmother they always have such horrid names The minister looked across at the velvet sofa with eyes that entirely contradicted the gravity of his face No he said I m sorry but she isn t I wish she were I never heard of such a jolly grandmother Is she an aunt pursued his small interlocutor I m afraid that she s not even related by marriage he replied Isn t she written down in the middle of your Bible at all said Prudence Jane The minister shook his head No he said I m afraid not Then Aunt Annie told a whopper announced Prudence Jane with satisfaction We should not malign the absent said the Reverend mister Sanders And that being the case suppose you go up at this point Imogen and tell your Aunt Annie that I am here Prudence Jane wondered what maligning the absent was She distrusted gentlemen who made cryptic remarks of this sort It was a way her brother Horace had She saw that the moment had now arrived to test Aunt Annie s theory about ministers and fibs She can t come down she replied Can t come down repeated the minister No said Prudence Jane looking at him out of the depths of her forget me not eyes she s washed her hair Oh said the Reverend mister Sanders in the tone of one who finds the conversation getting definitely beyond him At this moment an apparition with a round face and a pair of corduroy shoulders suddenly darkened the open window A lie is an a bom i na tion un to the Lord it sang and catching sight of the clerical back vanished hastily Interesting chorus observed the Reverend mister Sanders Prudence Jane paid no heed to this interruption It s hanging down her back now she pursued launching upon the details with her usual aplomb It comes clear down to here And standing up she indicated a point halfway between her ankle ties and the bottom of her ridiculous skirt The minister gazed fascinated Prudence Jane sat down again She washed it with Packer s Tar Soap she said her eyes fixed upon her victim She was quite unable to make out whether Aunt Annie was right about ministers or not The Reverend mister Sanders looked like the Sphinx She gave a piece to a gentleman once went on Prudence Jane warming to her work He wasn t a very nice gentleman He was a a she hesitated a moment over a fitting climax a a Piskerpalyan she finished Mercy said the Reverend mister Sanders finding his voice at last And what may I ask are you Prudence Jane looked faintly surprised I she said with pride and composure am an Orthy Dox Congo Gationist Yes said the Reverend mister Sanders so I suspected from the first And now what did he mean by that thought Prudence Jane to herself She could no longer see his face He had turned abruptly in his chair and was watching something through the aperture in the portieres Prudence Jane heard the thump of a pair of shoes plodding up the stairs and along the upper hall She knew that it was Peter Piper going to find Aunt Annie There was a stir in the room overhead then the muffled sound of a rocking chair suddenly abandoned followed by the swish of skirts coming along the passage and down the stairs Prudence Jane sat with parted lips on the edge of the sofa The Reverend mister Sanders looked decidedly nervous but he rose and presented a bold front to whatever might be coming to him through those portieres In another moment they were pushed hastily aside and Aunt Annie crowned with a quite faultless coiffure hurried into the room Why mister Sanders she said I did not know until this minute that you were here Then her eye fell upon her niece Prudence Jane was now standing in front of the sofa tracing the pattern of the carpet with the toe of an ankle tie Why didn t you tell me that mister Sanders was waiting demanded Aunt Annie sternly Prudence Jane continued to gaze at the carpet mister Sanders said Aunt Annie who never postponed a disagreeable duty we have a little girl here who cannot speak the truth and we are going to ask you to tell us what becomes of people who tell wrong stories The Reverend mister Sanders looked ill at ease Come here continued Aunt Annie holding out her hand toward the velvet sofa Prudence Jane moved reluctantly across the room And now went on the voice of the accuser she has even deceived her minister and she has come to make her little confession Tell mister Sanders directed Aunt Annie the truth about that wicked fib Which one inquired Prudence Jane meekly You know very well which answered her exasperated aunt the last one Prudence Jane lifted her blue eyes from the carpet and looked straight at the unfortunate mister Sanders She didn t give any of it to the Piskerpalyan she said Then she turned and walked discreetly through the portieres She felt that it was no moment to stay and learn what became of little girls who told whoppers Didn t give who what she could hear Aunt Annie saying vaguely on the other side of the curtains But Prudence Jane decided to let her minister explain THE GLORY BOX BY ELIZABETH ASHE I In Southern Ohio a girl s wedding chest is her Glory Box If like Mabel Bennet you are the daughter of a successful druggist the box is of cedarwood delivered free of charge by the Dayton department stores but if like Eunice Day you are the daughter of an unsuccessful bookkeeper who has left a life insurance inadequate even when supplemented by the salary you earn teaching primary children then the box is just a box covered with gay cretonne and serving the purpose very nicely When Eunice Day s engagement became known Mabel remembering the scalloped guest towels which Eunice had given her some months before brought over one afternoon an offering wrapped in tissue paper I hope you ll like this Eunice she said It s just a sack what they call a matinee I ve found them very useful Mabel spoke with the slightly complacent air of the three months bride Why it s ever so dear of you to go to so much trouble said Eunice taking the package into her hands She was a tall slender girl with dark eyes and a pretty dignity of bearing I ll have to open it right now I guess You aren t in a hurry are you Oh no not especially Harry doesn t get home until quarter past six and I ve fixed the vegetables Just you go ahead Eunice untied the white ribbon Why Mabel it s beautiful and such a delicate shade of pink She held the sack at arm s length I m glad you like it It s nothing wonderful of course It couldn t be more pretty and Stephen loves pink I wrote him the other day that I had made a pink kimono and I hoped he would like it He wrote back that pink was was the color of dawn and apple blossoms Mabel laughed Stephen has a funny way of saying things hasn t he Why I don t know said Eunice flushing Oh well went on Mabel good naturedly I do think you look nice in pink with your dark hair Harry always tells me to stick to blue It s the color for blondes Don t you want to show me your things I won t mind if the ribbons aren t all run in yet I d like to show them to

none	none	Come upstairs They ll look nicer though when they are all pressed out said Eunice laying the sack carefully back in its paper wrappings She carried it on outstretched palms Do you know when you re going to be married asked Mabel as she reached the top of the narrow stairs We haven t made plans yet Probably Stephen won t want to for another year It depends on so many things I suppose so said Mabel following Eunice into her bedroom It was a small room but pretty Eunice had recently put four coats of white paint on her oak set Lawyers continued Mabel sympathetically have to wait so much longer Now Harry knew to a cent what salary he was getting when he proposed to me and he knew what his raise would probably be for the next two years The Wire Company is a square concern There s your Glory Box It looks awfully nice You made it didn t you Stephen made it when he was on for his vacation last summer We happened to have the cretonne in the house Mother wanted me to buy a cedar chest but I thought this would do Oh one doesn t really need a cedar chest said Mabel cheerfully and they re terribly expensive you know Yes I do know Eunice s face twinkled I ll lay this sack on the bed so it won t get mussed while I m showing you the things She raised the lid of the Glory Box then glanced shyly at the other girl You re the first person I ve shown them to I hope you ll think they re dainty There isn t much lace on them but mother put in a lot of handwork feather stitching Lace is a bother to do up Mabel said amiably I ve been almost distracted doing up mine Your things were beautiful though Eunice was laying piles of carefully folded garments on the edge of the box There I ve got it now she said getting up from the floor This is my prettiest set I ve kept it wrapped in dark blue paper Mother said it would keep white longer Why they are sweet Eunice Mabel touched the soft white stuff with appraising fingers And all made by hand My what a lot of work Your mother must have spent hours on them She did She said she wanted to do it though The other things are plainer Eunice took them up one by one and showed them I won t let you see the table linen to day I ve done a lot of initialing but they don t look really well until they have been washed No they don t Anyway I have to be going You certainly have nice things Eunice That kimono is awfully pretty I like it said Eunice simply Well I can t stay another minute Don t you come down to the door now You have to put away everything I ll just run along Come and see me I ve got the flat all settled I shall love to Mabel Just a moment You must let me go to the door with you The Glory Box can wait Eunice found her mother standing by the bed when she came back She was a meagre looking woman with a thin mouth Her eyes had once been soft and dark like Eunice s but the glow had gone out of them leaving them a little hard I ve been looking at the sack Mabel brought you It s a nice pattern That sort of lace looks almost like real val What did she say to your things She said they were sweet mother Well I suppose they are as nice as any one could have without spending money You didn t show her the tablecloth I gave you No I thought I d wait to show the linen until it was all done up Her mother fingered the lace on the sack I don t believe she has a much better tablecloth than that one Eunice Do you suppose so No answered Eunice probably not It s very beautiful She laid down the garment she was folding and looked up troubled into her mother s face Oh it seems so selfish for me to have it all You ve always wanted nice fine linen mother I ve given up wanting I guess I don t care as long as you have them You had better lay tissue paper in that sleeve Eunice the way I showed you I ll start supper so that you can put these things away They won t look like anything if you leave them about When her mother was gone Eunice took up the pink kimono and spread it out on the bed She could fold it more carefully that way She touched it with caressing fingers Dawn and apple blossoms she repeated softly Then she smiled remembering Mabel s remark Stephen has a funny way of saying things Stephen was different somehow from Harry from any of the men whom her friends had married They were nice young men of course all of them One was superintendent of the Sunday School besides getting a good salary in the Cash Register Company another had gone to college had been in Stephen s class at the Ohio State University in fact and was now doing well as part owner of the garage on Main Street still another was paying teller in the bank next to the garage he wore very good looking suits usually with a tiny line of white at the edge of the waistcoat Still Stephen was different When he had got his B A degree at Ohio he decided that he wanted to be a lawyer and that he would go to one of the best schools in the country He chose Columbia He had worked his way through college but he considered that it would not pay to work his way through Law School He wanted the time to get something out of New York His father was unable to advance the money so Stephen went to a friend of his father s a prosperous coal dealer in the town and asked that he lend him enough to put him through economically but not he plainly said too economically He would give the coal dealer notes payable with interest four years after he was admitted to the bar The coal dealer taking into consideration the fact that the young man had broken every record at the university in scholarship and two other facts the young man s forehead and mouth lent him the money He said that the interest need not begin until he was admitted Stephen thanked him and went to Columbia One of the professors there took a great fancy to him He introduced him to his sister a maiden lady living in Washington Square who finding him very likable introduced him to other people living in the Square Stephen was very happy He wrote to Eunice he had been engaged to her since the end of his second year at the Law School Washington Square is rather terrifying from the outside but once inside you feel beautifully at home I think it s the perfect breeding you find there I ve met women more intellectual greater perhaps than Professor Lansing s sister but never one who gives such an impression of completion There are no loose ends You will like her Eunice In another letter he said We won t have much money to start with of course but if we put a little dignity into our kitchenette apartment it will be a home that people will love to come to It s partly the dignity of their living that makes these Washington Square people so worth while to be with And last week he had written You won t find New York lonely They will love you dear You belong You have not only charm but the dignity that belongs I wonder if I m foolish to care so much for that word dignity Perhaps it s because I associate it with you or perhaps I love you because you have it And Eunice too was happy and proud happy that Stephen was coming into his own and proud that he should think her equal to the occasion It would not be an easy task being equal to Stephen Stephen was a great man or would be a great man She knew it and Stephen knew it We are going to be great you and I he had said more than once And yet one day when she had answered You and I Stephen his eyes which had been alight with the glorious vision of the future softened and he had come and knelt beside her and had laid his head down Oh Eunice he had whispered I ve got brains I m pretty sure to be successful but if I m worth while it will be because of you You are a great woman dear And Eunice had mothered him and had hoped so fervently that the hope was a prayer that she would really be great enough to meet his needs Sometimes she doubted She had dignity Stephen had said so but inside she was deprecating and shy People like Mabel Ashley made her shy and most of the people she knew were like Mabel They thought Stephen s way of saying and thinking things funny There was only one woman whom she could talk with a High School teacher who had come to board next door She and the High School teacher took long walks together The High School teacher had been to Europe twice She knew how people lived outside of this little Ohio town outside of the United States even She was full of shrewd comment Eunice talked to her about the books that she and Stephen were reading and sometimes about Stephen himself Several times the High School teacher had said He is splendid Eunice Eunice thought about her this afternoon as she put the last things away in the Glory Box She hoped that if the Washington Square people were like this teacher she would get along And there came another encouraging thought The people in the Square were sure of themselves of course but perhaps they were sure because they had things and had always had things She would one day have the things in her Glory Box and she would have Stephen After she was quite used to having them and to having a person like Stephen she would be sure of herself too Supper will be ready in five minutes Eunice I m coming in a moment The room had grown quite dark Eunice lighted two candles standing on her bureau They were in common glass candlesticks which she had bought at the Ten Cent store she had wanted to have brass but then Stephen and she were going to have brass candlesticks in every room of their house They both loved candle light Eunice smoothed her dark hair Then she washed her hands very carefully Stephen had said once that they were not wonderfully pretty hands but that they had distinction He had kissed them I guess I m all right now said Eunice glancing into the mirror She picked up a photograph of Stephen from the bureau and laid her face against it Then she blew out the candles and went downstairs II Stephen s letter that awaited her when she came home from school the next afternoon was a one page scrawl My head is ringing so with the quinine I ve taken that I can t write to night By to morrow I shall probably be rid of this beastly cold I want to tell you about a book I ve just read It s great stuff He added a postscript Don t ask me dear if I wore my rubbers day before yesterday You know I didn t In Eunice s eyes was a smile of amused tenderness as she put the letter back in its envelope If the cold were beastly perhaps he might remember next time She was afraid though that only married men wore rubbers No letter came the next day or the next If I don t hear to morrow I ll telegraph He s probably busy said her mother I m afraid he s sick Eunice waited for the postman on Saturday morning but he brought her no letter She put on her hat and coat I ll be back in a half hour mother As she went down the steps a boy riding a bicycle stopped at the curb He handed her a telegram It was from Stephen s landlady Stephen had died that morning at two o clock of pneumonia Eunice was conscious of being very collected and calm as she went back into the house quite wonderfully calm Her mother was in the kitchen Eunice went to her and told her very gently She had the feeling that it was her mother s sorrow Her mother s dry hard sobs and bowed figure brought the tears to her eyes She laid her hand on the thin convulsed shoulders Mother don t don t dear it s all right you know She stood by her chair until the sobs ceased

none	none	around to to Stephen s mother I ll not be gone long missus Day followed her to the steps her face was pitifully pinched almost old At the gate Eunice turned and saw her Poor mother She wanted to go back and kiss her but she dared not Stephen s home was on the other side of the town It was a small frame house painted light gray with a gable back and front and a narrow porch running across it This morning the shades in the parlor were drawn down Eunice had to wait some moments before the door was opened by Stephen s young sister a slip of a thing but a capable housekeeper Her eyes were swollen with crying She s so little thought Eunice and took her in her arms When the girl was able to speak she told Eunice that her father had gone to New York and that he would bring Stephen home Eunice stayed an hour comforting talking planning Then she left her I m so quiet I didn t know it could be like this The March wind blew the dust into her face The grit irritated her She wished there were snow on the ground and then wondered that she should care That was how it was the next two days she went on thinking and acting with every now and then this strange awareness of being alive But on Monday afternoon when they came home from the cemetery Eunice went upstairs to her room I m going to lie down a while mother Her mother made no answer as she turned into the kitchen Eunice lay down on the bed A pale yellow sunset gleamed through the branches of the tree outside her window She had seen the yellow streak in the sky as they had left the cemetery She closed her eyes to shut it out Her heart was no longer numb It was waking to its misery She lay very still with clenched hands She had learned to bear physical pain that way She thought perhaps she could bear this if she lay very still I want to tell you about a book I ve just read It s great stuff O Stephen Stephen laddie The tears came and great sobs that shook and twisted her rigid body Once she thought her mother came up the stairs and stopped outside her door She buried her face in the pillow Her mother must not hear By and by she had been quiet for an hour her mother came in with a tray I ve made you some toast and tea Eunice You must keep up your strength Her tone was flat and emotionless She set the tray down by her in the darkness Then she lighted the gas Eunice swallowed the tea obediently she was so very tired As she put the cup down her eyes fell on the cretonne covered box in the window Mother my Glory Box Don t let me see it Oh don t let me see my Glory Box missus Day came up to the bed I ll take it out to morrow while you are at school I meant to do that Her face worked as she left the room When the door closed Eunice sat up and pushed her tumbled hair back from her face She wanted to look at the Glory Box To morrow her mother was going to take it away She clasped her hands tightly about her drawn up knees and stared at the box with hot miserable eyes Of course it would have to be taken away but she wanted to look at it now because it was her Glory Box and because it was Stephen s Stephen had made it That s a decent job for just a lawyer he had said when the last nail was driven in and they were taking a critical survey of it Stephen had laughed when she regretted that the roses in the cretonne were yellow because the things to go into the box very likely would be pink He had laughed and kissed her and told her she had better get a pair of pink specs then the roses would be pink enough And Stephen had taken such an interest in what she had written about the things she was embroidering for household use When she had reported a whole dozen napkins hemmed and initialed he had thought it would be jolly to have nice linen They would probably be short on silver at first but good linen made you feel respectable He remembered his mother taking so much pride in what had been left of hers For a moment the words of that letter were so vividly recalled that she forgot that Stephen was dead For quite a moment she was happy Then she remembered but the realization brought no tears only a swelling wave of misery I can t bear it oh I can t But even as she moaned she knew that she would bear it that she would go on living for years and years and years Other girls she had known or heard about in her own town had gone on living little Sadie Smith whose lover had been killed three days before her wedding and even Milly Petersen who had been engaged for five years when the man asked to be released because he wanted to marry the girl who had recently moved to Milly s street These girls had lived they had grown pale and faded or hard People felt very sorry for them they were spoken of as poor Milly or Sadie Smith poor child but they had lived Eunice saw herself moving among her little circle brave and sad eyed like these girls Suddenly she never remembered just how it came about suddenly her humor flashed a white light over the vision This sad eyed Self seemed something not to pity but to scorn It was grotesque standing in your friend s parlor with clenched hands as it were and compressed lips saying Don t mind me please I m bearing it If one were going to live one must live happily Stephen was such a happy person He was happy when he was working or playing or just loving Even hurdy gurdys made him happy When I hear one grinding away in the morning he had written I have to kick a few Law Journals about just to keep in tune with the darn thing It had been a delightful surprise to her his overflowing happiness for Stephen s face in repose was very grave She herself only occasionally had his joy in mere living but she had always thought that Stephen s joyfulness would prove infectious Suppose now without Stephen she should make the experiment of being happy It would be a wonderful experiment to see she spoke the words aloud deliberately to see if she could kill this terrible thing Sorrow and keep Stephen to love and to remember Eunice was still staring at the Glory Box but it was more than her Glory Box It was part of the problem that she was trying to think out clearly For perhaps sorrow was a problem that you could work out like other problems if only you could see it not as one solid opaque mass but as something made up of pieces that you could deal with one at a time The Glory Box was a piece She had wanted it taken away because it was a thing so filled with pain that she could not bear to have it about If Eunice got up in her excitement and walked up and down the room if the Glory Box could become a box again just a box covered with cretonne and the things in it become things then a great piece of misery would disappear Love a girl s love was like she groped a moment for words like a vine that puts forth little shoots and tendrils love even went into things When Death trampled on the vine the shoots and tendrils were crushed with it But if you cut them off these poor bruised pieces of the vine the vine itself would perhaps have a chance to become strong and beautiful Eunice played with the idea her cheeks flushed her eyes very bright She felt as she did sometimes when talking on paper with Stephen She went over to the Glory Box and raised the cover On top lay the matinee that Mabel had brought on that day not quite a week ago She unfolded it and touched it This isn t Stephen she said aloud quite firmly It s cotton voile and val lace It s cotton voile She took out garment after garment When she came to the pink kimono her eyes blinded with tears It s a lovely shade Pink is pretty with dark hair Her quivering lips could scarcely frame the words It s not Stephen It s it s just a kimono She put the things back and closed the box I ll look at the rest in a day or two I ll keep looking at them Probably I shall never be able to use them but I ll keep looking until I get accustomed to seeing them Mother will get used to seeing the box here If she put it in the storeroom she would always dread going in missus Day was getting breakfast the next morning when Eunice came down She went on mechanically with her preparation avoiding looking at her At the table she glanced up Eunice s face was white and haggard but her eyes strangely big were shining Eunice s mother watched her furtively throughout the meal As they left the table Eunice put her arms about her Don t take the box out mother It s better to get used to it I m trying to get used to things Don t you worry about me You ll see She kissed her and hurried to school In her exalted mood the sympathetic attentions of the other teachers seemed almost surprising They were dear and kind but why should they be so kind She was going to be happy At the end of the day however Eunice let herself softly into the house too wretched to want to meet her mother She carried to her room the letters of condolence that were on the dining room table She read them impassively even the kindly one from Miss Lansing wondering why they did not touch her It s because I m tired she concluded and knelt down by the Glory Box bowing her head on her outstretched arms Stephen dear she prayed I can t look at the things to night I m too tired But the next day she took them all out And on a Saturday afternoon three weeks later she startled her mother by coming into her room dressed in the suit and hat that were her best Her mother laid down the skirt on which she was putting a new braid Why where are you going Eunice I thought I d call on Mabel I ve never been to see her since she started housekeeping I promised to long ago missus Day looked at her keenly her mouth tightening You re foolish to go and see all her wedding presents about the house You won t be able to stand it I shall mother That s why I m going to stand it I shan t mind calling there after I ve been this once I ve thought it out You re a queer girl Eunice I don t understand you But I suppose you know your your own business best she ended taking up her work again Eunice felt quite sure that she did and yet there were days when the experiment seemed a failure or at least only just begun days when she would read in a paper of brilliant social events in New York in Stephen s New York Stephen might have been there at that dinner his eyes which looked so gravely from his picture lighted with the joyfulness of the occasion his splendid head towering above the other men as he joined in the toasts Stephen had told her they always made toasts at these dinners she could hear his laugh his hearty boyish laugh And those other days in early spring when a hurdy gurdy would play Turkey in the Straw and she could see Stephen pitching his Law Journals about exulting in the glorious fact that he was alive Oh how she longed for him wanted him these days with a passionate yearning that for moments maddened her But as the months went by the times of overwhelming wanting came less and less frequently I shall soon be happy Eunice told herself And on a morning of June loveliness a morning of very blue sky white clouds and butter cups Eunice knew that she was happy I m glad to day Stephen I m glad just because it s all so beautiful She wondered now and again why since she herself was so surely leaving the sorrow behind her her mother should still droop under its weight They seldom talked about Stephen They had agreed at the beginning not to do that often but there was bitterness in her mother s face and bitterness on occasion in her words I ve got used to seeing your box around but don t ever ask me to look inside It occurred to Eunice that perhaps it was because to her mother had come only the grief She was not having Stephen to love III One afternoon late in February Eunice was met in the hall by her mother A letter came for you this morning It s from New York She stood watching her as Eunice opened it with unsteady fingers Eunice looked up in a few moments very white It s from Professor Lansing s sister she faltered Miss Lansing is coming on to Chicago this week She says she would like to see me She ll stop off in Dayton over night Saturday probably and will come out for lunch if it s convenient for us to have her She can make connections by doing that Oh mother it s beautiful of her to want to come I don t know that it will do you much good to see her You ll probably get upset No I won t be upset because I ll be so glad Stephen said she was a wonderful woman and we can talk about him He was at her house only a few days before he caught cold Well I don t know said her mother You had better come into the kitchen where it s warm You look like a ghost Eunice I ll give you a cup of soup to drink It s on the stove now She laid nervous compelling fingers on Eunice s arm I suppose missus Day was pouring out the soup as she spoke I suppose that Miss Lansing hasn t any idea of the way we live Even the front stoop looks a sight It s needed a coat of paint for years I know Eunice answered her face clouding I wish things were different for Stephen s sake But we can t help it No said her mother harshly we can t help it But I wish she wasn t coming for a meal The last decent tablecloth was cut up into napkins a month ago I was ashamed of the one we set Mabel Bennet down to the other night Eunice walked to the window She looked out upon the backyard upon the snow that was reflecting the sunset a sentence of one of Stephen s letters in her mind It s the dignity of their living that makes these Washington Square people so worth while And then she recalled that other letter It will be jolly to have nice linen Good linen makes you feel respectable It pained her that they must offer this friend of Stephen s what they had been ashamed to offer Mabel Bennet Stephen s pride would be hurt Stephen who had loved that word dignity and Stephen s pride was her own pride just as much as if she were his wife as if he were living Eunice stood a long time looking out upon the snow until the rose of the sunset had gone from it leaving it blue and cold She turned from the window Mother she was glad that in the darkening kitchen she could not see her mother s face distinctly mother don t you think we had better use that very fine cloth you gave me and the napkins to make the table look nice Hadn t we better use them Use your things out of your Glory Box Eunice Yes they are just pretty things now mother All the pain is out of them I m going to wear the best set you made me I think if I have on those nice clothes under my dress I won t be so shy with Miss Lansing I want O mother I want Stephen to to feel proud of me missus Day bent to rake the fire then straightened up If you can stand wearing that set I ve nothing to say You have a right to your own notions But I don t see how I can bear to look at the cloth After it s been done up and on the table once you ll forget there was anything sad connected with it I know you will said Eunice with her brave pleading eyes fixed on her mother s set face I don t know maybe I could forget But I don t see how I could bring myself to use something out of your own Glory Box It seems almost indelicate They re all your things Eunice crossed the room and laid her face down on her mother s shoulder You gave me the things mother and you ve had so little of what you ve always wanted Can t it be our Glory Box for us both to use on special occasions like this Her arms tightened about her mother s neck Can t we use them this time for Stephen s sake After a moment s silence missus Day pushed her gently away If they are to be washed you ll have to bring them down to morrow I ll want to get them on the line while this good weather lasts Saturday is only four days off Saturday evening Eunice lighted the candles on her bureau lighting the candles seemed like another ceremony of this perfect day She had got up early so as to put her room and the rest of the house in order While her mother was finishing in the kitchen she had set the table It had been a joy to do that to spread the cloth so that the creases would come in just the right place and the large initial D show without being too conspicuous and to fold the napkins prettily and arrange the dishes At the last moment she had decided that it would not be too extravagant to buy a little plant of some sort for a centrepiece So there was just time for her to slip into the clothes that had been spread out on the bed and do over her hair before Miss Lansing arrived Stephen had said You will like her Eunice Like her she was the most wonderful woman she had ever met She was elderly but strangely enough you did not wonder whether she had been pretty or beautiful when she was young She was wonderful just as she was now You could not think of her as being different She was tall a little taller than Eunice herself Her face was finely cut the sort of face you saw in engravings of old portraits there were not many lines in it Her eyes were dark and young too though she had quite gray hair and evidently didn t care to be in the fashion for her black silk fell all around in ample lengths Eunice had watched her hands They were not small but long and slender and very white the two rings she wore seemed made for them And Eunice had not felt shy At first she had thought she was going to Miss Lansing had seemed at first so like a personage but the thought of Stephen and of the featherstitched best set she was wearing made her forget that Washington Square was as Stephen had said rather terrifying on the outside It was Stephen s friend whom they were entertaining and Stephen s friend was not a personage really but a wonderful woman who had loved Stephen too After lunch they talked together in the parlor while her mother was clearing things away Miss Lansing said that she had seen a great deal of Stephen that last year He had seemed to enjoy coming to the house He had come to dinner sometimes but more often he had dropped in on Saturday or Sunday afternoons for tea One afternoon he had not been quite himself She had questioned him a little and he had confessed with a laugh that he was homesick for Ohio That was the time he talked for two hours about you my dear Miss Lansing said smiling Fortunately no one else came in so he was uninterrupted I liked to listen to his talk he had charm But Eunice saw her eyes kindle He was more than charming He was great Yes Eunice answered very low He would have been a great man Miss Lansing I always knew he would At that Miss Lansing put out both hands and covered Eunice s that were clasped tightly in her lap He would have been a great man she repeated and you my dear would have made him a great wife Eunice felt that never unless she should hear Stephen s voice again should she listen to such wonderful words as those Ever since Miss Lansing had gone they had sung themselves in her heart like a sacred refrain She was glad that it was night now so that she could fall asleep repeating them Getting ready for bed Eunice I m beginning to Eunice opened the door to her mother who stood outside winding the clock Do you know said missus Day as she set the alarm I ve been thinking again what a good idea it was to open that can of peas They did make the chops look so tasty and they were almost as tender as the French I helped Miss Lansing twice Eunice kissed her as she turned away It was a nice dinner throughout mother and the table looked lovely Well I saw Miss Lansing look at the cloth She was too much of a lady to say anything of course but I could tell she noticed it Yes said Eunice I think she did missus Day was closing her door Put out the light in the hall before you go to bed Eunice Yes mother said Eunice softly closing her own door She stood still a moment in the centre of the candle lighted room Then she went over to the Glory Box and took out the kimono and laid it over the footboard so that the pink folds could catch the light When she had undressed she put it on It will be a beautiful ending to the day she said as she stood before the mirror braiding her hair Her eyes rested on Stephen s picture I think you would have been proud to day dear and I think you would have liked this She turned to the mirror and looked at the girl reflected there at the dark eyes and hair and at the kimono draping her soft white gown Dawn and apple blossoms she whispered and then stretched out her arms Stephen my dear O Stephen THE SPIRIT OF THE HERD seven BY DALLAS LORE SHARP I We were trailing the riders of P Ranch across the plains to a hollow in the hills called the Troughs where they were to round up a lot of cattle for a branding On the way we fell in behind a bunch of some fifty cows and yearlings which one of the riders had picked up and while he dashed off across the desert for a stray we tenderfeet drove on the herd It was hot and the cattle lagged so we urged them on All at once I noticed that the whole herd was moving with a swinging warping gait with switching tails and heads thrown round from side to side as if every steer were watching us We were not near enough to see their eyes but the rider far across the desert saw the movement and came cutting through the sage shouting and waving his arms to stop us We had pushed the driving too hard Mutiny was spreading among the cattle already manifest in a sullen ugly temper that would have brought the herd charging us in another minute had not the cowboy galloped in between us just as he did so untamed unafraid and instinctively savage is the spirit of the herd It is this herd spirit that the cowboy on his long cross desert drives to the railroad most fears The herd is like a crowd easily led easily excited easily stampeded when it becomes a mob of frenzied beasts past all control the spirit of the city gang at riot in the plains If one would know how thin is the coat of domestication worn by the tamest of animals let him ride with the cattle across the rim rock country of southeastern Oregon No better chance to study the spirit of the herd could possibly be had And in contrast to the cattle how intelligent controlled almost human seems the plainsman s horse I share all the tenderfoot s admiration for the cowboy and his pony Both of them are necessary in bringing four thousand cattle through from P Ranch to Winnemucca and of both is required a degree of daring and endurance as well as a knowledge of the wild animal mind which lifts their hard work into the heroic and makes of every drive a sage brush epic so wonderful is the working together of man and horse a kind of centaur of the plains From P Ranch to Winnemucca is a seventeen day drive through a desert of rim rock and greasewood and sage which under the most favorable conditions is beset with difficulty but which in the dry season and with anything like four thousand cattle becomes an unbroken hazard More than all else on such a drive is feared the wild herd spirit the quick black temper which by one sign or another ever threatens to break the spell of the riders power and sweep the maddened or terrorized herd to destruction The handling of the herd to keep this spirit sleeping is ofttimes a thrilling experience II Some time before my visit to P Ranch in the summer of nineteen twelve the riders had taken out a herd of four thousand steers on what proved to be one of the most difficult drives ever made to Winnemucca For the first two days on the trail the cattle were strange to each other having been gathered from widely separated grazing grounds from Double O and the Home Ranch and were somewhat clannish and restive under the driving At the beginning of the third day signs of real trouble appeared A shortage of water and the hot weather together began to tell on the temper of the herd The third day was long and exceedingly hot The line started forward at dawn and all day kept moving with the sun cooking the bitter smell of the sage into the air and with sixteen thousand hoofs kicking up a still bitterer smother of alkali dust which inflamed eyes and nostrils and coated the very lungs of the cattle The fierce desert thirst was upon the herd long before it reached the creek where it was to bed for the night The

none	none	and the dust had made slow work of the driving and it was already late when they reached the creek only to find it dry This was bad The men were tired but the cattle were thirsty and Wade the boss of the buckaroos pushed the herd on toward the next rim rock hoping to get down to the plain below before the end of the slow desert twilight Anything for the night but a dry camp They had hardly started on when a whole flank of the herd suddenly breaking away as if by prearrangement tore off through the brush The horses were as tired as the men and before the chase was over the twilight was gray in the sage making it necessary to halt at once and camp where they were They would have to go without water The runaways were brought up and the herd closed in till it formed a circle nearly a mile around This was as close as it could be drawn for the cattle would not bed lie down They wanted water more than they wanted rest Their eyes were red their tongues raspy with thirst The situation was a difficult one But camp was made Two of the riders were sent back along the trail to bring up the drags while Wade with his other men circled the uneasy cattle closing them in quieting them and doing everything possible to make them bed They were thirsty and instead of bedding the herd began to growl a distant mutter of throats low rumbling ominous as when faint thunder rolls behind the hills Every plainsman fears the growl for it too often is a prelude to the milling as it proved to be now when the whole vast herd began to stir slowly singly at first and without direction till at length it moved together round and round a great compact circle the multitude of clicking hoofs of clashing horns and chafing sides like the sound of rushing rain across a field of corn Nothing could be worse for the cattle The cooler twilight was falling but mingling with it rose and thickened and spread a choking dust from their feet which soon covered them and shut from sight all but the wall of the herd Slowly evenly swung the wall round and round without a break Only one who has watched a milling herd can know its suppressed excitement To keep that excitement in check was the problem of Wade and his men And the night had not yet begun When the riders had brought in the drags and the chuckwagon had lumbered up with supper Wade set the first watch Along with the wagon had come the fresh horses among them Peroxide Jim a supple powerful clean limbed buckskin that had I think as fine and intelligent an animal face as any creature I ever saw And why should he not have been saved fresh for just such a need as this Are there not superior horses as well as superior men a Peroxide Jim to complement a Wade The horse plainly understood the situation Wade told me and though there was nothing like sentiment for horse flesh about the boss of the P Ranch riders his faith in Peroxide Jim was absolute The other night horses were saddled and tied to the wheels of the wagon It was Wade s custom to take his turn with the second watch but shifting his saddle to Peroxide Jim he rode out with the four of the first watch who evenly spaced were quietly circling the herd The night for this part of the high desert was unusually warm It was close still and without a sky The near thick darkness blotted out the stars There is usually a breeze at night over these highest rim rock plains which no matter how hot the day may have been crowds the cattle together for warmth To night not a breath stirred the sage as Wade wound in and out among the bushes the hot dust stinging his eyes and caking rough on his skin Round and round moved the weaving shifting forms out of the dark and into the dark a gray spectral line like a procession of ghosts or some morris dance of the desert s sheeted dead But it was not a line it was a sea of forms not a procession but the even surging of a maelstrom of hoofs a mile around Wade galloped out on the plain for a breath of air and a look at the sky A quick cold rain would quiet them but there was not a feel of rain in the darkness no smell of it on the air Only the powdery taste of the bitter sage The desert where the herd was camped was one of the highest of a series of table lands or benches it lay as level as a floor rimmed by a sheer wall of rock from which there was a drop to the bench of sage below The herd had been headed for a pass and was now halted within a mile of the rim rock on the east where there was a perpendicular fall of about three hundred feet It was the last place an experienced plainsman would have chosen for a camp and every time Wade circled the herd and came in between the cattle and the rim he felt the nearness of the precipice The darkness helped to bring it near The height of his horse brought it near he seemed to look down from his saddle over it into its dark depths The herd in its milling was surely warping slowly in the direction of the rim But this was all fancy the trick of the dark and of nerves if a plainsman has nerves At twelve o clock the first guard came in and woke the second watch Wade had been in the saddle since dawn but this was his regular watch More than that his trained ear had timed the milling hoofs The movement of the herd had quickened If now he could keep them going and could prevent their taking any sudden fright They must not stop until they stopped from utter weariness Safety lay in their continued motion So the fresh riders flanked them closely paced them and urged them quietly on They must be kept milling and they must be kept from fright In the taut silence of the stirless desert night with the tension of the herd at the snapping point any quick unwonted sight or sound would stampede them the sneezing of a horse the flare of a match would be enough to send the whole four thousand headlong blind frenzied trampling till spent and scattered over the plain And so as he rode Wade began to sing The rider ahead of him took up the air and passed it on until above the stepping stir of the hoofs rose the faint voices of the men and all the herd was bound about by the slow plaintive measures of some old song It was not to soothe their savage breasts that the riders sang to the cattle but to prevent the shock of their hearing any loud and sudden noise So they sang and rode and the night wore on to one o clock when Wade coming up on the rim rock side felt a cool breeze fan his face and caught a breath of fresh moist wind with the taste of water in it He checked his horse instantly listening as the wind swept past him over the cattle But they must already have smelled it for they had ceased their milling The whole herd stood motionless the indistinct forms close to him in the dark showing their bald faces lifted to drink the sweet wet breath that came over the rim Then they started again but faster and with a rumbling from their hoarse throats that tightened Wade s grip on the reins The sound seemed to come out of the earth a low rumbling mumble as dark as the night and as wide as the plain a thick inarticulate bellow that stood every rider stiff in his stirrups The breeze caught the dust and carried it back from the gray coated ghostly shapes and Wade saw that the animals were still moving in a circle If he could keep them going He touched his horse to ride on with them when across the black sky flashed a vivid streak of lightning There was a snort from the steers a quick clap of horns and hoofs from far within the herd a tremor of the plain a roar a surging mass and Wade was riding the flank of a wild stampede Before him behind him beside him pressing hard upon his horse galloped the frenzied steers and beyond them a multitude borne on and bearing him on by the heave of the galloping herd Wade was riding for his life He knew it His horse knew it He was riding to turn the herd too back from the rim as the horse also knew The cattle were after water water mad ready to go over the precipice to get it carrying horse and rider with them Wade was the only rider between the herd and the rim It was black as death He could see nothing in the sage could scarcely discern the pounding panting shadows at his side but he knew by the swish of the brush and the plunging of the horse that the ground was growing stonier that they were nearing the rocks To outrun the stampede was his only chance If he could come up with the leaders he might yet head them off upon the plain and save the herd There were cattle still ahead of him how many what part of the herd he could not tell But the horse knew The reins hung on his straight neck while Wade yelling and firing into the air gave him the race to win to lose Suddenly they veered and went high in the air as a steer plunged headlong into a draw almost beneath their feet They cleared the narrow ravine landed on bare rock and reeled on They were riding the rim Close to their left bore down the flank of the herd and on their right under their very feet was a precipice so close that they felt its blackness its three hundred feet of fall A piercing half human bawl of terror told where a steer had been crowded over Would the next leap carry them after him Then Wade found himself racing neck and neck with a big white steer which the horse with marvelous instinct seemed to pick from a bunch and to cling to forcing him gradually ahead till cutting him free from the bunch entirely he bore him off into the sage The group coming on behind followed its leader and in after them swung others The tide was turning Within a short time the whole herd had veered and bearing off from the cliffs was pounding over the open plains Whose race was it Peroxide Jim s according to Wade for not by word or by touch of hand or knee had he been directed in the run From the flash of the lightning the horse had taken the bit and covered an indescribably perilous path at top speed had outrun the herd and turned it from the edge of the rim rock without a false step or a tremor Bred on the desert broken at the round up trained to think steer as his rider thinks it the horse knew as swiftly as clearly as his rider the work before him But that he kept himself from fright that none of the wild herd madness passed into him is a thing for wonder He was as thirsty as any animal of the herd he knew his own peril I believe as none of the herd had ever known anything and yet such coolness courage wisdom and power Was it training Was it more intimate association with the man on his back and so a further remove from the wild thing which domestication does not seem to touch Or was it all suggestion the superior intelligence above riding not the flesh but the spirit IN THE PASHA S GARDEN A STAMBOUL NIGHT S ENTERTAINMENT BY H G DWIGHT I As the caique glided up to the garden gate the three boatmen rose from their sheepskins and caught hold of iron clamps set into the marble of the quay Shaban the grizzled gatekeeper who was standing at the top of the water steps with his hands folded respectfully in front of him came salaaming down to help his master out Shall we wait my Pasha asked the head kaikji The Pasha turned to Shaban as if to put a question And as if to answer it Shaban said The madama is up in the wood in the kiosque She sent down word to ask if you would go up too Then don t wait Returning the boatmen s salaam the Pasha stepped into his garden Is there company in the kiosque or is madama alone he inquired I think no one is there except Zuembuel Agha replied Shaban following his master up the long central path of black and white pebbles Zuembuel Agha exclaimed the Pasha But if it had been in his mind to say anything else he stopped instead to sniff at a rosebud And then he asked Are we dining up there do you know I don t know my Pasha but I will find out Tell them to send up dinner anyway Shaban It is such an evening And just ask Mustafa to bring me a coffee at the fountain will you I will rest a little before climbing that hill On my head said the Albanian turning off to the house The Pasha kept on to the end of the walk Two big horse chestnut trees their candles just starting alight in the April air stood there at the foot of a terrace guarding a fountain that dripped in the ivied wall A thread of water started mysteriously out of the top of a tall marble niche into a little marble basin from which it overflowed by two flat bronze spouts into two smaller basins below From them the water dripped back into a single basin still lower down and so tinkled its broken way past graceful arabesques and reliefs of fruit and flowers into a crescent shaped pool at the foot of the niche The Pasha sank down into one of the wicker chairs scattered hospitably beneath the horse chestnut trees and thought how happy a man he was to have a fountain of the period of Sultan Ahmed III and a garden so full of April freshness and a view of the bright Bosphorus and the opposite hills of Europe and the firing West How definitely he thought it I cannot say for the Pasha was not greatly given to thought Why should he be as he possessed without that trouble a goodly share of what men acquire by taking thought If he had been lapped in ease and security all his days they numbered many more did those days than the Pasha would have chosen Still they had touched him but lightly merely increasing the dignity of his handsome presence and taking away nothing of his power to enjoy his little walled world So he sat there breathing in the air of the place and the hour while gardeners came and went with their watering pots and birds twittered among the branches and the fountain plashed beside him until Shaban reappeared carrying a glass of water and a cup of coffee in a swinging tray Eh Shaban It is not your business to carry coffee protested the Pasha reaching for a stand that stood near him What is your business is my business my Pasha Have I not eaten your bread and your father s for thirty years No Is it as long as that We are getting old Shaban We are getting old assented the Albanian simply The Pasha thought as he took out his silver cigarette case of another pasha who had complimented him that afternoon on his youthfulness And choosing a cigarette he handed the case to his gatekeeper Shaban accepted the cigarette and produced matches from his gay girdle How long is it since you have been to your country Shaban The Pasha lifting his little cup by its silver zarf realized that he would not sip his coffee quite so noisily had his French wife been sitting with him under the horse chestnuts But with his old Shaban he could still be a Turk Eighteen months my Pasha And when are you going again It is not apparent Perhaps in Ramazan if God wills Or perhaps next Ramazan We shall see Allah Allah How many times have I told you to bring your people here Shaban We have plenty of room to build you a house somewhere and you could see your wife and children every day instead of once in two or three years Wives wives a man will not die if he does not see them every day Besides it would not be good for the children In Constantinople they become rascals There are too many Christians And he added hastily It is better for a boy to grow up in the mountains But we have a mountain here behind the house laughed the Pasha Your mountain is not like our mountains objected Shaban gravely hunting in his mind for the difference he felt but could not express And that new wife of yours went on the Pasha Is it good to leave a young woman like that Are you not afraid No my Pasha I am not afraid We all live together you know My brothers watch and the other women She is safer than yours Besides in my country it is not as it is here I don t know why I have never been to see this wonderful country of yours Shaban I have so long intended to and I never have been But I must climb my mountain or they will think that I have become a rascal too And rising from his chair he gave the Albanian a friendly pat Shall I come too my Pasha Zuembuel Agha sent word Zuembuel Agha interrupted the Pasha irritably No you needn t come I will explain to Zuembuel Agha With which he left Shaban to pick up the empty coffee cup II From the upper terrace a bridge led across the public road to the wood If it was not a wood it was at all events a good sized grove climbing the steep hillside very much as it chose Every sort and size of tree was there but the greater number of them were of a kind to be sparsely trimmed in April with a delicate green and among them were so many twisted Judas trees as to tinge whole patches of the slope with their deep rose bloom The road which the Pasha slowly climbed swinging his amber beads behind him as he walked zigzagged so leisurely back and forth among the trees that a carriage could have driven up it In that way indeed the Pasha had more than once mounted to the kiosque in the days when his mother used to spend a good part of her summer up there and when he was married to his first wife The memory of the two and of their old fashioned ways entered not too bitterly into his general feeling of well being ministered to by the budding trees and the spring air and the sunset view Every now and then an enormous plane tree invited him to stop and look at it or a semi circle of cypresses So at last he came to the top of the hill where in a grassy clearing a small house looked down on the valley of the Bosphorus through a row of great stone pines The door of the kiosque was open but his wife was not visible The Pasha stopped a moment as he had done a thousand times before and looked back He was not the man to be insensible to what he saw between the columnar trunks of the pines where European hills traced a dark curve against the fading sky and where the sinuous waterway far below still reflected a last glamour of the day The beauty of it and the sharp sweetness of the April air and the infinitesimal sounds of the wood and the half conscious memories involved with it all made him sigh He turned and mounted the steps of the porch The kiosque looked very dark and unfamiliar as the Pasha entered it He wondered what had become of Helene if by any chance he had passed her on the way He wanted her She was the expression of what the evening roused in him He heard nothing however but the splash of water from a half invisible fountain It reminded him for an instant of the other fountain below and of Shaban His steps resounded hollowly on the marble pavement as he walked into the dim old saloon shaped like a T with the cross longer than the leg It was still light enough for him to make out the glimmer of windows on three sides and the square of the fountain in the centre but the painted domes above were lost in shadow The spaces on either side of the bay by which he entered completing the rectangle of the kiosque were filled by two little rooms opening into the cross of the T He went into the left hand one where Helene usually sat because there were no lattices The room was empty The place seemed so strange and still in the twilight that a sort of apprehension began to grow in him and he half wished he had brought up Shaban He turned back to the second the latticed room the harem as they called it Curiously enough it was Helene who would never let him Europeanize it in spite of the lattices Every now and then he discovered that she liked some Turkish things better than he did As soon as he opened the door he saw her sitting on the divan opposite He knew her profile against the checkered pallor of the lattice But she neither moved nor greeted him It was Zuembuel Agha who did so startling him by suddenly rising beside the door and saying in his high voice Pleasant be your coming my Pasha The Pasha had forgotten about Zuembuel Agha and it seemed strange to him that Helene continued to sit silent and motionless on her sofa Good evening he said at last You are sitting very quietly here in the dark Are there no lights in this place It was again Zuembuel Agha who spoke turning one question by another Did Shaban come with you No replied the Pasha shortly He said he had had a message but I told him not to come A ah ejaculated the eunuch in his high drawl But it does not matter with the two of us The Pasha grew more and more puzzled for this was not the scene he had imagined to himself as he came up through the park in response to his wife s message Nor did he grow less puzzled when the eunuch turned to her and said in another tone Now will you give me that key The Frenchwoman took no more notice of this question than she had of the Pasha s entrance What do you mean Zuembuel Agha demanded the Pasha sharply That is not the way to speak to your mistress I mean this my Pasha retorted the eunuch that some one is hiding in this chest and that madama keeps the key That was what the Pasha heard in the absurd treble of the black man in the darkening room He looked down and made out beside the tall figure of the eunuch the chest on which he had been sitting Then he looked across at Helene who still sat silent in front of the lattice What are you talking about he asked at last more stupefied than anything else Who is it A thief Has any one He left the vague question unformulated even in his mind Ah that I don t know You must ask madama Probably it is one of her Christian friends But at least if it were a woman she would not be so unwilling to unlock her chest for us The silence that followed while the Pasha looked dumbly at the chest and at Zuembuel Agha and at his wife was filled for him with a stranger confusion of feelings than he had ever experienced before Nevertheless he was surprisingly cool he found His pulse quickened very little He told himself that it wasn t true and that he really must get rid of old Zuembuel after all if he went on making such preposterous gaffes and setting them all by the ears How could anything so baroque happen to him the Pasha who owed what he was to the honorable fathers and who had passed his life honorably and peaceably until this moment Yet he had had an impression walking into the dark old kiosque and finding nobody until he found these two sitting here in this extraordinary way as if he had walked out of his familiar garden which he knew like his hand into a country he knew nothing about where anything might be true And he wished he almost passionately wished that Helene would say something would cry out against Zuembuel Agha would lie even rather than sit there so still and removed and different from other women Then he began to be aware that if it were true if he ought to do something He ought to make a noise He ought to kill somebody That was what they always did That was what his father would have done or certainly his grandfather But he also told himself that it was no longer possible for him to do what his father and grandfather had done He had been unlearning their ways too long Besides he was too old A sudden sting pierced him at the thought of how old he was and how young Helene Even if he lived to be seventy or eighty she would still have a life left when he died Yes it was as Shaban said They were getting old He had never really felt the humiliation of it before And Shaban had said strangely something else that his own wife was safer than the Pasha s Still he felt an odd compassion for Helene too because she was young and it was Judas tree time and she was married to gray hairs And although he was a pasha descended from great pashas and she was only a little French girl quelconque he felt more afraid than ever of making a fool of himself before her when he had promised her that she should be as free as any other European woman that she should live her life Besides what had the black man to do with their private affairs Zuembuel Agha he suddenly heard himself harshly saying is this your house or mine I have told you a hundred times that you are not to trouble the madama or follow her about or so much as guess where she is and what she is doing I have kept you in the house because my father brought you into it but if I ever hear of your speaking to madama again or spying on her I will send you into the street Do you hear Now get out Aman my Pasha I beg you entreated the eunuch There was something ludicrous in his voice coming as it did from his height The Pasha wondered if he had been too long a person of importance in the family to realize the change in his position or whether he really All of a sudden a checkering of lamplight flickered through the dark window touched the negro s black face for a moment traveled up the wall Silence fell again in the little room a silence into which the fountain dropped its silver patter Then steps mounted the porch and echoed in the other room which lighted in turn and a man came in sight peering this way and that with a big white accordeon lantern in his hand Behind the man two other servants appeared carrying on their heads round wooden trays covered by figured silks and a boy tugging a huge basket When they discovered the three in the little room they salaamed respectfully Where shall we set the table asked the man with the lantern For the Pasha the lantern seemed to make the world more like the place he had always known He turned to his wife apologetically I told them to send dinner up here It has been such a long time since we came But I forgot about the table I don t believe there is one here No uttered Helene from her sofa sitting with her head on her hand It was the first word she had spoken But little as it was it reassured him like the lantern There is the chest hazarded Zuembuel Agha The interruption of the servants had for the moment distracted them all But the Pasha now turned on him so vehemently that the eunuch salaamed in haste and went away III Why not asked Helene when he was gone We can sit on cushions Why not echoed the Pasha Grateful as he was for the interruption he found himself wishing secretly that Helene had discouraged his idea of a picnic dinner And he could not help feeling a certain constraint as he gave the necessary orders and watched the servants put down their paraphernalia and pull the chest into the middle of the room There was something unreal and stage like about the scene in the uncertain light of the lantern Obviously the chest was not light It was an old cypress wood chest that they had always used in the summer to keep furs in polished a bright brown with a little inlaid pattern of dark brown and cream color running around the edge of each surface and a more complicated design ornamenting the centre of the cover He vaguely associated his mother with it He felt a distinct relief when the men spread the cloth He felt as if they had covered up more things than he could name And when they produced candlesticks and candles and set them on the improvised table and in the niches beside the door he seemed to come back again into the comfortable light of common sense This is the way we used to do when I was a boy he said with a smile when he and Helene established themselves on sofa cushions on opposite sides of the chest Only then we had little tables six inches high instead of big ones like this It is rather a pity that we have spoiled all that she said Are we any happier for perching on chairs around great scaffoldings and piling the scaffoldings with so many kinds of porcelain and metal After all they knew how to live the people who were capable of imagining a place like this And they had the good taste not to fill a room with things Your grandfather was it He had had a dread that she would not say anything that she would remain silent and impenetrable as she had been before Zuembuel Agha as if the chest between them were a barrier that nothing could surmount His heart lightened when he heard her speak Was it not quite her natural voice It was my great grandfather the Grand Vizier They say he did know how to live in his way He built the kiosque for a beautiful slave of his a Greek whom he called Pomegranate Madame Pomegranate What a charming name And that is why her cipher is everywhere See She pointed to the series of cupboards and niches on either side of the door dimly painted with pomegranate blossoms and to the plaster reliefs around the hooded fireplace and the cluster of pomegranates that made a centre to the gilt and painted lattice work of the ceiling One could be very happy in such a little house It has an air of being meant for moments And you feel as if they had something to do with the wonderful way it has faded She looked as if she had meant to say something else which she did not But after a moment she added Will you ask them to turn off the water in the fountain It is a little chilly now that the sun has gone and it sounds like rain or tears The dinner went on the whole not so badly There were dishes to be passed back and forth There were questions to be asked or comments to be made There were the servants to be spoken to Yet more and more the Pasha could not help wondering When a silence fell too he could not help listening And least of all could he help looking at Helene He looked at her trying not to look at her with an intense curiosity as if he had never seen her before asking himself if there were anything new in her face and how she would look if Would she be like this She made no attempt to keep up a flow of words as if to distract his attention She was not soft either she was not trying to seduce him And she made no show of gratitude toward him for having sent Zuembuel Agha away Neither did she by so much as an inflection try to insinuate or excuse or explain She was what she always was perfect and evidently a little tired She was indeed more than perfect she was prodigious when he asked her once what she was thinking about and she said Pandora tapping the chest between them He had never heard the story of that Greek girl and her box and she told him gravely about all the calamities that came out of it and the one gift of hope that remained behind But I cannot be a Turkish woman long she added inconsequently with a smile My legs are asleep I really must walk about a little When he had helped her to her feet she led the way into the other room They had their coffee and cigarettes there Helene walked slowly up and down the length of the room stopping every now and then to look into the square pool of the fountain and to pat her hair The Pasha sat down on the long low divan that ran under the windows He could watch her more easily now And the detachment with which he had begun to look at her grew in spite of him into the feeling that he was looking at a stranger After all what did he know about her Who was she What had happened to her during all the years that he had not known her in that strange free European life which he had tried to imitate and which at heart he secretly distrusted What had she ever really told him and what had he ever really divined of her For perhaps the first time in his life he realized how little one person may know of another particularly a man of a woman And he remembered Shaban again and that phrase about his wife being safer than Helene Had Shaban really meant anything Was Helene safe He acknowledged to himself at last that the question was there in his mind waiting to be answered Helene did not help him She had been standing for some time at an odd angle to the pool looking into it He could see her face there with the eyes turned away from him How mysterious a reflection is she said It is so real that you can t believe it disappears for good How often Madame Pomegranate must have looked into this pool and yet I can t find her in it But I feel she is really there all the same and who knows who else They say mirrors do not flatter the Pasha did not keep himself from rejoining but they are very discreet They tell no tales Helene raised her eyes In the little room the servants had cleared the improvised table and had packed up everything again except the candles I have been up here a long time she said and I am rather tired It is a little cold too If you do not mind I think I will go down to the house now with the servants You will hardly care to go so soon for Zuembuel Agha has not finished what he has to say to you Zuembuel Agha exclaimed the Pasha I sent him away Ah but you must know him well enough to be sure he would not go Let us see She clapped her hands The servant of the lantern immediately came out to her Will you ask Zuembuel Agha to come here she said He is on the porch The man went to the door looked out and said a word Then he stood aside with a respectful salaam and the eunuch entered He negligently returned the salute and walked forward until his air of importance changed to one of humility at sight of the Pasha Salaaming in turn he stood with his hands folded in front of him I will go down with you said the Pasha to his wife rising It is too late for you to go through the woods in the dark Nonsense She gave him a look that had more in it than the tone in which she added Please do not I shall be perfectly safe with four servants You can tell them not to let me run away Coming nearer she put her hand into the bosom of her dress then stretched out the hand toward him Here is the key the key of Pandora s box Will you keep it for me please Au revoir And making a sign to the servants she walked out of the kiosque IV The Pasha was too surprised at first to move and too conscious of the eyes of servants too uncertain of what he should do too fearful of doing the wrong the un European thing And afterwards it was too late He stood watching until the flicker of the lantern disappeared among the dark trees Then his eyes met the eunuch s Why don t you go down too suggested Zuembuel Agha The variable climate of a great house had made him too perfect an opportunist not to take the line of being in favor again It might be better Give me the key and I will do what there is to do But you might send up Shaban Why not the Pasha secretly asked himself Might it not be the best way out At the same time he experienced a certain revulsion of feeling now that Helene was gone in the way she had gone She really was prodigious And with the vanishing of the lantern which had brought him a measure of reassurance he felt the weight of an uncleared situation fantastic but crucial heavy upon him And the Negro annoyed him intensely Thank you Zuembuel Agha he replied but I am not the nurse of madama and I will not give you the key If he only might though he thought to himself again You believe her this Frank woman whom you had never seen five years ago and you do not believe me who have lived in your house longer than you can remember The eunuch said it so bitterly that the Pasha was touched in spite of himself He had never been one to think very much about minor personal relations but even at such a moment he could see was it partly because he wanted more time to make up his mind that he had never liked Zuembuel Agha as he liked Shaban for instance Yet more honor had been due in the old family tradition to the former And he had been associated even longer with the history of the house My poor Zuembuel he uttered musingly you have never forgiven me for marrying her My Pasha you are not the first to marry an unbeliever nor the last But such a marriage should be to the glory of Islam and not to its discredit Who can trust her She is still a Christian And she is too young She has turned the world upside down What would your father have said to a daughter in law who goes shamelessly into the street without a veil alone and who receives in your house men who are no relation to you or her It is not right Women only understand one thing to make fools of men And they are never content to fool one The Pasha still waiting to make up his mind let his fancy linger about Zuembuel Agha It was really rather absurd after all what a part women played in the world and how little it all came to in the end Did the black man he wondered walk in a clearer cooler world free of the clouds the iridescences the languors the perfumes the strange obsessions that made others walk so often like madmen Or might some tatter of preposterous humanity still work obscurely in him Or a bitterness of not being like other men That perhaps was why the Pasha felt friendlier toward Shaban They were more alike You are right Zuembuel Agha he said the world is upside down But neither the madama nor any of us made it so All we can do is try and keep our heads as it turns Now will you please tell me how you happened to be up here The madama never told you to come You know perfectly well that the customs of Europe are different from ours and that she does not like to have you follow her about What woman likes to be followed about retorted the eunuch with a sly smile I know you have told me to leave her alone But why was I brought into this house Am I to stand by and watch dishonor brought upon it simply because you have eaten the poison of a woman Zuembuel Agha replied the Pasha sharply I am not discussing old and new or this and that but I am asking you to tell me what all this speech is about Give me that key and I will show you what it is about said the eunuch stepping forward But the Pasha found that he was not ready to go so directly to the point Can t you answer a simple question he demanded irritably retreating to the farther side of the fountain The reflection of the painted ceiling in the pool made him think of Helene and Madame Pomegranate He stared into the still water as if to find Helene s face there Was any other face hidden beside it mocking him But Zuembuel Agha had begun again doggedly I came here because it is my business to be here I went to town this morning When I got back they told me that you were away and that the madama was up here alone So I came Is this a place for a woman to be alone in a young woman with men working all about and I don t know who and a thousand ways of getting in and out from the hills and ten thousand hiding places in the woods The Pasha made a gesture of impatience and turned away But after all what could one do with old Zuembuel He had been brought up in his tradition The Pasha lighted another cigarette to help himself think Well I came up here continued the eunuch and as I came I heard madama singing You know how she sings the songs of the Franks The Pasha knew But he did not say anything As he walked up and down smoking and thinking his eye caught in the pool a reflection from the other side of the room where the door of the latticed room was and where the cypress wood chest stood as the servants had left it in the middle of the floor Was that what Helene had stood looking at so long he asked himself He wondered that he could have sat beside it so quietly It seemed now like something dark and dangerous crouching there in the shadow of the little room I sat down under the terrace he heard the eunuch go on where no one could see me and I listened And after she had stopped I heard Never mind what you heard broke in the Pasha I have heard enough He was ashamed ashamed and resolved He felt as if he had been playing the spy with Zuembuel Agha And after all there was a simple way to answer his question for himself He threw away his cigarette went into the little room bent over the chest and fitted the key into the lock Just then a nightingale burst out singing but so near and so loud that he started and looked over his shoulder In an instant he collected himself feeling the black man s eyes upon his Yet he could not suppress the train of association started by the impassioned trilling of the bird even as he began to turn the key of the chest where his mother used to keep her quaint old furs and embroideries The irony of the contrast paralyzed his hand for a strange moment and of the difference between this spring night and other spring nights when nightingales had sung And what if after all only calamity were to come out of the chest and he were to lose his last gift of hope Ah He knew at last what he would do He quickly withdrew the key from the lock stood up straight again and looked at Zuembuel Agha Go down and get Shaban he ordered and don t come back The eunuch stared But if he had anything to say he concluded not to say it He saluted silently and went away V The Pasha sat down on the divan and lighted a cigarette Almost immediately the nightingale stopped singing For a few moments Zuembuel Agha s steps could be heard outside Then it became very still The Pasha did not like it Look which way he would he could not help seeing the chest or listening He got up and went into the big room where he turned on the water of the fountain The falling drops made company for him and kept him from looking for lost reflections But they presently made him think of what Helene had said about them He went out to the porch and sat down on the steps In front of him the pines lifted their great dark canopies against the stars Other stars twinkled between the trunks far below where the shore lights of the Bosphorus were It was so still that water sounds came faintly up to him and every now and then he could even hear nightingales on the European side Another nightingale began singing in his own woods the same one that had told him what to do he said to himself What other things the nightingales had sung to him years ago And how long the pines had listened there still strong and green and rugged and alive while he and how many before him sat under them for a little while and then went away Presently he heard steps on the drive and Shaban came carrying something dark in his hand What is that asked the Pasha as Shaban held it out A revolver my Pasha Zuembuel Agha told me you wanted it The Pasha laughed curtly Zuembuel made a mistake What I want is a shovel or a couple of them Can you find such a thing without asking any one Yes my Pasha replied the Albanian promptly laying the revolver on the steps and disappearing again And it was not long before he was back with the desired implements We must dig a hole somewhere Shaban said his master in a low voice It must be in a place where people are not likely to go but not too far from the kiosque Shaban immediately started toward the trees at the back of the house The Pasha followed him silently into a path that wound through the wood A nightingale began to sing again very near them the nightingale thought the Pasha He is telling us where to go he said Shaban permitted himself a low laugh I think he is telling his mistress where to go However we will go too And they did bearing away to one side of the path till they came to the foot of the tall cypress This will do said the Pasha if the roots are not in the way Without a word Shaban began to dig The Pasha took the other spade To the simple Albanian it was nothing out of the ordinary What was extraordinary was that his master was able to keep it up soft as the loam was under the trees The most difficult thing about it was that they could not see what they were doing except by the light of an occasional match But at last the Pasha judged the ragged excavation of sufficient depth Then he led the way back to the kiosque They found Zuembuel Agha in the little room sitting on the sofa with a revolver in either hand I thought I told you not to come back exclaimed the Pasha sternly Yes faltered the old eunuch but I was afraid something might happen to you So I waited below the pines And when you went away into the woods with Shaban I came here to watch He lifted a revolver significantly I found the other one on the steps Very well said the Pasha at length more kindly He even found it in him at that moment to be amused at the picture the black man made in his sedate frock coat with his two weapons And Zuembuel Agha found no less to look at in the appearance of his master s clothes But now there is no need for you to watch any longer added the latter If you want to watch do it at the bottom of the hill Don t let any one come up here On my head said the eunuch He saw that Shaban as usual was trusted more than he But it was not for him to protest against the ingratitude of masters He salaamed and backed out of the room When he was gone the Pasha turned to Shaban This box Shaban you see this box It has become a trouble to us and I am going to take it out there The Albanian nodded gravely He took hold of one of the handles to judge the weight of the chest He lifted his eyebrows Can you help me put it on my back he asked Don t try to do that Shaban We will carry it together The Pasha took hold of the other handle When they got as far as the outer door he let down his end It was not light Wait a minute Shaban Let us shut up the kiosque so that no one will notice anything He went back to blow out the candles Then he thought of the fountain He caught a last play of broken images in the pool as he turned off the water When he had put out the lights and groped his way to the door he found that Shaban was already gone with the chest A drop of water made a strange echo behind him in the kiosque He locked the door and hurried after Shaban who had succeeded in getting the chest on his back Nor would Shaban let the Pasha help him till they came to the edge of the wood There carrying the chest between them they stumbled through the trees to the place that was ready Now we must be careful said the Pasha It might slip or get stuck But are you going to bury the box too demanded Shaban for the first time showing surprise Yes answered the Pasha And he added It is the box I want to get rid of It is a pity remarked Shaban regretfully It is a very good box However you know Now then There was a scraping and a muffled thud followed by a fall of earth and small stones on wood The Pasha wondered if he would hear anything else But first one and then another nightingale began to fill the night with their April madness Ah there are two of them remarked Shaban She will take the one that says the sweetest things to her The Pasha s reply was to throw a spadeful of earth on the chest Shaban joined him with such vigor that the hole was soon very full We are old my Pasha but we are good for something yet said Shaban I will hide the shovels here in the bushes he added and early in the morning I will come again before any of those lazy gardeners are up and fix it so that no one will ever know There at least was a person of whom one could be sure The Pasha realized that gratefully as they walked back through the park He did not feel like talking but at least he felt the satisfaction of having done what he had decided to do He remembered Zuembuel Agha as they neared the bottom of the hill The eunuch had taken his commission more seriously than it had been given however or he preferred not to be seen Perhaps he wanted to reconnoitre again on top of the hill I don t think I will go in just yet said the Pasha as they crossed the bridge into the lower garden I am rather dirty And I would like to rest a little under the chestnut trees Would you get me an overcoat please Shaban and a brush of some kind And you might bring me a coffee too How tired he was And what a short time it was yet what an eternity since he last dropped into one of the wicker chairs He felt for his cigarettes As he did so he discovered something else in his pocket something small and hard that at first he did not recognize Then he remembered the key the key He suddenly tossed it into the pool beside him It made a sharp little splash which was reechoed by the dripping basins He got up and felt in the ivy for the handle that shut off the water At the end of the garden the Bosphorus lapped softly in the dark Far away up in the wood the nightingales were singing LITTLE SELVES BY MARY LERNER Margaret O brien a great aunt and seventy five knew she was near the end She did not repine for she had had a long hard life and she was tired The young priest who brought her communion had administered the last rites holy oils on her eyelids Lord forgive her the sins of seeing holy oils on her lips Lord forgive her the sins of speaking on her ears on her knotted hands on her weary feet Now she was ready though she knew the approach of the dread presence would mean greater suffering So she folded quiet hands beneath her heart there where no child had ever lain yet where now something grew and fattened on her strength And she seemed given over to pleasant revery Neighbors came in to see her and she roused herself and received them graciously with a personal touch for each And has your Julia gone to New York missus Carty Nothing would do her but she must be going I suppose Twas the selfsame way with me when I was coming out here from the old country Full of money the streets were I used to be thinking Well well the hills far away are green Or to missus Devlin Terence is at it again I see by the look of you Poor man There s no holding him Eh woman dear Thirst is the end of drinking and sorrow is the end of love If her visitors stayed longer than a few minutes however her attention wandered her replies became cryptic She would murmur something about all the seven parishes or the Wicklow hills or the fair cove of Cork tippy toe into the ocean then fall into silence smiling eyes closed yet with a singular look of attention At such times her callers would whisper Glory b t God she s so near it there s no fun in it and slip out soberly into the kitchen Her niece Anna Lennan mother of a fine brood of children would stop work for the space of a breath and enjoy a bit of conversation Ain t she failing though the poor afflicted creature missus Hanley cried one day Her mind is going back on her already Are you of that opinion I m thinking she s mind enough yet when she wants to attend but mostly she s just drawn into herself as busy as a bee about something whatever it is that she s turning over in her head day in day out She sleeps scarce a wink for all she lies there so quiet and in the night my man and I hear her talking to herself No no she ll say I ve gone past I must be getting back to the start Or another time This is it now If I could be stopping And what do you think she is colloguing about There s no telling Himself does be saying it s in an elevator she is but that s because he puts in the day churning up and down in one of the same What else can you expect Tis nothing but Going up going down with him all night as it is Betune the two of them they have me fair destroyed with their traveling Are you lacking anything Aunt Margaret I call out to her I am not she answers impatient like Don t be ever fussing and too ing will you Tch tch And do you suppose the children are a comfort to her Sorra bit Just a look at them and she wants to be alone Take them away let you says she shutting her eyes The others is realer And you think she s in her right mind all the same I do Tis just something she likes to be thinking over something she s fair dotty about Why it s the same when Father Flint is here Polite and riverintial at the first then impatient and if the poor man doesn t be taking the hint she just closes up shop and off again into her whimsies You d swear she was in fear of missing something The visitor being a young wife had an explanation to hazard If she was a widow woman now or married perhaps she had a liking for somebody once Perhaps she might be trying to imagine them young days over again Do you think could it be that Anna shook her head My mother used to say she was a born old maid All she wanted was work and saving her bit of money and to church every minute she could be sparing Still you can t be telling Tis often that kind weeps sorest when tis too late My own old aunt used to cry If I could be twenty five again wouldn t I do different Maybe maybe though I doubt could it be so Nor was it so The old woman lying back so quietly among her pillows with closed eyes yet with that look of singular intentness and concentration was seeking no lover of her youth though indeed she had had one once and from time to time he did enter her revery try as she would to prevent him At that point she always made the singular comment Gone past I must be getting back to the beginning and pressing back into her earliest consciousness she would remount the flooding current of the years Each time she hoped to get further though remoter shapes were illusive and if approached too closely vanished for once embarked on her river of memories the descent was relentlessly swift How tantalizing that swiftness However she yearned to linger she was rushed along till all too soon she sailed into the common light of day At that point she always put about and laboriously recommenced the ascent To day something her niece had said about Donnybrook Fair for Anna too was a child of the old sod seemed to swell out with a fair wind the sails of her visionary bark She closed her mind to all familiar shapes and strained back way way back concentrating all her powers in an effort of will For a bit she seemed to hover in populous space This did not disturb her she had experienced the same thing before It simply meant that she had mounted pretty well up to the fountain head The figures when they did come would be the ones she most desired At last they began to take shape tenuously at first then of fuller body each bringing its own setting its own atmospheric suggestion whether of dove feathered Irish cloud and fresh greensward sudden downpour or equally sudden clearing with continual leafy drip drip drip in the midst of brilliant sunshine For Margaret O Brien ardent summer sunlight seemed suddenly to pervade the cool orderly little bed chamber Then Here she is and a wee girl of four danced into view wearing a dress of pink print very tight at the top and very full at the bottom She led the way to a tiny new house whence issued the cheery voice of hammers Lumber and tools were lying round from within came men s voices The small girl stamped up the steps and looked in Then she made for the narrow stair Where s Margaret gone to said one of the men The upper floor s not finished It s falling through the young one will be Peggy called the older man Come down here with you There was a delighted squeal The pink dress appeared at the head of the stairs Oh the funny little man daddy Such a funny little old man with a high hat Come quick let you and see him The two men ran to the stairs Where is he She turned back and pointed Then her face fell Gone the little man is gone Her father laughed and picked her up in his arms How big was he Peg As big as yourself I wonder No no Small As big as the baby She considered a moment Yes just as big as that But a man da Well why aren t you after catching him and holding him for ransom Tis pots and pots o gold they ve hidden away the little people and will be paying a body what he asks to let them go She pouted on the verge of tears I want him to come back I mistrust he won t be doing that the leprechaun Once you take your eye away it s off with him for good and all Margaret O Brien hugged herself with delight That was a new one she had never got back that far before Yet how well she remembered it all She seemed to smell the woody pungency of the lumber the limey odor of white wash from the field stone cellar The old woman s dream went on Out of the inexhaustible storehouse of the past she summoned one by one her much loved memories There was a pig tailed Margaret in bonnet and shawl trudging to school one wintry day She had seen many wintry school days but this one stood out by reason of the tears she had shed by the way She saw the long benches the slates the charts the tall teacher at his desk With a swelling of the throat she saw the little girl sob out her declaration I m not for coming no more mister Wilde What s that Margaret And why not Haven t I been good to you Tears choked the child Oh mister Wilde it s just because you re so terrible good to me They say you are trying to make a Protestant out of me So I ll not be coming no more The tall man drew the little girl to his knee and reassured her Margaret O Brien could review that scene with tender delight now She had not been forced to give up her beloved school mister Wilde had explained to her that her brothers were merely teasing her because she was so quick and such a favorite A little Margaret knelt on the cold stone floor at church and stared at the pictured saints or heard the budding branches rustle in the orchard outside Another Margaret a little taller begged for a new sheet of ballads every time her father went to the fair There were the long flimsy sheets with closely printed verses These you must adapt to familiar tunes This Margaret then swept the hearth and stacked the turf and sang from her bench in the chimney corner Sometimes it was something about the little old red coat me father wore which was All buttons buttons buttons buttons all buttons down before or another beginning O dear what can the matter be Johnnie s so long at the fair He promised to buy me a knot of blue ribbon To tie up my bonny brown hair Then there was a picture of the time the fairies actually bewitched the churn and labor as you might no butter would form not the least tiny speck Margaret and her mother took the churn apart and examined every part of it Nothing out of the way Tis the fairies is in it her mother said All Souls Day a Friday Put out a saucer of cream the night for the little people let you A well grown girl in a blue cotton frock the long braids of her black hair whipping about her in the windy evening set out the cream on the stone flags before the low doorway wasting no time in getting in again The next day how the butter came Hardly started they were when they could feel it forming When Margaret washed the dasher she kept an eye out for the dark corners of the room for the air seemed thronged and murmurous After this picture came always the same tall girl still in the same blue frock this time with a shawl on her head She brought in potatoes from the sheltered heaps that wintered out in the open From one pailful she picked out a little flat stone rectangular and smoother and more evenly proportioned than any stone she had ever seen What a funny stone she said to her mother Her mother left carding her wool to look You may well say so Tis one of the fairies tables Look close and you ll be turning up their little chairs as well It was as her mother said Margaret found four smaller stones of like appearance which one might well imagine to be stools for tiny dolls Shall I be giving them to little Bee for playthings You will not You ll be putting them outside In the morning though you may be searching the countryside no trace of them will you find for the fairies will be taking them again So Margaret stacked the fairy table and chairs outside Next morning she ran out half reluctantly for she was afraid she would find them and that would spoil the story But no they were gone She never saw them again though she searched in all imaginable places Nor was that the last potato heap to yield these mysterious stones Margaret growing from scene to scene appeared again in a group of laughing boys and girls What ll we play now Let s write the ivy test Here s leaves Each wrote a name on a leaf and dropped it into a jar of water Next morning Margaret who had misgivings stole down early and searched for her leaf Yes the die was cast At the sight of its bruised surface ready tears flooded her eyes She had written the name of her little grandmother and the condition of the leaf foretold death within the year The other leaves were unmarred She quickly destroyed the ill omened bit of ivy and said nothing about it though the children clamored There s one leaf short Whose is gone Mine is there Is it yours John Is it yours Esther But Margaret kept her counsel and within the year the little grandmother was dead Of course she was old though vigorous yet Margaret would never play that game again It was like gambling with fate And still the girls kept swinging past Steadily all too swiftly Margaret shot up to a woman s stature her skirts crept down her braids ought to have been bobbed up behind She let them hang however and still ran with the boys questing the bogs climbing the apple trees storming the wind swept hills Her mother would point to her sister Mary who though younger sat now by the fire with her spriggin embroidery for the quality Mary could crochet too and had a fine range of shamrogue patterns So the mother would chide Margaret What kind of a girl are you at all to be ever lepping and tearing like a redshanks deer Tis high time for you to be getting sensible and learning something Whistles and scouting guns is all you re good for and there s no silver in them things as far as I can see What fine whistles she contrived out of the pithy willow shoots in the spring And the scouting guns hollowed out of elder stalks which they charged with water from the brook by means of wadded sticks working piston wise They would hide behind a hedge and bespatter enemies and friends alike Many s the time they got their ears warmed in consequence or went supperless to bed pretending not to see the table spread with baked potatoes laughing potatoes they called them because they were ever splitting their sides besides delicious buttermilk freshly laid eggs oat cakes and fresh butter A child without supper is two to breakfast their mother would say smiling when she saw them tackle their stirabout the next day How full of verve and life were all these figures That glancing creature grow old How could such things be The sober pace of maturity even seemed out of her star Yet here she was growing up for all her reluctance An awkward gossoon leaned over the gate in the moonlight though she was indoors ready to hide But nobody noticed her alarm There s that long legged McMurray lad again scouting after Mary I ll be bound said her mother all unawares But it was not Mary that he came for though she married him just the same and came out to America with their children some years after her sister s lone pilgrimage The intrusion of Jerry McMurray signaled the grounding of her dream bark on the shoals of reality Who cared about the cut and dried life of a grown woman Enchantment now lay behind her and if the intervals between periods of pain permitted she again turned an expectant face toward the old childish visions Sometimes she could make the trip twice over without being overtaken by suffering But her intervals of comfort grew steadily shorter frequently she was interrupted before she could get rightly launched on her delight And always there seemed to be one vision more illusive than the rest which she particularly longed to recapture At last chance words of Anna s put her on its trail in this wise When she was not as her niece said in her trance wool gathering Anna did her best to distract her sending the children in to ask would she have a sup of tea now or a taste of wine jelly One day after the invalid had spent a bad night she brought in her new long silk coat for her aunt s inspection for the old woman had always been tasty and dressy and had made many a fine gown in her day The sharp old eyes lingered on the rich and truly striking braid ornament that secured the loose front of the garment What s that plaster she demanded disparagingly Anna inclined to be wroth retorted I suppose you d be preferring one o them tight ganzy sweater things that fit the figger like a jersey all buttoned down before A sudden light flamed in the old face I have it she cried Tis what I ve been seeking this good while Twill come now the red coat I must be getting back to the beginning With that she was off relaxing and composing herself as if surrendering to the spell of a hypnotist To reach any desired picture in her gallery she must start at the outset Then they followed on in due order all that procession of little girls pink clad blue print clad bare legged or brogan shod flirting their short skirts plaiting their heavy braids About half way along a new figure asserted itself a girl of nine or ten who twisted this way and that before a blurred bit of mirror and frowned at the red coat that flapped about her heels bought oversize you may be sure so that she shouldn t grow out of it too soon The sleeves swallowed her little brown hands the shoulders and back were grotesquely sack like the front had a puss pout on it Tis the very fetch of Paddy the gander I am in it I ll not be wearing it so She frowned with sudden intentness Could I be fitting it a bit I wonder the way mother does cut down John s coats for Martin With needle scissors and thread she crept up to her little chamber under the eaves It was early in the forenoon when she set to work ripping The morning passed and the dinner hour Peggy Where s the girl gone to I wonder To Aunt Theresa s I m thinking Well it s glad I am she s out o my sight for my hands itched to be shaking her Stand and twist herself inside out she did fussing over the fit of the good coat I m after buying her The little fustherer For the small tailoress under the roof the afternoon sped on winged feet pinning basting and stitching trying on ripping out again and re fitting I ll be taking it in a wee bit more She had to crowd up to the window to catch the last of the daylight At dusk she swept her dark hair from her flushed cheeks and forced her sturdy body into the red coat It was a fit believe you me Modeled on the lines of the riding habit of a full figured lady she had seen hunting about the country side it buttoned up tight over her flat boyish chest and bottled up her squarish little waist About her narrow hips it rippled out in a short frisk Beneath her calico skirt and bramble scratched brown legs Warmed with triumph she flew downstairs Her mother and a neighbor were sitting in the glow of the peat fire She tried to meet them with assurance but at sight of their amazed faces misgiving clutched her She pivoted before the mirror Holy hour cried her mother What sausage skin is that you ve got into Then as comprehension grew Glory b t God Ellen tis the remains of the fine new coat I m after buying her large enough to last her the next five years Twas too large the child whimpered A gander I looked in it Then cajolingly I m but after taking it in a bit ma Twill do grand now and maybe I ll not be getting much fatter Look at the fit of it just Fit God save the mark cried her mother Is the child after making that jacket herself asked the neighbor I am Margaret spoke up defiantly I cut it and shaped it and put it together It has even a frisk to the tail Maggie said the neighbor to Margaret s mother Tis as good a piece o work for a child of her years as ever I see You ought not to be faulting her she s done that well And bursting into irrepressible laughter it s herself will have to be wearing it woman dear All she needs now is a horse and a side saddle to be an equeestrieen So the wanton destruction of the good red coat in that house where good coats were sadly infrequent ended with a laugh after all How long she wore that tight jacket and how grand she felt in it let the other children laugh as they would What joy the old woman took in this incident With its fullness of detail it achieved a delicious suggestion of permanence in contrast to the illusiveness of other isolated moments Margaret O Brien saw all these other figures but she really was the child with the red coat In the long years between she had fashioned many fine dresses gowned gay girls for their conquests and robed fair brides for the altar Of all these nothing now remained but she could feel the good stuff of the red kersey under her little needle scratched fingers and see the glow of its rich color against her wind kissed brown cheek To the life she exclaimed aloud exultantly To the very life What life Aunt Margaret asked Anna with gentle solicitude Is it afraid of the end you are darling No no asthore I ve resigned myself long since though twas bitter knowledge at the outset Well well God is good and we can t live forever Her eyes opening to the two flaring patent gas burners winked as if she had dwelt long in a milder light What s all this glare about she asked playfully I guess the chandler s wife is dead Snuff out the whole of them staring candles let you Tis daylight yet just the time o day I always did like the best Anna obeyed and sat down beside the bed in the soft spring dusk A little wind crept in under the floating white curtains bringing with it the sweetness of new grass and pear blossoms from the trim yard It seemed an interval set apart from the hurrying hours of the busy day for rest and thought and confidences an open moment The old woman must have felt its invitation for she turned her head and held out a shy hand to her niece Anna my girl you imagine tis the full o the moon with me I m thinking But no never woman was more in her right mind than I Do you want I should be telling you what I ve been hatching these many long days and nights Twill be a good laugh for you I ll go bail And as best she could she gave the trend of her imaginings Anna did not laugh however Instead with the ever ready sympathy and comprehension of the Celt she showed brimming eyes Tis a thought I ve often myself let me tell you she admitted Of all the little girls that were me and now can be living no longer You ve said it cried the old woman delighted at her unexpected responsiveness Only with me tis fair pit yus There s all those poor dear lasses there s nobody but me left to remember and soon there ll not be even that Sometimes they seem to be pleading just not to be forgotten so I have to be keeping them alive in my head I m succeeding too and if you ll believe me tis them little whips seem to be the real ones and the live children here the shadders Her voice choked with sudden tears They re all the children ever I had My grief that I ll have to be leaving them They ll die now for no man lives who can remember them any more Anna s beauty already fading with the cares of house and children seemed to put on all its former fresh charm She leaned forward with girlish eagerness Auntie Margaret she breathed with new tenderness there s many a day left you yet I ll be sitting here aside of you every evening at twilight just and you can be showing me the lasses you have in mind Many s the time my mother told me of the old place and I can remember it well enough myself though I was the youngest of the lot So you can be filling it with all of our people Mary and Margaret John Martin and Esther Uncle Sheamus and the rest I ll see them just as clear as yourself for I ve a place in my head where pictures come as thick and sharp as stars on a frosty night when I get thinking Then with me ever calling them up they ll be dancing and stravaging about till doomsday So the old woman had her heart s desire She re created her earlier selves and passed them on happy in the thought that she was saving them from oblivion Do you mind that bold lass clouting her pet bull now she would ask with delight speaking more and more as if of a third person And that other hussy that s after making a ganzy out of her good coat I d admire to have the leathering of that one Still the old woman lingered a good month beyond her allotted time As spring ripened the days grew long In the slow fading twilights the two women set their stage gave cues for entrances and exits Over the white counterpane danced the joyous figures so radiant so incredibly young the whole cycle of a woman s girlhood Grown familiar now they came of their own accord soothing her hours of pain with their laughing beauty or suddenly contemplative assisting with seemly decorum at her devotional ecstasies A saintly woman the young priest told Anna on one of the last days She will make a holy end Her meditations must be beautiful for she has the true light of Heaven on her face She looks as if she heard already the choiring of the angels And Anna respectfully agreeing kept her counsel He was a good and sympathetic man and a priest of God but American born he was like her stolid kindly husband outside the magic circle of comprehension He sees nothing poor man she thought indulgently But he does mean well So she set her husband to mind the young ones and easily doffing the sordid preoccupations of every day slipped back into the enchanted ring THE FAILURE BY CHARLES CALDWELL DOBIE I At an unearthly hour in the morning John Scidmore sat up suddenly in his bed and remembered Julia Norris s telephone message He rose at once switched on the shaded light on the bureau and looked at his watch the minute hand had just swung past three o clock Undisturbed by her husband s nocturnal prowling Kitty Scidmore slept with almost childish naturalness He plunged the room into darkness again and felt his way out into the hall and down the short flight of stairs to the dining room The night was unusually warm As he opened the garden window pungent odors of dry stubble wet with a late October dew floated toward him He leaned out and drew in a deep breath but his attempts at calmness failed utterly He knew that it was absurd to fret he might just as well go back to bed and sleep peacefully One could not place a line of insurance at three o clock in the morning Upon what day had Julia Norris telephoned Was it last Friday Yes he remembered now perfectly He had been busy with a peevish customer who haggled about a twenty five cent overcharge In the midst of the controversy in her characteristically impulsive way Julia Norris had rung up O John is that you John Place ten thousand dollars with the Falcon Insurance Company on my flats in the Richmond District He had recognized her voice even before she gave her name And he had been so sure he would not forget Why he had been so very sure that he had not troubled to make a memorandum And to think that the excitement of arguing a twenty five cent overcharge should have so completely put to rout Julia Norris s order A sudden rage at his carelessness seized him How he loathed his life his work and the soul killing routine and cramped vision of the figurative counting house He switched on the light and peered into the mirror over the mantel smiling satirically at the reflection greeting him the reflection of plain Johnny Scidmore insurance broker s clerk a commonplace rather undersized law abiding citizen just turning forty whose face showed the lack of that forceful ability necessary to convert opportunity into success As he drew back from the glass with a shrug of disgust the futility of his life flashed over him He still could remember the time when he went blithely to the day s work buoyed by youth s intangible hope of better things But the years soon took their toll of enthusiasm and there were days when John Scidmore went through his paces like a trick horse urged by the whip of necessity Lately he had been worried to find how easily he was forgetting things telephone messages instructions from his chief orders to place insurance So far nothing very important had slipped by him but now he felt quite sure that he could never trust himself again There were many reasons why he should have remembered Julia Norris s orders First because she was his wife s friend second because a ten thousand dollar order to his credit was not an everyday occurrence and third because the circumstance that had overshadowed it was relatively of so little importance For over a week then Julia Norris s property had gone without insurance protection What if it had burned up What if it were burning up at this very moment He sat down suddenly He got up again fumbled about and found cigarettes and a box of matches Two cigarettes quieted him He began to think that he was a silly fool mooning about when he should have been sleeping In the morning he would take an early train to San Francisco and place the line without further ado Yes after all he was as silly and notional as a young schoolgirl He put down the window turned off the lights and crawled upstairs to bed II True to his resolve John Scidmore took an early train to San Francisco next morning although he could not have said why It was as impossible to place insurance at eight thirty as it was at three A M since no self respecting insurance office opened until nine Still there is a certain comfort in even futile activity when one has the fidgets It was a beautiful October morning such as often veils the Berkeley hills in faint purple and draws a soft glamour over the city of San Francisco and as Scidmore walked briskly down the elm shaded streets of Berkeley toward the train he felt elusively happy notwithstanding the ripples below the surface of his content The office boy was taking books out of the safe when he arrived at the office In a corner by the wash basin one of the stenographers stood fluffing up her hair A janitor dusted the desks with casual attention As Scidmore entered he noticed a woman sitting near the counter She rose instantly lifting her veil smiling a welcome at him He crossed over to her it was Julia Norris His heart began to beat violently but the next moment he had recovered himself and was able to smile back at her in perfect self control You are early he said offering her his hand Yes and I m in trouble You know those flats I insured last week they burned down early this morning They tell me there isn t a stick left standing His hand fell as if a blow had wilted it The flats you insured last week he echoed sparring for time I don t believe I understand Why didn t you get my telephone message I phoned last Tuesday I thought I talked to you I was sure it was your voice Could I have rung up the wrong office Her uncertainty steadied him Unconsciously she opened a door of escape Scidmore laid his hat on the counter Julia Norris fluttered back to her seat and he sat down beside her I suppose I ve bungled things again she went on Usually I leave everything to mister Rice but this insurance matter I took into my own hands I wanted you to have the business so I left positive instructions with mister Rice to let me know when the next insurance policy expired That was last Friday I phoned you at once I can t imagine As she rattled on pointing an accusing finger at herself John Scidmore grew surer and surer of his next step There was not the faintest note of calculation in his attitude confused and dazed he merely followed her lead And you never received any policy he questioned Not after a week You must have thought we were rather inattentive or slow She shook her head I forgot the whole transaction until this morning Rice phoned me at eight o clock But there may still be a chance Scidmore suggested shamed by the very ease with which he was escaping Perhaps another clerk got the message I ll question them all Or maybe you rang up the Falcon s office direct She laid a gloved hand on his arm as she shrugged He shook his head You can t imagine how this bothers me he went on He began to feel a certain boldness such as thieves feel when they put over a sharp trick He wanted to prolong the discussion to dally with danger To think that in trying to be of service to me you should have gone astray I wouldn t have had it happen for Let me see what was the amount of your order Ten thousand dollars Ten thousand dollars That s a lot of money Yes she admitted slowly as she moved toward the door I m pretty comfortable but nobody likes to throw money into the street He thrust his hands into his pockets in an effort at nonchalance He could feel his temples throbbing But his confusion cleared before Julia Norris s unruffled smile deepening a growing sense of irritation She was not greatly concerned first because she did not have to be and second because her faith in his integrity was unshaken Her complacency and trustfulness enraged him What was ten thousand dollars to her In the midst of his musings her voice curiously remote roused him I m going to have lunch with Kitty she said almost gayly Lunch with Kitty he echoed Then floundering with mingled consternation and embarrassment he finished Oh yes won t that be fine Yes by all means do And yet unnerved as he was he went through the conventional motions of courtesy bowing her to the door pressing her hand cordially sweeping her a good bye with exaggerated warmth Even when she was gone her unperturbed smile mocked him She did not have the slightest suspicion of his unworthiness and therein lay the essence of the sudden and unqualified hate he began to feel for her John Scidmore questioned all the clerks as they entered the office Had any one received a telephone message about a week ago from missus Julia Norris He was playing his game so earnestly that he would not have been surprised to find somebody acknowledging the transaction The manager came in at ten o clock Scidmore even presented the case to him missus Julia Norris a client of his had telephoned an order for insurance over a week ago Nobody remembered it The property to be insured had burned up Of course missus Norris might have been mistaken she admitted as much but there was just a chance The manager instantly interested adjusted his glasses A ten thousand dollar line neglected Incredible He began to investigate personally calling up one clerk after another while Scidmore listened like a highwayman tempting chance from a spirit of sheer bravado Nobody remembered even under the most searching cross examination The private exchange operator who was usually very keen about such matters could not place the call Then came a discussion as to how to prevent such a lapse should one occur Scidmore sat at the manager s desk quite the hero of the hour a very important personage whose ten thousand dollar client had come to grief It was years since he had figured in a question of office policy Gradually the uniqueness of his position pushed Julia Norris and her loss into a hazy background He returned to his routine work with a gay spirit Several times during the morning the manager called him for further conference and inquiry Finally a letter was drafted to missus Julia Norris to the effect that the California Insurance Brokers Company regretted exceedingly to inform her that upon closer examination no trace could be found of her telephone message They could only conclude that she inadvertently had rung up the wrong office Inquiry at the Falcon Company s office however developed that no such insurance had been placed even by a rival firm They hoped that this unfortunate occurrence would not stand in the way of other favors at her hands and so forth John Scidmore signed the letter with a flourish All morning the fiction of Julia Norris s mistake still persisted Why had she not taken greater precautions The idea of telephoning in a line of insurance and not inquiring the name of the person who took the message Common sense would dictate such a course He began to feel abused as if Julia Norris had betrayed him in some way III It was not until John Scidmore had scrambled aboard the ferryboat on his way home and had seated himself in his usual place under the pilot house that his inflated spirits began to collapse The afternoon had been spent in a mad rush of business an avalanche of petty orders and details such as periodically afflicts an insurance broker s office The sense of security which had enveloped him all day fell away before a vague uneasiness Before an audience he had played his part spiritedly without the spur of interested auditors his performance lagged There was an element of excitement in serving moral fiction to unsuspecting listeners but hoodwinking himself proved a boresome task The boldest highwayman had a cleaner record at least such an outlaw made bold plays and took great chances He had not risked so much as his little finger on his enterprise and his victim s cheek was still warm with the kiss of betrayal Lies thievery murder one by one these suggestions of outlawry mentally passed in review and sank into insignificance before this sinister word betrayal In all the calendar of human weaknesses John Scidmore could recall none that served so contemptible an end as betrayal And he John Scidmore had been guilty of this crowning meanness If the memory of Julia Norris s confidence stabbed him what of the attitude of his superiors at the office They had never even thought of questioning him As he looked back on the events of the morning he was appalled It seemed that all these years he had built up barriers of moral responsibility only to see them swept away before a freshet of fears A tramping of feet warned him that the boat was swinging into the slip He rose mechanically The exertion of following the scrambling crowd and finding himself a seat on the train interrupted his self accusation By the time he was comfortably settled again he mentally had begun his defense Why should he make such an absurd fuss over confessing his fault to Julia Norris She was rich her husband had left her a cool million Ten thousand dollars didn t matter and besides she was Kitty s friend Had he the right to purchase a quiet conscience at the expense of Kitty s pride What had he given Kitty in the fifteen years of their wedded life Had he played the game boldly and well Did she hold her head high at the mention of his name No he had fallen short of his own standards How much more must he have fallen short of her hopes for him And now he was lacking the courage to swallow his medicine He was ready to whimper and whine at the load which his own inefficiency had forced upon his conscience He argued that strong men made bold plays and damned the consequence in other words they took a chance But his soul was tricking itself out in a dramatic subterfuge What he really had discovered was something to excuse his weakness and this something loomed up conveniently in the person of Kitty Scidmore his wife When Scidmore arrived home he went directly to his room and closed the door The thought of meeting Kitty troubled him But after he had slipped on an old coat and freshened up he felt better At the dinner table he noticed a tired pinched look about his wife s mouth Julia Norris was every day as old as his wife but time had dealt kindly with her Her face was still fresh and rosy there was not even a glint of gray in her hair Resentment began to move him resentment at Julia Norris at her fortune at her friendship for his wife at every detail connected with his memory of her Kitty began to talk Scidmore sat silent crumbling his bread Finally the dread subject came to life Kitty looked up and said Julia was late to day as usual Poor dear Julia what a generous soul she is Scidmore began to fidget Late How did that happen She left our office long before ten o clock Oh but you don t know Julia She did a thousand and one things before she arrived here And such a disheveled creature as she was And so full of apologies and troubles Nothing to speak of she laughed them all away in five minutes Then she didn t tell About the insurance I should say she did She was so worried for fear you d be distressed about it all She admitted that she was to blame But she knows how conscientious you are and she was afraid Scidmore impatiently interrupted his wife Julia Norris ought to have some business sense Kitty upon my word she should And it has worried me A woman like that one never can be sure of just what she does think It s an even chance that deep down she believes that she delivered the message to me and that I neglected it He could feel his face flushing with mingled indignation and disapproval as he voiced his displeasure Kitty got up to pour a glass of water Why John she half chided I m sure Julia wouldn t be guilty of such a thought You don t know her generous impulsive Why she d forgive you for neglecting if you really had neglected anything As a matter of fact she said very decidedly If I d been dealing with anybody but John Scidmore I do believe I d be inconsistent enough to try to blame the other fellow but of course I know Yes he broke in excitedly that s just it That s the way she puts it to you But such a remark as that just bears out what I say she s not altogether satisfied I know what she thinks I saw it in her face this morning this is what comes of trying to help one s poor friends His wife stopped pouring water and laid down the pitcher Nonsense Julia Norris has perfect faith in you Why should she have he persisted hotly Isn t it just as possible for me to forget to overlook a telephone message as the other fellow I m not infallible any more than she is No Kitty returned very quietly I don t think she imagines that you are infallible But she knows that if you took her message and forgot it you d admit it He rallied from this blow with a feeling of fierce antagonism Well he sneered sarcastically if she s silly enough to have any such notions she does need a guardian As a matter of fact I d conceal my mistakes as quickly as any one else would Kitty began to laugh a full throated indulgent laugh that made him bite his lips What a lot of foolish brag you re indulging in Johnny Scidmore Well after all let s forget about it Julia herself laughed it off He crumpled the napkin in his hand Yes that s just it She can laugh over it while we why if we lost ten thousand it would be a tragedy I couldn t help thinking to day after she d left the office suppose just suppose I had received Julia Norris s phone message and forgotten it The very thought made me sick all over He paused frightened at the lengths to which his uneasiness had forced him His wife s smile gave way to a puzzled look as she returned very quietly Do you really think it worth while to face these imaginary situations His resentment flared again at the comfortable evenness of her tone Yes I do he snapped back It helps one to exercise one s morals I wanted to know just how I would act in such an emergency And I ve found out The very thought frightens me too much I know that I should feel morally bound to confess but I d never have the courage of my convictions Now what do you suppose you would advise me to do in a situation like that What would you tell me to do Kitty Scidmore looked straight at her husband He dropped his eyes I would not advise you John she said distinctly He glanced up at her You d not say a word She shook her head No it wouldn t be necessary He began to stir his tea His hand was shaking and his spoon rattled noisily against the teacup IV After he had helped Kitty with the dishes John Scidmore left the house for a walk It was a calm beautiful night lit by a slender moon hung high in the heavens and stars twinkling cheerily As he went along the elm shaded streets he drew in deep breaths striving to steady the tumult within him Kitty s words hummed themselves into his inner consciousness No John it wouldn t be necessary What did she really mean Did she think he had the courage to settle such a question decisively righteously Did He stopped turning the phrase over in his mind He knew that materially he had been a failure People called him a nice fellow and let it go at that Was it possible for his wife the wife who had lived so close to all his weaknesses to glorify him with so large a hope The thought began to thrill him He heard the Old Library clock on the University campus chime nine He began to walk slowly in the direction of the chiming clock He was still undecided still battling with his cowardice The shrill whistle of an incoming train arrested him This same train would swing back to San Francisco in ten minutes He retraced his steps In ten minutes His legs seemed weighted He wondered whether he would really catch it Standing before the massive facade of the Hotel Fairmont John Scidmore had a fleeting hope that Julia Norris would not be at home But almost as instantly he felt a desperate need to clear himself at once If he waited even an hour he could not vouch for the outcome He walked rapidly into the lobby gave his name to the hotel clerk and awaited the reply with beating heart missus Norris was in A bell boy answering the clerk s summons showed him to her apartments A maid ushered him into a reception room He sank into one of the luxurious chairs drumming upon its arms with nervous fingers A lamp on the centre table threw a rich golden light over the surroundings Thrown over a chair a lace scarf fell with the undulating softness of a cascade Near a vase of blood red roses a long white glove had been dropped carelessly He did not wait long Julia Norris came toward him with her usual warm smile and a hand outstretched in welcome He stood up She was very simply dressed in white and a band of velvet at her throat set off a fine cameo ringed with pearls but her air of quiet elegance caught and held his resentful eyes A fierce unreasoning hate began to sway him for a moment his vision blurred As she stepped back to pick up her lace scarf from the chair John Scidmore recovered his poise I was afraid you would be out he began inadequately She threw the scarf about her shoulders I was preparing to drift downstairs to watch the dancing she answered You caught me just in time He stood irresolutely almost awkwardly watching her dainty manipulations of the filmy lace Then quite suddenly so suddenly as to surprise even himself he blurted out I lied to you this morning I took your order for insurance I forgot to place it She stood for a moment in silence What made you John Scidmore shrugged His vision was clearing He felt quite calm You suggested the idea yourself You were so ready to take the blame I suppose it was self preservation I began to strike blindly as any desperate man would I m not what they call a success I never have been You know how it is some people Oh well Some of us don t get by that s all He turned away Julia Norris touched him on the shoulder John can t you see that the ten thousand dollars doesn t matter to me But you and Kitty you and Kitty do matter He began to crush his hat between his clasped hands She threw the scarf from her shoulders Look here John He stopped her with an abrupt gesture I ve won this victory for Kitty s sake he said This is the first time in my life I ve lived up to her hope of me If you were a failure you d realize how much that means She was standing by the vase of roses scattering petals with ruthless fingers She crossed over to him and put both her hands in his You re not a failure John Scidmore she said simply The rose petals were dropping in a steady shower on the table He saw them lying lightly on the white glove He felt a great relief as he put his clenched hand to his eyes V As John Scidmore rode home he felt desperately tired He could not remember a day which had seemed longer He dragged up the elm shaded street down which he had whistled his confident way twelve hours before a shuffling ineffectual figure As he opened the front door his hand shook He lingered in the hall hanging his hat with unnecessary care twisting his necktie into shape smoothing the thin wisps of hair about his temples He found Kitty in the living room A tiny fire crackled in the grate Standing in the doorway he watched the needle which Kitty deftly plied slipping about its task with fascinating gleams Her face was happily flushed and she was humming softly to herself The elegant memory of Julia Norris rose before him He saw again the golden shower of light from the huge table lamp the vase of American Beauty roses the lace scarf thrown carelessly across a brocade chair He pressed his lips together and entered the room Kitty looked up He stopped short Something new he ventured She gave a little laugh New I should say not Just freshening up a bit for to morrow To morrow he echoed dully What s on for to morrow Guest day at the club missus Wiley has asked me to pour tea What kept you out so late Johnny He crossed over to the fire pulling his easy chair into place I went over to the city to see Julia Norris He stood a moment undecided his back turned toward Kitty his hand upon the chair He was waiting for Kitty to question him Finding that she did not answer he turned and looked at her She was intent on her sewing but he fancied that the flush of happiness suddenly had fled her cheeks I went over to see Julia Norris he repeated desperately You said your advice wouldn t be necessary He sank into a chair Across the room he heard the monotonous ticking of a clock He was wondering what Kitty would say Of course she understood the whiteness of her face told him that her feminine intuition had bridged the gaps in his explanation He began to have a terror lest she would come up to him or speak perhaps even weep The fire in the grate flared up suddenly turned faintly blue and died Still Kitty said nothing still the clock ticked rhythmically He leaned back closed his eyes and drew a long breath Kitty was stirring She came over and dropped gently before the fire leaning her head against him I forgot to tell you she said slowly I asked Julia Norris over for Sunday dinner She s so awfully stuffed up in that horrible hotel Her bravery smote him more than tears could have He did not answer but he just put out his hand and touched her hair caressingly as she finished It s very grand I know and all that But after all it isn t home Johnny is it BUSINESS IS BUSINESS BY HENRY SEIDEL CANBY I Six hours on the train had nearly exhausted Joseph Cargan He had read all the available magazines looked up his connections twice in the railway guide and even gazed for an hour out of the window But there were only woods and farms to be seen scarcely a bill board and no automobiles He dropped his cigar wearily into the spittoon by his chair in the club car and relapsed into lethargy With dull iteration he ran over the plans for the deal in prairie land that he hoped to put through to morrow and guessed lazily at whether six thousand dollars would purchase the tract of which they had written him He thought of his wife and hoped that his telegram would be telephoned over to the Runkles so that she might meet him at the station with the clean shirt he had asked for Afterwards he cut his nails yawned loudly and was just going to sleep when they stopped at Joline and a boy came in with papers 
8791_291101_000007_000000	train-clean-360	Cargan turned first as usual to the stock market reports 
none	none	There were only two items of interest since he had left the tape Montana Pacific had gone off a little more But two hundred shares of Benningham Common had sold at seventeen a drop of ten points 
8791_291101_000007_000004	train-clean-360	His eye caught an explanatory note the dividend on the preferred had been cut the surplus was heavily reduced His mind searching rapidly over their business fixed upon two marginal accounts Jim Smith s and Waldron s 
8791_291101_000007_000005	train-clean-360	In each case the collateral deposited had already been insufficient 
8791_291101_000007_000006	train-clean-360	Drawing out his note book he swiftly figured 
none	none	That old gambler Smith s always on the edge he reflected We can hold him a little longer 
8791_291101_000007_000009	train-clean-360	Gotta sell Waldron out Must have made a thousand dollars out of that account first and last Too bad A momentary sense of Waldron s calamity swept over him but quickly evaporated 
8791_291101_000007_000010	train-clean-360	 Business is business he thought and remembered with a little angry satisfaction Anita Waldron s coming out dance and how the Runkles who were invited kept talking about it all winter Old Waldron won t be so darn particular next year 
none	none	As the train pulled into his home town he hurried out upon the station platform and saw with pride and pleasure that his wife was just stepping out of the Runkles motor Looking about to see who might be there to note the company she was keeping his eye fell on a tall and stooping gentleman with a trimmed beard and eyeglasses who was searching with weary eyes the train windows but even while he frowned at the recognition his wife had seized him by the shoulder caroling Hello Jimmy 
8791_291101_000008_000002	train-clean-360	Give me a kiss dear and take your old shirt She was a graceful woman stiffened by an obvious corset and faintly powdered 
8791_291101_000008_000003	train-clean-360	A long yellow feather dangled from her orange hat big pearls were set in her ears and her shoe buckles glittered as she walked 
8791_291101_000009_000000	train-clean-360	He kissed her admiringly 
8791_291101_000009_000001	train-clean-360	 Say Martha you look great he chuckled 
none	none	I hate to have to go right on You tell the kids I ll bring em something when I get back 
8791_291101_000010_000000	train-clean-360	The train was starting indeed he had just time to dash up the steps of his car 
8791_291101_000010_000001	train-clean-360	 Good bye dear she caroled 
none	none	Good bye dee ar hummed the brakeman and slammed down the swinging floor of the vestibule Cargan was already balancing himself along the corridor of the club car 
8791_291101_000010_000004	train-clean-360	A lurch of the train swung him heavily out among the chairs to save himself he caught a shoulder and dropped into a seat 
none	none	His neighbor had but just sat down 
8791_291101_000010_000006	train-clean-360	It was Waldron 
none	none	They shook hands as if nothing were in the air and then compared watches to see if the train were on time This done Waldron took off his glasses swung them on their black cord and began to polish them nervously blinking with short sighted eyes into the space that hurried past the car windows 
8791_291101_000011_000002	train-clean-360	Cargan offered him a cigar but he put it aside quickly 
8791_291101_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 No thank you no thank you Well they cut the dividend He looked at Cargan with a wan smile 
8791_291101_000012_000001	train-clean-360	 What ll I do Cargan 
8791_291101_000012_000002	train-clean-360	They told me I d find you on the train and I thought I d ask your advice 
none	none	Cargan was relieved
8791_291101_000013_000001	train-clean-360	 Sell mister Waldron he answered earnestly sell right off 
8791_291101_000013_000002	train-clean-360	That Brogan crowd s runnin the company now and they re no good sell quick 
8791_291101_000014_000000	train-clean-360	Waldron looked at him in doubt 
8791_291101_000014_000001	train-clean-360	 How much do I lose he asked feebly 
none	none	Bout six thousand against his will Cargan made the tone apologetic Say put up only five thousand more collateral and we ll carry you till better luck 
8791_291101_000016_000000	train-clean-360	The old man blinked rapidly then conquered his pride 
8791_291101_000016_000001	train-clean-360	With punctilious care he unbuttoned his gray cutaway took out a wallet from under the button of the Society of Colonial Wars drew forth a sheet of note paper and with a pencil inscribed a broad O There s my collateral mister Cargan he said whimsically 
none	none	He was so helpless and so elegant in his helplessness that the bully awoke in Cargan With an effort he broke through the nervous deference with which Waldron always inspired him and spoke roughly We don t do business without either collateral or cash Waldron 
8791_291101_000019_000000	train-clean-360	The gentleman put his wallet back hurriedly as if some one had laughed at it and cast a quick hurt look at his broker 
8791_291101_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 You haven t been thinking of selling me out after all the business I ve given you 
8791_291101_000021_000000	train-clean-360	Cargan nodded 
8791_291101_000022_000000	train-clean-360	Incredulity horror resolve passed over Waldron s face 
8791_291101_000022_000001	train-clean-360	 You cannot It s impossible he said firmly 
none	none	The assertion in his tone was irritating What s goin to stop us Cargan asked coolly shoved his hands into his pockets and puffed clouds from his cigar 
8791_291101_000024_000000	train-clean-360	Different worlds of imagination revolved in the two men s minds Theophilus Waldron thought of the children and of his father the governor and of the family pride 
none	none	Sudden poverty was as bad as disgrace
8791_291101_000024_000002	train-clean-360	 I didn t mean it that way he answered hurriedly 
none	none	I m in temporary difficulties My house is mortgaged 
8791_291101_000024_000005	train-clean-360	I ve borrowed money from my wife and other places He was too proud to add This is confidential My boy s just entered college my girl s just come out It isn t just the money a gush of emotion reddened his face You ve got to pull me through Cargan 
8791_291101_000024_000006	train-clean-360	It s impossible it s out of the question for me to break now 
none	none	But Cargan was remembering how he lost his job in the department store and couldn t pay the rent When he was kicked out nobody said it was impossible Nobody said it was impossible when they went into the top of a tenement The contrast made him bitter but it was the thought that he had never felt it to be impossible the inescapable inferiority always forced upon him in the presence of Waldron which roused his temper
8791_291101_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Business is business mister Waldron he said curtly 
8791_291101_000026_000001	train-clean-360	 Ab so lute ly we won t take the risk 
none	none	They were rattling through coal sheds and grain elevators at the edge of a town 
8791_291101_000027_000001	train-clean-360	Waldron got up stiffly and carefully brushed the cinders from his coat 
8791_291101_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 This is Bloomfield I think he said coldly 
none	none	I m meeting my family here 
8791_291101_000028_000002	train-clean-360	mister Cargan there are considerations above business His voice failed a little 
none	none	This is a matter of life and death 
8791_291101_000029_000000	train-clean-360	Cargan had heard that bluff before 
none	none	What d you mean he grunted mister Waldron was staring fixedly out of the window
8791_291101_000030_000001	train-clean-360	 I mean he faltered that I may not be able to stand up under it And then his voice resumed its desperate certainty 
8791_291101_000030_000002	train-clean-360	 I mean sir that what you propose is impossible 
8791_291101_000030_000003	train-clean-360	I mean that ab so lute ly you cannot sell me out 
8791_291101_000031_000000	train-clean-360	He bowed and felt his way down the corridor 
none	none	I can t can t I Cargan flung after him then jerked a sheet from the telegraph pad in the rack beside him and wrote Sell out Waldron at noon to morrow unless five thousand collateral Something ll drop for you old boy he growled addressed the telegram to his partner and gave it to the porter Outside Cargan heard a burst of merry voices and saw Waldron hurried away by two laughing girls to an automobile waiting with a trunk strapped behind it 
8791_291101_000033_000001	train-clean-360	missus Waldron followed 
8791_291101_000033_000002	train-clean-360	She was a stiff woman a little faded quietly dressed 
8791_291101_000033_000003	train-clean-360	Her face was troubled and when they reached the motor she caught her husband s elbow gently as if to ask him something but he merely nodded and turned her glance toward Cargan s window 
none	none	She bowed and smiled very sweetly in his direction and Cargan smiled sourly in return 
8791_291101_000033_000005	train-clean-360	Then the children hustled the old folks into the tonneau and they were off just as the train started 
none	none	Cargan felt hardly used A man s got to look out for himself he thought angrily Business is business that s the thing for him to remember
8791_291101_000034_000003	train-clean-360	 It s impossible Nevertheless in self defense he began to calculate what it might have cost to carry the account until the appalling magnitude of the risk shut off the discussion 
none	none	The darned old self confident aristocrat he murmured working himself up into a fury Thinks he can bluff me but he ll find out what s impossible believe me Then he dispelled his irritation by a cocktail and hurried into the diner He snored in his berth while the train ran out farther and farther upon the great Kansas plain slept while signs of culture disappeared one by one and arose in the midst of an endless unfamiliar world of grass When he sat down in the diner for his morning meal the great wheel of the horizon rimmed round his little train without a notch on the perfect circle over night the outer world had changed but he was absorbed in fitting his choices into a sixty cent breakfast The train stopped quickly and firmly and lay dead upon the prairie
8791_291101_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Eccentrics or hot box said the man who jumped off the step beside him 
none	none	Nothing much else goes wrong with an engine nowadays 
8791_291101_000037_000002	train-clean-360	What is it Bill 
none	none	And the conductor looking about him to see that no more passengers were within earshot answered Eccentrics two hours anyway Cargan flung his cigarette on the ground I ll miss my connection at Hay Junction he protested I ve gotta be in Hamden this afternoon
8791_291101_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 Walk then said the conductor stolidly 
none	none	It s only ten miles from here straight across 
8791_291101_000041_000000	train-clean-360	There was no house in sight no road nothing but the dead train the new land of endless shimmering prairies and beyond the ditch a single horseman looking curiously at the long cars and the faces strained against the glass of the windows 
8791_291101_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Say you Cargan called can you get an auto anywhere here 
8791_291101_000043_000000	train-clean-360	The figure looked at him impassively then shook its dusty head 
8791_291101_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Or a team 
8791_291101_000045_000000	train-clean-360	It shook its head again 
8791_291101_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 Or a horse Cargan hesitated 
8791_291101_000046_000001	train-clean-360	He had never ridden a horse 
none	none	A sudden gleaming idea shot across the man s solemn features He slid off his pony and led him nearer the ditch Say he suddenly became voluble you said you wanted to get to Hamden Well if you ll make it five plunks and give me your ticket you can take this horse an I ll go round by train 
8791_291101_000048_000002	train-clean-360	Say do you want to 
8791_291101_000049_000000	train-clean-360	Cargan was tempted 
none	none	All you had to do was to stick on
8791_291101_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 What ll I do with my suit case 
8791_291101_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 Gimme it to take for you 
none	none	I guess it ain t worth more n my horse II They helped him on and pointed out the dim line of telephone poles which marked a road a mile beyond 
8791_291101_000053_000001	train-clean-360	He walked his horse onward not daring to trot struck the dusty highway rode on over an imperceptible roll of the plains and was alone on a vast bare earth naked as when born from the womb of time 
none	none	Plover swung up before him with melancholy cries A soft haze rose from the plains They grew more vast more endless In the north a white cloud mass piled itself up and up until it seemed as if it might topple over upon the flat world beneath 
8791_291101_000054_000004	train-clean-360	He had never before looked at the country except as real estate never seen the plains and a curious new sense of the bigness of the earth oppressed him 
8791_291101_000054_000005	train-clean-360	He felt very small and very mean 
none	none	The humiliation of his spirits was a novel feeling and an unpleasant one he tried to hum it away Just wait till I strike Broadway And watch me with the girls For I m the man that invented it The hair that always curls His harsh voice in the stillness was ridiculous even to him but when he stopped singing the silence flowed over him as a stream that had been held back 
8791_291101_000056_000001	train-clean-360	The sky was enormous he was only a speck on the vast floor 
none	none	As he plodded on and on and on through the dust he began to grow dizzy from the glare and the heat He could not collect his thoughts for business A curious sense of weakened identity perplexed him and his head was full of drifting pictures Waldron s face among them 
8791_291101_000056_000005	train-clean-360	That face lingered 
8791_291101_000056_000006	train-clean-360	He saw him looking vaguely out of the car window saying that he couldn t stand up under it that it was impossible He wondered if it was a bluff after all 
8791_291101_000056_000007	train-clean-360	The face faded away leaving a dull pity behind it a struggling remorse 
none	none	Cargan shifted uneasily in his saddle and tried to think of business But instead of business queer childish ideas began floating in and out of his mind accompanied by words remembered from Sundays in his boyhood 
8791_291101_000056_000010	train-clean-360	He was alone with God 
8791_291101_000056_000011	train-clean-360	God saw into his heart 
none	none	A little nervous shiver ran over him and when he checked it with a laugh there followed a wave of superstitious emotion A low wave of the prairies had hidden from him a little house and barn standing crudely new against the sky in the distance Tiny figures were moving behind the buildings and a dust cloud rose from the highway in front 
8791_291101_000057_000002	train-clean-360	Cargan suddenly became conscious of his appearance his serge suit his straw hat his awkward seat in the saddle 
none	none	The loneliness of the plains had shaken his usual self assurance
8791_291101_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 Maybe they ll think I stole this horse 
8791_291101_000058_000001	train-clean-360	Guess I ll go round he said aloud 
none	none	He jerked his steed from the road into the grass and urged him into a trot Instantly he found himself beaten and jolted like a ship in a tempest 
8791_291101_000058_000004	train-clean-360	He lost a stirrup he slipped sidewise on the saddle then in a panicky fright he began to shout and saw at the bit 
none	none	Frightened by the voice and the thunder of hoofs a chaparral cock darted from beneath the horse s nose It was enough to make the beast swerve then toss his head and in a panic madder than his rider s break into a run and dash unrestrainably onward Cargan numb with fright leaned over his neck and wound his hands in the mane 
8791_291101_000058_000008	train-clean-360	The speed sickened him 
8791_291101_000058_000009	train-clean-360	The flat earth swung beneath the sky swam dizzily 
8791_291101_000058_000010	train-clean-360	He dared not pull on the reins he could only hold on grimly and shut his eyes 
8791_291101_000058_000011	train-clean-360	Once he slipped and screaming saw for an instant a blur of grass before he could pull himself back to safety 
none	none	And then the speed increased the sweaty shoulders labored beneath him and his senses whirled 
8791_291101_000059_000000	train-clean-360	He did not note how far they ran but at last came a slower motion a gallop and then a trot 
none	none	Weak from exhaustion he was bumped from the saddle and found himself clutching and kicking with both arms around his horse s neck 
8791_291101_000059_000002	train-clean-360	Flinging himself outward he rolled over on the soft ground and lay groaning on the prairie 
8791_291101_000059_000003	train-clean-360	The well trained horse stopped and began to graze he too was quivering with fatigue but his fright was over 
none	none	The sun was burning near the zenith 
8791_291101_000059_000005	train-clean-360	The world again was empty and this time there was no road 
none	none	Cargan was lost When he recovered a little he caught the horse and too shaken to mount him limped on leading him by the bridle in what direction he did not know Pangs of hunger and faintness assailed him The awful loneliness chilled him through in spite of the blaze of heat and light He remembered stories of men who had wandered on the prairie round and round in an endless circle until they had gone crazy and blown out their brains 
8791_291101_000061_000003	train-clean-360	A profound pity for himself stirred him 
8791_291101_000061_000004	train-clean-360	Never had he so felt the need of humanity of human aid 
none	none	He would have given a hundred dollars to be walking up Main Street with the boys calling to him from Rooney s cigar store and the world where it was yesterday Just in front a little calf stumbled to its feet and ran toward them mooing piteously 
8791_291101_000062_000001	train-clean-360	It too was lost 
none	none	Cargan stroked its nostrils and a sympathy for all suffering things flowed through his heart He thought with a shudder of Waldron pacing somewhere like himself alone lost helpless his pride gone In his awakened imagination he saw him wandering nearer and nearer the fatal act He ll shoot himself I ought to done something he whispered with a sudden rush of unfamiliar emotion and all the sentiment in his nature heaved and struggled to the light A cow lowed somewhere beyond them his horse pricked up his ears and the calf ambled off in the direction of the sound Cargan limped after hurriedly leading his horse A hundred yards brought them to the edge of a slight bowl in the plains with a little moisture around which pewees were flying and his heart leaped to see beside it a tiny house of unpainted boards Wires stretched from one window along the depression which led westward until they disappeared in the endless horizon and as he paused to survey a sharp bell rang
8791_291101_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 Hello is that Annie came faintly across the silence 
none	none	He looked at his watch and saw that it was only eleven I ll talk to Casey about Waldron he said guiltily Relief for his escape and still more the hush of that enormous plain the solemnity of the great and shining sky filled him with high and noble thoughts
8791_291101_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 Say is Hamden near here he asked of a slim woman in a gingham dress who appeared at the door 
none	none	She nodded
8791_291101_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 And say can I use your telephone 
none	none	She hesitated looking him over then motioned him incuriously to the stool behind the pine table Solitude seemed to have made her unready of speech 
8791_291101_000069_000002	train-clean-360	He called Cargan Casey then waited fidgeting 
none	none	Silence invaded the little kitchen 
8791_291101_000069_000004	train-clean-360	The clock ticked in a hush the chickens droned in whispers the woman herself worked over the stove with slow fingers moving the kettles gently 
none	none	Cargan Casey were busy He fumed for an instant then gave his own home number It s Jim he said and heard his wife s carol of surprise 
8791_291101_000070_000001	train-clean-360	He could see her tiptoeing at their telephone 
none	none	I m all right he shouted in response to her eager words and the thought of their little sitting room and the kids playing behind her warmed his blood I got run away with on the plains but I m all right Her frightened ejaculation thrilled him with loving pride honest I am And then suddenly a wave of generous emotion mounted to his head
8791_291101_000070_000004	train-clean-360	 Martha he called quickly tell Casey not to sell out Waldron tell him right away 
none	none	I ll explain to morrow 
8791_291101_000071_000000	train-clean-360	The connection roared and failed 
8791_291101_000071_000001	train-clean-360	He hung up the instrument 
none	none	The quiet room the gently moving woman the immensity without rushed back on his sight Exhilarated clear hearted looking heaven in the face he asked the necessary questions mounted his horse and pushed onward Hamden was already a blotch upon the horizon Say it s great to get into a big country he murmured lifted his bare head to the free air and in a curious exaltation of mind rode on dreamily He noticed the flowers in the coarse grass watched the wild doves flying with their quick strong wing beats and swung his eye joyfully around the blue horizons that receded until one felt the curve and pitch of the world The mood lasted until Cargan reached the first straggling houses of the village street so that he entered upon the rutty highway between dirt sidewalks with regret as one whose holiday was ending 
8791_291101_000073_000001	train-clean-360	He scarcely noticed the loiterers who stared at him or thought of his streaked face his trousers split at the knee his hat lost on the wild ride 
8791_291101_000074_000000	train-clean-360	But as he plodded onward the atmosphere of town had its effect 
none	none	His eye began to take note of the size of the shops glittering under their false fronts the new houses behind rows of stiff young trees the number and make of automobiles His subconsciousness grasped the financial level of Hamden although his thoughts were still in the wide spaces of the plains A boy ran out from the side walk to sell him a paper He stuck it in his side pocket and suddenly began to feel like a man of this world again Say sonny he called who sells land in this burg Dubell John Dubell Thanks He went more and more slowly A drug store blazing with marble and onyx in the afternoon sun made Cargan s dry throat wrinkle with thirst He pulled his horse toward that side of the street 
8791_291101_000077_000002	train-clean-360	There was a row of customers along the soda water counter and through the open windows came scraps of conversation two boys were teasing each other about a girl a group of men were talking auctions options prices real estate 
none	none	He drank their talk in greedily with a pang of homesickness and a rush of returning common sense Dismounting stiffly he tied his horse and stood for an instant on the cement pavement feeling his dirt and tatters wondering if they would throw him out for a bum 
8791_291101_000077_000004	train-clean-360	Then he slid inside the door and ordered a chocolate soda 
none	none	The clerk was reading the paper while he juggled the milk shakes Cargan carefully concealing his torn trousers climbed a stool and began to look back upon the vagaries of the day with sullen wonder 
8791_291101_000078_000001	train-clean-360	He brushed furtively at the caked dust on his legs remembering irritably the elegance of Waldron whom he had saved 
8791_291101_000078_000002	train-clean-360	In the mirror of the soda fountain he saw himself torn dirty shrinking and the sight filled him with disgust and anger 
none	none	He felt as ridiculous as when he had come out with a glass too much from the Stoneham bar and tripped over the steps of the main entrance
8791_291101_000078_000004	train-clean-360	 Gimme a cigar he called to the boy at the magazine counter bit off the end lit it and began to think business 
8791_291101_000079_000000	train-clean-360	The clerk swirling a cataract of milk from glass to glass revealed the inner sheet of the paper propped before him 
none	none	Cargan read beneath his arm the full page advertisement of a land sale the land sale he had come through all this tomfoolery to reach His eyes bulged as he saw that they were going to throw a thousand acres on the market
8791_291101_000079_000003	train-clean-360	 Good gosh he gulped inwardly what a chance It was a sure thing for the man with the money 
none	none	The last of his fine sentiments evaporated 
8791_291101_000080_000001	train-clean-360	Except for Waldron he could have scooped it all in but now four hundred was all he dared touch and perhaps not that 
none	none	Raging against his softness back there on the plains which seemed a hardly recognizable world he ground his teeth and coughed and choked over his soda 
8791_291101_000080_000003	train-clean-360	Soft headed donkey 
8791_291101_000080_000004	train-clean-360	The reaction was complete 
none	none	Suddenly a little thought no bigger than a minute rose in one corner of his brain and spread and spread He looked furtively at the clock over the clerk s head and saw that it was only half past two With guilty deliberation he rose and walked slowly toward the door of the telephone booth keeping back from full consciousness just what he was about to do Then he slammed himself within and shouted Casey s address to the operator As he waited his wrath mounted What in heck was the matter with me anyway He smoked furiously in the stifling box
8791_291101_000082_000000	train-clean-360	 Go ahead said the operator and at the word Hey there Casey he yelled at the dim voice on the wires I ve gotta have five thousand quick 
8791_291101_000082_000001	train-clean-360	Sell that Benningham Common yes Waldron s At the name his anger broke loose 
8791_291101_000082_000002	train-clean-360	 The old high brow tried to bluff me 
8791_291101_000082_000003	train-clean-360	What The connection failed and left him gasping 
none	none	What 
8791_291101_000083_000001	train-clean-360	Sold it 
8791_291101_000083_000002	train-clean-360	He told you to No I dunno anything about a court decision 
8791_291101_000083_000003	train-clean-360	Up fifteen points on a merger 
8791_291101_000083_000004	train-clean-360	Well what do you think He gulped down the sudden reversal and felt for words 
8791_291101_000083_000005	train-clean-360	 Say tell him he licked his lips tell him I m sure glad I saved him 
8791_291101_000083_000006	train-clean-360	I m sure glad 
none	none	I saved him I m sure glad The wires roared again and Cargan putting down the receiver grinned shamefacedly into the dirty mirror But gradually a sense of conscious virtue began to trickle pleasantly through his veins
8791_291101_000084_000002	train-clean-360	 I m sure glad he repeated more vigorously carryin him to day was what did it A vision of missus Waldron s happy face rose to bless him the exhilaration of the morning coursed back into his heart with a comfortable feeling of good business about it 
8791_291101_000084_000003	train-clean-360	He felt better and better 
8791_291101_000084_000004	train-clean-360	From somewhere a saying floated into his head Doing good unto others is the only happiness By heck that s true he commented aloud and sat smoking peacefully his mind aglow with pleasant thoughts 
none	none	The bell whirred raucously 
8791_291101_000085_000001	train-clean-360	He saw that he had forgotten to replace the receiver and putting it to his ear caught Casey s voice again 
none	none	Say Carg Jim Smith s in the office and won t leave till he s heard from you 
8791_291101_000086_000001	train-clean-360	Montana Pacific s off two points more 
none	none	Say do you want to carry him He says he s done for if you sell him out A fire of indignation rushed through Cargan What d you think I am a damned philanthropist he yelled
8791_291101_000087_000001	train-clean-360	 Sell out the old gambler 
none	none	Sell him out And he hung up NOTHING BY ZEPHINE HUMPHREY This is not going to be an easy story to write Its theme is precisely that which I have chosen for my title and naturally its positive significance is not obvious But I must somehow get the thing into words The spiritual value which I found in the experience may come home to some reader At any rate it is good for us all to stop now and then and challenge the conventional standards of our lives To begin with I presume that there are few sympathetic students of humanity who will not agree with me that the strain of mysticism which sometimes appears in the New England character is one of the most interesting and touching of all the manifestations of our human nature It is so unexpected The delicate pearl in the rough oyster is not more apparently incongruous rarer or more priceless Nay it is more than that The development is so impossible as to be always a miracle freshly wrought by the finger of God There are all sorts of elements in it which do not appear in other kinds of mysticism humor that unfailing New England salt reserve and a paradoxical mixture of independence and deference It knows how inexplicable it must seem to its environment how it must fret its oyster so it effaces itself as much as possible But it yields not one jot of its integrity It holds a hidden solitary place apart like a rare orchid in the woods like a hermit thrush Even to those who love it it will not lightly or often reveal itself But when it does well I would take a weary barefoot pilgrimage for the sake of the experience which I had last summer And here I may as well begin my narrative I I sat behind her in the little country church and when I had studied her profile for a few moments I was glad of a chance to rise and sing the Doxology She was a woman of fifty odd a typical Vermonter with the angular frame and features peculiar to her class Her mouth was large her cheek bones high her thin dark hair streaked with gray was drawn smoothly down behind her ears But her expression that gave her away Not flagrantly of course To discover her one had to be temperamentally on the watch for her Apparently like all the rest of us she was looking at the flowers before the pulpit but I was sure that her wide blue eyes were really intent on something behind and beyond Her mouth brooded her forehead dreamed her whole face pondered grave and delectable matters I am afraid that I did not hear much of the sermon that morning When church was over I followed her out and waited to see in what direction she turned her homeward steps Then I made up my mind to devote the next week to taking walks in that same direction The minister s wife saw me looking after her and approached me with a smile which I understood She was about to say That is one of our native oddities a real character I see that she interests you Shall I take you to see her You will find her a curious and amusing study But I headed her off by letting the wind blow my handkerchief away Nobody should tell me anything about my mystic not even what her name was or where she lived I was fully prepared not to find her for several days I went forth in quest of her in the spirit in which I always start out to find a hermit thrush ready to be disappointed to wait humbly aware that the best rewards demand and deserve patience But she was not so securely hidden as the thrush Her little house gave her away to my seeking as her expression the day before had given her away to my sympathy It was just the house for her low and white under a big tree on the side of a brook threaded hill a little apart from the village I recognized it the instant I saw it and when I had read the name Hesper Sherwood on the mailbox by the side of the road I confidently turned in at the gate She was working in her garden clad in a blue checked gingham apron and a blue sunbonnet When she heard my footsteps she looked up slowly turning in my direction and for the first time I saw her full face It was even better than her profile Oh when human features can be moulded to such quietness and confidence what an inexplicable pity it is that they ever learn the trick of fretfulness In Hesper Sherwood humanity for once looked like a child of God I was not sure at first that she saw me distinctly Perhaps the sun dazzled her shaded eyes Her expectant expression held itself poised a little uncertainly as if she were doubtful of the exact requirements of the situation But when I said something commonplace enough and yet heartful about the beauty of the view from her gate her face lighted and she came forward It s better from the house she said shyly yet eagerly Won t you come up and see It was indeed as fair a prospect as threshold ever opened out upon Close at hand was the green hillside dropping down to the smiling summer valley and beyond were the mountains big and blue with their heads in the brilliant sky and with cloud shadows trailing slowly over them Directly across the way they were massive in the distance where the valley opened out to the south they were hazy and tender One of them loomed above the little house and held it in its hand Everywhere they were commanding presences and it was clear that the house had taken up its position wholly on their account Plain enough in itself it was that house Its three small rooms were meagrely furnished and its windows were curtainless inviting the eyes beyond themselves It was utterly restful It made me want to go home and burn up half the things I possess Later as I came to know it and its owner better I understood what perfect counterparts they were She too invited the gaze beyond herself It is of course not my intention to trace the development of our friendship Though we trusted each other from the beginning we took the whole summer to feel our way into each other s lives It was a beautiful experience I would not have hurried it But now I want to proceed at once to the conversation in which she finally told me explicitly what had not happened to her It was but the definite statement of what I had known all along that here was a life which God had permitted Himself the luxury of keeping apart for his own delectation We were sitting out on the front steps in the face of the mountains and valley and we had said nothing for a long time Our silence had brought us so close that when she began to speak my ear ignored the uttered words and I felt as if my thoughts were reading hers It s queer about folks lives isn t it she said thoughtfully though I am not sure that she was any more aware of her lips than I was of my ears How they follow one line how the same things keep happening to them over and over I suppose it s what people call Fate There s no getting away from it Take my brother Silas As a boy he was always making the luckiest trades couldn t seem to help it Then when he married and moved to his new farm he began to get rich and now he couldn t stop his money if he wanted to He must be worth fifteen thousand dollars Take my sister Persis She s had eleven children Take my uncle Rufus He s been around the world three times and is just starting again Take She paused and hesitated You I supplied softly Well yes take me She turned and flashed a sudden smile at me I ve always wanted everything and I ve had nothing She spoke the word as if it were the pot of gold at the foot of the rainbow It took me a long time to understand she went on quietly as I made no comment I suppose that was natural I was young and I had never happened to hear of a case like mine At first I thought that just because I wanted a thing I was bound to have it There was my mother Again she paused and a tender glowing light appeared in her face like the quickening of a latent fire It was eloquent of all sorts of passionate youthful eager things I guess I worshiped my mother she submitted simply Maybe you think that anyway I had her But no I hadn t She liked me well enough Mothers do But we had a big family and we lived in a big house and she was very busy It bothered her to have me get in her way with my huggings and kissings Why in the world couldn t I wait until bedtime Poor mother She never did seem to know what to make of my devotion People don t like to be loved too well it embarrasses them She died when I was fourteen And I thought I d die too There was no shadow on Hesper s face as she remembered her young far away anguish rather there was a strange deepening of peace But she was silent for two or three minutes and I noticed that she put out her hand and caressed an old fashioned crocheted tidy that lay on the arm of a chair which she had brought out on the porch When she resumed her story she spoke somewhat more rapidly I was sick a long time If I hadn t been I think I might have gone crazy But pain took my attention and weakness made me sleep a good deal and when I came to get up again I was quieter I spent lots of time in the fields and woods I had always loved them and now they seemed to help me more than anything else There was something about them so big that it was willing to let me love it as much as I wanted to That was comforting When I was in the woods I felt as if I had hold of an endless thread You know how it is She appealed to me
8699_291107_000097_000000	train-clean-360	 Indeed yes 
none	none	I answered her And I quoted William Blake Only wind it into a ball It will lead you in at heaven s gate Built in Jerusalem s wall She nodded soberly yet glowingly and pondered the words for a moment Then That s very good she said Please say it again Well by and by she continued touching her finger as if she were half unconsciously enumerating the points of a discourse there was something indescribably simple and downright in her manner of unfolding her experience by and by somebody gave me a card to the village library and I began to read Of course I had always gone to school but the pieces in the readers didn t interest me particularly and I hadn t followed them up A reader isn t a book anyway it s a crazy quilt I guess I shan t ever forget that summer I couldn t do anything but read I read stories and poems and books about travel and history and peoples lives I had a hiding place up in the woods where I used to go and stay for hours sometimes whole days My older sister couldn t get anything out of me in the way of housework It was wonderful Her voice rose a little and something of the old exultation came flooding back into her face Isn t it silly to talk of books as if they were just print and paper when they are really stars and seas and cities and pictures and people and everything There was nothing my books didn t give me that summer and yet on the other hand there was nothing they didn t make me want I wanted to travel to go everywhere to see and hear everything above all by way of a beginning I wanted to go to school I was always an impatient child and it did seem as if I couldn t wait till autumn when the schools opened There s a good school at Fieldsborough over the mountain I coaxed my father to let me go there and after a while he consented On the day he wrote to enter my name I ran up in the woods and lay in a bed of ferns and cried for joy I hugged every tree that came in my way I tried to hug the brook Dear me Again she broke off and the light which had begun to burn in her eyes softened into a smile That s the way I was then I was so hot hearted I didn t understand But you went I inquired my sympathetic eagerness suddenly breaking bounds It seemed to me that I could not stand it if she had been disappointed Oh why not My voice faltered for she shook her head My eyes she said briefly They had always bothered me and before he let me go to school father had them examined by a city doctor who was boarding in the village He said I d surely be blind some day and that of course the more books I read the sooner the end would come She spoke as if she referred to the wearing out of an umbrella or a pair of shoes and fortunately for us both my distress kept me dumb It was pretty hard at first a real blow But I was sixteen years old and I had suffered once Then too I thought I had to make a choice and I needed all my wits about me So I held on to myself and went off to the woods to think Should I go to school or should I keep my eyes as long as I could As soon as I had put my mind to it however I found that there wasn t any real question there Of course I d got to keep my eyes and the school must go There were all sorts of reasons I wanted to see the woods and mountains as long as possible I didn t want to become dependent on any one My memory wasn t very good and I knew most likely if I went to school and stuffed my mind full that year I d soon forget everything and there I d be worse off than ever So I gave over thinking about it and just lay in the ferns all the afternoon Maybe you ll hardly believe me when I tell you that I was happy that day I don t know what it was Something moved in the treetops and in the shadows I watched it closely and by and by when I was just on the point of seeing it I realized that both my eyes were closed If I hadn t been so surprised by that discovery and so taken up with wondering how I had happened to shut my eyes without knowing it I believe I d have seen Her voice trailed off into silence and I presently found myself wondering if she had left that sentence unfinished also without knowing it II My father died the next year she continued after a few thoughtful minutes and my sister married and I came to live in this little house I had it fixed over to suit me so that it was as simple and convenient as possible and I set myself to learn it by heart I did a lot of my housework after dark Inside a year I was so independent that I knew I need never worry about having to get anybody to help me By taking plenty of time I managed to learn some books by heart too and I found it was much more interesting to sit and think about one paragraph for an hour than to read twenty pages Even a few words are enough Take Be still and know that I am God or Acquaint now thyself with Him and be at peace There s no end to those sentences Well She touched her third finger and then for the first time she came to a full pause as if she were not sure about going on Her face grew shy and reserved and reluctant I looked away not for anything would I have urged her further confidence But she went on presently She had committed herself to the stream of this confession and she would not refuse to be carried by it wherever it might wind After a while I had a lover He was a man from the city and I met him in the woods We were never introduced and for a long time I didn t know anything about him except that I loved him and he loved me We couldn t help it for we felt the same way about the woods I had never known any one like him before and never expected to because I m so different from most folks He made me understand how lonely it is to be different I we But after all she could not dwell on this experience and I did not want her to The poignant beauty of the relation was already sufficiently apparent to my imagination One day he told me that he had a wife at home she concluded and I never saw him again I think it was then that I really knew and understood Knew what Understood what She had an air of having said all that was necessary of having come to the end of her story and I shrank from putting any crude questions to her But it seemed to me that if she did not tell me something more of her secret I should just miss the most significant revelation I had ever caught a glimpse of Perhaps she read my suspense At any rate she said presently It was very simple If it hadn t been I couldn t have understood it for I was never a good hand at trying to reason things out It was just that I wasn t ever to have anything I wanted When I once knew and accepted that I felt as if I d slipped out into a great wide quiet sea This was to her own mind so definitely the end of her narrative that after sitting a moment in silence she half rose as if to go into the house and attend to some domestic task But I put out my hand and held her apron s hem You mean I stammered Really she must tell me a little more A look of perplexity almost of distress came into her tranquil face and she shook her head I told you I was no hand at working things out she said It s better just to know Please I insisted It was crass in me but I felt that something as precious as life itself depended on my grasping the full significance of this story Gently but very resolutely she stooped and released her apron from my clutch I ve some bread in the oven she said and disappeared III She was gone so long that I had time to do what I would with the fragments of the story which she had so non committally delivered to me Since analysis was my way I should have full scope for it I sat with my head in my hands my elbows on my knees The sunset deepened and glowed around me but I paid no attention to it The cloudy abstraction which hovered before my inner vision and let me grasp here a fringe there a fold was all absorbing to me Souls that want greatly like Hesper are doomed to failure or disappointment No earthly having can possibly satisfy them For what they really want is simply God and earth represents Him very imperfectly Hesper had not been happy with the thing she had come nearest having her mother Would she have been happy with her lover Would he have let her love him too well Books and education and travel are all finite and fragmentary means to an end which never arrives Only adventurous spirits can escape the torment in them And with all her eagerness Hesper was not adventurous She was too earnest and humble she was too direct Fate had been good to her and in giving her nothing had really given her everything Everything that was God Well her story had not once referred to Him but it had been as instinct with Him as a star with light It was He who had beckoned and lured her by lurking in her three definite interests and then had shattered them before her in order that she might find Him She had Him fast at last and He had her There was no mistaking the heavenly surrender of her face I was awed with the apprehension of the passionate seeking and finding between a human soul and its Maker Did she recognize and acknowledge the situation Or here again did she prefer a blind certainty Blind The word had dogged me for several weeks but I had evaded it Now when it suddenly confronted me I was all but staggered by it I think I groaned slightly I know I pressed my hand closely over my eyes Then my own action admonished me Here was I deliberately shutting myself away from the sight of the outer world in order that I might hold and marshal my thoughts in the presence of reality The hills and sky are distracting the whole flying glory of creation is a perpetual challenge and disturbance to the meditative spirit How supremely excellent it would be if one could only look long and hard and adoringly enough at it to see through it once and then never see it again for the rapt contemplation of That which lies behind I had come to this point in my revery when Hesper softly returned and stood in the doorway behind me I looked up at her She returned my smile but I thought that her eyes did not quite fix me Neither did she glance at the sky when I commented on the beauty of the sunset although she assented to the comment convincingly As she sat down beside me her hands and feet made a deft groping I said nothing and I have never known whether she or any one else knew that she was blind The minister s wife waylaid me as I passed her house that evening on my way back to my room You ve been to see Hesper Sherwood again she remarked with a righteous tolerant air of ignoring a slight I m so glad Her life is so empty that any little attention means riches to her Empty The expostulation was a mistake but I really could not help it I have never known such a brimming life I added still more foolishly The minister s wife stared at me Why she has nothing at all she said Precisely I commented and went on my way A MOTH OF PEACE BY KATHARINE FULLERTON GEROULD Anne Marmont of old the pupil of the nuns had told her about Andecy an ancient place half manor half farm in the Marne valley whence you could walk over a wind swept plain to the battlefields of the Hundred Days The nuns being exiled of course can t keep it up any longer and no one wants to buy I remember it as a place of heavenly peace though in my day they used to make the oldest and crossest nun in the order superior at Andecy However Madame Francoise de Paule is dead now and there aren t any nuns anyhow Do take it dear If you want quiet Anne Marmont swept her arms out as if to embrace illimitable horizons Nothing but a church spire or a clump of trees to be seen from edge to edge of the plain The unstable ocean is nothing to it And if you want variety you can walk over to Champaubert and look at the house where Napoleon stayed the night before the battle Riddled with bullet holes it is There used to be a foolish ancient there who remembered the Hundred Days He s dead now I suppose but then so is Madame Francoise de Paule thank Heaven and her cane too I hope they buried the cane Do take it darling It s dirt cheap and my dear nuns would be so pleased They d probably send the money to the new Nicaragua convent And Miss Stanley had gone to Andecy had been conquered by the insuperable peace of the plain and had set up her little household No place that she had ever seen seemed so good to wait in When Edmund Laye came back from the Argentine to marry her she would submit to London but already she had hopes of enticing him to Andecy for the honeymoon The chill of the slow spring warmed her northern blood she liked the reluctance of the season s green the roaring fire that met her in the salon the sharp cold click of her boots on the brick paved corridor She was well cared for a Protestant and a foreigner who was none the less a mysterious well wisher of ces dames she found a shy allegiance springing up about her steps as she traversed the plain There was always a hot galette for her at la vieille Andecy an obsequious curtsy at Congy chateau from the housekeeper who showed with mumbling pride the bed where Henri Quatre had slept and a welcoming smile from saint Eloi that holy humorist in the Champaubert chapel She sat until twilight often on the sinister shore of l Etang des Loups Even the legended Croix Jeanne leaning against its pine thicket seemed glad of her awkward Protestant dip It was a good place and all for the price of a second rate hotel splotched with Baedekers Loneliness in the sense of removal from the social scene did not afflict her She who shrank almost morbidly from human encounters had no fear of the peasants Slim shy timorous she felt safe here Her terrors were all of people and what people could do to her The plain ignored her self distrust Letters came from Edmund regularly if you granted the delay of driving to Sezanne to fetch them The months rounded slowly punctually to winter and her marriage So might a chatelaine have waited powerless but trusting Then in full summer time the lightning struck choosing again the Montmirail plain after a hundred years respite The first rumors were vague and vivid all detail and no substance like news in the Middle Ages There was war and she scarcely knew more Jacques or Etienne turned over night into a reservist and departed but had it not been for that she would hardly have known The two maid servants whom she had brought with her clamored for Paris she gave them money and had them driven to Sezanne After the mobilization they must have got through for she never heard again It did not occur to her to strike out herself for the capital for her common sense told her she was better off where she was until Paris had cleared the decks for action Besides Paris frightened her She hated being jostled in streets she resented even a curious stare Old Marie and her husband with their grandchild came up from their cottage to the manor to sleep and with the son and nephew gone there was nothing for them to do but potter about rheumatically in her behalf For many days the click of the rosary was never stilled among the corridors of Andecy And still the rumors grew terror capping terror until it seemed that even at Andecy blood might rain down at any moment from the arched heaven At first Miss Stanley forced herself to drive the fat donkey into Sezanne for news a half day s trip with only more terror at the end The feeble crowds beset the bulletins posted outside the mairie and scattered murmuring their own comments on the laconic messages Sometimes crones and half grown children on the edge of the crowd got her to report to them as she emerged from the denser group in front of the mairie wall She did so as gently as she could for they were all involved fathers husbands sweethearts brothers sons were facing the enemy at some point or other that only the War Office knew If some creatures had had nothing to give it was only because the Prussians had taken all they had in seventy There was no insane terror the people were strangely calm yet they and theirs had been of all time the peculiar food of the enemy and there was pessimism afloat The plain was as defenseless as they its mild crops as fore ordained to mutilation by feet and hoofs and wheels as they to splintering shells Miss Stanley who was so shy of unfamiliar action felt Sezanne too much for her She stopped going after a week and resigned herself to not knowing She chafed under the censorship though she knew that Edmund Laye would tell her that it was well done of the Powers that Were to stanch the leakage of news as you would stanch blood from an artery The General Staff was better off not drained of its vital facts To be sure Miss Stanley never read newspapers Even less did she subscribe to them But she longed now for a neutral America where the extras came hot and hot where experts of every kind fought out the battles on the front page and good journalese stimulated the lax imagination Her determination to go no more to Sezanne led her for exercise to other quarters of the plain She would walk quickly tensely for an hour her eyes fixed on a clump of trees or a church spire far ahead of her at the end of the unswerving road until the clump and the spire rose up to match her height and she came to the first whitewashed cottage Champaubert church was never empty these days of worshipers who gazed up at gaudy saint Eloi as if he could help The crops that waved on the old Montmirail battlefield were thinly harvested by women and an impeding fry of children The steep little streets of Congy were dirtier than ever and the ducks and the infants plashed about more indiscriminately in the common mud puddles No more galettes at la vieille Andecy the old woman was prostrated by the loss of her reservist grandson Finally she gave up the plain too and withdrew into Andecy itself waiting always waiting for word of Edmund Laye There had been a touch of loyalty to him in her staying on without plan of escape News of him would reach her here sooner than elsewhere If she left she would be lost in a maelstrom and might lose some precious word Until she heard from Edmund of his sailing or of a change of plan she would stay where he thought of her as being When she heard she would go Some atavistic sense in Miss Stanley caused her to look all through early August to the provisioning of the manor some dim instinct to hoard food that might have sprung from the heart of a colonial ancestress behind a stockade of logs premonition against death and savages She sent old Marie to buy thriftily making it clear that her fortress was not for herself alone but for all who might be in need Together she and Marie and the granddaughter piled provisions in the empty rooms and the dark cellars and they lived frugally on milk and eggs and soupe aux choux Sometimes she wondered whether the danger was not a mere fixed idea of the foolish peasants who had all been touched in the wits by seventy True the able bodied men were gone but the reports these people brought her made no sense Their quality verged on folk lore Something gigantic was going on somewhere but it had nothing to do with Edmund Laye in the Argentine or with her at Andecy Paris in danger Perhaps but how to take it on their word Belgium flowing with blood Just what did it mean An aeroplane over Sezanne at dawn It must often have happened allez The air was never free nowadays The Germans in France They had been seeing Germans behind every bush for forty years So she talked with old Marie scarcely sure whether she or old Marie were the fool Since the household no longer drove the fat donkey to Sezanne none of them knew even what the War Office said unless what old Seraphine from the next farm reported that her granddaughter had heard in Champaubert from a woman whose married daughter had been to Sezanne two days before could be called a War Office report And never from the first on the plain of Andecy had anyone understood why According to the plain all things were to be believed of the German Emperor who was usually drunk but on the other hand who could trust an atheist government The soil of the Hundred Days had never recovered from Bonapartist tendencies Miss Stanley had often noted and even old Marie would sometimes mix up fifteen and seventy The White Paper which Miss Stanley had never heard of would have been wasted on Champaubert and Montmirail Wonder stirred at last even in old Marie s fatalistic mind at the lack of panic in this shy young foreigner who could not chaffer who could not bully who could not endure even the mimic urbanity of Sezanne Strange that she should be willing to stay quietly pacing up and down the cobbled courtyard of Andecy for sole exercise Past mid August Marie put a vague question When I hear from him I shall go Marie Miss Stanley answered But I leave everything here to you and Theophile The British fleet holds the sea they say and I shall be better off in England I shall surely come back when the war is over and perhaps I shall bring my husband with me Some dim muscular effort deepened the wrinkles in the old woman s face It was as if a knife had cut them in the living flesh I hope so if Theophile and I are here To be sure you must go where it is your duty We will keep such of the provisions as can be kept Keep nothing It is all for you who have been so kind to me you and yours Not a child not a creature for a dozen miles about that I would not wish to share with as you know But listen Marie Miss Stanley blushed faintly as she bent her head nearer Marie s good ear It is my duty My first duty that is must be to my future husband When he returns from America she had long ago learned the futility of distinguishing for Marie between l Amerique du nord and l Amerique du sud and was patient with her belief that New York was a suburb of Cayenne he will wish me there He was to have sailed last month A letter a telegram must have gone astray in the confusion When I hear he will doubtless be in England And when he reached England I was to go to my friends and be married to him My heart bleeds for France but I am not French and my duty is not here I am American you see dear Marie and my fiance is English Ah Marie shook her head My old head is turned with all they tell me and the buzzing in my bad ear is like cannon But I had thought that the English for some reason I do not understand were fighting with us They have been telling us for ten years that we do not hate the English that we love them And Theophile thought that an English army was against the Germans But perhaps I am wrong Monsieur votre fiance will not have to fight then I congratulate you mademoiselle The English are fighting with the French Marie But all Englishmen are not soldiers Monsieur Laye is not a soldier He is an engineer He is perhaps past the age There is no conscription in England Marie No man is a soldier unless he chooses No service to make None C est beau ca All Frenchmen must fight So England may go to war and still have men to till the fields But where do their armies come from Any man who wishes may go But none are compelled except the soldiers by profession There will be enough never fear England will not desert France The old woman nodded I am not afraid of that And you are not afraid that monsieur le fiance will fight I do not understand these things As Theophile says what I comprehend I do not hear and what I hear I do not comprehend I go to fetch mademoiselle s soup They are lucky all the same to get the crops in in time of war She clattered from the room Miss Stanley felt her heart grow heavy she did not know precisely why If only word would come Perhaps she was a fool to stay There must be trains through to Paris now Anything to get nearer Edmund away from this historic war bound plain She crouched by the window to eat her soupe aux choux and stale bread If only some boy would come riding into the courtyard with a letter for her She had bribed half the urchins who loitered by the mairie in Sezanne to rush to her hot foot with anything that came The lightning that had struck once at Champaubert and Montmirail was to strike again before she heard from Edmund Laye Suddenly with no warning the heavens opened with that reiterant flash Frightened stragglers over the plain refugees from the north pushing on from beyond Sezanne in a blind stumbling dash to the southward rumors that sprang up out of the ground so that she had but to stand still to hear the world move indescribable distant noises commotions less seen than sensed on the far horizon a casual smudge of aeroplanes on the great blue round of heaven an earth for no visible reason tumultuously vibrating beneath her and then at last one hot noon a frightened boy falling exhausted at her feet She gave him the piece of gold which for many days had been waiting for him in her pocket and bade him rest where he lay until he was ready for food Marie and Theophile crouched beside him listening to his winded babbling Armies armies fighting men riding on horses guns and wounded like fifteen like seventy like Hell People like themselves leaving their cottages and farms making with such portable treasures as they had food relics poultry babes in arms for the shelter of a town No town could avail them for in the towns sat the officers and the marketplace offered only a bigger a more organized destruction But the hope of shelter would take them far afield Anything was better than to see sabres splintering your walls and a greasy flame replacing all that had been ancestral and intimate Better to die in the open with friends not smoked out of your own cellar to fall on a bayonet They knew the secular ways of war the dwellers on the plain were the foredoomed type of the refugee the world over Once in so often men fought and poor people were homeless And now none of the vieux de la vieille were there to guard These were the visions that assembled in Miss Stanley s brain while Marie her lean fists clenched reported the boy s wild talk The lumps of fat hardened on her congealing soup and still her mind went painfully shuttle wise back and forth from her telegram infinitely delayed but clearly authentic to the apocalyptic events surrounding her Like most Americans perpetually defended by two oceans Miss Stanley had no conception of invasion as a reality The insult of an enemy on your own ground was one which she had never steeled herself to meet There was no weapon in her little arsenal for a literal foe Her knees trembled under her as she rose to look out of the window after Marie spent with eloquence had left her Edmund Laye by this was with his regiment even she might not know where No point in trying to break through to London his telegram dated the day of his arrival in England was already too old The letter he promised her would go the way of all the letters he must have written that she had never had And she herself was caught she had waited too long on that predestined plain The noises she heard seemed rumblings of the earth and cracklings of the inflamed sky Andecy manor had not yet seen one soldier unless you reckoned the pilots of those soaring monoplanes But their hours were numbered soon any moment now all that hidden rumor would break forth into visible fruit of fighting men men with rifles men with lances men with mitrailleuses or howitzers She was trapped To try even with no luggage to make the miles to Sezanne would be not so much to take her life in her hands as to kick it from her Caught and her nervous nostrils feigned for her a subtle odor of smoke She turned from the window and went to the quiet room that had once been the chapel Out of those windows she could not look thank Heaven The life of the Virgin in villainous stained glass barred her vision She was absolutely alone Old Marie and Theophile were not people they were strangers creatures animals what not She scarcely knew Allies meant nothing to her at the moment but marching men Even Edmund who would be killed unless they hid in caves and let their beauty rot in the dark Fool that she had been not to go to England while there was time Fool that she had been to forget that Edmund Laye landing in England would be first of all a Territorial one of the thousands of slim reeds on which Kitchener was so heavily leaning She had been obsessed with peace sure that war could not touch her or what was privately supremely hers She was a creature of peace a little doctrinaire who supposed that in the inverted moral world in which she walked right made might There was a deal of most logical self pity in her tears How did any of it concern her that she should be cooped in a country manor to await horrors from unknown people Why should Edmund Laye who had chosen an antipodal career be dragged back to present himself as a mark for some Prussian shell The senselessness of it angered her Nations meant little to her the cosmos nothing Alone in the chapel she treated herself to a vivid personal rage And still the strange tumult that was more than half made of vibrations too slow for sound waves beat upon her nerves like an injury to the internal ear By twilight the physical need of action came to her She felt in the subtler fibres of her mind that if she stayed longer there half prone in her worm eaten arm chair groveling mentally in this welter of concrete alarms she should sink into a pit whence reason could not rescue her She had been so calm in her folly so lulled by the sense of her sacred detachment from this bloody business so sure that neutrality protected you from fire and steel even in the thickest melee she could not have been more ridiculous if she had worn a dress cut out of the Stars and Stripes Now some obscure inhibition told her she must act She must move her hands and feet limber her cramped muscles set the blood flowing properly in her veins make herself physically normal or her worthless mind would let her go mad She must not think of death or outrage or torture She must forget the things she had heard those first days at Sezanne She must forget the gossip of Marie and Theophile and Seraphine inventing inventing with a mediaeval prolixity and a racial gift for the macabre on chill evenings by the fire They had no need of news They dug up out of the bloody deeps of the past things the like of which she had never expected to hear She must forget shut her staring mouth and forget Whatever visited itself on Andecy must not find a gibbering mistress there Perhaps if she pretended that Edmund knew moment by moment what she was doing she could master her faltering flesh and her undisciplined mind She had lost him forever but she would try to be some of the things he thought her Edmund Laye had called her flower like Well flowers were broken but they did not go mad She must be decent Her brisk pacing of the chapel did not allay her fears but it brought back to her a sense of decorum Her body had never lent itself to an immodest gesture what she caught at the notion could be more immodest than visible fear So gradually by artificial means she brought herself back into some dignity scolding and shaking herself into a trooper s demeanor She could not trust her mind but perhaps she could get her instincts into fighting form Cautiously she tried them as you try a crazy foothold to see if it will bear your weight Her muscles seemed to respond suppleness strength coordination were reported satisfactory She thought she could promise not to fall a shivering again The noise in her ears faded the vibrations ceased to rock her nerves Miss Stanley flung open the chapel door and walked firmly ignoring echoes down the brick paved corridor to the kitchen Marie Theophile and little Jeanne watched in a kind of apathy the pot on the fire In the dim corners of the big kitchen Miss Stanley thought she saw strange figures Inspection revealed a few frightened women and children from farms that had once been dependencies of Andecy Here was something to do more blessed exercise for hands and feet You Francoise and the little ones And you Mathilde and the girl Good It is time the children had food and went to bed We must economize candles so we will all eat here The dining room in half an hour will be a dormitory Jeanne shall sleep in my room Milk and gruel for the little ones Marie and soupe aux choux for the rest of us Milk we will use while we have it Eggs also We cannot expect to keep the livestock forever Bread we have not until I bake it in my own fashion It may come to that Jeanne you will eat with us older ones Come and help me make beds for the children Luckily there are cots for a whole community In half an hour she took out her watch the babies sup and say their prayers To morrow I prepare the chapel and the pupils old dormitory for wounded Wounded there will be if what we hear from Sezanne though they are all fools in Sezanne from the fat mayor down be true My fiance is at the front We wait here for our men hein And she beckoned to Jeanne She had made her speech blindly recklessly planning as she spoke thinking that if she could convince her hearers she could perhaps convince herself She looked for the effect on them when she had done The speech had worked If it worked for them it must work for her too It could not be madness if it had lighted up those sodden faces And as she looked from one to another she saw a flicker of pride of patriotism reflected in their eyes Reflected from what From her without doubt There must have been pride in her voice and glance when she spoke of Edmund Laye Good That was the line to take There should be a brave show she would work her muscles to death to keep it going Every due emotion should be cultivated in each limb and feature every surface inch of skin should play its part The drum and fife should play all the more bravely because her heart was hollow Perhaps if she got a fair start a fine physical impetus toward courage she could keep it up to the end Come Jeanne She beckoned the child The women stirred and the children huddled against their skirts crept out upon the floor Theophile is the great gate locked The old man shook his head vaguely He had gone near to losing his few wits with the rumors from Sezanne which his ears had drunk up so greedily His shaken mind was wandering windily about in reminiscences of seventy and legends of fifteen It had best be locked at once The lantern Jeanne Come The child looked at her piteously Oh very well Miss Stanley pushed her gently aside I shall not need it There is still light enough Fetch the bowls for the babies Jeanne We must all get to bed and be up with the dawn Alone she left the house and crossed the innumerable cobblestones of the huge courtyard to the outer gate She knew the way of the heavy bolts and bars for she had often escorted Theophile on his rounds before the official coucher of the household but her shaking fingers tapped the rusty iron ineffectually She loathed her fingers insubordinate little beasts She struck her right hand smartly with her left her left with her right to punish them with real pain The fingers steadied she drove the foolish antiquated bolts home Something white fluttered about her feet in the twilight the hens had not been shut up Miss Stanley was very angry for a moment with Theophile then angry with herself for her anger Theophile was frightened because he knew seventy had been the moment of his prime She did not know she had no right to be frightened Tales of the Civil War she remembered now had always bored her she had never listened to them Her duty now was to secure the poultry They must have eggs while they could and chicken broth for the children Mathilde s little girl was a weakling So she ran hither and yon trying to drive the silly handful toward the little grange where they were kept With traditional idiocy they resisted and the last stragglers she lifted and imprisoned ruthlessly in her skirt She hated the creatures to touch them made her flesh crawl but at last she got them all in squawking and fastened the door upon them How like the stupid things to make extra trouble because there was a war Her anger against them was quite serious and sank into proper insignificance only when her task was done A stone wall continuing the house wall all the way round bounded the courtyard but through the grille she could see rocket like sputters of flame far off on the horizon and here and there a patch of light in the sky which meant fires burning steadily beneath The pounding vibrations had ceased There was trouble a mighty trouble upon them all and with the dawn perhaps all the things those chattering fools by the fire had spent their phrases on Strangest of all to her was the sudden thought that Edmund separated from her now by the innumerable leagues of destiny might be as the crow flies not so far away A few fatal miles might be replacing even now the friendly familiar ocean whose division of the lovers had been a mere coquetry of Time On that thought she must not dwell besides irony returned to her at last did she not gather from those idiots within that all soldiers one ever saw were Germans One s own armies were routed somewhere but one encountered one s self only the victors ever Then the jealous captain to whom she had given the command reminded her that such reflections meant mutiny Slim straight hollowed out with fear but walking delicately ahead she went back to the house and superintended the babies supper Then the grown ups ate standing about the table as at the Passover faces half averted toward the door and she marshaled them all to their appointed sleeping places Marie and Theophile abdicated their dominion with an uncouth relief If mademoiselle so shy so small could be so sure of what they ought to do doubtless hers was a great brain in a frail form After prayers in which Miss Stanley herself joined borrowing a chapelet they went off to snore peacefully in the guardianship of that great brain so opportunely discovered You have not an American flag old Marie asked as she shuffled off Theophile past any coherent reflections was mumbling over the dying fire No nothing of the sort I am sorry I should use it if I had You could not make one Impossible to night To morrow I will see Marie apologetically offered a last suggestion to the great brain A white flag It would do no harm to have it ready Francoise swears they are in Sezanne to night I will see Allez vous coucher And Miss Stanley turned on her heel and sought the little room where Jeanne was already restlessly dreaming Save the babies Andecy found no deep sleep that night The old people napped and woke and napped again according to their habit The mothers rose and walked beside their children s cots then fell limply back and dozed Miss Stanley slept from sheer exhaustion until an hour before dawn Then she rose and dressed herself and when dressed sent Jeanne to wake her grandparents Whatever the day might bring it should not find them either asleep or fasting They would eat if it was to be their last meal Alone in her room by candle light Miss Stanley made a white flag out of a linen skirt She sewed hastily but firmly that it might be no flimsier than she could help By the first streaks of daylight she groped for and found in a lumber room a long stick to fasten it to probably it flashed across her Madam Francoise de Paule s cane never buried as Anne Marmont had hoped When the flag was finished she loathed it loathed its symbolism loathed its uselessness No whatever happened she would have nothing to do with that What could be more humiliating than to hold up a white flag in vain Another idea came to her and while breakfast was preparing and the children were being dressed she carried it swiftly into execution Slashing a great cross out of a scarlet cape she sewed it firmly to the white ground That she might hang to the dove cot after breakfasting She carried it martially with her into the great kitchen and placed it in a corner The sun itself was hardly up but the children brought the flag out into the firelight and old Marie was jubilant The wonderful idea The great brain of mademoiselle She fussed almost happily over the simmering skillet of milk But the great brain was pondering apart in the lessening shadows Better the American flag if she could manage it She would beg an old blue smock of Theophile s for she had nothing herself Those wretched stars It would take her a long morning and she felt convinced that this day s sun would not rise peacefully to the zenith This thing she had made was a lie Incalculable harm could be done by assuming a badge you had no right to incalculable harm to those who had the right She was mortally afraid but she would not do anything in pure panic That would make it worse for every one in the end An American flag it must be made How many states were there She had no notion but she fancied they were as the sands of the sea It would take a woman all day to cut out those stars and sew them to a blue field hacked out of Theophile s smock And what a makeshift banner in the end Even if the enemy politely waited for her to finish it would they not detect it at once Was not that the kind of thing every German knew better than she how many little silly stars there were safe and far away sending senators to Washington A sullen tide of mirth was let loose in her far below the surface Here she was quivering with terror with a lot of foolish livestock on her hands livestock that she could not give up to slaughter as if they had been the sheep that they really were Miss Stanley caught up one of the children to her lap and fed it great spoonfuls of warm milk choking it hopelessly Luckily the mother was too apathetic to reproach her She could not even feed a child without wetting it all over Disgusted she put the child down again It whimpered and the mother roused moved over to it Miss Stanley looked at her cup Chocolate no coffee for the coffee was gone Coffee might have cleared her brain but this mess would do nothing for her Still she drank it And gradually as their hunger was appeased they crept about her Even those who did not move their chairs turned and faced her She could not meet so many eyes She had nothing to do with them these tellers of old wives tales who expected her to deliver them from the horrors their own lips had fabricated Why did they stare at her as if she might have an idol s power over events Whispering almost inaudibly their strung and beaded prayers yet blasphemously looking to her The shadows still lessened in the great kitchen The sun lay in level streaks on the centre of the stone floor and even the twilight in the corners was big with noon The women sat in a helpless huddle not knowing how to go about the abnormal tasks of the abnormal day The far off thunders of the plain began again vibrations as of earthquake first then explicit sounds unmistakable and portentous To day you could distinguish among those clamors Miss Stanley with the first sounds expected to have a tiny mob to quell but their apathy did not leave them Even the children turned that steady hypnotized stare on her And then Jeanne how could she not have missed Jeanne from the assembly ran down the corridor with a sharp clatter They are there Soldiers on horseback at the gate And indeed now in the sudden tragic hush Miss Stanley could hear the faint metallic thrill and tinkle of iron bars at a distance struck sharply Old Theophile roused himself as if by unconscious antediluvian habit but Marie plucked him back and ran for the flag with the scarlet cloth cross This she thrust into the American girl s hand No one else moved except that Mathilde flung her heavy skirt over her little girl s head For one moment Miss Stanley stood irresolute She had never dreamed of such a tyranny of irrelevant fact She must for life or death for honor at all events respond to a situation for which nothing since her birth had prepared her Peace had been to her as air and sunlight the natural condition of life This was like being flung into a vacuum it was death to her whole organism Yet somehow she was still alive Irony took her by the throat and then the thought of Edmund Laye linked himself with events like these riding or marching beneath just such skies on just such a planet under just such a law Never had there been really immunity like that which she had fancied to be the very condition of human existence It was all human with a wild inclusiveness that took her breath And whatever happened paralysis like that which even now crept slowly up her limbs was of the devil Against that last ignominy she braced herself Her muscles responded miraculously to her call for help and she felt her feet moving across the floor If feet could move hands could She rolled up the little banner and threw it in the very centre of the fire It occurred to her as a last insult that she did not know enough German even to proclaim her nationality but she did not falter again Some residuum of human courage out of the past kept her body loyal some archaic fashion of the flesh that dominated the newness of the mind Past generations squared her shoulders for her and gave her lips a phrase to practice As she passed down the corridor she flung each door wide open She paused a mere fraction of an instant in the big front door of the house but from there she could see only a confusion of helmets and horses nosing at the grille Almost immediately she passed through the door and walked hatless her arms hanging stiffly at her sides across the innumerable cobblestones to the gate IN NO STRANGE LAND BY KATHARINE BUTLER He was in the heart of the crowd in it and of it the crowd of late afternoon whose simultaneous movement is the expression of a common wish to cease to be a crowd His was one of the thousand faces that are almost tragical with weariness tragical without thought At five o clock the sparkle of the morning is forgotten There is no seeking of hidden treasure in the face opposite for the face opposite whosesoever it may be has become too hatefully intrusive with its own burden to yield any light of recognition He was running down the Elevated stairs at the appointed minute when his foot slipped and he fell It seemed hardly a second before he was up again angered by the sudden congestion about him One white cheeked woman put her hand to her mouth and gave a cry Let me by he exclaimed straining to break through the fast pressing barrier The very throng of which he had been an undistinguishable member had suddenly closed round him focusing its Argus glance upon him nearer and nearer and it was only by extreme struggle that he was able to push away and be free He sat down in the train breathless from his final sprint He felt as if the incident had roused him from some deep lethargy of which he had hitherto been unaware With his quickened pulse his thoughts ran more quickly more crystally onward He felt as if a wonderful but unknown piece of luck had befallen him An ecstatic sense of fortune made him wonder at himself What am I so damned happy about all of a sudden he thought He made an indifferent survey of his fellow passengers and as he noted the familiar heads and shoulders he had a most curious sensation of utter bliss and thanked heaven that his lot was not theirs Am I dreaming he asked himself Am I about to discover a gold mine or what As the train moved out he sank comfortably back into his seat and with his chin on his hand he took up his accustomed nightly gaze on the outer landscape His thoughts ran back to the morning He saw the room where he had gone to wake his children It was a large square room with colored nursery pictures on the walls and a collection of battered toys in the corner The place was fresh and cool with the sparkling air of early May and through the open windows he had seen the lawn thick spread with cobwebs And in each of the three small beds a pretty child of his lay stretched in a childish attitude of sleep Very tender they looked very lovable in their naive curlings up a young shapely arm flung out in the restlessness of approaching day lips and nostrils just stirred by the tiny motion of their breathing and an unbelievable blossomy hand spread in fairy gesture across a pillow As he walked through the room he heard the boy John murmur in his waking dreams Alicia sat up suddenly as thin and straight as a new reed in her prim nightgown Her eyelashes were black and her eyes were heather purple Father she had cried I know what day it is And in a moment three small whirlwinds stood up on the floor dropped their nightgowns and began to fling their arms and legs into their morning apparel and there was a great deal of loud conversation full of the presage of festivity Their father had forgotten that he had a birthday until his wife and children had recovered it from obscurity and made it a day of days As he left the house he had looked at Maggie his fragile high hearted wife and urged her not to get tired with the nonsense She had looked back at him with mock haughtiness and warned him not to be late to supper or make light of feast days He did not notice her words he was curiously unable to grow accustomed to her face The more he saw it the more unbelievably beautiful the more eloquent in delicate and gentle meanings it became to him She looked into his eyes quickly with a question for his sudden absent mindedness Because your face is so heavenly he answered reverently As the train moved on he saw that a fresh green haze had begun to veil and adorn the landscape which through the cold months had been so gaunt and ugly to his daily observation The hint of fever was in the air the slight madness that accompanies the pangs of seasonal change Love glowed in his heart and touched all the veins of his body with its winelike warmth its inimitable winelike bouquet Life is sweet Life is sweet his body said echoing and reechoing through all the channels of his being And as the train carried him on through the fields and woods outside the city something almost like the fervor of genius took hold of him plucking at his heart for words crying to him out of the silent fields and woods for words words A slight rain was in the air darkening the twilight when he stepped down from the train He was grateful for the darkness for the soft air on his face grateful indeed for the silence Evening had brought him back to his obscure town a small station marked by one lantern swung in the stiff grasp of an ancient man The usual handful of three or four passengers alighted and exchanging remarks up and down the village street quickly disappeared within the generous portals of their hereditary houses The sound of a door opening and shutting the pleasant light of lamps the brief glimpse of a shining supper table the departing whistle of the train as it shot away through field and thicket and the remote town was undisturbed again He was grateful indeed for the nightly renascence of his spirit in the clear air and gracious heaven of the place On this May night of mist and darkness he took up again the thread of his real existence Only to night it seemed more golden more palpitating with hope and mystery a still moment wherein one could only half distinguish between the future and the past He was thirty years old to day he told himself and he had a wife and three children A short swift time it had been Had he them then or was it a dream Where were his footsteps taking him down the empty street To Babylon or some lost coast of gods and visions He turned a familiar corner A fresh breeze struck his face with a sudden shower of drops and he saw in the dim light the heads of crocuses shaking in the grass beside the walk He flung open the door and heard Maggie s voice in the dining room and the laughter of Alicia Hallo he called and getting no answer he walked into the dining room There was a circle of candles on the table unlighted as yet and a bowl of flowers Maggie was sitting by the fire cracking nuts and telling a story to the children who sat about her in white frocks the firelight on their faces The boy John was staring into the flame with the look that made his mother believe that she had given habitation to a poet s soul and that inspired her to tell the most extravagant tales of wonder that her brain could conjure Vibrant mystery rang in the low monotony of her voice Their father checked himself at the doorway thinking that he had done violence to the etiquette of birthdays by allowing himself to view the preparation He laughed and stepped out again Oh I see you don t want me I really didn t look at a thing And he called back from the stair How soon may I come He heard nothing but the cracking of nuts Maggie s enchanting tone and the short laughter of Alicia O Maggie dear he called again No reply only the soft continuance of the magic tale in the inner room By the way He stepped down a stair By the way Maggie may I see you a second The story had ceased but Maggie neither answered nor came He stepped to the dining room door with a curious sense of apprehension There was a touch of surprise in his tone Maggie She looked round and on her face was the quick and strange reflection of his bewilderment Yet she looked beyond him through him as if he had not been there The boy John was still staring into the fire folded deep in the robe of enthrallment his mother had made As if from the hushed heart of it he said What did you hear mother She gave him a startled glance and then she smiled upon him tenderly warmly Only the wind outside dear child It is a rainy and windy night She looked again toward the door of the room Maggie Such was the sudden torture and fear in his breast he could scarcely lift his voice He put one hand to his head and stepped nearer his wife As if to find tranquillity in a moment of nervousness she rested her soft glance on Alicia the child of delicate hands and delicate thoughts Robbie the importunate youngest leaned against his mother with heavy and troubled eyes I thought I heard something mother he said She bent over him visibly trembling What did you think it was darling she asked I thought it was the rain hitting the window and trying to get in She laughed and rose uneasily from her chair and taking the child in her arms she walked up and down before the friendly fire For a long time there was no sound in the room except the vague sound of wind of flame and of Maggie s footsteps Suddenly Robbie gave a little cry from her shoulder Why doesn t father come The man rushed toward his wife to clasp her and the child in his arms crying O Maggie She sank to her chair trembling and stroking the head of her child with fearful compassion O heavy mystery Is this life he cried or death He stretched out his arms in vain The impassable gulf lay between them Then as he turned away from her the walls of the house grew heavy upon him the fire sent forth a smothering heat and incomprehensible unendurable became the spectacle of human grief He went toward the door Hesitating he looked back again Robbie s face was buried in her breast her eyes were deep and dark with the half guessed truth There came a sound at the door that caused Maggie to start piteously He forgot his desire to be free in his desire to clasp her again and console her She left the children and went unhesitating and pale to answer the summons he hovering beside her What a flower she looked and how fragilely shaken like the rain beaten crocuses in the grass As the door opened he saw two men standing in the dark and wet For a moment neither spoke One looked at the other and broke out You tell her for God s sake This came to him dimly as if he were a thousand miles away He heard no more He had gone out into the wind and rain It struck his breast again with its incomparable sweetness He saw dark hills lying before him Gateways long barred within him rushed open with a sound of singing and triumph He felt no more sorrow no more pity only incredible freedom and joy The stone had been rolled away Death is sweet Death is sweet echoed and reechoed through all the passages of his being He smelt the icy breath of mountains and he knew the vast solitude of the plains of the sea The veins of his body were the great rivers of the earth sparkling in even splendor His head was among the stars he saw the sun and the moon together and the four seasons were marshaled about him The clouds of the sky parted and fell away and across the blue sward of heaven he saw the procession of glowing gracious figures whose broken shadow is cast with such vague majesty across the face of the earth LITTLE BROTHER BY MADELEINE Z DOTY It was a warm summer s day in late August No men were visible in the Belgian hamlet The women reaped in the fields the insects hummed in the dry warm air the house doors stood open On a bed in a room in one of the cottages lay a woman Beside her sat a small boy He was still but alert His eyes followed the buzzing flies With a bit of paper he drove the intruders from the bed His mother slept It was evident from the pale drawn face that she was ill Suddenly the dreaming silent summer day was broken by the sound of clattering hoofs Some one was riding hurriedly through the town The woman moved uneasily Her eyes opened She smiled at the little boy What is it dear The boy went to the window Women were gathering in the street He told his mother and hurried from the room Her eyes grew troubled In a few minutes the child was back breathless and excited O mother mother the Germans are coming The woman braced herself against the shock At first she hardly grasped the news Then her face whitened her body quivered and became convulsed Pain sprang to her eyes driving out fear beads of perspiration stood on her forehead a little animal cry of pain broke from her lips The boy gazed at her paralyzed horrified then he flung himself down beside the bed and seized his mother s hand What is it mother what is it The paroxysm of pain passed the woman s body relaxed her hand reached for the boy s head and stroked it It s all right my son Then as the pain began again Quick sonny bring auntie The boy darted from the room Auntie was the woman doctor of B He found her in the Square The townspeople were wildly excited The Germans were coming But the boy thought only of his mother He tugged at auntie s sleeve His frenzied efforts at last caught her attention She saw he was in need and went with him Agonizing little moans issued from the house as they entered In an instant the midwife understood She wanted to send the boy away but she must have help Who was there to fetch and carry The neighbors terrified at their danger were making plans for departure She let the boy stay Through the succeeding hour a white faced little boy worked manfully His mother s cries wrung his childish heart Why did babies come this way He could not understand Would she die Had his birth given such pain If only she would speak And once as if realizing his necessity his mother did speak It s all right my son it will soon be over That message brought comfort but his heart failed when the end came He rushed to the window and put his little hands tight over his ears It was only for a moment He was needed His mother s moans had ceased and a baby s cry broke the stillness The drama of birth passed the midwife grew restless She became conscious of the outer world There were high excited voices wagons clattered over stones moving day had descended on the town She turned to the window Neighbors with wheelbarrows and carts piled high with household possessions hurried by They beckoned to her For a moment the woman hesitated She looked at the mother on the bed nestling her babe to her breast then the panic of the outside world seized her Quickly she left the room The small boy knelt at his mother s bedside his little face against hers Softly he kissed the pale cheek The boy s heart had become a man s He tried by touch and look to speak his love his sympathy his admiration His mother smiled at him as she soothed the baby glad to be free from pain But presently the shouted order of the departing townspeople reached her ears She stirred uneasily Fear crept into her eyes Passionately she strained her little one to her How soon little son how soon The lad absorbed in his mother had forgotten the Germans With a start he realized the danger His new born manhood took command His father was at the front He must protect his mother and tiny sister His mother was too ill to move but they ought to get away Who had a wagon He hurried to the window but already even the stragglers were far down the road All but three of the horses had been sent to the front Those three were now out of sight with their overloaded wagons The boy stood stupefied and helpless The woman on the bed stirred My son she called My son He went to her You must leave me and go on I can t mother The woman drew the boy down beside her She knew the struggle to come How could she make him understand that his life and the baby s meant more to her than her own Lovingly she stroked the soft cheek It was a grave determined little face with very steady eyes Son dear think of little sister The Germans won t bother with babies There isn t any milk Mother hasn t any for her You must take baby in your strong little arms and run run with her right out of this land into Holland But he could not be persuaded The mother understood that love and a sense of duty held him She gathered the baby in her arms and tried to rise but the overtaxed heart failed and she fell back half fainting The boy brought water and bathed her head until the tired eyes opened Little son it will kill mother if you don t go The boy s shoulders shook He knelt by the bed A sob broke from him Then there came the faint far distant call of the bugle Frantically the mother gathered up her baby and held it out to the boy For mother s sake son for mother In a flash the boy understood His mother had risked her life for the tiny sister She wanted the baby saved more than anything in the world He dashed the tears from his eyes He wound his arms about his mother in a long passionate embrace I ll take her mother I ll get her there safely The bugle grew louder Through the open window on the far distant road could be seen a cloud of dust There was not a moment to lose Stooping the boy caught up the red squirming baby Very tenderly he placed the little body against his breast and buttoned his coat over his burden The sound of marching feet could now be heard Swiftly he ran to the door As he reached the threshold he turned His mother her eyes shining with love and hope was waving a last good bye Down the stairs out the back door and across the fields sped the child Over grass and across streams flew the sure little feet His heart tugged fiercely to go back but that look in his mother s face sustained him He knew the road to Holland it was straight to the north But he kept to the fields He didn t want the baby discovered Mile after mile through hour after hour he pushed on until twilight came He found a little spring and drank thirstily Then he moistened the baby s mouth The little creature was very good Occasionally she uttered a feeble cry but most of the time she slept The boy was intensely weary His feet ached He sat down under a great tree and leaned against it Was it right to keep a baby out all night Ought he to go to some farmhouse If he did would the people take baby away His mother had said Run straight to Holland But Holland was twenty miles away He opened his coat and looked at the tiny creature She slept peacefully The night was very warm He decided to remain where he was It had grown dark The trees and bushes loomed big His heart beat quickly He was glad of the warm soft live little creature in his arms He had come on this journey for his mother but suddenly his boy s heart opened to the tiny clinging thing at his breast His little hand stroked the baby tenderly Then he stooped and softly his lips touched the red wrinkled face Presently his little body relaxed and he slept He had walked eight miles Through the long night the deep sleep of exhaustion held him He lay quite motionless head and shoulders resting against the tree trunk and the new born babe enveloped in the warmth of his body and arms slept also The feeble cry of the child woke him The sun was coming over the horizon and the air was alive with the twitter of birds At first he thought he was at home and had awakened to a long happy summer s day Then the fretful little cries brought back memory with a rush His new born love flooded him Tenderly he laid the little sister down Stretching his stiff and aching body he hurried for water Very carefully he put a few drops in the little mouth and wet the baby s lips with his little brown finger This proved soothing and the cries ceased The tug of the baby s lips on his finger clutched his heart The helpless little thing was hungry and he too was desperately hungry What should he do His mother had spoken of milk He must get milk Again he gathered up his burden and buttoned his coat From the rising ground on which he stood he could see a farmhouse with smoke issuing from its chimney He hurried down to the friendly open door A kindly woman gave him food She recognized him as a little refugee bound for Holland He had some difficulty in concealing the baby but fortunately she did not cry The woman saw that he carried something but when he asked for milk she concluded he had a pet kitten He accepted this explanation Eagerly he took the coveted milk and started on But day old babies do not know how to drink When he dropped milk into the baby s mouth she choked and sputtered He had to be content with moistening her mouth and giving her a milk soaked finger Refreshed by sleep and food the boy set off briskly Holland did not now seem so far off If only his mother were safe Had the Germans been good to her These thoughts pursued and tormented him As before he kept off the beaten track making his way through open meadows and patches of trees But as the day advanced the heat grew intense His feet ached his arms ached and worst of all the baby cried fretfully At noon he came to a little brook sheltered by trees He sat down on the bank and dangled his swollen feet in the cool fresh stream But his tiny sister still cried Suddenly a thought came to him Placing the baby on his knees he undid the towel that enveloped her There had been no time for clothes Then he dipped a dirty pocket handkerchief in the brook and gently sponged the hot restless little body Very tenderly he washed the little arms and legs That successfully accomplished he turned the tiny creature and bathed the small back Evidently this was the proper treatment for the baby grew quiet His heart swelled with pride Reverently he wrapped the towel around the naked little one and administering a few drops of milk again went on All through that long hot afternoon he toiled His footsteps grew slower and slower he covered diminishing distances Frequently he stopped to rest and now the baby had begun again to cry fitfully At one time his strength failed Then he placed the baby under a tree and rising on his knees uttered a prayer O God she s such a little thing help me to get her there Like a benediction came the cool breeze of the sunset hour bringing renewed strength In the afternoon of the following day a wagon stopped before a Belgian Refugee camp in Holland Slowly and stiffly a small boy slid to the ground He had been picked up just over the border by a friendly farmer and driven to camp He was dirty dedraggled and footsore Very kindly the ladies committee received him He was placed at a table and a bowl of hot soup was set before him He ate awkwardly with his left hand His right hand held something beneath his coat which he never for a moment forgot The women tried to get his story but he remained strangely silent His eyes wandered over the room and back to their faces He seemed to be testing them Not for an hour not until there was a faint stirring in his coat did he disclose his burden Then going to her whom he had chosen as most to be trusted he opened his jacket In a dirty towel lay a naked miserably thin three days old baby Mutely holding out the forlorn object the boy begged help Bit by bit they got his story Hurriedly a Belgian Refugee mother was sent for She was told what had happened and she took the baby to her breast Jealously the boy stood guard while his tiny sister had her first real meal But the spark of life was very low For two days the camp concentrated its attention on the tiny creature The boy never left his sister s side But her ordeal had been too great It was only a feeble flicker of life at best and during the third night the little flame went out The boy was utterly crushed He had now but one thought to reach his mother It was impossible to keep the news from him longer He would have gone in search Gently he was told of the skirmish that had destroyed the Belgian hamlet There were no houses or people in the town that had once been his home That is his story ended the friendly little Dutch woman And his father I inquired Killed at the front was the reply I rose to go but I could not get the boy out of my mind What a world What intolerable suffering Was there no way out Then the ever recurring phrase of the French and Belgian soldiers came to me When I had shuddered at ghastly wounds at death at innumerable white crosses on a bloody battlefield invariably in dry cynical hopeless tones the soldier would make one comment C est la guerre que voulez vous WHAT ROAD GOETH HE BY F J LOURIET A smoky lantern suspended from the roof by a piece of spun yarn described intricate curves in the obscurity of the forecastle Black chasms gaped on every side Oil skins and sodden clothing slapped against the walls The air was impure saturated with moisture and vibrant with the muffled roar of the storm outside A thin sheet of water washed over the floor as the ship rolled A sea chest broke from its lashings and carried away to leeward The deck rose and the chest slipped aft amid a raffle of wet boots and sou westers it sank and the heavy chest shot forward across the slippery floor to fetch up sharply against one of the bunks Again the ship rolled and the chest glided to leeward Mutterings came from the chasms and pale faces distorted with yawns appeared above the bunk boards The owner of the chest awoke and crept stiffly from his bunk the ship rolled the water splashed about his feet and the chest swooped toward him He made it fast and climbed into his bunk again without drying his feet The faces had disappeared The ship rose and fell the lantern swung the hanging clothes bulged and flattened and bulged again gloomy shadows wavered and seemed ever threatening to advance from the walls The sound of the storm outside was dull and persistent Boom A solemn stroke of the bell on the forecastle head woke one of the sleepers He sat up expectant for a moment and then sank back As he did so the door slid open the storm bellowed as a man stepped through and was deadened again as he forced the door to behind him He vanished into the starboard forecastle and reappeared with a short pipe that gurgled as he smoked He seated himself on a chest and the man who had awakened looked down on him What time is it he asked The smoker looked up That you Bill It s gone six bells The other grumbled I heard one bell from the fo c s le head She rolled bad just now Tolled the bell herself Humph said the man in the bunk thoughtfully Shut up called a voice I want to sleep Bill lowered his voice How s the weather he inquired looking down anxiously at the smoker s glistening oilskins Heavy The Old Man hain t left the deck for a minute After that the man in the bunk could not sleep again He heard the other leave the forecastle and swear as the flying spray struck his face he heard a great body of water come over the bows and wash aft he heard the heavy breathing about him He lay in his clothing it was wet and his blankets were wet Warm wet anyhow he thought and shivered at the sound of the water washing about in the darkness below him and at the thought of the weather outside He counted the minutes grudgingly and lay dreading the sound of the opening door Wide eyed he watched the lantern swinging in the gloom the pendulous clothing on the wall the starting shadows until some one beat frantically on the door and staggering into the forecastle turned up the light and called the watch A a all hands Eight bells there D ye hear the news you port watch Eight bells there Men stirred and yawned Tired men kicked off blankets and sat up swearing Cramped men eased themselves from their bunks and pulled on sodden boots They stumbled about the heaving deck cursing their cold oilskins cursing the ship cursing the sea Come shake a leg bullies continued the inexorable voice Weather bad an goin to be worse Get a move on you or the mate ll be for ard with a belayin pin Anything up inquired one Heard the Old Man tell the mate to take in the fore lower tops l Thereupon they fell anew to cursing the captain his seamanship and above all his want of knowledge of the weather The watch went out into the tumult of the night out into a chaos of smashing seas and howling wind out into a furious abyss of darkness and uproar They collided blindly with other men they called out angrily Great seas crashed over the bulwarks and smothered them invisible torrents poured off the forecastle head and washed aft beating them down stunning them From somewhere out of the darkness came the voice of the mate bawling orders They felt for the clewlines making the most of the intervals between the boarding seas High above them they knew a man was making his way aloft in the darkness to ease up the chain sheets They hauled and swore arching their backs against the seas that tore at their gripping fingers and washed their feet from under them And always the mate s voice sounded cheerful threatening dauntless Then up into the black night ratline by ratline panting clutching and climbing out upon the invisible yard along invisible foot ropes grasping invisible jack stays swaying in the darkness spat upon by the storm beating the stiff canvas with bleeding hands unheeding the tumult of the sea the pounding wind the lurching yard with no thought save for the mate s voice below and the lashing canvas under their hands From the foretop as they descended they looked far down on the narrow hull rolling pitching and shivering beneath them Out from the darkness pale seas rushed roaring toward the ship and roaring passed to leeward Seething masses of water rose over the bows smashed down on the deck and surged aft forward and over the side Hissing foam creamed about the lee chains vicious rain squalls drove across the flooded decks the cold was penetrating In the empty forecastle the lantern swung the shadows rose and crouched the voice of the storm sounded deep and steady Ends of blankets dangled from the deserted bunks and flicked at the murmuring water on the floor The deck soared and swooped soared and swooped minute after minute hour after hour and still the lantern swung and the shadows moved and waited The door slid back the storm bellowed and three men staggered into the forecastle bearing another They laid him awkwardly in one of the lower bunks and stood for a moment looking down at him The ship rolled and the shadows on the wall started as if they too would gather around that gloomy berth Again the deck dropped the shadows retreated and the three men turned and left the forecastle The man in the bunk lay inert as they had left him His body sagged lumpishly to the roll of the ship A dark stain appeared and spread slowly on the thin pillow A little later another man entered He came to the edge of the bunk and gazed for a few minutes then deliberately removed his dripping oilskin coat and sou wester The man in the bunk began to moan and the other leaned over him The moans continued and the watcher sat down on a chest beside the bunk Soon the sufferer s eyes opened and he spoke What time is it he asked Lie quiet Bill the other cautioned It s gone six bells My head hurts complained Bill He tried to raise it and moaned a little The elder man placed a hand gently on his shoulder Don t you worry he said You got hurted a little when the spar carried away That s all Spar repeated Bill and pondered What watch is it Middle watch I thought I been on deck said Bill It was blowin His hands were groping about Who bandaged my head The steward They carried ye down into the cabin first Want a drink Bill Bill assented and the other bracing himself against the chest lifted the injured man s head slightly and he drank I may as well go to sleep he said and closed his eyes Instantly he reopened them Why ain t you on deck Jansen he asked The Old Man sent me in to sit by you Jansen fingered his long gray beard and the bright eyes under the shaggy brows blinked uneasily You see it s this way Bill You was hurt an the Old Man thought mebbe you d want something He looked at the swinging lantern as if seeking inspiration Anything I can do for ye Bill he asked at last The other stirred I can t move me legs he complained Mebbe the spar hurt your back a little suggested Jansen timidly You remember don t ye Bill Again the injured man pondered Me back s broke he said finally and Jansen nodded Me back s broke an me head s broke Bill went on an there s a pain in me side like Dago knives D ye want another drink asked Jansen It s eight bells an my watch below for me said Bill and again Jansen nodded Silence fell The muffled roar of the storm the plunging forecastle the waiting man on the chest the dim light the swinging lantern the pendulous clothing and the shadows all seemed accessory to the great event about to take place The pain in me side is awful groaned Bill and Jansen shivered The Old Man said he d come for ard as soon as he could leave the poop he said as if hoping there might be comfort in the thought I don t need him gasped the sufferer I m goin I think Old Jansen folded his hands and repeated the Lord s Prayer Then he leaned forward Is is there anybody ashore you d want me to write to he asked No answered Bill between his moans Me mother s dead an there s nobody else that matters I never was no good to any of em After a time the moans ceased A great sea boomed on the deck outside and washed aft The lantern swung violently and the ship s bell tolled Jansen looked into the bunk Bill s eyes were fixed on him I want to ask you Jansen he said in a low voice D ye think there is any chance for me The other hesitated I I m afraid not he stammered I don t mean a chance to live explained Bill I mean d ye think I ve got to go to hell Jansen s tone grew positive No he said I don t I wisht there was a parson here muttered the man in the bunk There used to be a old chap that come regular to the Sailors Home gray whiskers he had an a long coat I wisht he was here He d tell me The man on the chest listened his elbows on his knees his head on his hands I shook hands with him many a time continued Bill He d tell me Jansen started and looked up His bright deep set eyes had taken on a look intent glowing Shall I read to ye a bit he asked I ve got a book it might strike ye now All right said Bill indifferently The old man crossed the forecastle opened his chest and delving deep into its contents brought forth a small thin book It had seen much usage the binding was broken the leaves were stained and torn The old man handled it tenderly He held it high before him that the light from the swinging lantern might fall upon the text and read stumblingly pausing when the light swung too far from him and making grotesque blunders over some of the long words What is that book asked Bill after a time It ain t the Bible No said Jansen It ain t the Bible Then who is it says them things demanded Bill He talks like he was Everything Jansen lowered the book I don t exactly understand what they call him he answered they give him so many names But I reckon nobody but God talks like that whatever they call him Where did you get it the book I mean persisted Bill I was cleanin out a passenger s cabin two voyages back an I found it under the bunk I ve been readin it ever since It s all full o strange forrin names worse n the ones in the Bible Well neither of em stands to help me much commented Bill I ain t never been good I ve been a sailor man That book he broke off to groan as the ship rolled heavily but resumed that book says same as the Bible that a man s got to be pious an do good an have faith an all that else he don t have no show at all Listen said Jansen He turned the pages and read a few lines as impressively as he could That sounds easy said Bill But I ought to ha knowed about that before It s no good desirin anything now It s too late He d know I was doin it just to save my own skin my soul I mean Bill said Jansen I m goin to ask you something He closed the little book over one finger and leaned toward the bunk Do you remember how you come to be hurted this way The spare spar that was lashed to starboard fetched loose an I tried to stop it answered Bill readily I see it comin Why did you try to stop it Well a big sea had just washed the Old Man down in the lee scuppers an if the spar had struck him it would ha killed him It s killed you Bill said Jansen Didn t you think o that Me exclaimed Bill scornfully Who s me But why did you want to save his life insisted Jansen The ship ud stand a likely chance in a blow like this without a skipper wouldn t she Then you thought Thought nothin There was no time to think I see the spar comin an I says Blazes That ll kill the skipper an I tried to stop it You ain t sorry you did it Sorry nothin What s done s done See here Bill said old Jansen earnestly I ll tell you what you did You did your duty An you laid down your life for another You saved the captain s life an mebbe the ship an all our lives through him An you did it without thought o reward Don t you s pose you ll get a little credit for that I m thinkin said Bill He lay silent for a minute Read that again he requested Old Jansen did so and after a pause he added Now if I was you I wouldn t worry no more about hell Just make your mind as easy as you can That s a better way to go I ve got that said Bill It s all right Go on read to me some more Jansen lifted the book and resumed his reading He turned the pages frequently choosing passages with which he was familiar The other moaned at intervals With every roll of the ship water plashed faintly underneath the bunks The lantern swung unwearied and sodden clothing slapped against the walls Dark shadows rose and stooped and rose again as if longing and afraid to peer into the narrow berth The sound of the storm outside was grave and insistent The reader came to the end of a passage and laid the book on his knee Suddenly he realized that the moans had ceased He leaned over and looked at the man in the bunk He was dead Old Jansen sat motionless deep in thought At length he reopened the little book and read once more the lines which he had already repeated at the dying man s request He is not lost thou son of Pritha No Nor earth nor heaven is forfeit even for him Because no heart that holds one right desire Treadeth the road of loss He closed the book and again meditated Later he rose replaced the book in his chest drew the dead man s blanket over his face and went out on deck THE CLEARER SIGHT

none	none	 Noakes leaned over a stand in one of the Maxineff laboratories and looked intently into a crucible while he advanced the lever of a control switch regulating the furnace beneath it 
8699_291107_000003_000001	train-clean-360	He held a steady hand on the lever so that he might push it back instantly if he saw in the crucible too sudden a transformation 
8699_291107_000003_000002	train-clean-360	As he watched the dull saffron powder took on a deeper hue about the edge the body of it remaining unchanged 
none	none	For several minutes he peered with keen intentness at the evil inert little mass 
8699_291107_000003_000004	train-clean-360	No further change appeared 
8699_291107_000003_000005	train-clean-360	He leaned closer over it regardless of the thin choking haze that spread about his face In his attitude there was a rigidity of controlled excitement out of keeping with the seeming harmlessness of the experiment 
8699_291107_000003_000006	train-clean-360	He was as a man attuned to a tremendous hazard anticipation and mental endurance taut all his force focused on one throbbing desire 
none	none	He bent closer and the hand on the lever trembled in nervous premonition 
8699_291107_000003_000008	train-clean-360	The deepened hue touched only the edge following regularly the contour of the vessel it made no advance toward the centre of the substance 
8699_291107_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 It shall Noakes breathed and as if conning an oft repeated formula he said The entire mass should deepen in color regularly and evenly Heat 
none	none	Heat 
8699_291107_000005_000000	train-clean-360	His glance shifted to the control switch under his hand 
8699_291107_000005_000001	train-clean-360	Its metal knobs marking the degrees of intensity of the current it controlled caught the light and blinked like so many small baleful eyes Particularly one that which would be capped next in the orbit of the lever held him fascinated the winking potentiality of it thralled him as the troubled crystal devours the gaze of the Hindu magi 
8699_291107_000006_000000	train-clean-360	He jerked back his head decisively he would increase the current 
8699_291107_000006_000001	train-clean-360	The thought burned before him like a live thing and in the light of it he saw many pictures heliographs of happenings in and about the laboratories flame smoke dense and turgid splintered wood metal hurtling through air bleeding hands lacerated breasts sightless eyes 
8699_291107_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 That s the trouble with high explosives he half groaned 
8699_291107_000008_000000	train-clean-360	He turned away from the stand and went to the single window that lit the room 
8699_291107_000008_000001	train-clean-360	Through it he saw shops store houses and small buildings similar to his own all a part of the plant of Maxineff 
8699_291107_000008_000002	train-clean-360	He thought of each small laboratory as a potential inferno each experimenter a bondman to ecstasy the whole frenzied gasping scheme a furtherance of the fame and power of Henry Maxineff already world known inventor of the deadliest high explosives 
8699_291107_000008_000003	train-clean-360	One of the buildings had been turned into a temporary hospital 
8699_291107_000008_000004	train-clean-360	He thought of the pitiful occupant his face scarred one socket eyeless and shivered 
8699_291107_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 It isn t that I want to hedge he said 
8699_291107_000009_000001	train-clean-360	 I shall take the chance but having risked everything I will go to her able and whole offering it all without an apology 
8699_291107_000010_000000	train-clean-360	His gaze was drawn back to the crucible 
8699_291107_000010_000001	train-clean-360	In the thin haze above it a face seemed to shine 
none	none	Avidly he gave himself to the spell his tight strung imagination had conjured a face oval and delicately tinted lips joyously curved gray eyes not large but brimming with enthusiasm fearlessness and truth a white brow beneath simply arranged light hair
8699_291107_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Let me bring with an avowal all that you have now more for in your life there can t be anything bigger than my love 
8699_291107_000011_000001	train-clean-360	And it s that which makes the deal right 
8699_291107_000011_000002	train-clean-360	Don t judge me yet 
none	none	Wait until I ve finished and grant me that it s worth while 
8699_291107_000012_000000	train-clean-360	He whispered to the face and his breath made little swirls and eddies in the haze about it 
8699_291107_000012_000001	train-clean-360	The filmy curves wafted toward him bringing it close to his lips 
8699_291107_000012_000002	train-clean-360	The lids fluttered 
none	none	Then an acrid odor filled his throat and nostrils 
8699_291107_000012_000004	train-clean-360	The face vanished 
8699_291107_000012_000005	train-clean-360	He started back distraught 
8699_291107_000013_000000	train-clean-360	A rushing recollection of Maxineff s tragedies came to him more vivid even than the face 
8699_291107_000013_000001	train-clean-360	Halsey who jarred the nitro had been annihilated Ewell was mad from the violent termination of an experiment similar to that now in development 
8699_291107_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 A year ago Noakes said and still Ewell lives and raves 
8699_291107_000015_000000	train-clean-360	How alike the cases were 
none	none	The difference lay in the crucible 
8699_291107_000015_000002	train-clean-360	If the mixture there were properly prepared added heat would metamorphose it calmly from its present harmlessness into something new wonderful deadly 
8699_291107_000015_000003	train-clean-360	It would become imbued with marvelous possibility a thing for which royal military bureaus imperial navies would pay a great price 
8699_291107_000016_000000	train-clean-360	A twist of the lever would do it 
8699_291107_000016_000001	train-clean-360	Yet how alike And Ewell was mad injured gruesomely living dead 
8699_291107_000017_000000	train-clean-360	Again the blinking switch caught him but he shrugged away its evil suggestiveness 
8699_291107_000017_000001	train-clean-360	He sought to flee the strain of the moment to make it seem natural and like the smaller risks of his daily occupation 
8699_291107_000017_000002	train-clean-360	He assumed a tottering bravado and as he put his hand to the lever he smiled crookedly 
none	none	A light quick tread sounded on the walk outside on the double step as the knob turned a voice said May I come mister Alchemist 
8699_291107_000019_000000	train-clean-360	His hand left the lever as if it pricked him 
none	none	You
8699_291107_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Am I a wraith 
8699_291107_000022_000000	train-clean-360	Noakes looked at her silently 
8699_291107_000022_000001	train-clean-360	In the moment s abstraction her presence seemed a manifestation of some psychic conduction which he tried lamely to understand here now in a moment of danger of which she unknowingly was the moving force 
8699_291107_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Then exorcise me quickly but don t sprinkle me with acid it would be fatal to my clothes 
8699_291107_000024_000000	train-clean-360	Noakes warmed to the aura of light and cheer about her 
8699_291107_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 There isn t an alkali in the shop I won t endanger you he replied easily 
none	none	She moved into the room and paused a moment near the stand missus 
8699_291107_000027_000001	train-clean-360	Max says you are confining yourself too closely 
8699_291107_000027_000002	train-clean-360	I ve been with her all morning 
8699_291107_000028_000000	train-clean-360	While she spoke she took off her hat and smoothed her hair 
8699_291107_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 I m blown to pieces 
8699_291107_000029_000001	train-clean-360	I drove Cornish this morning he got by everything on the way 
none	none	He acted like a premiere danseuse when I passed the cooper s shop His joy at seeing her was discountenanced by his fear for her and he was afraid of her Her insinuated trust in him threw into murky relief the affair which occupied him When she turned to him a flushed joyful face and gray eyes clear and unsullied it flashed into his soul as formedly as a Mene Tekel that she would unhesitatingly brush out of her life path the dust of doubt that equivocation and willingness to balance motives were no part of her 
8699_291107_000030_000003	train-clean-360	He knew that in her were no dim angles of cross grained purpose no shadowy intersections of the lines of good and evil 
none	none	I say I m blown to wisps couldn t you find me a mirror please What would I do with a mirror here 
8699_291107_000032_000001	train-clean-360	But see 
8699_291107_000079_000002	train-clean-360	He lifted the window sash 
none	none	pulled in one shutter and with a gesture of presentation said As others see us 
8699_291107_000034_000000	train-clean-360	She turned her back while she arranged her hair before the makeshift mirror 
8699_291107_000034_000001	train-clean-360	Relieved from her direct gaze he stepped quickly to the stand and looked into the crucible 
none	none	There was no change 
8699_291107_000034_000003	train-clean-360	He had expected none but he could not be sure 
8699_291107_000034_000004	train-clean-360	Maxineff himself could not be sure of this new mixture 
none	none	A run of the same temperature might bring about the change he looked for as readily as an increase 
8699_291107_000034_000006	train-clean-360	The suspense was unbearable 
8699_291107_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Well Cagliostro she called 
8699_291107_000035_000001	train-clean-360	 You alchemists are capable of the utterest abstraction aren t you 
8699_291107_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Why have you come he said quickly frowning at her 
8699_291107_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 To take you driving with an enticing smile 
8699_291107_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Will you not go 
8699_291107_000038_000001	train-clean-360	Please at once 
8699_291107_000039_000000	train-clean-360	Her manner lost something of its verve 
none	none	It isn t safe you know really he added
8699_291107_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 And won t you come 
8699_291107_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 I cannot not this morning 
8699_291107_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 Well she said with a little sigh as she thrust in her hat pins missus 
8699_291107_000043_000001	train-clean-360	Max will be disappointed 
8699_291107_000043_000002	train-clean-360	On her command I came to break up this seclusion of yours 
none	none	None of us have seen you for
8699_291107_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 A week seven days 
8699_291107_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 What are you doing 
8699_291107_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh I ve been working out some ideas 
8699_291107_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 But you are so quiet about it 
8699_291107_000047_000001	train-clean-360	What are the ideas 
8699_291107_000048_000000	train-clean-360	Noakes hesitated and she laughed merrily as she went toward the door 
8699_291107_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 We laity are hopeless aren t we 
none	none	You are thinking that I couldn t possibly understand
8699_291107_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 No I wasn t because I scarcely understand myself 
none	none	Of course some secret formula mister Max has you on
8699_291107_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 Indeed no he said 
8699_291107_000052_000001	train-clean-360	 mister Max knows nothing about it that is he continued hurriedly it s the sort of thing At any rate I ll soon be through 
8699_291107_000053_000000	train-clean-360	She stood in the doorway outlined against the bright incoming mid daylight her face turned back to him 
8699_291107_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 And then you will come out into the world again 
8699_291107_000054_000001	train-clean-360	missus Max and Cornish and I shall be honored 
8699_291107_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 Then I shall be free 
8699_291107_000056_000000	train-clean-360	He spoke the words with singular feeling 
8699_291107_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 Truly though mister Noakes she said in a straightforward manner you are too busy 
8699_291107_000057_000001	train-clean-360	missus Max says you are to break out break out with the measles if nothing else will interrupt you and you are to have tea with her this afternoon 
8699_291107_000058_000000	train-clean-360	Noakes looked doubtful 
8699_291107_000058_000001	train-clean-360	She went down the steps and turned again 
8699_291107_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh I almost forgot here s a letter for you 
none	none	Where
8699_291107_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 It came in the Maxineffs mail this morning 
8699_291107_000061_000001	train-clean-360	missus Max suggested my bringing it to you 
8699_291107_000062_000000	train-clean-360	Noakes took the long foreign stamped envelope 
8699_291107_000062_000001	train-clean-360	The typed superscription was noncommittal but at the Berlin postmark his eyes narrowed and the knuckles of the hand by his side whitened 
8699_291107_000062_000002	train-clean-360	He drew a quick breath and looked keenly at the girl 
8699_291107_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 Was mister Maxineff at home this morning he asked quietly 
none	none	No I believe he is in the city
8699_291107_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh he breathed 
8699_291107_000065_000001	train-clean-360	 Thank you very much 
8699_291107_000066_000000	train-clean-360	He slipped the letter into his pocket 
8699_291107_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 Well I can t stay any longer 
8699_291107_000068_000000	train-clean-360	Noakes pressed her hand 
8699_291107_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 And Cagliostro when the puzzle s solved come to see me 
8699_291107_000069_000001	train-clean-360	I ll sing away the worries Good bye 
8699_291107_000070_000000	train-clean-360	 Good bye Miss Becky 
8699_291107_000070_000001	train-clean-360	Excuse my untractableness won t you 
none	none	With a pat to her hat and a smile to Noakes she was gone 
8699_291107_000072_000000	train-clean-360	He watched her a moment then strode rapidly to the stand 
8699_291107_000072_000001	train-clean-360	Looking through the faint haze he saw her pass down the straight path which led to the great gate of the Maxineff work yard 
8699_291107_000072_000002	train-clean-360	When she was close to it he grasped the switch lever with cramped fingers 
8699_291107_000072_000003	train-clean-360	His face was colorless He moved the lever forward with a jerk and lifting his eyes saw her pass out of the gate 
8699_291107_000073_000000	train-clean-360	Beyond reach of time he waited 
none	none	Evenly insistently a dull brown suffused the mass 
8699_291107_000073_000002	train-clean-360	Still he waited fearfully wondering at the stability of this new thing 
none	none	It kept its even coloring 
8699_291107_000073_000004	train-clean-360	He pushed back the lever watched again and waited 
none	none	He was afire with joy 
8699_291107_000074_000001	train-clean-360	He had succeeded he had created a thing new to the world an explosive which would be more powerful than the deadliest in existence he had perfected the work of a week s exquisite danger he had won 
8699_291107_000075_000000	train-clean-360	 I am glad glad he said faintly 
8699_291107_000076_000000	train-clean-360	As he straightened up he found himself suddenly weak 
8699_291107_000076_000001	train-clean-360	The strain had been galling and the madness of gratification consumed his strength 
8699_291107_000076_000002	train-clean-360	He moved toward the door stepping very gently for he knew not how slight a vibration might shatter the delicate affinity in his discovery 
8699_291107_000077_000000	train-clean-360	He remembered the foreign letter and taking it from his pocket tore open the envelope 
8699_291107_000078_000000	train-clean-360	He looked through the open door conscious for the first time of the perfectness of the day 
8699_291107_000078_000001	train-clean-360	It was good to be alive he thought free something accomplished with leave to tell a girl 
8699_291107_000079_000000	train-clean-360	A tall man entered the gate and took the walk toward the laboratory Noakes looked at him in a moment of amazement almost of stupefaction The necessity of instant action startled him to movement 
8699_291107_000079_000001	train-clean-360	As quickly as he thought he pushed the door three quarters shut replaced the jars from which he had taken his materials filled a second crucible with a harmless haphazard mixture and placed it over a dead furnace in a stand in the corner behind the door 
none	none	He lifted the window sash 
8699_291107_000079_000003	train-clean-360	With all his strength he hurled his priceless crucible 
8699_291107_000079_000004	train-clean-360	By a marvel of speed he had the sash lowered and was behind the door when the building was shaken by an explosion 
8699_291107_000080_000000	train-clean-360	 What is that mister Noakes came in deep calm tones from the door 
8699_291107_000081_000000	train-clean-360	 Good morning mister Maxineff said Noakes turning slowly 
8699_291107_000081_000001	train-clean-360	 The racket Some half baked fulminate I put in the ditch out there an hour ago 
8699_291107_000082_000000	train-clean-360	 So long since said the older man advancing toward the window 
none	none	Yes sir 
8699_291107_000083_000001	train-clean-360	I think the jarring of the wagon you see leaving the chemical house caused it 
8699_291107_000084_000000	train-clean-360	A hole several feet in diameter marked the spot where the crucible fell The stuff had delayed not an instant in working its havoc 
8699_291107_000084_000001	train-clean-360	Noakes was glad there was too little of it to cause a suspicious deal of damage 
8699_291107_000085_000000	train-clean-360	Maxineff looked reflectively about the yard while Noakes nervously eyed his chief s expressive profile 
8699_291107_000085_000001	train-clean-360	His eyes wandered to the fine gray head of this tall straight man 
8699_291107_000085_000002	train-clean-360	He could not fail to be impressed afresh by the forceful exterior significant of the inner attitude which had won for Henry Maxineff a name honored among nations 
8699_291107_000086_000000	train-clean-360	 What of your work he said 
8699_291107_000087_000000	train-clean-360	Noakes was glad those seeing eyes were not on him 
8699_291107_000088_000000	train-clean-360	 I m beat he said 
8699_291107_000088_000001	train-clean-360	 I ve gone at it every way I know and I have been consistently and finally unsuccessful 
8699_291107_000089_000000	train-clean-360	In the ensuing pause Noakes realized that this was the first admission of failure he had ever made to his chief 
8699_291107_000089_000001	train-clean-360	The surprise it called forth was grateful to him 
8699_291107_000090_000000	train-clean-360	 What s the trouble 
8699_291107_000090_000001	train-clean-360	But I think the trouble with you is that you have overreached yourself Noakes 
8699_291107_000091_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh no the idea is a fine tremendous one 
8699_291107_000091_000001	train-clean-360	Sheer stupidity is my trouble I think 
8699_291107_000092_000000	train-clean-360	His humility seemed real and perhaps the unusualness of it brought a curious expression to Maxineff s face and into his eyes a contemplative light that Noakes did not care to meet 
8699_291107_000093_000000	train-clean-360	 I met Miss Hallam as I entered Maxineff said carelessly 
none	none	The remark may have meant much or it may have had merely an intentional indication of the intimacy accorded Noakes above the other assistants in the laboratories Yes 
8699_291107_000095_000001	train-clean-360	She came to tell me that missus Max will permit me to have tea with her this afternoon 
8699_291107_000096_000000	train-clean-360	 You are coming I hope 
none	none	Indeed yes I confess I am tired out I gave up the experiment early this morning 
8699_291107_000097_000003	train-clean-360	I understood the fulminate was running low and spent my morning blundering over making some 
8699_291107_000097_000004	train-clean-360	I couldn t do that even familiar as I am with the process 
8699_291107_000098_000000	train-clean-360	 Well leave it all and come with me over the yard 
8699_291107_000098_000001	train-clean-360	I am inspecting this morning 
8699_291107_000098_000002	train-clean-360	Be my secretary for a while 
8699_291107_000099_000000	train-clean-360	Five o clock had passed when they emerged upon the New England town s stolid main street 
8699_291107_000099_000001	train-clean-360	They walked beneath the venerable flanking trees toward the Maxineff villa which surmounted a wooded continuation of the street 
8699_291107_000100_000000	train-clean-360	In a high gray and white room they found missus Maxineff 
8699_291107_000100_000001	train-clean-360	She touched a bell as she said in an odd manner of inflecting But you are late 
8699_291107_000101_000000	train-clean-360	Moving to one end of the spindle legged sofa she made place at her side for Maxineff and motioned Noakes to a chair near them 
8699_291107_000102_000000	train-clean-360	 Ah I see it you will be a second Max all science all absence and a woman waiting at home 
8699_291107_000102_000001	train-clean-360	Immolation you call it she continued her hands moving quickly among the appurtenances of the tea table That is what you prefer my young mister Noakes 
none	none	I am under orders you know missus Max said Noakes with a deferential inclination of the head toward Maxineff 
8699_291107_000104_000000	train-clean-360	A servant brought in buttered rusks and served the men with tea 
none	none	Orders For orders do you permit circles about your eyes as dark as they themselves are 
8699_291107_000105_000002	train-clean-360	Then you are easily immolate 
8699_291107_000106_000000	train-clean-360	Over his cup Maxineff smiled encouragement to his wife 
8699_291107_000107_000000	train-clean-360	 You are practical my friend 
8699_291107_000107_000001	train-clean-360	Confess now there is a reason for your your application 
8699_291107_000108_000000	train-clean-360	Noakes s attitude was uncompromising 
8699_291107_000108_000001	train-clean-360	He placed his cup on the table before he spoke 
none	none	The reason you are thinking of missus Max is not for a poor man missus Maxineff lifted her shoulders and displayed her palms in a manner that marked her nationality
8699_291107_000111_000000	train-clean-360	 So Science has made your dark skin white love for this business of killing men has kept you hid a week 
8699_291107_000112_000000	train-clean-360	 Of saving men Maxineff corrected while his wife smiled as at the recurrence of a customary witticism 
8699_291107_000113_000000	train-clean-360	 And you gave the orders Max 
8699_291107_000113_000001	train-clean-360	You are to be blamed for this display of energy 
8699_291107_000114_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t scold dear 
8699_291107_000114_000001	train-clean-360	It will be a wonderful thing 
8699_291107_000115_000000	train-clean-360	 A new explosive she interrupted 
8699_291107_000116_000000	train-clean-360	 Do you remember the day we motored from Stoneham 
8699_291107_000116_000001	train-clean-360	I first thought of it then 
none	none	I have been too busy to work on it so I turned the idea over to Noakes
8699_291107_000117_000000	train-clean-360	 And I have made application to a home for the feeble minded missus Max Noakes said 
8699_291107_000117_000001	train-clean-360	 mister Max will never commission me again 
8699_291107_000118_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll be with you to morrow and we shall see wherein is the difficulty 
8699_291107_000119_000000	train-clean-360	 But Max another 
8699_291107_000119_000001	train-clean-360	Now I see your scheme of universal peace quite puffed away 
8699_291107_000120_000000	train-clean-360	 This will bring it nearer Maxineff said enthusiastically 
none	none	missus Maxineff shrugged her shoulders as she walked toward the long windows
8699_291107_000122_000000	train-clean-360	 Stay to dinner will you she said to Noakes 
8699_291107_000123_000000	train-clean-360	 Thanks but I couldn t with propriety 
8699_291107_000123_000001	train-clean-360	I forgot to have luncheon to day and your tea has given me a keen anticipation for dinner my zest would be embarrassing to you and past my control 
8699_291107_000123_000002	train-clean-360	Besides I shall take a half mile walk to night 
8699_291107_000124_000000	train-clean-360	 Lucky Becky 
8699_291107_000124_000001	train-clean-360	Then come again soon 
8699_291107_000124_000002	train-clean-360	Max dear she said turning to her husband I cannot hear that again 
8699_291107_000124_000003	train-clean-360	I shall be on the porch 
none	none	When she passed through the window Noakes seated himself to listen to a new exposition of the subject which chiefly aroused Maxineff s interest and loosed his speech 
8699_291107_000125_000001	train-clean-360	Frequently he bent his head in acquiescence and occasionally interjected a pertinent question under the guidance of his secondary mind but his thoughts moved in a circle of smaller radius 
8699_291107_000126_000000	train-clean-360	What to him was a policy of world peace 
none	none	He cared not a jot what scheme of universal pacification men dreamed over 
8699_291107_000126_000002	train-clean-360	Maxineff s argument was not new to him when he gave it serious attention he doubted its practicability 
8699_291107_000127_000000	train-clean-360	The older man s voice seemed far away as it said Each new explosive deals a blow at war war 
8699_291107_000128_000000	train-clean-360	Noakes had heard the same thing when his chief concluded with the government an agreement which secured to it the exclusive use of his latest product 
none	none	This new thing will make war too dreadful a course for the least humanitarian nation to pursue That the variance of nations tends toward equilibrium is incontrovertible 
8699_291107_000129_000002	train-clean-360	Granted then 
8699_291107_000130_000000	train-clean-360	Noakes was practical 
8699_291107_000130_000001	train-clean-360	He placed before himself a definite goal 
8699_291107_000130_000002	train-clean-360	He exerted every power to attain it and used the means at his disposal 
8699_291107_000130_000003	train-clean-360	If he encompassed it he put it to the use for which it was intended 
8699_291107_000130_000004	train-clean-360	He gave no thought to the extraneous influence it exerted on other phases upon which his life touched 
8699_291107_000130_000005	train-clean-360	He had made a great discovery not a fortunate accident like that of the man who discovered nitro 
8699_291107_000130_000006	train-clean-360	With great danger to himself he had followed a line of reasoning to its proximate end the resulting discovery he would use to his individual advantage He did not accord to himself the godlike privilege of casting discord among the nations and he did not care what peaceful zoo the lion the bear and the various species of eagle found as common refuge 
none	none	On the other hand if to each is given coextensive power The voice slipped away as Noakes humorously wondered why Maxineff had never been a delegate to a Peace conference 
8699_291107_000132_000000	train-clean-360	The great man s argument was advanced step by step 
8699_291107_000132_000001	train-clean-360	The light faded Secure in the dusk Noakes no longer maintained a semblance of attention 
none	none	He weighed the chances of the present and actualized his long time dreams 
8699_291107_000133_000000	train-clean-360	A servant clicked soft light from the wall and removed the tea table 
8699_291107_000281_000001	train-clean-360	Noakes rose 
8699_291107_000134_000000	train-clean-360	Noakes rose uttered a commonplace and bade his chief good night 
8699_291107_000135_000000	train-clean-360	Soon he was descending the village street keeping pace with his rapid thoughts 
8699_291107_000136_000000	train-clean-360	From the exchange he dispatched a messenger to the house a half mile away 
8699_291107_000137_000000	train-clean-360	He dressed quickly the while reading repeatedly his foreign letter When dressed he sat on the bed chin in his palms and looked at the blank bedroom wall 
none	none	A frown hung between his brows 
8699_291107_000137_000002	train-clean-360	Later he sat before the shelves in his study absently scanning the backs of the books 
none	none	When When he said aloud 
8699_291107_000139_000000	train-clean-360	In the morning Maxineff would come to search for that which he had found 
8699_291107_000139_000001	train-clean-360	He might be there for weeks from morning till night 
8699_291107_000139_000002	train-clean-360	In that case the work must be delayed and misguided 
8699_291107_000139_000003	train-clean-360	The proportions were finely calculated the method could not be bettered 
8699_291107_000139_000004	train-clean-360	He could duplicate it in an hour 
8699_291107_000139_000005	train-clean-360	If only he could repeat the experiment before 
8699_291107_000140_000000	train-clean-360	 To night he said and left the room with a firm step 
none	none	He dined well though with few words for the kindly lady in whose home he lived 
8699_291107_000142_000000	train-clean-360	He took the path by the side of the road which led in the opposite direction from the Maxineff place 
8699_291107_000142_000001	train-clean-360	He lit his first pipe since morning How good life was 
8699_291107_000142_000002	train-clean-360	The town the plant Maxineff were all behind him Ahead was a goal toward which he bore with increasing lightness of heart 
8699_291107_000142_000003	train-clean-360	Clearly defined decisions unregretted faded into the brightness of anticipation 
8699_291107_000142_000004	train-clean-360	His pack of problems dropped from him 
8699_291107_000142_000005	train-clean-360	One day more and he could speak one evening of companionable friendship 
8699_291107_000143_000000	train-clean-360	Her yard was a gnomish alternation of unsullied light and alluring shade 
none	none	The moon utilized impartially natural and artificial features of landscape as detail for the picture of gray black and silver 
8699_291107_000143_000002	train-clean-360	Noakes traversed less rapidly the curved driveway pausing where it was cut by a paved way to the door 
none	none	Through a window he saw her seated on the piano bench her head bent forward her mellow tinted hair coiled low She was singing softly 
8699_291107_000145_000000	train-clean-360	She came to the door to meet him 
8699_291107_000146_000000	train-clean-360	 Will duty call you back before you have been with me just a little while she asked as they entered the room 
8699_291107_000147_000000	train-clean-360	 No duty has lost her voice at present 
8699_291107_000148_000000	train-clean-360	She dropped into a big arm chair 
8699_291107_000148_000001	train-clean-360	He turned his back to the light and sat facing her 
none	none	What have you been doing this week
8699_291107_000150_000000	train-clean-360	 Singing mostly 
8699_291107_000151_000000	train-clean-360	 Sing now please 
8699_291107_000152_000000	train-clean-360	 No let s talk first 
8699_291107_000153_000000	train-clean-360	 Well how did Cornish behave on your way back 
8699_291107_000154_000000	train-clean-360	 Quite as well as if you had been with us Noakes 
8699_291107_000155_000000	train-clean-360	He leaned forward quickly 
8699_291107_000156_000000	train-clean-360	 Do you know that s the first time you ve called me Noakes 
8699_291107_000157_000000	train-clean-360	 It slipped 
8699_291107_000157_000001	train-clean-360	missus Max says it you know I am weak about taking on colloquialisms 
none	none	And you are sorry you have been so easily influenced Noakes asked in ponderous aggrievement
8699_291107_000159_000000	train-clean-360	 You do not seem to be overjoyed 
8699_291107_000160_000000	train-clean-360	 I am he said gently 
8699_291107_000161_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t be hilarious over it 
8699_291107_000162_000000	train-clean-360	 I will I wish 
8699_291107_000163_000000	train-clean-360	 Well certainly Noakes it shall be 
8699_291107_000164_000000	train-clean-360	 Thanks Miss Beck 
8699_291107_000165_000000	train-clean-360	 Haven t you done anything but work these days 
8699_291107_000166_000000	train-clean-360	 I have thought more or less 
8699_291107_000167_000000	train-clean-360	 Strange what about 
none	none	You of course Steady 
8699_291107_000169_000001	train-clean-360	Spring has passed 
8699_291107_000170_000000	train-clean-360	 And to night I heard a queer thing about you 
8699_291107_000171_000000	train-clean-360	 What she asked in an engaging manner of invitation to confidence 
8699_291107_000172_000000	train-clean-360	 That you are to be married 
8699_291107_000172_000001	train-clean-360	I have it on the word of my landlady 
8699_291107_000174_000000	train-clean-360	 So it is rumored in the village 
8699_291107_000175_000000	train-clean-360	 I am glad my family is not so anxious to thrust me off as my friends are 
none	none	And you are unwilling to be thrust off as you put it Married No not unwilling unprepared 
8699_291107_000177_000002	train-clean-360	It is so very final you know A woman gives up everything 
none	none	Not necessarily
8699_291107_000179_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh yes she does freedom family associations 
8699_291107_000180_000000	train-clean-360	 And in return 
8699_291107_000181_000000	train-clean-360	 From the right man she gets a sort of compensation 
none	none	Not a high valuation
8699_291107_000183_000000	train-clean-360	 A true one she knows she cares more than he does 
8699_291107_000184_000000	train-clean-360	 No no Noakes spoke from a full heart 
8699_291107_000185_000000	train-clean-360	 She does and knowing it she need not expect equal return only part compensation 
8699_291107_000185_000001	train-clean-360	But how good he ought to be 
8699_291107_000186_000000	train-clean-360	 Good he asked doubtfully 
none	none	Yes everything she thinks he is No man loved of woman is that
8699_291107_000189_000000	train-clean-360	 Noakes you are disillusioning and incorrect and moreover traitorous to your kind 
8699_291107_000190_000000	train-clean-360	 Not a bit of it you overpraise my kind 
8699_291107_000191_000000	train-clean-360	 But let s be definite you know he may be all 
8699_291107_000192_000000	train-clean-360	 And may not always have been in which connection he may not be expected to enlighten the dreaming lady may he 
8699_291107_000193_000000	train-clean-360	 I think he may 
8699_291107_000194_000000	train-clean-360	 But he may possess a certain masculine trait a kind of secretiveness 
8699_291107_000195_000000	train-clean-360	 Secretive she mused 
8699_291107_000195_000001	train-clean-360	 Then he is a bit of a coward I think 
8699_291107_000196_000000	train-clean-360	 He would be a cad Noakes said quickly to tell her things that would pain her 
none	none	Understanding will come sooner or later she said oracularly
8699_291107_000197_000001	train-clean-360	 It is better to become accustomed to a thing than have it come as a revelation 
8699_291107_000198_000000	train-clean-360	 I see Noakes said like taking a tonic in midwinter to fend off spring fever 
8699_291107_000198_000001	train-clean-360	You forget he continued in a different tone looking at her speculatively that understanding may never come 
8699_291107_000199_000000	train-clean-360	 Then he has put her on a lower intellectual plane he has withheld from her as he might from a child 
8699_291107_000200_000000	train-clean-360	 No he has loved her too well to hurt her 
8699_291107_000201_000000	train-clean-360	 Loved her so ill that he has deceived her from the beginning 
8699_291107_000202_000000	train-clean-360	 To my mind there is something active in deception this would be rather an omission 
none	none	An omission that is an insult to her
8699_291107_000204_000000	train-clean-360	 Not at all Noakes spoke somewhat vehemently 
8699_291107_000205_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t think I mean she said that there should be a detailed interchange of trivial confidence 
8699_291107_000205_000001	train-clean-360	That would be tiresome 
8699_291107_000205_000002	train-clean-360	If however there were one big thing in his life that might influence her feeling toward him he should tell it and let her judge 
8699_291107_000206_000000	train-clean-360	 Not smooth over a disagreeable occurrence 
none	none	Never 
8699_291107_000207_000001	train-clean-360	It would be cruel 
8699_291107_000208_000000	train-clean-360	Noakes sat very still 
8699_291107_000209_000000	train-clean-360	 If I were the girl she began and checked the speech with a faint laugh 
8699_291107_000209_000001	train-clean-360	 But we will not be dramatic nor personal 
8699_291107_000210_000000	train-clean-360	Noakes told himself he had always known that this was her thought she was too clear hearted to feel anything else 
8699_291107_000210_000001	train-clean-360	The understanding of which she had half seriously spoken must never come and the only means of avoiding it was to night s silence the silence of all the days to follow 
none	none	He foresaw the revelation which might come and realized that any abnegation was worthless except the sacrifice of his love 
8699_291107_000210_000003	train-clean-360	Alive aware of its possible fulfillment he could not condemn himself to the sacrifice 
8699_291107_000210_000004	train-clean-360	She had not asked it of him and he would not face that which she might ask if he obeyed the weak voice which counseled a surrender to her judgment 
8699_291107_000210_000005	train-clean-360	To the last intoxicating drop he would drink in reverent loving thankfulness for the draught vouchsafed him 
8699_291107_000210_000006	train-clean-360	He would care not in fearful accumulation of credit against a day of reckoning but in surrender to the brimming abundance of their store 
8699_291107_000210_000007	train-clean-360	He would secure to her freedom from that possible pain by following the inevitable trend 
8699_291107_000211_000000	train-clean-360	His regard was a compelling force with which he had lived and grown since he had known Becky 
8699_291107_000211_000001	train-clean-360	He had not spoken of it to her silenced by the piteous bane of insufficient income but now almost he was free When he spoke the breadth and depth of the thing it was would induce her assent 
none	none	Of this he was so sure that he did not consider the possibility of refusal 
8699_291107_000211_000003	train-clean-360	His failure to anticipate such a chance was by no means due to an under estimation of her powers of will determination or selection rather to the feeling which with the beat of his heart knocked for freedom to go out out about the world and with its sweeping lines converged again to enter and permeate a heart attuned to reception and response 
8699_291107_000212_000000	train-clean-360	He sat beside her on the piano bench and placed before her the songs he liked best 
8699_291107_000213_000000	train-clean-360	Her voice was a pure soprano of an expressive sweetness which affected Noakes as nothing else he had known 
8699_291107_000213_000001	train-clean-360	It seemed to him that her clarity of soul found expression in her exquisitely pure singing tones 
8699_291107_000214_000000	train-clean-360	With hands tight clasped between his knees fearing to look at her Noakes listened while she sang him into a half visualized dream as obsessing as it was immanent which he clung to and enjoyed to the full in order that he might ignore the longing then to speak his thought 
8699_291107_000214_000001	train-clean-360	His dream keyed him to a responsiveness which made his throat throb in sympathy with the vibration of her tones 
8699_291107_000215_000000	train-clean-360	Presently he went away 
8699_291107_000216_000000	train-clean-360	Alone in the silver splotched yard the spell yet held him but when the white road pointed a way back to what he had left behind a fog of uncertainty encircled him dissipating the glow of his dream checking his anticipation crushing his problem close to him in the narrow circle of his vision so close that although a thing solved and set aside it loomed ominous and insistent 
8699_291107_000217_000000	train-clean-360	He followed the road back to what he had left behind 
8699_291107_000218_000000	train-clean-360	In the laboratory Noakes bent over a crucible 
8699_291107_000218_000001	train-clean-360	The room was still 
none	none	Not even the night sounds penetrated the shut door and closed window The light from a single bulb played upon the set lines of his jaw and upon the still hand which lay on the switch lever 
8699_291107_000218_000004	train-clean-360	He drew a deep breath that quivered through the room with startling distinctness 
8699_291107_000218_000005	train-clean-360	He bent closer to the tiny quantity of powder in the bottom of the vessel 
8699_291107_000219_000000	train-clean-360	Suddenly he stood erect and looked about him 
8699_291107_000219_000001	train-clean-360	His glance slowly circled the room and fell to the hand on the switch lever 
8699_291107_000219_000002	train-clean-360	Then he advanced the lever 
8699_291107_000220_000000	train-clean-360	It came as a burst of light taken up and radiated by clouds of fume and gas with which the air was instantly impregnated 
none	none	Around Noakes was a white hot brilliance which he could not face and could not escape 
8699_291107_000220_000002	train-clean-360	His eyes pained horribly 
8699_291107_000220_000003	train-clean-360	He heard a crescendo roaring as of a billow breaking on the shore as suddenly as it had come the light went out He was in darkness 
8699_291107_000220_000004	train-clean-360	He trained his gaze into the void and succeeded only in augmenting the pain back of his eyes 
8699_291107_000220_000005	train-clean-360	The darkness was impenetrable He began to realize what had happened 
8699_291107_000220_000006	train-clean-360	With a low moan he crumpled and sank to the floor 
8699_291107_000221_000000	train-clean-360	Late in the afternoon of the next day behind a livery horse two men were covering the roadway between town and the Hallam place 
8699_291107_000221_000001	train-clean-360	To one the way seemed long 
8699_291107_000221_000002	train-clean-360	He leaned back wearily and pulled a soft hat down over his bandaged eyes 
8699_291107_000222_000000	train-clean-360	 Where are we he asked 
8699_291107_000223_000000	train-clean-360	 At the gate the driver replied 
8699_291107_000224_000000	train-clean-360	Noakes stiffened 
8699_291107_000224_000001	train-clean-360	The gate closed behind them and the wheels rumbled on the driveway 
8699_291107_000225_000000	train-clean-360	 Is is any one in front 
8699_291107_000226_000000	train-clean-360	 Miss Hallam is on the porch sir 
8699_291107_000227_000000	train-clean-360	The vehicle came to a stop 
8699_291107_000228_000000	train-clean-360	 Afternoon Miss Beck Noakes called 
8699_291107_000229_000000	train-clean-360	He tried to make it sound pleasant and commonplace and knew that he failed 
8699_291107_000230_000000	train-clean-360	Grasping the side of the vehicle he descended clumsily 
8699_291107_000231_000000	train-clean-360	Becky took his hand and pressed it warmly 
8699_291107_000231_000001	train-clean-360	She turned and took a step toward the house still holding his hand 
8699_291107_000231_000002	train-clean-360	He withdrew it 
8699_291107_000232_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t please I know the way 
8699_291107_000233_000000	train-clean-360	With the shuffling tread of the blind he ascended the walk stopping uncertainly at the foot of the steps 
8699_291107_000233_000001	train-clean-360	He heard Becky at his side draw a quick breath as if about to speak 
none	none	He half turned to her and hearing nothing more mounted the steps heavily
8699_291107_000234_000000	train-clean-360	 Do you know he said as he paused at the top I ve never counted these steps before 
8699_291107_000234_000001	train-clean-360	I didn t know there were so many 
8699_291107_000234_000002	train-clean-360	Let s sit inside if you don t mind 
none	none	He went a little way and Becky put her hand on his arm
8699_291107_000236_000000	train-clean-360	 It s this way Noakes she said gently as she guided him into the room in which they were the night before 
none	none	Thank you 
8699_291107_000237_000001	train-clean-360	It s a bit hard to be led Noakes said huskily 
8699_291107_000238_000000	train-clean-360	They sat on a deep couch 
8699_291107_000239_000000	train-clean-360	 Noakes was it wise to come 
8699_291107_000239_000001	train-clean-360	I am glad you are here but won t it hurt you retard your recovery Becky asked anxiously 
8699_291107_000240_000000	train-clean-360	 I had to come 
8699_291107_000241_000000	train-clean-360	 mister Max told me both he and the doctor telephoned me early this morning that in spite of all they said to you you insisted on coming 
8699_291107_000242_000000	train-clean-360	 I am fit sound except for my eyes that s the shame of it he said bitterly 
8699_291107_000242_000001	train-clean-360	 They couldn t persuade me that I should rest now rest to recover from a shock that will last a lifetime 
8699_291107_000243_000000	train-clean-360	 I thought I was afraid you might add fresh danger by coming out so soon 
none	none	I tell you I had to come he said with level forcefulness
8699_291107_000244_000001	train-clean-360	 As for my eyes the harm is done 
8699_291107_000245_000000	train-clean-360	 Is it irremediable 
none	none	I am blind
8699_291107_000247_000000	train-clean-360	 But soon some day surely 
none	none	No 
8699_291107_000248_000001	train-clean-360	The doctor gives me banalities for answers 
8699_291107_000248_000002	train-clean-360	I suppose he thinks I would go to pieces if he told me the truth 
8699_291107_000249_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes perhaps he thinks you could not bear the truth Becky assented very gently 
8699_291107_000250_000000	train-clean-360	Her low feeling tones brought a lump to Noakes s throat 
8699_291107_000250_000001	train-clean-360	He felt the sympathy which quivered in her voice and it nearly unmanned him but he misunderstood her meaning 
8699_291107_000250_000002	train-clean-360	He thought that she felt with him the sting of being deprived of full knowledge of his condition the hurt of their doubting his strength 
8699_291107_000250_000003	train-clean-360	That Becky meant something far different he might have known from her humble acquiescence and the sudden touch of her hand on his arm 
none	none	I ve been trying to think it out Noakes said his voice low at first roughening and increasing in volume as he spoke but here I am unweakened in mind and body and put aside Not to see never to see for myself the beautiful things about me shut out from everything with power to do and ability to appreciate yet put out in darkness never to O Becky you I can t ever see you again Don t You mustn t please
8699_291107_000253_000000	train-clean-360	 I didn t intend to speak so to you 
8699_291107_000253_000001	train-clean-360	I haven t the right 
8699_291107_000253_000002	train-clean-360	You must pardon me He was silent a moment 
8699_291107_000253_000003	train-clean-360	 I came to say something else 
8699_291107_000254_000000	train-clean-360	He turned his head about impatiently calling upon his bandaged eyes to perform their function 
8699_291107_000255_000000	train-clean-360	 Is it dark yet he asked 
8699_291107_000256_000000	train-clean-360	 We are in the gloaming Becky answered softly 
8699_291107_000257_000000	train-clean-360	Noakes shut his lips taking counsel of his powers of control before he spoke 
8699_291107_000258_000000	train-clean-360	 Becky he began and gave a tired little sigh 
8699_291107_000258_000001	train-clean-360	 Let me call you Becky to day 
8699_291107_000259_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes she acquiesced quietly 
8699_291107_000260_000000	train-clean-360	 Becky he continued lingering over the word thinking of the privilege of its use as an accolade conferred by her you need not speak when I have finished I ll go away then 
8699_291107_000261_000000	train-clean-360	 What is it Becky asked 
none	none	Tell me 
8699_291107_000262_000000	train-clean-360	Noakes leaned forward pressing his temples then sat erect and turned his face toward her 
8699_291107_000263_000000	train-clean-360	 I love you he said 
none	none	I think it has been through more lifetimes than this I know I shall always love you 
8699_291107_000263_000002	train-clean-360	I could no more grow away from it than I could add a cubit to my stature by taking thought 
8699_291107_000263_000003	train-clean-360	I kept silent because I was poor 
8699_291107_000263_000004	train-clean-360	Don t think of this as a bit of sordidness creeping in 
8699_291107_000263_000005	train-clean-360	My love would not ask of you any sacrifice 
8699_291107_000263_000006	train-clean-360	I could not give you the things you are accustomed to so I said nothing 
8699_291107_000263_000007	train-clean-360	I planned and worked for a time when I would be privileged to speak 
8699_291107_000264_000000	train-clean-360	He heard an inarticulate sound at his side and quickly continued 
8699_291107_000265_000000	train-clean-360	 Last night I thought the time was close at hand 
8699_291107_000265_000001	train-clean-360	I thought in a few days I could come to you and ask you for your love 
8699_291107_000265_000002	train-clean-360	Success of a certain kind was about to crown an effort of a despicable kind 
8699_291107_000265_000003	train-clean-360	Of that I must tell you 
8699_291107_000265_000004	train-clean-360	To night I am confessing a wrong I have done you That s what it is 
8699_291107_000265_000005	train-clean-360	O Becky the explosion last night took away my sight made me a useless blind man but it opened my eyes too 
8699_291107_000265_000006	train-clean-360	It is as if a scroll were outspread before me on which is a record of all my tendencies and crucial acts 
8699_291107_000265_000007	train-clean-360	I can see my failures at the crises of my life and I can trace them back to causes can see wherein a lightly taken determination has later borne bitter fruit 
8699_291107_000265_000008	train-clean-360	Last night I thought I had reached the pinnacle of attainment in reality I had fallen lower than ever before 
8699_291107_000265_000009	train-clean-360	The success which was to be the beginning of all good things was stolen 
8699_291107_000265_000010	train-clean-360	I robbed Maxineff of it 
8699_291107_000265_000011	train-clean-360	He gave me an idea to work out 
8699_291107_000265_000012	train-clean-360	I followed his instructions to a point where I knew a different treatment might bring about a fine result 
8699_291107_000265_000013	train-clean-360	I saw great possibilities in the experiment and determined to keep for myself the benefits of it From that point I followed my own ideas and called the thing mine 
8699_291107_000265_000014	train-clean-360	I opened correspondence with the representatives of a foreign government They agreed to buy the secret in case of a successful test 
8699_291107_000265_000015	train-clean-360	It was an excellent bargain I made I put a high price on the betrayal of my benefactor 
8699_291107_000265_000016	train-clean-360	The experiment was successful 
8699_291107_000265_000017	train-clean-360	I was forced to destroy the result why it is needless to say 
8699_291107_000265_000018	train-clean-360	Last night when I left you I went back to repeat the experiment intending to make a small quantity to be used in the test which would have taken place to morrow 
8699_291107_000265_000019	train-clean-360	Something went wrong with the unstable stuff and you know the rest 
8699_291107_000266_000000	train-clean-360	In relief from the tension of his confession his voice dropped lower as he said Now you know me 
8699_291107_000267_000000	train-clean-360	He shifted his position stretching out his hands toward her 
8699_291107_000267_000001	train-clean-360	He touched her face started and drew back 
8699_291107_000268_000000	train-clean-360	 And Becky do you realize that it was after I left you last night that I went back 
8699_291107_000268_000001	train-clean-360	After what you told me 
8699_291107_000268_000002	train-clean-360	O Becky I am glad I cannot see you now 
8699_291107_000269_000000	train-clean-360	His voice quivered off to a whisper 
8699_291107_000270_000000	train-clean-360	 It is poor consolation that I know myself for what you judge me 
8699_291107_000270_000001	train-clean-360	I know bitterly well I see much now 
8699_291107_000270_000002	train-clean-360	I could not come to the weakest agreement with the self I want to be until I had told you of the wrong I have done you 
8699_291107_000270_000003	train-clean-360	And let me think my love is not distasteful to you 
none	none	I know I am past your caring for and I ll never ask it of you but let me keep on loving you 
8699_291107_000270_000005	train-clean-360	Won t you Becky 
8699_291107_000271_000000	train-clean-360	He paused and listened 
8699_291107_000271_000001	train-clean-360	He heard Becky s uneven breathing 
8699_291107_000272_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t offer any excuse there is none to offer 
8699_291107_000272_000001	train-clean-360	I want only the comparative peace of the assurance that those I have wronged understand now 
8699_291107_000272_000002	train-clean-360	I have talked with mister Maxineff 
8699_291107_000272_000003	train-clean-360	He was with me afterwards when the pain He hushed me far too gently but he will not forget 
none	none	You will not forget either Becky and you will not excuse 
8699_291107_000272_000005	train-clean-360	If though you should ask me why I would say again I love you 
8699_291107_000272_000006	train-clean-360	It is the only reason I was thinking of you while I was making myself unfit for you to think of me 
8699_291107_000273_000000	train-clean-360	 Do you care so much Becky asked softly 
none	none	Yes 
8699_291107_000274_000001	train-clean-360	May I keep on caring

8699_291107_000276_000000	train-clean-360	 For the sake of the little good in me which love of you will keep alive and growing 
8699_291107_000277_000000	train-clean-360	 You ask nothing of me 
8699_291107_000277_000001	train-clean-360	What will you find in caring for me 
8699_291107_000278_000000	train-clean-360	 There will be a constant joy in knowing that you permit me to care 
8699_291107_000279_000000	train-clean-360	Becky was silent 
8699_291107_000280_000000	train-clean-360	 If you won t let me I am afraid it will make no difference because I cannot help it you know 
8699_291107_000280_000001	train-clean-360	I don t want to help it you don t mind my saying so 
8699_291107_000281_000000	train-clean-360	For a moment neither of them spoke 
none	none	Noakes rose
8699_291107_000282_000000	train-clean-360	 I Becky I thank you for hearing me out 
none	none	He went a step away from her I m going 
8699_291107_000285_000000	train-clean-360	She did not rise 
none	none	I am glad you have not spoken of my my mistake and somehow I am sorry I know what you

8699_291107_000291_000000	train-clean-360	 But I don t want you to go she said softly 
8699_291107_000292_000000	train-clean-360	Something in her tone made Noakes turn sharply 
none	none	Becky
8699_291107_000294_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes Noakes 
none	none	You don t Yes
8699_291107_000297_000000	train-clean-360	 You love me and blind

8699_291107_000299_000000	train-clean-360	Her hands were in his when he sat by her side 
8699_291107_000300_000000	train-clean-360	 I talked with the doctor this morning she said 
8699_291107_000301_000000	train-clean-360	 As I did

8699_291107_000302_000001	train-clean-360	He gave me a message for you 
8699_291107_000303_000000	train-clean-360	 A message from the doctor 
8699_291107_000304_000000	train-clean-360	 It was mister Max s notion that I should tell you 
8699_291107_000305_000000	train-clean-360	 What is it Noakes asked quickly 
8699_291107_000306_000000	train-clean-360	 Your eyes they will be well in time if you are very careful 
8699_291107_000307_000000	train-clean-360	As Noakes breathed deep in relief and gratitude one of his hands engaged two of Becky s and he found a different use for the other 
8699_291107_000308_000000	train-clean-360	 Noakes Becky said I ll take care of the eyes 
none	none	THE GARDEN OF MEMORIES BY C A MERCER The garden looked dreary and desolate in spite of the afternoon sunshine The lilac and lavender bushes were past their prime their wealth of sweetness had been squandered by riotous offshoots The wind played among the branches and cast changing sun flecked shadows on the grass grown paths narrowed by the encroachment of the box borders that had once lined the way with the stiff precision of troops before a royal progress The flowers had the air of being overburdened with the monotony of their existence They could never have had that aspect if they had been only wild flowers and had never experienced human care and companionship That made the difference The gate hung on rusty hinges it answered with a long drawn out creaking as it was pushed open by a man who had been a stranger to the place for nearly twenty years Yes the garden was certainly smaller than it had been pictured by his memory There had been a time when it had appeared as a domain of extensive proportions and the wood beyond of marvelous depth and density He was conscious of a sense of disappointment The property would scarcely realize as high a price in the market as he had hoped and it was incumbent upon him to part with it if he would be released from the narrow circumstances that hemmed him in He had arranged to meet the lawyer there that afternoon One of the latter s clients had already made a bid for the estate The timber at all events would add to the value The house faced southward upon the garden It was here the man had been brought up by an old great aunt He guessed later that she had grudged him any of the endearments that death had denied her bestowing upon her own children Her affections had all been buried before he was born Besides he took after the wrong branch of the family She must have possessed a strong personality It was difficult to bring to mind that it was no longer an existent force Every one from the parson to the servants had stood a little in awe of her He remembered the unmoved manner in which she had received the news of the death of a near relative It had overwhelmed him with a sudden chill that so she would have received tidings of his own It had taken all the sunshine in the garden to make him warm again In the mood that was growing upon him it would not have much surprised him to find her sitting bolt upright in her carved high back chair as she had sat in the time of his earliest recollections the thin yellow hands on which the rings stood out folded in her lap On one occasion she had washed his small hands between hers The hard lustre of the stones acquired a painful association with the ordeal The blinds would be partially drawn in the musk scented parlor to save the carpet from further fading for there had been a tradition of thrift in the family from the time of its settlement a tradition that had not been maintained by its latest representative Like the atmosphere of a dream the years grew dim and misty between now and the time when summer days were longer and sunnier and it had been counted to him for righteousness if he had amused himself quietly and not given trouble A stream that he had once dignified with the name of river formed a boundary between the garden and the wood Although it had shrunk into shallow insignificance with much beside a faint halo of the romance with which he had endued this early scene of his adventures still clung to the spot As he came to the stream he saw the reflection of a face in the water not his own but that of one much younger It was so he met the boy The child had been placing stepping stones to bridge the stream and now came across balancing himself on the slippery surfaces to test his work It was odd that he had remained unobserved until this moment but that was due to the fact of the water rushes on the brink being as tall as he The boy s eyes met those of the man with a frank unclouded gaze He did not appear astonished That is the way when one is young enough to be continually viewing fresh wonders one takes everything for granted He saw at a glance that this other was not alien to him his instinct remained almost as true as those of the wild nature around For his own part he had an unmistakable air of possession about him He appeared to belong to the place as much as the hollyhocks and honeysuckle and yet how could that be Probably a child of the caretaker the man told himself He had authorized the agent to do what was best about keeping the house in order He had not noticed what signs it had to show of habitation Now he saw from the distance that it had not the unoccupied appearance he had expected of it nor the windows the dark vacant stare of those that no life behind illumines Do you live here he asked of the boy Yes The boy turned proudly toward the modest gray pile in the manner of introducing it forgetting himself in his subject It s a very old house There s a picture over the bureau in the parlor of the man who built it and planted the trees in the wood Hannah says Hannah It was a foolish repetition of the name Of course there were other Hannahs in the world The old servant of that name who had told the man stories in his boyhood had been dead more years than the child could number Yes don t you know Hannah She ll come and call me in presently and then you ll see her Hannah says they the trees have grown up with the family he assumed a queer importance evidently in unconscious mimicry of the one who had repeated the tradition to him and that with them the house will stand or fall Do you think the roots really reach so far There was an underlying uneasiness in the tone which it was impossible altogether to disguise As the other expressed his inability to volunteer an opinion on this point the boy went on seeing that his confidences were treated with due respect I dug up one myself once I wished I hadn t afterwards to make myself a Christmas tree like I d read about I just had to hang some old things I had on it It was only a tiny fir small enough to go in a flower pot but that night the house shook and the windows rattled as if all the trees in the forest were trying to get in I heard them tapping their boughs ever so angrily against the pane As soon as it was light I went out and planted the Christmas tree again I hadn t meant to keep it out of the ground long they might have known that Have you no playfellows here The boy gave a comprehensive glance around There are the trees they are good fellows I wouldn t part with one of them It s fine to hear them all clap their hands when we are all jolly together There are nests in them too and squirrels We see a lot of one another This statement was not difficult to believe the Holland overalls bore evident traces of fellowship with mossy trunks The boy did most of the talking He had more to tell of the founder of the family whose portrait hung in the parlor and of how when he the child grew up he rather thought of writing books as that same ancestor had done and making the name great and famous again He had not decided what kind of books he should write yet Was it very hard to find words to rhyme if one tried poetry He was at no pains to hide such fancies and ambitions of which his kind are generally too sensitive or too ashamed to speak to their elders and which are as a rule forgotten as soon as outgrown Shall we go in the wood now said the boy It s easy enough to cross over the stepping stones Yes let us go The man was beginning to see everything through the boy s eyes The garden was again much as he had remembered it inclosed in a world of beautiful mystery Nothing was really altered What alteration he had imagined had been merely a transitory one in himself The child had put a warm eager hand into his together they went into the wood as happy as a pair of truant school boys they might have been friends of long standing So this is your enchanted forest said the man Not really enchanted replied the boy seriously I once read of one but of course it was only in a fairy tale That one vanished as soon as one spoke the right word It would be a very wrong word that could make this vanish He had a way of speaking of the wood as if it were some sacred grove His companion suddenly felt guilty not quite knowing why Of course some one might cut them down The boy lowered his voice it seemed shameful to mention the perpetration of such a deed aloud It would be terrible to hear them groan when the axe struck them The young ones mightn t mind so much but it would be bad for the grandfather trees who ve been here from the beginning Hannah says one would still hear them wailing on stormy nights Even if they had been felled and carted away Yes even then though to be sure there would be no one to hear the wailing if it s true that the house must fall too at the same time But we needn t trouble about that none of it is likely to happen You see if it did where should I be He laughed merrily This last argument appeared to him to be quite conclusive Such an important consideration placed the awful contingency quite out of the question and transformed it into nothing more than a joke The child s laughter died away as they both stood still to listen Each thought he had heard his own name called It s Hannah said the boy and off he raced toward the house barely saving himself from running into the arms of another person who had turned in at the gate Who was the boy who ran round by the espaliers a minute ago One would scarcely have judged him to be a child of the caretaker The man s heart sank with a dull thud something had told him the answer before it came Child The lawyer looked puzzled I did not see one No children have any business in this garden neither is there any caretaker here The house has been shut up altogether since the old servant you called Hannah died eleven years ago They had reached the veranda The westering sun had faded off the windows It was easy to see that the house was empty The shutters were up within and the panes dark and weather stained Birds had built their nests undisturbed about the chimney stacks The hearthstones had long been cold My client is willing to purchase the property on the terms originally proposed the lawyer was saying He contemplates investing in it as a building site Of course the timber would have to be felled A breeze passed through the treetops like a shudder The younger man interposed I am sorry you should have had the trouble of coming here but I have decided to keep the old place after all stick and stone It is not right it should go out of the family I must pull my affairs together as well as I can without that The little phantom of his dead boyhood was to suffer no eviction THE CLEAREST VOICE BY MARGARET SHERWOOD The little business frown which John Wareham usually wore only at his office and put off as he put on his hat in starting for home lingered that evening persisting through the long street car ride the walk past rows of suburban houses and even to the brook at the foot of the hill below his home Here it vanished for the brook marked the spot where the world stopped and Alice began He watched with a meditative happy smile the rough stone fence which bordered this bit of meadow land with the trailing woodbine and clematis that made it a thing of beauty and as he climbed the hill the deepening color in the sunset clouds and the notes of a wood thrush from the forest edge not far away became part of a deep sense of harmony breaking a mood of anxiety and fear Then came the comforting glimpse of the red brick house through the encompassing green with its white daintiness of porch fan window and window facings It all looked like her in its serene and simple distinction it seemed to embody her her creative touch was everywhere The bay window about which they had disagreed when the house was planned had surprisingly turned out to the liking of both As he fumbled at the latch of the gate and pinched his finger as he always did a vexed sense of triumph came to him for it surely would have worked better if he had insisted on having his own way Everywhere were traces of little worries and little triumphs the latter predominating It was the very soul of home from the threshold to the branches of the tall elm which touched the roof protectingly it was wholly desirable and it might have to go As he followed the brick walk in bitterness he closed his eyes that he might not see and so ran into a porch pillar the one on which Alice s red roses were blossoming the queer little groan that he gave in some strange way took on the sound of Railroads and again Railroads as he beat his head against the pillar once or twice purposely and his voice had a note of contempt He had not felt that way about railroads when he had invested his savings partly in the stock of a new railroad in the West partly in the stock of an old railroad in the East that was doing wild things in the way of improvements Then there had been nothing too good for him to say about the earning power of railroads the wise management of railroads the net profits of railroads Now both railroads were in trouble dividends were cut and the stock which he had hoped to sell at a profit had dropped almost to zero the mortgage loan on his house was due in a month and he a man earning only a moderate salary in a real estate office had nothing in the world wherewith to meet the emergency Even the savings bank deposit had gone into railroad stock in order that the mortgage might be paid off more quickly But his face lighted up with a smile both sad and bright which made quite a different face of it as he crossed the threshold that threshold on which Alice had stopped to kiss him the day he had married her and brought her home There was something here that shut out all the trouble in the universe about the doorway his wife s laughter seemed to be always floating that laughter merry touched with tenderness made up of mirth and sorrow as all wise laughter is Just then came little Jack to meet him speeding madly down the baluster and John as he picked up his boy kissed him and reproved him for coming downstairs that way had nothing to answer when his son averred that it was lots better than a railroad save That might well be There s ice cream for dinner the boy exploded and the father roughly smoothing Jack s tousled hair started as he caught a sound of chatter from the living room and stood still in dismay That to day of all days should be the time of the family gathering which brought two uncles two aunts and three cousins to the house How completely he had forgotten He hung up his hat and grasped little Jack s hand he would tell them nothing about his troubles nothing he would be the ideal host concealing his personal vexations under a cordial smile But hardly had he opened the door with his office bag still held absent mindedly in his hand when they were upon him The cordial smile did not deceive them for a minute Aunt Janet who was sitting by the fireplace looked the most troubled of all though she said nothing It was Why John what s the matter from Aunt Mary and Well John how goes it from Uncle Philip who looked as if he knew that it went very badly indeed and What makes you look so worried With a home like this no man ought to look worried from his Cousin Austin who had recently become engaged and was thinking about homes He nodded approvingly at the room which was simply furnished soft in coloring with English chintzes a few pictures of trees and of water all out of door things and a fireplace that showed signs of constant use John s face brightened as he caught this look of admiration not all the confusion of greeting and inquiries in regard to health not all the business worries in the world could check the sense of peace that always came to him in entering this room which more perfectly than any other spot expressed the personality of Alice He managed to make his way through the little crowd of sympathetic wrinkled faces and wondering smooth faces There were it was discovered comfortable chairs enough for all and John found himself as host the centre of a little group bent on probing his affairs in friendly fashion to the bottom It was his sister Emily who finally started the flood of questioning that led to the betrayal of the secret he had meant to keep for the present She came bustling in through the door leading to the dining room looking anxious as soon as she glanced at her brother and from the brass bowl of yellow roses held unsteadily in her hand a few drops spattered to the floor Are you ill John she asked or have you lost Among all the many voices of inquiry comment question whereby she was interrupted the voice of Alice was the clearest making the others no matter how near the speakers stood seem to come from far away Little Jack came and climbed upon his father s knee a curious reproduction of the family look of worry appearing on his chubby face John the elder leaned his head back in the chintz covered chair shutting his eyes for a minute with a sense of warmth and satisfaction and the nearness of the cuddling body of his son Everything s the matter he said wearily everything and he had a momentary twinge of conscience realizing that he was not being the ideal host They all watched him anxiously sympathetically in silence and Aunt Mary near the window went on drawing her needle in and out with exquisite precision her gray head bent over a centrepiece which she intended to present to the house Oh no I m not ill said John Wareham suddenly sitting upright but the Long Gorge Railroad has gone into a receiver s hands and three days ago the New York and Nineveh cut its dividend I m done for Emily gave a little gasp and said nothing You will pull through all right asserted Uncle Philip stirring up the fire in order to hide his face And Cousin Austin slapped John s shoulder saying facetiously Take courage Jeremiah The worst is yet to come John laughed in spite of himself and struck his fist upon the knee not occupied by Jack Every dollar I had in the world I had drawn out and put into those two cursed things Now I ve nothing no capital no credit The place has got to go No no cried the women folk The place has got to go repeated John Wareham his face in little Jack s hair And I feel as if I could rob a bank or a jewelry store to prevent that Jack burst into a delighted giggle through which John heard You wouldn t do any such thing and you mustn t talk that way before Jack It was Alice who spoke with a little catch in her voice that sometimes came half way between a laugh and a sob and it was echoed by the two aunts Railroads growled John with supreme contempt It would have been a great deal better if railroads had never been invented Jack we shall have to get a prairie schooner and trek to the West Jack s eyes shone like stars but he got no chance to say anything for with that outburst the springs of speech were loosened There was the clamor the chorus clamor of relatives indignant inquisitive sympathetic relatives all eager to help and all uneasily conscious that their own small measure of prosperity would hardly stand the strain He shook his head sadly in answer to the inquiry as to whether he could not borrow he had no security Aunt Mary did not fail to remind him that she had warned him at the time Aunt Janet in a thin but affectionate voice admitted that she had suffered in the same way heavily And then the clock ticked through a brief silence Why don t you read your letters asked Emily suddenly She stood absent mindedly arranging the flowers with one finger busy already with plans for the future There was a small pile of letters on the centre table quite within John s reach he began tearing open the envelopes in mechanical fashion throwing them untidily upon the floor As each one fell Jack slid down and picked it up climbing back to his father s knee One was a wedding announcement one was a plumber s bill at the third John paused read looked up bewildered and read again Why Emily he exploded boyishly This can t be Read that will you and tell me if I have lost my mind Emily put down the roses and read the letter slowly wonderingly smiling even as her brother had smiled Not Uncle John And we were always so afraid of him Twenty thousand dollars murmured John Open mouthed silence waited upon them until Cousin Austin broke the spell with I say would you mind if I looked over your shoulder And John flung him the letter with a little whoop of joy Is this plain living or is this a fairy story he demanded quizzically I never thought of myself as a dark eyed hero with a fortune dropping into my hands just in the nick of time A title ought to go with it The vibrant energy of the man was back again the dry humor which in sunny seasons quivered about his mouth was once more there the mocking incredulity of his words belied the growing look of peace and security in his face The years seemed slipping from him bringing him a mellow boyhood Twenty thousand dollars isn t exactly a fortune John It will buy the place twice over exulted the man and we shan t have to start for the West in a prairie schooner right away Shan t we papa asked little Jack in hungry disappointment But the child s shrill voice had little chance where everybody was speaking at once Aunt Mary s Well I hope you hang on to this and not be foolish again and Cousin Austin s You deserve it John and Uncle Howard s Well I am glad Shake and several other congratulatory remarks all came at once The poor old fellow the poor old fellow said John to himself softly rubbing his hands I suppose he died out in Oklahoma all alone How he happened to will this to me I give up he didn t like me very well The very atmosphere of the room had changed once more a feeling of quiet pleasure pervaded it The full sense of home peace security came back with a suggestion of a kettle singing on the hearth though there was no kettle nearer than the kitchen But there s Frank It must have been Alice who suggested this and a something disturbing questioning crept into the air Frank said John Wareham suddenly Why I d forgotten all about Frank We haven t heard of him for more than fifteen years or so have we More than that answered Emily He was in Mexico the last we knew He may be living suggested John Mexico is always in such a state I suppose the mails can t be trusted We ought to find out said Alice Uncle John had cast him off suggested Emily tentatively anxiously But he was Uncle John s own son said Alice earnestly compellingly and wasn t Uncle John in the wrong Uncle John was a queer customer said John hastily He was cranky no doubt about it but he wasn t crazy and if this lawyer s statement is correct I ve got a good legal right to the twenty thousand haven t I Of course you have said Aunt Mary But the moral right whispered Alice What was the quarrel about anyway asked Austin Frank s marriage wasn t it I never heard much about it That was part of it said Aunt Janet Frank you know fell in love with a little country girl whom his father did not want him to marry but he insisted on having his way and married her Good for him nodded Austin approvingly Little Jack glancing from one to another with wide blue eyes was silently weaving his philosophy of life and his interpretation of humanity Religion was mixed up in it in some way contributed John Uncle grew to be something of a fanatic and he wanted them both to believe what he believed and they wouldn t or didn t or couldn t It was incompatibility of temper all round I dare say Frank was a good son reminded Alice He was patient with his father and he all but gave up his life for Uncle John nursing him through diphtheria More and more the sweet persistent voice brought trouble and question into the atmosphere from which trouble and question had so suddenly cleared The new security began to seem unstable the new found joy a stolen thing Even in the pauses the personality of the woman spoke from curtain and cushion and fireplace of this room of her devising She dominated the whole seeming the only presence there brother and sister and guests shrank in the radiance of her Do you really think I ought to hunt Frank up asked the man Emily shook her head but doubtfully You probably couldn t find him after all these years I could try admitted John Nonsense cried Aunt Mary over her embroidery You stay right where you are and pay off your mortgage A man who has worked as hard as you have and has had as much trouble ought to take a bit of good luck when it comes Think how much good you could do with it murmured Aunt Janet As the pickpocket said when he put the stolen dime in the collection plate said Austin but fortunately Aunt Janet did not understand Uncle had a right to do what he pleased with his own said John defiantly If he chose to cast off his son for reasons which he considered sufficient he had the right But you cannot cast off your son persisted Alice John we have a boy of our own You know that the obligation is one of all eternity you cannot get rid of fatherhood O papa papa you hurt me squealed little John suddenly interrupted in his philosophy weaving Confound it all cried John with sudden irritation Isn t this just like life To hold out the rope just to grab it away again with a grin I won t I say What is mine is mine But it isn t yours Did Frank have any children he asked Several I believe admitted Emily reluctantly And he never got on He never got on And the twenty thousand might save their pesky little Mexican souls The child s laughter rippled out across the shocked silence of the elders Maybe Uncle John left them something suggested Emily For a man who tried such big things this doesn t seem much money Her brother shook his head The entire sum of which he stands possessed he read from the lawyer s letter You might make a few inquiries through the post I rather imagine the Mexican mail service isn t very trustworthy suggested Aunt Mary hopefully He looked at her but in abstracted fashion as if it were not to Aunt Mary that he was listening I ll write to this Oklahoma lawyer and then I must go to Mexico Isn t it a little quixotic It s most likely all kinds of foolishness like everything else I do groaned the man But it s what I d want done for my little chap if I were dead and he alive and I had quarreled with him I suppose I could keep this money and save my skin but You couldn t keep it without finding out murmured Alice because you are you and the real you is incapable of doing a mean thing You must do as you think best said Emily at last Maybe if you find Frank he won t want it all but will divide knowing that his father willed it to you That may be as it may be said the man leaning back in his chair with the face of one listening But I go to Mexico It s a queer game we play here and I ll be dashed if I can understand it but I m going to play it as fairly as I know how So the voice of Alice won of Alice who had been dead for five long years THE MARBLE CHILD BY E NESBIT All over the pavement of the church spread the exaggerated cross hatching of the old pews oak a Smithfield market of intersecting lines such as children made with cards in the old days when kings and knaves had fat legs bulging above their serviceable feet and queens had skirts to their gowns and were not cut across their royal middles by mirrors reflecting only the bedizened torso of them and the charge heart trefoil or the like in the right hand top corner of the oblong that framed them The pew had qualities tall fat hassocks red cushions a comparative seclusion and in the case of the affluent red curtains drawn at sermon time The child wearied by the spectacle of a plump divine in black gown and Geneva bands thumping the pulpit cushions in the madness of incomprehensible oratory surrendered his ears to the noise of intonations which in his own treble would have earned the reprimand Naughty temper His eyes however were through some oversight of the gods of his universe still his own They found their own pasture not to be sure the argent and sable of gown and bands still less the gules of flushed denunciatory gills There is fair pasture in an old church which when Norman work was broken down men loved and built again as from the heart with pillars and arches which to their rude time symbolized all that the heart desires to materialize in symbolic stone The fretted tombs where the effigies of warrior and priest lay life like in dead marble the fretted canopies that brooded above their rest Tall pillars like the trunks of the pine woods that smelt so sweet the marvel of the timbered roof turned upside down it would be like a ship And what could be easier than to turn it upside down Imagination shrank bashfully from the pulpit already tightly tenanted but the triforium was plainly and beautifully empty there one could walk squeezing happily through the deep thin arches and treading carefully by the unguarded narrow ledge Only if one played too long in the roof aunts nudged and urgent whispers insisted that one must not look about like that in church When this moment came it came always as a crisis foreseen half dreaded half longed for After that the child kept his eyes lowered and looked only at the faded red hassocks from which the straw bulged and in brief guarded intimate moments at the other child The other child was kneeling always whether the congregation knelt or stood or sat Its hands were clasped Its face was raised but its back bowed under a weight the weight of the font for the other child was of marble and knelt always in the church Sundays and week days There had been once three marble figures holding up the shallow basin but two had crumbled or been broken away and now it seemed that the whole weight of the superimposed marble rested on those slender shoulders The child who was not marble was sorry for the other He must be very tired The child who was not marble his name was Ernest that child of weary eyes and bored brain pitied the marble boy while he envied him I suppose he doesn t really feel if he s stone he said That s what they mean by the stony hearted tyrant But if he does feel How jolly it would be if he could come out and sit in my pew or if I could creep under the font beside him If he would move a little there would be just room for me The first time that Ernest ever saw the marble child move was on the hottest Sunday in the year The walk across the fields had been a breathless penance the ground burned the soles of Ernest s feet as red hot ploughshares the feet of the saints The corn was cut and stood in stiff yellow stooks and the shadows were very black The sky was light except in the west beyond the pine trees where blue black clouds were piled Like witches feather beds said Aunt Harriet shaking out the folds of her lace shawl Not before the child dear whispered Aunt Emmeline Ernest heard her of course It was always like that as soon as any one spoke about anything interesting Aunt Emmeline intervened Ernest walked along very melancholy in his starched frill The dust had whitened his strapped shoes and there was a wrinkle in one of his white socks Pull it up child pull it up said Aunt Jessie and shielded from the world by the vast silk veiled crinolines of three full sized aunts he pulled it up On the way to church and indeed in all walks abroad you held the hand of an aunt the circumferent crinolines made the holding an arm s length business very tiring Ernest was always glad when in the porch the hand was dropped It was just as the porch was reached that the first lonely roll of thunder broke over the hills I knew it said Aunt Jessie in triumph but you would wear your blue silk There was no more thunder till after the second lesson which was hardly ever as interesting as the first Ernest thought The marble child looked more tired than usual and Ernest lost himself in a dream game where both of them got out from prison and played hide and seek among the tombstones Then the thunder cracked deafeningly right over the church Ernest forgot to stand up and even the clergyman waited till it died away It was a most exciting service well worth coming to church for and afterwards people crowded in the wide porch and wondered whether it would clear and wished they had brought their umbrellas Some went back and sat in their pews till the servants should have had time to go home and return with umbrellas and cloaks The more impetuous made clumsy rushes between the showers bonnets bent skirts held well up Many a Sunday dress was ruined that day many a bonnet fell from best to second best And it was when Aunt Jessie whispered to him to sit still and be a good boy and learn a hymn that he looked to the marble child with Isn t it a shame in his heart and his eyes and the marble child looked back Never mind it will soon be over and held out its marble hands Ernest saw them come toward him reaching well beyond the rim of the basin under which they had always till now stayed Oh said Ernest quite out loud and dropping the hymn book held out his hands or began to hold them out For before he had done more than sketch the gesture he remembered that marble does not move and that one must not be silly All the same marble had moved Also Ernest had spoken out loud in church Unspeakable disgrace He was taken home in conscious ignominy treading in all the puddles to distract his mind from his condition He was put to bed early as a punishment instead of sitting up and learning his catechism under the charge of one of the maids while the aunts went to evening church This while it was terrible to Ernest was in the nature of a reprieve to the housemaid who found means to modify her own consequent loneliness Far away whispers and laughs from the back or kitchen windows assured Ernest that the front or polite side of the house was unguarded He got up simulated the appearance of the completely dressed and went down the carpeted stairs through the rosewood furnished drawing room rose scented and still as a deathbed and so out through the French windows to the lawn where already the beginnings of dew lay softly His going out had no definite aim It was simply an act of rebellion such as secure from observation the timid may achieve a demonstration akin to putting the tongue out behind people s backs Having got himself out on the lawn he made haste to hide in the shrubbery disheartened by a baffling consciousness of the futility of safe revenges What is the tongue put out behind the back of the enemy without the applause of some admirer The red rays of the setting sun made splendor in the dripping shrubbery I wish I hadn t said Ernest But it seemed silly to go back now just to go out and to go back So he went farther into the shrubbery and got out at the other side where the shrubbery slopes down into the wood and it was nearly dark there so nearly that the child felt more alone than ever And then quite suddenly he was not alone Hands parted the hazels and a face he knew looked out from between them He knew the face and yet the child he saw was not any of the children he knew Well said the child with the face he knew I ve been watching you What did you come out for I was put to bed Do you not like it Not when it s for punishment If you ll go back now said the strange child I ll come and play with you after you re asleep You daren t Suppose the aunts catch you They won t said the child shaking its head and laughing I ll race you to the house Ernest ran He won the race For the other child was not there at all when he reached the house How odd he said But he was tired and there was thunder again and it was beginning to rain large spots as big as pennies on the step of the French window So he went back to bed too sleepy to worry about the question of where he had seen the child before and only a little disappointed because his revenge had been so brief and inadequate Then he fell asleep and dreamed that the marble child had crept out from under the font and that he and it were playing hide and seek among the pews in the gallery at church It was a delightful dream and lasted all night and when he woke he knew that the child he had seen in the wood in yesterday s last light was the marble child from the church This did not surprise him as much as it would surprise you the world where children live is so full of amazing and incredible looking things that turn out to be quite real And if Lot s wife could be turned into a pillar of salt why should not a marble child turn into a real one It was all quite plain to Ernest but he did not tell any one because he had a feeling that it might not be easy to make it plain to them That child doesn t look quite the thing said Aunt Emmeline at breakfast A dose of Gregory s I think at eleven Ernest s morning was blighted Did you ever take Gregory s powder It is worse than quinine worse than senna worse than anything except castor oil But Ernest had to take it in raspberry jam And don t make such faces said Aunt Emmeline rinsing the spoon at the pantry sink You know it s all for your own good As if the thought that it is for one s own good ever kept any one from making faces The aunts were kind in their grown up crinolined way But Ernest wanted some one to play with Every night in his dreams he played with the marble child And at church on Sunday the marble child still held out its hands farther than before Come along then Ernest said to it in that voice with which heart speaks to heart come and sit with me behind the red curtains Come The marble child did not look at him Its head seemed to be bent farther forward than ever before When it came to the second hymn Ernest had an inspiration All the rest of the churchful sleepy and suitable were singing The roseate hues of early dawn The brightness of the day The crimson of the sunset sky How fast they fade away Ernest turned his head towards the marble child and softly mouthed you could hardly call it singing The rosy tews of early dawn The brightness of the day Come out come out come out come out Come out with me and play And he pictured the rapture of that moment when the marble child should respond to this appeal creep out from under the font and come and sit beside him on the red cushions beyond the red curtains The aunts would not see of course They never saw the things that mattered No one would see except Ernest He looked hard at the marble child You must come out he said and again You must come you must And the marble child did come It crept out and came to sit by him holding his hand It was a cold hand certainly but it did not feel like marble And the next thing he knew an aunt was shaking him and whispering with fierceness tempered by reverence for the sacred edifice Wake up Ernest How can you be so naughty And the marble child was back in its place under the font When Ernest looks back on that summer it seems to have thundered every time he went to church But of course this cannot really have been the case But it was certainly a very lowering purple skied day which saw him stealthily start on the adventure of his little life He was weary of aunts they were kind yet just they told him so and he believed them But their justice was exactly like other people s nagging and their kindness he did not want at all He wanted some one to play with May we walk up to the churchyard was a request at first received graciously as showing a serious spirit But its reiteration was considered morbid and his walks took the more dusty direction of the County Asylum His longing for the only child he knew the marble child exacerbated by denial drove him to rebellion He would run away He would live with the marble child in the big church porch they would eat berries from the wood near by just as children did in books and hide there when people came to church So he watched his opportunity and went quietly out through the French window skirted the side of the house where all the windows were blank because of the old window tax took the narrow strip of lawn at a breathless run and found safe cover among the rhododendrons The church door was locked of course but he knew where there was a broken pane in the vestry window and his eye had marked the lop sided tombstone underneath it By climbing upon that and getting a knee in the carved water spout He did it got his hand through turned the catch of the window and fell through upon the dusty table of the vestry The door was ajar and he passed into the empty church It seemed very large and gray now that he had it to himself His feet made a loud echoing noise that was disconcerting He had meant to call out Here I am But in the face of these echoes he could not He found the marble child its head bent more than ever its hands reaching out quite beyond the edge of the font and when he was quite close he whispered Here I am Come and play But his voice trembled a little The marble child was so plainly marble And yet it had not always been marble He was not sure Yet I am sure he said You did talk to me in the shrubbery didn t you But the marble child did not move or speak You did come and hold my hand last Sunday he said a little louder And only the empty echoes answered him Come out he said then almost afraid now of the church s insistent silence I ve come to live with you altogether Come out of your marble do come out He reached up to stroke the marble cheek A sound thrilled him a loud everyday sound The big key turning in the lock of the south door The aunts Now they ll take me back said Ernest you might have come But it was not the aunts It was the old pew opener come to scrub the chancel She came slowly in with pail and brush the pail slopped a little water on to the floor close to Ernest as she passed him not seeing Then the marble child moved turned toward Ernest with speaking lips and eyes that saw You can stay with me forever if you like it said but you ll have to see things happen I have seen things happen What sort of things Ernest asked Terrible things What things shall I have to see Her the marble child moved a free arm to point to the old woman on the chancel steps and your aunt who will be here presently looking for you Do you hear the thunder Presently the lightning will strike the church It won t hurt us but it will fall on them Ernest remembered in a flash how kind Aunt Emmeline had been when he was ill how Aunt Jessie had given him his chessmen and Aunt Harriet had taught him how to make paper rosettes for picture frames I must go and tell them he said If you go you ll never see me again said the marble child and put its arms round his neck Can t I come back to you when I ve told them Ernest asked returning the embrace There will be no coming back said the marble child But I want you I love you best of everybody in the world Ernest said I know I ll stay with you said Ernest The marble child said nothing But if I don t tell them I shall be the same as a murderer Ernest whispered Oh let me go and come back to you I shall not be here But I must go I must said Ernest torn between love and duty Yes And I shan t have you any more the living child urged You ll have me in your heart said the marble child that s where I want to be That s my real home They kissed each other again It was certainly a direct Providence Aunt Emmeline used to say in later years to really sympathetic friends that I thought of going up to the church when I did Otherwise nothing could have saved dear Ernest He was terrified quite crazy with fright poor child and he rushed out at me from behind our pew shouting Come away come away auntie come away and dragged me out missus Meadows providentially followed to see what it was all about and the next thing was the catastrophe The church was struck by a thunder bolt was it not the sympathetic friend asks It was indeed a deafening crash my dear and then the church slowly crumbled before our eyes The south wall broke like a slice of cake when you break it across and the noise and the dust missus Meadows never had her hearing again poor thing and her mind was a little affected too I became unconscious and Ernest well it was altogether too much for the child He lay between life and death for weeks Shock to the system the physician said He had been rather run down before We had to get a little cousin to come and live with us afterwards The physicians said that he required young society It must indeed have been a shock says the sympathetic friend who knows there is more to come His intellect was quite changed my dear Aunt Emmeline resumes on regaining consciousness he demanded the marble child Cried and raved my dear always about the marble child It appeared he had had fancies about one of the little angels that supported the old font not the present font my dear We presented that as a token of gratitude to Providence for our escape Of course we checked his fancifulness as well as we could but it lasted quite a long time What became of the little marble angel the friend inquires as in friendship bound Crushed to powder dear in the awful wreck of the church Not a trace of it could be found And poor missus Meadows So dreadful those delusions What form did her delusions take the friend anxious to be done with the old story hastily asks Well she always declared that two children ran out to warn me and that one of them was very unusual looking It wasn t no flesh and blood ma am she used to say in her ungrammatical way it was a little angel a taking care of Master Ernest It ad old of is and And I say it was is garden angel and its face was as bright as a lily in the sun The friend glances at the India cabinet and Aunt Emmeline rises and unlocks it Ernest must have been behaving in a very naughty and destructive way in the church but the physician said he was not quite himself probably for when they got him home and undressed him they found this in his hand Then the sympathizing friend polishes her glasses and looks not for the first time at the relic from the drawer of the India cabinet It is a white marble finger Thus flow the reminiscences of Aunt Emmeline The memories of Ernest run as this tale runs THE ONE LEFT BY E V LUCAS I HE had become very ill could hardly move from where he lay and she who loved him and was to have married him and spent all her waking hours in thinking what she could do for him persuaded him to have a telephone installed and brought to his bedside so that he and she could talk and he could talk with others too 
5424-291111-0000	train-other-500	Every night he rang her up and they had a long conversation many times in the day also Nothing as it happened could have saved his life but this modern device lightened his last weeks His death
none	none	 although it blasted her hopes made no difference to her devotion 
5424-291111-0001	train-other-500	She merely installed his memory in the place of his rich personality and loved that He almost more than ever was her standard What he would have liked she did what he would have disliked she left undone
none	none	 Although dead he swayed her utterly 
5424-291111-0002	train-other-500	and under his dominion she was equable and gentle although broken at heart She took all things as they came since how could anything matter now that everything that mattered was over One perplexity only had power to trouble her
5424-291111-0003	train-other-500	and that was the wonder the amazement the horror
none	none	 not only that so much knowledge and kindliness and sympathy 
5424-291111-0004	train-other-500	and all that made for the world s good and happiness should be so wantonly extinguished but that no touch of the vanished hand should be permitted to the one soul now left behind with whom his soul had been fused
5424-291111-0005	train-other-500	This she could neither understand nor forgive Religious she had never been in the ordinary sense although such religion as must sway a true idealistic lover was hers but now
none	none	 she broke even from such slender ties as had held her 
5424-291111-0006	train-other-500	to orthodoxy She threw off the creed of her parents as naturally and simply as if it were a borrowed garment
none	none	 and sank into her sorrow 
5424-291111-0007	train-other-500	which was also her joy without another thought of here or hereafter
none	none	 So it went on for a year or so 
5424-291111-0008	train-other-500	during which time his house had remained empty save for a caretaker for she who was rich could not bear that any one else should live there and his room exactly as he had died in it
none	none	 II 
5424-291111-0009	train-other-500	One evening she dined out Her next neighbor on one side was a young American engineer
none	none	 and in their conversation they came in time to the topic of invention and the curious aptitude for inventiveness shown by the American race 
5424-291111-0010	train-other-500	It was a case said the engineer of supply following demand all Americans required time and labor saving appliances and they obtained them Where servants abounded and there was no servant problem as in England and on the Continent
5424-291111-0011	train-other-500	the need for such contrivances was not acute And so on The conversation thus begun reached at last specific inventions and the engineer told of a remarkable one which had come under his notice just before he left New York
5424-291111-0012	train-other-500	You will probably not believe me he said the thing sounds incredible but then who would have believed once that there could be a telegraph and still less a telephone Who would have believed that the camera would ever be anything but a dream
5424-291111-0013	train-other-500	I will tell you what this is It is a machine in which you insert a portion no matter how small of a telephone wire and by turning a handle you compel this piece of wire to give back every message that has ever passed over it She held her heart
5424-291111-0014	train-other-500	This really exists she forced herself to ask Actually said the engineer But when I left home the inventor was in a difficulty All the messages were coming out all right but backwards
none	none	 Naturally the reproduction would be from the most recent to the less recent By writing down the words and then reversing them the investigator could of course get at what he was wanting I may say that the invention is for the New York police but my friend is convinced 
5424-291111-0015	train-other-500	that he can devise some mechanical system of reversing at the time which will make the messages read forward as they should Just think of the excitement of the detective listening through all the voices and ordinary conversations on the wire
none	none	 for the one voice and the one sentence that will give him his long desired clue 
5424-291111-0016	train-other-500	But are you ill No no she said
none	none	 although her face was a ghastly white no it is nothing The room is a little hot 
5424-291111-0017	train-other-500	Tell me some more about your inventive friend Is he wealthy Indeed no said the engineer That is his trouble If he had more money or if he had some rich backers who believed in him he might do wonders I should like to help him she said
5424-291111-0018	train-other-500	This kind of work interests me Could you not cable him to come over and bring the thing with him I would gladly finance him I want some sporting outlet like that for my money Cable Yes cable There are things that one does by impulse or not at all
5424-291111-0019	train-other-500	The butler here will get you a form
none	none	 III 
5424-291111-0020	train-other-500	She had been to the empty house that day with an employee of the telephone company
none	none	 and they had extracted a foot of the precious wire 
5424-291111-0021	train-other-500	A few minutes ago she had held it in her trembling fingers and placed it in the machine Now
none	none	 she carefully locked the door and drew the heavy curtain over it 
5424-291111-0022	train-other-500	and carried the machine to the farthest corner of the room There with a sigh of relief and tense and almost terrible anticipation
none	none	 she sat down and placed her ear to the receiver and began to turn the handle His voice sounded at once 
5424-291111-0023	train-other-500	Are you there It was quite clear so clear and unmistakable and actual
none	none	 that her hand paused on the handle and she bowed her throbbing head 
5424-291111-0024	train-other-500	She turned on Are you there the familiar tones repeated And then the reply Yes who is it in a woman s voice Then he spoke again Ernest he said Is it Helen Again her hand paused Helen
none	none	 that rubbishy little woman he had known all his life and was on such good terms with 
5424-291111-0025	train-other-500	She remembered now that she had been away when the telephone was installed and others had talked on it before her It could not be helped
none	none	 she had meant to be the first but circumstances prevented 
5424-291111-0026	train-other-500	There must be many conversations before she came to her own she would have to listen to them all She turned on and the laughing chaffing conversation with this foolish little Helen person repeated itself out of the past now so tragic
5424-291111-0027	train-other-500	To other talks with other friends and now and then with a tradesman she had to listen but at last came her hour Is that you she heard her own voice saying knowing it was her own rather by instinct than by hearing Is that you
none	none	 But I know it is How distinctly you speak Yes it s me 
5424-291111-0028	train-other-500	and his soft vibrant laugh How are you dear Better I hope Have you missed me Missed you And then the endearments the confidences the hopes and fears the plans for the morrow the plans for all life
5424-291111-0029	train-other-500	As she listened the tears ran down her face but still she turned on and on Sometimes he was so hopeful and bright and again so despairing
none	none	 She remembered the occasion of every word Once she had dined out and had gone to the theatre It was an engagement she could not well refuse 
5424-291111-0030	train-other-500	It was an amusing play and she was in good spirits She rang him up between the acts and found him depressed Hurrying home she had settled down to talk to him at her ease How it all came back to her now Are you there my dearest Yes but oh
5424-291111-0031	train-other-500	so tired so old It is a bad day Every one has been complaining of tiredness to day You say that because you are kind Just to comfort me It s no use I can see so clearly sometimes
none	none	 I shall never get well 
5424-291111-0032	train-other-500	to night I know it My darling no And then silence complete terrifying She had rung up without effect He had fainted she thought and had dropped the receiver She was in a fever of agony
none	none	 She leaped into a cab and drove to his house The nurse reassured her he had begun to sob and did not want her to know it and now he was asleep 
5424-291111-0033	train-other-500	But there was no sleep for her that night What if he were right if he really knew In her heart she feared that he did with the rest of her she fought that fear As she listened the tears ran down her face but still she turned on
5424-291111-0034	train-other-500	and on She sat there for hours before the last words came
none	none	 the last he was ever to speak over the wire 
5424-291111-0035	train-other-500	It was to make an engagement He had rallied wonderfully at the end and was confident of recovery
none	none	 She was to bring her modiste to his room at eleven o clock the next morning with her patterns that he might help in choosing her new dress 
5424-291111-0036	train-other-500	He had insisted on it the dress she was to wear on his first outing At eleven he had said Mind you don t forget But then you never forget anything Good night once more my sweet Good night
none	none	 She had never seen him again alive 
5424-291111-0037	train-other-500	He died before the morning She put the machine away and looked out of the window The sun had risen The sky was on fire with the promise of a beautiful day
none	none	 Worn out she fell asleep 
5424-291111-0038	train-other-500	to wake to what To such awakening as there is for those who never forget anything
none	none	 IV Every night found her bending over the machine 
5424-291111-0039	train-other-500	She had learned now when not to listen She had timed the reproduction absolutely and watch in hand she waited until the other messages were done
none	none	 and her own voice began 
5424-291111-0040	train-other-500	There was no condensing possible one must either each time have every conversation or stop it But how could she stop it before the end Locking the door and drawing the heavy curtain
none	none	 she would sit down in the far corner and begin to turn 
5424-291111-0041	train-other-500	She knew just how fast to turn for others so slowly for herself When the watch gave her the signal she would begin to listen Is that you
none	none	 Is that you But I know it is 
5424-291111-0042	train-other-500	How distinctly you speak Yes it s me and the soft vibrant laugh
none	none	 How are you dear Better I hope Have you missed me Missed you THE LEGACY OF RICHARD HUGHES BY MARGARET LYNN I Rachel Marquis paused a moment with her hand on the library door She had had John placed in here because it was the room she herself loved best and she knew that it was here she would prefer to sit beside him in these last hours of waiting Yet she had hesitated to come down and even now with her hand on the door knob she lingered again to re strengthen herself before entering The very unusualness of an unfamiliar sight in the familiar room would add she knew to the sharp strangeness of the whole event She almost hoped as she waited this moment for another practical duty of some sort which would postpone again her entrance to the room But no sound came from any part of the silenced house and she opened the door and entered The long casket stood awkwardly across the blank fireplace for she had chosen to give no direction to the undertaker and he had followed his own professional judgment Everything was arranged however with a sort of intention which indicated the intrusion of the professional into the private In spite of the stronger feeling of the moment Rachel Marquis noticed this with sharp disapproval But she went directly to the chair which had been placed beside the casket and seated herself bowing her head long on her folded arms before she looked on the familiar face beside her It was now only twenty four hours since the strange accident had happened and she had not yet adjusted herself even so far as to determine her fundamental emotion It was grief of course but the kind or degree of that grief was still undefined The hours since they had brought him home had been so full of the unfamiliar practical things which arise at such a time of the sudden necessities and small perplexities which muddle and chafe sorrow that there had been scarcely a moment for her to look consciously at the great fact Even now as she covered her eyes to be the more alone with herself she felt rather a welcoming of momentary inactivity than the relaxation of grief She realized with a sort of pang of disapproval that she did not need to relax from any tension of anguish She did not know what she wished to say to herself in this communion She was sorry bitterly sorry but what elements went into the making of that grief She could not yet tell So she leaned with covered eyes almost as if she were waiting for something outside of herself to give her a cue As the minutes passed however the great simple fact that John was dead and that his place beside her would now be empty engrossed all supplementary feelings and her genuine regret had its way She wept long and ever more bitterly absorbed as one may be in a mere physical expression of grief The activity of sorrow overcame thought for the time and left her no energy for analysis of feeling Death alone seemed enough to weep over and her tears still fell At last as if having reached a natural period she rose and moved away to the window and sat down there in a quiet reverie of sadness She was sorry for the life cut off shocked at the abruptness and completeness of the tragedy John himself she was sure the assertive energizing John would have hated this sudden subduing of himself and she sympathized with such revolt sorry sorry for it all As she thought she looked gravely out across the garden the gay stretch to which John had given so much time She had never understood his devotion to that garden He had not been ready to spend money on things to give aesthetic pleasure in the house although in practical matters he had been willing enough to make outlays ever since his business had been secure She thought of their new car of the signs of prosperity in their living Poor John she said at last with a deep sigh when aware of the nodding line of rare dahlias on which her eyes were resting she thought of all the pains he had taken in the propagation and selection of them She had come to recognize this lavishness of care and money as a sort of blind expression of the one aesthetic element in his nature and had felt a quiet approval of it Poor John she sighed again and turned from the window to go But even as she did so the simplicity of her mood passed and the old complexity of feeling returned with a keenness which was for the moment bewildering As she left the window the long black shape across the fireplace confronted her again and she paused startled anew it was so strange and so tremendous a thing in her room For the library was above everything else in the world hers It was such a room as shows it has been taking on character through succeeding decades cumulative of its type slowly drawing to itself an atmosphere of fineness and greatness The credit of it belonged only remotely to Rachel Marquis She was the possessor but not the maker of it She had kept it and loved it but her own contribution to it had been slight A few shelves of new books not yet mellowed down to the tone of the others standing as if waiting to be proved and a bit of renewing of texture here and there whose freshness showed need of the softening of time were the only marks of her hand or taste But it was such a room as any lover of the long effects of books would cherish In the midst of its harmonies the heavy black box undoubtedly looked harsh and intrusive Rachel recognized as a sort of confidence with herself that bringing it here was an invasion Because she loved the room herself she had placed John here without thought of the inappropriateness of the act But now the incongruity of the choice struck her Why should he be brought here she thought pitifully to the room he never frequented where she scarcely welcomed him she acknowledged Why should she sit beside him here when she had so seldom done so before She remembered very well the manner with which he occasionally sought her here tentative unfamiliar and yet assertive She had resented every element of that manner Anywhere else in the house he was more nearly himself here everything she did not desire in him was accentuated It had been she thought with an instinctive desire to do the best for him in every way that she had directed that he should be placed here just as she had ordered everything of the choicest and had given her most careful attention and taste to every detail But this thought had been a failure Poor John she said gently once more with a pity in her thought all the greater for this very incongruity as she came over and stood beside him But as her eyes rested on his face she felt almost compelled to withdraw the phrase The dead man seemed to allow no such pity The unfamiliar in the familiar which is stranger than a new thing held her startled attention as she looked She had thought that she knew John Marquis to the last shred of his character but death seemed to have laid a fineness she had never known over the stubbornness and taciturnity of the face The dignity of the last great experience of his life seemed to mark him He seemed to be gathering himself away from her pitying kindness Very soon she went out again and closed the door II When Richard Hughes the last of his family left his mother s old home to John and Rachel Marquis no one had wondered Rachel was a sort of cousin and John too a distant connection by somebody s marriage And they lived in the town and nothing was more natural than that he should give them a home there and whatever else he had to leave What no one knew but Rachel was that Richard Hughes had wished to marry her and that she had refused him and chosen John Marquis instead Richard Hughes fifteen years her senior quiet and inexpressive shut in with books and remote from life was far less to her mind than John Marquis who was of her own generation with whom she went to parties and talked the light talk of youth and had a thousand things in common as she thought John was bright and jolly and played tennis and danced with her and took her out in a canoe and was sweet tempered and loved to laugh and between times talked seriously about the business he was starting and the money he expected to make John belonged to the whole format of her life at that time and it was perfectly natural to choose to marry him with the expectation that life would go on as she and John had both known it and liked it in other homes comfortable sensible ambitious of practical things real as their kind would call it It seemed an impossible thing for her not to marry John In the first years of their marriage she was proud of coming quickly to understand John s business She was proud of her management and her well timed economies proud that John could talk affairs over with her with satisfaction that she was beginning to take the place her mother and other successful women had taken in practical life But after two or three years had passed the space taken by practical things in her life began to shrink her familiarity with them detracted from their interest and allowed her to dispose of them more readily She began to feel a restlessness which called for new interests At the same time John s affairs were not prospering Difficulties he could not manage hampered him All Rachel s advice and economies were of little help among the inevitable conditions of the time She was becoming tired of the continual effort to acquire and impatient of the atmosphere of practical things But she made a show of readiness when he suggested that they give up the cheerful modern home they had fitted about themselves with the conventions of comfort and the furnishings and decorations to which they had been adapted It was just at this time that Richard Hughes left them his home and the little money he owned Nothing could have been more opportune for them Whatever other feelings John may have had were absorbed in sheer relief at the assistance the bequest brought him The money with that from the sale of their own house tided him over his difficulties and even helped to develop his business further Rachel concealed her reluctance at moving into the out of date old house with its antiquated furnishings and made a show of welcoming their fortune as a good partner should She could hardly tell when her consciousness of the house began to have its influence upon her From the first John absorbed in business left all practical things to her feeling that the house was more hers than his anyway She in a mood of vague compunction and desire to compensate for she hardly knew what made it a point of honor to dispose of all their own furniture chosen with such satisfaction and complacency and settled among the dull tones and quiet spaces of the old house Gay old place isn t it said John walking through the house after they were established Rachel assented with a cheerful smile Oh well he went on settling down with his trade journals which looked sadly out of place in the dim library we can stand it for a while Some time we can have what we want again It was months before he recurred to the subject directly Then one Sunday he looked about him as he sat stretched in an old easy chair and said abruptly We are getting pretty well settled down here I didn t think the old place would be so comfortable It is more than comfortable said Rachel quietly I wonder why Richard ever left it to us Have you ever figured it out Oh he had no nearer relatives that he knew Rachel tried to speak in a matter of fact way but instead she hesitated and flushed a little John looked at her closely Do you know any other reason he asked curiously Rachel hesitated again Mere reticence on past affairs was one thing positively keeping a secret from her husband was another Richard wanted to marry me once she said But I don t think that had anything to do with it she added hastily When was that Oh before I was engaged to you said Rachel and smiled at him John said nothing more but sat tapping his knee with his folded newspaper as was his habit when in thought Presently he rose and strolled away Rachel could not help resenting his silence which left her in discomfort When so much had been said he should have said more if only to put her at her ease For days afterwards she expected him to return to the subject and when he did not do so she continued to resent the implication he seemed to be making At this time the house itself had already begun to have its effect upon her Rachel could hardly tell when she stopped looking wistfully at the sectional bookcases and mission furniture of her acquaintances But soon after she moved into it the house had ceased to be to her merely a house With her conventionally modern notions of beauty in furnishings she had first been surprised to find how at rest and how satisfied she was in this house which had met in a generous way the needs and tastes of another generation but met few of those to which she had been trained She had not known that it was in her to find a charm in such a house But from the time when she first became aware of a positive quality in the place she became more and more awake to its existence she wondered at it but it held her attention constantly more firmly At last she found that behind the entity of the house lay that which had made it the personality of the generations gone and especially of its last owner The quality of the whole place with its solidity of walls and generosity of room along with its plain sincerity in every detail seemed to indicate praiseworthiness not only in the first builder but in all later possessors It became a meritorious thing to have and to keep a house like this She remembered something of the sacrifices that Richard Hughes had made to retain it and warmed with pride of him at the recollection The whole place reflected him and the people who had made him Gradually Rachel grew in pride of the house and of her heritage As she lived there month by month she found herself enveloped in its atmosphere and growing toward its proportions At first she entered the library with timidity and an uncomfortable strangeness Even one who had only very superficial intellectual tastes must have felt a sort of awe before its accumulation of books and their accompaniments When Rachel and John had first begun to make a home they had placed the making of a library among their ambitions for it and had taken pleasure in adding a few gayly bound novels each year to the small united collection with which they had begun They had enjoyed seeing their few shelves grow and knowing that they had so many of the popular books of which their friends talked When they came to the Hughes home Rachel had crowded their parti colored collection into the shelves of the library there weeding out others to make room for their own But on a later day as she reentered the room she felt a shock at the incongruity presented and to John s puzzlement gathered their own books into a corner by themselves where a curtain safely hid them Their garish triviality had no place among these mellowed long tried volumes John however had looked the old volumes over and pronounced them a dry lot give him something fresher But Rachel perceived that there had been something in the choosing of these books which she had never really known To her books had been an accessory an incidental thing hypothetically an enrichment of life but not an essential She had thought of intellectual exercise as an intermittent thing to be taken up or laid down as suited the mood of the time But here was a people who chose books not merely as a desirable possession an ornamental furnishing but as an unquestioned necessity Gradually as she continued to handle and to know their books she evoked for herself the earlier presences of the house most of all Richard Hughes In the long hours which she now spent alone about the house she found herself living more constantly in a companionship with those minds They were not only an atmosphere but sometimes almost a positive presence It entertained her to go over the books one by one sometimes deciding who had chosen this one and that one and for what reason and picturing the occasion of its coming to his hand As her knowledge of the library grew she took more and more pleasure in this tracing the taste of one owner or another in the recurrence of a subject or in successive accretions She as she learned glowed over her collection of first editions of modern works since they had been chosen not as first editions but in their own time as works for which an appreciative hand was eagerly waiting And since Richard Hughes was the only one of her predecessors in the library whom she had known she found herself embodying all the others in him She knew him now better than she had ever known him She could detect his additions to the treasures of the house and as her own knowledge increased could trace his using of the resources which had been handed down to him She began to take pleasure in following what she thought had been his path in taste and knowledge gradually matching her mind to his own Her pride in the room went through successive stages In her first days of satisfaction in mere proprietorship of so respectable and worthy a possession she took pleasure in unostentatious exhibition of it She liked to take guests there in a natural sort of way and to be found sitting there by unexpected callers She liked the eminently admirable background of the rows of books for social episodes But as her knowledge of the library grew that stage passed As she went from familiarity to intimacy she began to desire that it should be an exclusive intimacy She no longer took callers to the room and when familiar acquaintances found their way there she was uneasy at their handling of the books and impatient of their discussion of them She now seldom spontaneously took strangers there In time she had come to group John with all the others The only companionship that she desired in the library was an imagined one John s attitude had more and more set her apart in this companionship His dislike for the house had grown steadily more obvious as the months and years passed It showed itself in a lack of home pride in open contempt for the old fashioned elements of the place in reluctance to make even necessary expenditure upon it But Rachel herself had hardly guessed the strength of his feeling until one day when she discovered among Richard Hughes s papers what seemed to be a memorandum for a codicil to his will which would make a gift of a thousand dollars to the little public library of the town She took the note directly to John I think we ought to do this she said John looked at the paper and laid it down I don t see that we are obliged to he answered shortly It is what he intended to do and we got the money she said with too patient a manner as if explaining the moral point to him We should give it in his name It is enough to have to live in Richard Hughes s house I don t care to set up a memorial for him besides But John she urged herself to argue is it honest There is more than one kind of honesty said John shortly in a tone which checked further answer I can t afford it he added after a moment as the final word She left him in an anger which it seemed to her she would feel all her life But gradually it became less an active feeling than a part of all her unformulated opinion of him He had not followed her a single step in the development which had resulted from her awakening to the spirit of the house In time he came to ignore the library altogether as part of the house and by degrees fitted up an incongruous little lounging place upstairs Rachel came to regard his whole attitude toward the place and the man who had owned it as belonging to his mental and aesthetic plane his jealous ingratitude seemed not a separate feeling but only an element in his character Richard Hughes she now understood very well had known her very little and had loved only her prettiness and light girlishness charms which were different from anything in his own life The recollection of that episode did not flatter her now or even afford her any special gratification But she loved to live side by side with the embodiment she had re created for herself and was proud to feel her spirit matching its spirit She sometimes felt with her growing imagination that she was living in the house not with John but with these presences of the past most of all with Richard Hughes But in the mean time the matter of the bequest assumed for her constantly greater proportions After some time had passed she ventured to mention it again He answered as before I can t afford it She knew that he could afford it About the same time he bought a strip of ground lying beside them and began his garden Rachel suggested that he take a piece of their own grounds but he bluntly rejected the proposal A growing taciturnity marked his manner and often a willful crudeness of phrase and speech which annoyed her almost to the point of reproof So far as was possible however she kept the recognition of all this far in the background of her thought and forebore any conscious criticism of him even to herself But her warmest feeling for him was tinged with pity Yesterday he had been taken This accident sudden as a lightning flash and more unforeseen had ended the relation between them though not the puzzle Rachel had never been one to revise her opinion of a man because he was dead Her tears had fallen now but she had no compunctious self deception and her long framed feelings were only complicated not really altered She saw as clearly as ever the incongruity of her husband s presence in this room where Richard Hughes had had his life and where she now had her own III All waited for the coming of John s brother David Marquis David was an elder brother retired from business on some pretext or other now loitering his way profitably and pleasantly through the later half of his life It had been his custom to visit them frequently spending weeks at a time idling about the house quiet keen of look ready to talk with interest on any general topic but incommunicative of opinion on any personal matter Rachel had always felt as she saw his observant eye first upon John and then upon her that he saw the difference between them and sympathized with her For this reason although she had never criticized John to him she had sometimes spoken freely of herself and of her own tastes and wishes and he had listened quietly as ever but responsively She had a sort of feeling now that she would find her poise through him when he came A sympathetic eye would help her to adjust the degree of her grief to the limits of her previous feeling It was eight o clock when he arrived The pretext of dinner in the house was over and even the neighborly and professional attentions of the day were withdrawn Rachel descended from her room in the quiet house at the sound of his entrance and met gratefully the brotherly kindliness of his manner They sat a few minutes in the hall in question and answer of his journey and of the accident and all the circumstantial things which cluster about death itself Rachel answered freely and fully discovering a relief in breaking the instinctive repression of the day and finding the sort of rest she had hoped for from his presence David listened to her quietly as he had always done with his ready eye upon her At last he rose turning away from her with a comprehensive look about him Where is he he asked abruptly In the library said Rachel with a movement to lead the way for him In there exclaimed David with the emphasis of surprise Then he closed his lips again and followed her without meeting her questioning look But inside the door he paused again Rachel had constrained by long habit looked first at the room as she entered and then at the casket as a separate thing The room had so long served to give her poise that she felt a sort of appeal to it even now David s eyes rested first on the casket and then swept the room in a disapproving look Why is he here he asked with a curtness in his easy voice which Rachel had never heard from him before Why she began hesitatingly and then added vaguely It seemed best Best for him responded David with the same curtness Then he turned and dropped his head slowly over the figure in the coffin and Rachel slipped away David s manner seemed to put her entirely outside of the occasion Later he joined her where she waited in the dim parlor The still chilliness of the room was stiffening and depressing but she had not made a fire because its open cheerfulness would not have seemed appropriate David walked up and down the long room a few minutes in a silence which Rachel not knowing his mood did not break Then he said as abruptly as before Can you have him moved in the morning Moved Where Rachel had not supposed that her brother in law would have the same feeling of incongruity that she had Anywhere but there Here I don t know there is no place in the house that seems to belong to him The hall might do at least he went through there every day he finished with an irony none too subtle He began to walk up and down the length of the room alternately facing her with a challenging air and turning abruptly away again when he had neared her seat But Rachel absorbed still in her mood was unappreciative of his manner John never fitted into the house very well anywhere she said with reserved regret Fitted into it exclaimed David as he turned toward her at the end of the room My Did the house ever fit into him It is the business of a house to suit the people that live in it he flung over his shoulder as he wheeled away again Rachel was silent puzzled at this surprising change of manner in David and not knowing how much of his emotion was merely the impatience of grief Is there a corner of the house where it is appropriate for him to lie now except that little cubby hole of his upstairs demanded David continuing but as one who knows that an answer is impossible He suddenly abandoned his walk and came over and sat down opposite her in front of the empty fireplace He sat silent a moment his gray figure drooping in a big chair Rachel looking carefully at him for the first time noted with a kind of surprise the mark of brokenness and relaxation upon him of submission to tremendous grief It had not occurred to her that John could be mourned in that way After a moment he said quietly This house has never been a home for John I was always hoping said Rachel as if this subject were one which they had discussed before and agreed upon that he would feel more at home here in time What would have been necessary to bring that about asked David quietly Well said Rachel with reluctance in criticism even greater than usual he would have had to change in many ways In what ways persisted David Rachel hesitated again The thing when baldly said seemed so much harsher than when it was merely held in thought John s taste was different from that of the people who made the house she said Yes I know These pictures and the old books in the library and so on Is that what you mean Well the insides of the books and other pictures which we don t have and so on she finished indefinitely Yes You thought John was crude and rather coarse in feeling Oh no not that indeed You wouldn t call it just that of course But the difference between you was the same whether it put you up high or him down low Isn t that so You were sorry for yourself because John was not on your level Yes admitted Rachel reluctantly voicing the word Were you ever sorry enough for John because you were not on his level There are different kinds of lonesomeness he added after a pause I never saw a worse case than John s Rachel sat upright looking at him in a sort of amazement as much at himself as at the idea She had never dreamed that behind his apparently sympathetic observation of her lay any condemnation of her attitude He met her look with one as direct and asked in a way which made the question a sort of arraignment Did it ever occur to you what a tragedy John s life was Rachel merely shook her head slowly as she tried to connect in an impersonal sort of way the notion of tragedy with John John the successful the obstinate the simple in desire the objective There had been no real disappointment in all his life She looked back half indignantly at David rejecting the suggestion David rose and took a turn up and down the parlor again pausing in the shadows at the farther end of the room Then he came back to his seat and faced her determinedly What I had always hoped was that you would come to understand John without any outside interference I came back over and over to see but I always kept from butting in He paused again I wouldn t say anything now only your tone your Poor John way shows you are just the same as ever I won t have him buried without your knowing something more about him if I can show you he added more gently Please tell me said Rachel quietly Her mind was still half as much on David as on what he was going to say There is nothing to tell that you should not have seen for yourself You were his wife and you lived with him From the time you came to this house one side of John s life ended In a way he had no home and no wife A man wants a companion Rachel almost spoke in startled contradiction It was she who had been uncompanioned You were proud I know of never finding fault with John Don t you know that he would have been glad if you had openly found fault with him As it was it seemed as if you thought him hopeless When he said things about the house or anything in it he really wanted you to contradict him and argue with him and give him a way to come to the same place where you were don t you see Did he tell you No But of course I used to sit round with him a good deal And I had always been used to understanding him he added with a drop in his voice John had a lot of imagination he went on Rachel looked up in real surprise I could see every year how the house was getting more on his nerves Sometimes when he was feeling it more than usual he would say little things that I understood For him it was like living with some one who didn t want him round But he might have liked it You don t understand said Rachel as if pricked into coming to her own defense John didn t like the way the house came to us in the first place You didn t know Yes I did he responded as she hesitated I found out And yet she went on we used the house and the money You haven t known much about the business for several years have you Of course you do know that the house has been in your name from the beginning almost But you don t know that the few thousands Richard Hughes left have been invested for you ever since two years after he died It crippled John for a while after he took it out of the business But he always took good care of that money it amounts to quite a little now John didn t like it because Richard Rachel hesitated again You thought he was jealous He did that after one day when you weeded out a lot of his books and put them away in some corner And it was after he had those New York electric men here that evening and you seemed not to want to have them in the library that he bought that corner of ground over there and made his garden Don t you understand Rachel dropped her face upon her hands partly for relief from David s serious face which forebore to rebuke her and yet of necessity did so partly to close herself in with her own bewilderment To reconstruct John s life meant to take a new view of her own also David leaned suddenly toward her If John had been jealous wouldn t he have had reason Rachel I know you weren t untrue to him But still He felt the formulation of the thought with her I haven t judged you harshly Rachel he went on in a moment but it is not right that a man s brother should know him better than his wife does I had to make you know even at the last Then as if he were compelled to say the final hard thing he added Wasn t there something you had already thought you should do when everything was in your hands Rachel startled and flushing faced him again in involuntary confession I had always thought it would be right to carry out a plan of Richard Hughes s Yes I know I am sure that was only a momentary notion of his He had a great habit of making notes of things His will was made only a few days before he died and that idea was probably earlier I was an executor you remember But anyway several years ago John made a large gift to the library of Richard s college in Richard s name He took no chances on being unfair He should have told you he added but John had a hard sort of pride to manage and I suppose he never did No said Rachel he never did She rose with a sudden dropping of her hands at her sides as if relinquishing something they had held and moved vaguely toward the door Don t you think pursued David that he might be brought in here or somewhere Rachel hesitated her hand faltering on the door frame No she said at last let him stay there now And she herself went out through the dim chill hall She lingered a moment at the closed library door and then went slowly on up to her own empty room OF WATER AND THE SPIRIT eight BY MARGARET PRESCOTT MONTAGUE I WANT to tell you I must tell you all about it With a kind of grave finality the little woman in the deck chair next to mine snapped together the collapsible drinking cup with which she had been playing and sat up laying a small eager hand on my arm It was as if her groping thoughts had suddenly pushed open a door into action I wondered if she guessed that I had been peeping at her from under dropped lids She had the colorless make up of a small middle aged mouse but her expression was amazing It startled and arrested one All the old lines of the face were set to small ambitions and sordid desires but the look which should have accompanied these lines was clean gone wiped into something big and still and simple and her manner was that of an earnest child I was in Belgium when it commenced she began But I guess I better go back and tell it all right from the beginning she broke off Please do I begged I did my best to speak naturally but my voice seemed to break some spell for her face blurred suddenly to self consciousness I I reckon I ought to apologize for speaking to a stranger she stammered primly And now her words exactly matched all the old small lines of her face It was as if her little self aware of something big and overwhelming that threatened to sweep her out of her depth made a desperate clutch at conventionality But I want to hear I protested eagerly Please tell me She must have seen that I was in earnest for the little conventional self disappeared at that and she answered simply And I want to tell you it seems like I ve just got to tell you It was September nineteen fourteen We homing Americans were churning through an extraordinarily blue ocean toward New York and peace while back there just over our shoulders a mad world was running red It was like bein torn all to pieces and put together again different she said But I ll go back like I said and start right from the beginning For a moment she was silent staring thoughtfully down at the cheap little metal cup screwing the rings softly round and round and drawing as it were inspiration from the sight of it I come from Johnson s Falls she began at length You wouldn t know where that is It s just a little place down in West Virginia but it s right close to the Virginia state line and we have some mighty nice people in town Why she exclaimed I reckon we have some of the very best blood in the South there But but that isn t what I set out to tell you she caught herself up She fell into such a prolonged silence turning the little cup and looking at it that at last I ventured a question to start her again And I suppose I said you belong to one of the oldest families there I was sorry as soon as I had said it No I don t she answered simply looking straight up at me That was how it all commenced My father kept the livery stable But of course it wouldn t matter keepin a livery I mean if your family was all right Jeff Randolph kept the grocery Being a Randolph of course he could But my name s Smithson Sadie Virginia Smithson and my grandfather was a carpenter I m a dressmaker myself That s the reason they didn t elect me to the Laurel Literary Society She paused a moment I reckon you wouldn t understand about the Laurel Literary Society she questioned a trifle wistfully Perhaps not I admitted Well it s a literary society of course The members read papers and all like that but it s a heap more n that Belonging to it kind of marks a person out in Johnson s Falls and gives em the the well I reckon you d call it the entray to all the best homes in town If you don t belong well I reckon it came kinder harder on me not belonging than it did on some of the others Why I d have said the girls that started it were my very best friends We d played together as children and I called em all by their first names and they knew I was just as smart an liked readin an all that just as well as any of em did So when I wasn t asked to join well it just seemed to knock me right out I wasn t but nineteen then an when you re young things hurt more I reckon Anyhow the slight of it got just fixed in my mind an I made a kind of a vow that I d belong to that society some day if I died for it And then after a while it came to me maybe if I could just save money enough to go abroad they d ask me to read a paper before the society when I got back cause mighty few people have traveled much from our town Well she looked thoughtfully away at the blue water many an many a night I ve put myself to sleep thinking how it would be when I read that paper You know when you re young and kind of unhappy and slighted how you make up things to sort of comfort yourself I nodded Well I could just see the whole thing me standing there reading an all and when I d get through I could almost hear the applause They d some of em have on gloves you know so it would sound softer an more genteel like than just common bare hand clapping Well it takes time for a country dressmaker to save It took me twenty years I did have most enough once but then my sister was taken sick an what I d saved had to go for her But I just gritted my teeth an commenced again and at last this spring I had enough an I joined a party and went Ours wasn t a regular party It was just a professor an his wife who were goin anyhow an would take a couple of ladies with them so there were just the four of us Well we traveled for a month or more an you better b lieve I stretched my eyes to see all there was to see An then all at once the world just tipped itself right over an went crazy We were in Brussels when it came The professor was sure everything would quiet down in a little bit an he said we d better stay right there And anyhow it wasn t easy to get away It was all just awful with one country after another slipping in Only things came so quick a person didn t hardly have time to catch their breath an think how awful fore something worse was jumping right on top of it Well we stayed and stayed till at last the Germans came It certainly was a sight to see em but I ain t goin to tell about that I m just goin to skip right along to what I set out to tell The professor and his wife had left their only child a mighty sickly little thing with her grandmother in Paris and when things got so bad they were pretty near distracted to get to her Well one morning the professor came in and told us he d run across a young American a mister Grenville who was being sent to Paris on some special diplomatic business He had a big automobile and he thought maybe he could get it fixed to take us all too It looked like a mighty crazy thing to do but there wasn t any holdin the professor an his wife on account of their child and me and the other lady we was afraid to be left behind Well after a lot of runnin around from one official to another they did finally get it all fixed for us to go an the next day we started out with an American flag on the front of our car Of course we were stopped a lot of times and all our papers gone through and everything but each time they let us go on account of mister Grenville bein a United States official We d started early an by noon we d come a right smart piece an about that time we began to hear firing on in front Did you ever hear them big guns she broke off to ask her childlike eyes questioning me I shook my head Well you needn t never want to hear em she said When they commenced we all kind of looked at one another an I reckon we was all scared Anyhow I know I was Why at home I m fraid of a thunderstorm But still we kept on The sound of the firin got louder an louder but it was never very close and along late in the afternoon it sort of died off an we commenced to draw breath again and think everything was goin to be all right I m most sure now we must have missed the way for just about that time we ran upon a piece of road that was all tore up There were big holes in it from the shells an those tall poplars alongside were all snapped off an their branches stripped down like a child peels a switch You could smell the fresh sap like you can in lumber camps at home Well we had to slow up an kind of pick our way and on round the very next turn we ran right up on them On the fighting I gasped No no the fightin was all over then Just for a flash comin on em so quick like I didn t know what they were They looked like little sprawled brown heaps But in the second I was wonderin one of em flung up an arm and groaned How awful I cried aghast Yes she assented simply it certainly was awful My words ain t big enough to tell you how awful Runnin up on em so unexpected like that kind of cut my breath right off an choked me There they were layin all about acrost the road an in a wheat field alongside with the sun just shining down like it was any kind of a summer day A good many of em were dead but there were a plenty that weren t They blocked the road so we had to stop an right where we stopped there was a young man layin flung over on his back He d snatched his shirt open at the breast an the blood had all dripped down into the dust of the road He opened his eyes an stared right up in my face an cried Water for God s sake He said it over an over in the awfullest voice an like it was one word Water for God s sake water for God s sake like that I had this little drinkin cup an there was a good sized creek just a piece across the field so I grabbed my hand bag an jumped out Well at that all of em in the car commenced to holler an scream at me to get back that we couldn t stop it wouldn t be safe an we couldn t do anything an anyhow the stretcher bearers would be along d rectly But I just said He wants water an I ve got my cup here an there s the branch an anyhow I says he looks kind of like my sister s oldest boy an with that I started on to the creek Well the professor an mister Grenville jumped out of the car an came runnin after me but I just turned round an looked at em You all go on I says He asked me for water for God s sake an if you try to put me back in that car I ll fight you like a wildcat I never did anything like that fightin I mean she broke off to explain earnestly but I would have an I reckon they knew it The professor tried to argue You ll be a raving maniac if you stay here he says Well I says look what s here now what difference does it make if I am Somehow that was the way I felt Everything was so awful it didn t seem to matter whether anything awful happened to me or not So I just kept on to the creek and mister Grenville said For Heaven s sake let her stay if she can do anything I wish to God I could stay too But he couldn t he was carryin some mighty important dispatches that he just had to get on with An then he calls out to me Good luck and God bless you Miss Smithson An when I looked back he was standin with his hat off He was a mighty nice young man But all the time the other ladies in the car was screamin an hollerin for them to come on so they had to go They left you all alone I cried They had to she returned mister Grenville had to get on with his dispatches an it was the last chance the professor an his wife had of gettin through to their child An the other lady Well she couldn t do nothin but scream anyhow By the time I was comin back from the creek the car was just pullin out of sight Somehow to see it go like that gave me a kind of funny feelin I was scared I reckon but all the same I felt kind of still too It seemed like for the last few weeks I d been hustled along in a wild kind of a torrent but now I d touched bottom an got my feet under me I reckon a woman does touch bottom when there s anything she can do anyhow one raised to work like I ve been does But oh my Lord she cried suddenly dropping her face to her hands I wish I could keep from seein it all still an hearin it too Did you ever hear a man scream she demanded Not just groan but shriek an scream In hospitals I said uncertainly I ve heard people screaming when they were coming out of ether She shook her head That s different You knew there were people nurses and doctors to do things for em but out there there wasn t anything but the trampled wheat an the big empty sky There was plenty of em who wanted water an begged an cried for it but I just said I ll be back to you all presently an went on to the first one He was kind of delirious but he could drink the water an was mighty glad to get it I brushed the flies all away an spread a clean handkerchief over his wound he was too far gone to try an do anything else for him an went on back to the creek Water that was the main thing they wanted The most of em that could be were bandaged already Some of the medical outfit had been around an got em tied up but after that I reckon the fightin must of changed an cut em off from their friends for the stretcher bearers didn t come an didn t come It was all so strange an kind of shut away there like destruction had lit for a spell an then flown on to the next place The wheat was all laid over an tramped and lumpy with khaki bodies an with caps an guns an things flung around in it an the red sun sailin down an down in the West an every here an there awful splatters of blood in the wheat But I didn t have time to look an think too much an it was mighty lucky I didn t have They were all English an had run upon a German battery an been shot to pieces fore they hardly knew what was happenin I guess some of em must have got away but there was a plenty that didn t They d been layin there since dawn an an they were hungry her voice broke An I didn t have anything to give em she whispered They say after a while you get kind of numb to things she went on presently with her grave simplicity I don t know how that is but I know the things I saw made me stop every now an then down by the creek out of sight an just wring an wring my hands together in a kind of rage of pity Once goin through the wheat I tramped on something soft an when I looked it was it was just a piece of a man I thought I d lay right down then an die but I says to myself They want water they want water an that way I kind of drove myself on But all the time I could see my heart under my waist just jumpin up an down like it was fightin to jump out an run away An then another time But she broke off No she said I won t tell about that It s so peaceful here with that blue water an sunshine an all I reckon I oughtn t to tell what it s like underneath when Hell takes the lid off An maybe some day the Lord ll let me forget But it s funny she went on again presently how your mind grabs ahold of any foolish thing to steady you She paused staring down at the little cup as though she drew remembrance from it I recollect as I went back and forth back and forth weaving out paths through the wheat a silly song that we used to sing to a game at school kept runnin in my head I don t want none of your weevily wheat An I don t want none of your barley An I don t want none of your weevily wheat To bake a cake for Charley I was mighty glad it did For all it was so silly it kept me from flyin right off the handle An so I kept on an on carryin em water Some of the men thought it was funny I should be there an they wanted to talk an ask me questions but the most of em were sufferin too bad to care an some of em were busy goin along into the next world an were done with bein surprised over anything in this Most of em called me Nurse or Sister an some way I liked to have em do it Some of em certainly were brave too Why I saw one young fella jump straight up to his feet an fling his arms out wide an holler right up at the sky Are we downhearted No an pitch over dead You know she paused to explain simply her extraordinarily childlike eyes lifted to mine for understanding and sympathy it just seems to snatch the heart right out of you to see a person stand up to death like that specially when they re so young like that little fella Of course she went on after a moment I didn t just give em water I d do any other little thing I could besides An every time I could do anything I certainly was glad Doing things seemed to ease up a little that terrible rage of pity I felt I took my skirt off an rolled it up for a pillow for a little fella who couldn t move an was layin with his head in a kind of a sink hole He tried to thank me but he couldn t he just sobbed but he caught ahold of my hand an kissed it That made me cry It was so sort of young an pretty of him After that I went on for a spell with the tears just pourin down my cheeks But presently I found the one who couldn t drink the water an I quit cryin then My tears weren t big enough only God s would have been big enough for that The man s face was all gone eyes mouth everything an still he was alive He must have heard me an known somebody was there for he commenced to scream an moan tryin to say things down in his throat an to reach out his hands an flop about O my God It was like a chicken with its head off I thought I d have to run But I didn t I just sort of fell down beside him an caught ahold of his hands an patted them an talked to him like you do to a child in a nightmare I don t know what I said at first Just a crazy jumble of pity I reckon but after a little bit I found I was prayin I know I needed it an it seemed to help him too for after a little bit he stopped that awful tryin to speak down in his throat an lay still just grippin my hands I was so crazy I couldn t think of a thing to say but God bless us an keep us an make his face to shine upon us an be merciful unto us An I just said that over an over I guess it wasn t the words that he wanted it was the feelin of havin God there in all that awful dark and blood an some human bein beside him who was sorry Anyhow every time I d stop he d snatch at my wrists so hard it would hurt look She broke off to push up her gray sleeve and there on her thin wrist still vividly black and blue were the bruised prints of fingers But I was glad to be hurt I wanted to be hurt I wanted to have a share in all the sufferin It just seemed like my heart would break An she added with great simplicity I reckon that s just what it did do for I know I broke through into something bigger than I ever had been Well after a while God did have mercy on that poor soul for he quit pullin at my hands and began to die an when I came round again to him he was gone But that got me started an I left off sayin that foolishness about the weevily wheat an said the little prayer instead I said it to myself first but after a little bit I found I was sayin it out loud I don t know why but it seemed like I had to say it every time I gave one of em water Just God bless us an keep us an make his face to shine upon us and be merciful unto us It was somehow like a child s game like havin to touch every tree box goin along the street or steppin over every crack Each one of em had to have the water an the little prayer an then on to the next or back down to the creek for more Most of em didn t seem to notice but some of em laughed an some stared like I was crazy an maybe I was a little an again some of em were glad of it So I kep on an on an the sun went down an the dark came an it seemed like a kind of a lid had shut us away from all the world It wasn t right dark for the stars were shinin It was about that time that I found the little officer He was dyin off in the wheat all to himself an he got me to take down some messages for his folks I wrote em in my diary I had a pocket flashlight in my bag an it made a round eye of light that stared out at every word I wrote They were the simplest kind of words Just love love to mother and love to father and Snippy and Peg an good bye to em all an how he was glad to die for England But they look mighty strange jumpin out there in my diary alongside of travel notes about Brussels It s like something big an terrible had smashed its fist right through all the little fancy things But it was funny she went on after a minute how sort of like children so many of the men were so trusting an helpless There was one little fella always said the same thing to me every time I came round They ll sure be around for us soon now won t they sister he d say An I d always answer Oh yes just in a little bit now An he d settle back again so trusting an satisfied an like I really knew That was the way they all seemed to me just children Even the ones that cursed an screamed at me An another funny thing she added lifting her grave child s eyes to mine I ve never been married never known what it was to have children but that night all those men were my children even the biggest an roughest of em I felt em all here She held her hands tight against her breast An I b lieve I would have died for any one of em I reckon bein so crazy with pity had stretched me up out of bein a scary old maid into bein a mother I recollect there was two loose horses gallopin about They were wild with fear an they d gallop as hard as ever they could in one direction an then they d wheel round an come to a stand with their heads up an their tails cocked an nicker an snort over what they smelt an then take out again Well once they came chargin right down on us an I thought sure they were goin right over the men I never stopped to think I ran straight out in front of em wavin my arms an hollerin They just missed gallopin right over me But I didn t care I b lieve I d almost have been glad It was like I said I wanted to be hurt too That was because it was all so lonesome for em Death an sufferin is a lonesome thing she stated gravely When they d scream I felt like I d tear my heart out to help em But all I could do was just to stand on the outside like an watch em sufferin an maybe dryin inside there all alone That s why it seemed like bein hurt too would make it easier Well along late in the night the guns broke out again awful loud an presently off against the sky I saw red streaks of flame go up in two places an I knew they were towns on fire I just stopped still an looked an thought what it was like with the folks scurryin round like rats an the fire an the shells rainin down on em That s Hell right over there I says out loud to myself an then I went on down to the creek faster than ever Maybe I was gettin kind of lightheaded then an God knows it was enough to make anybody so anyhow I felt like I had to hold Hell back It was loose right over there an the only thing that held it off was the cup of water an the little prayer So I kept on back an forth back an forth from the creek faster an faster I thought if I missed one of em it would let Hell in on all the rest so I kept on an on The guns were boomin an the flames goin up into the sky an all Hell was loose but the little prayer an the cup of water was holdin it back An then at last when it commenced to freshen for dawn I knew I d won She drew a deep breath and paused looking up at me with clear far away eyes That was because I knew He was there she said He I questioned awestruck by her tone She nodded Yes God she answered simply An after that that terrible lonesomeness melted all away I knew that though I had to stand outside an see em suffer He was inside there with em closer to em even than they was to themselves So I knew it wasn t really lonesome for em even if they were sufferin an dyin An I m right sure that a good many of em got to know that too anyhow the faces of some of the ones that had died looked that way when I saw em in the mornin Maybe it was because I cared so much myself that I kind of broke through into knowin how much more God cared Folks always talk like He was a father way off in the sky but I got to know that night that what was really God was something big an close right in your own heart that was a heap more like a big mother An it was all bigger an sort of simpler than I d ever thought it would be Right over there was Hell an big guns an men killin each other but here where we were were just stars overhead an folks that you could do things for an God I reckon that s the way she said with her grave simplicity when things get too awful you suffer through to God an He turns you back to the simplest things just the little prayer an the cup of water for men that were like sick children This is the cup she added holding it out for my inspection An an that s all I reckon she concluded When daylight came the stretcher bearers did get through to us There was a sort of doctor officer with them an I never in my life saw any one look so tired Who are you an what in thunder are you doing here he stormed out at me only I don t say it as strong as he did I reckon I must have looked like a wild woman I had lost my hat and my hair was all falling down an I only had on my short alpaca underskirt cause I d taken off my dress skirt to make a pillow like I said but I just stood right up in the midst of all those poor bodies an says I m Miss Smithson Sadie Virginia Smithson an I ve been holdin Hell back all night I knew I was talkin crazy but I didn t care like the way you do comin out of ether He stared at me for a spell an then he says kind of funny Well Miss Sadie Virginia I m glad you held some of it back for everybody else in the world was letting it loose last night He was mighty kind to me though an helped get me to one of the base hospitals an from there over to England But I don t know what happened to the professor an his party Well I ventured after a long pause and not knowing quite what to say the Laurel Literary Society will be glad enough to have you belong to it now She flashed bolt upright at that her eyes staring at me But but you don t understand she cried breathlessly I ve been face to face with war an death an Hell an God I ve been born again do you reckon any of them little old things matter now I was stunned by the white look of her face What does matter now I whispered at last Nothin she answered nothin but God an love an doin things for folks That was why I had to tell you mister SQUEM BY ARTHUR RUSSELL TAYLOR Why do we go on perpetuating an uncomfortable breed The man who was shaving at the mirror paneled door of the Pullman smoking compartment looked at his questioner on the leather seat opposite Give it up he answered Why is a hen The first man rapped his pipe empty on the edge of a cuspidor You answer the question he said in the only possible way by asking another Right answered the shaver and began to run the hot water A closely built man in a suit so heavily striped as to seem stripes before it was a suit lurched into the compartment and settled himself to his paper and cigar That monkey on a stick he presently broke out is still taking good money away from the asses who go to hear him rant about God and Hell and all the rest up in Boston I am so damn tired of him and of that rich rough neck Freeze It s the limit Pretty much said the man with the pipe I was reading about the Belgians just before you came in and when I jumped away from them I lit on some things about Poland Then I wondered aloud to this gentleman why we go on multiplying increasing such an uncomfortable breed Modoc gods and degenerate millionaires make one wonder more What is your line may I ask inquired the stripe suited man Religion The hell I beg your pardon If you mean that you re a preacher or something like that all I ve got to say is you re a funny one It s your job isn t it to be dead sure that everything s all right or somehow going to be all right no matter about all the mussed upness Yes that s certainly your job Yet here you are asking why we go on stocking the world with kids I might ask that I m in rubber tires but not you Yes I might only I don t The man who had been shaving had resumed his tie collar and coat and now lighted a cigarette I lay my money he said on one thing that if men let themselves go they wind up shortly with God or with what would be God if there were any You ve come to it early through the Ledger You d have got to it sooner or later though if you d been talking about hunting dogs provided you d have let yourselves go Well now asked the closely built man what is your line Education High brow company Seems to me the pair of you ought to be silencers for a plain business man like me Rubber is my line not how the world is run My opinion on that is small change sure Yet I think it ought to be run the world I mean even if it s mussed up to the limit and I think it s up to us to keep it running The parson here if he is a parson asks why we should that is if I get him And then I think there s a manager of it all in the central office a manager understand though he never seems to show up around the works and certainly does seem to have some of the darnedest ways The professor here if he is a professor doesn t sense any manager that is if I get him straight with his if there were any That was what you said wasn t it I m a picked chicken on religion and education but honest both those ideas would mean soft tires for me yes sir soft tires Broad Street gentlemen said the porter at the door The Reverend Allan Dare walked away from the train and down the street He was Episcopally faced and Episcopally trim and he was having considerable difficulty in holding his universe together This is not pleasant at forty two when you want your universe held together and things settled and calm He had an uncomfortable sense that this difficulty had jolted into plain sight on the car Ass he addressed himself briefly To let your sag and unsettlement loose in that way To say such a thing as you said and in such a place To parade your momentary distrust of life Ass oh ass He said or thought a Prayer Book collect one which seemed rather suited to asses and continued I suppose I m three tenths sag no more and He knoweth whereof we are made and what a devil of a world it is to be in just now But that rubber man on the car he isn t sag at all Heavens his crudeness His beastly clothes and the bare shaved welt around the back of his neck and that awful seal ring But he s fastened Life is worth pushing at and cheering for and there s a manager if he has the darnedest ways I d give something for an every minute mood like that a carrying night and day sureness like that He s not illuminated lucky dog Professor William Emory Browne had changed cars and was continuing his journey In his lap lay a volume of essays just put forth by a member of his craft a college professor He opened it it chanced at page twenty seven and his eye was caught by the name of his own specialty He read Philosophy is the science which proves that we can know nothing of the soul Medicine is the science which tells that we know nothing of the body Political Economy is that which teaches that we know nothing of the laws of wealth and Theology the critical history of those errors from which we deduce our ignorance of God Confound it ejaculated Professor Browne and closed the book Room for one more inquired a voice and the rubber tire man slid into the seat I just pulled off a little thing out here he said that ought to put a small star in my crown A down and out a tough looker says to me Please mister give me a dime I m hungry And I says to him Get out What you want is a good drink go get it and slips him a quarter Talk about gratitude To think there are men you know it and I know it and he was afraid of it who d have steered him to a quick lunch and put him against soft boiled eggs Man s inhumanity to man Sure Nothing but that ever makes me any trouble about things Tear ninety George this to the conductor and burn this panetella some time You said you were in education he went on I ve just blown myself to a Universal History five big volumes with lots of maps and pictures and flags of all nations and hanging gardens of Babylon and such things Gave down thirty five for it and my name is printed Peter B Squem on the first page of every book Now mister Squem grew quite earnest you d say wouldn t you that if a man could take those books down chew them up you understand and take them down he d have an education Not the same of course as normal school or college and yet an education I think if you know what s good for you you will steer clear of what you call an education I think I should stick to rubber tires and a few comfortable certainties and peace mister Squem stared How s that he inquired Education is your line you were saying and yet you queer your stuff I d get quick word from the house if I handled Mercury tires that way But you wouldn t rejoined Professor Browne you wouldn t because tires mean something Tires are your life preserver they are shaped like life preservers aren t they You ve got me going said mister Squem and no mistake I don t mind telling you I d hoped to get some hunch from you on education You see my clothes are right I always have a room with bath and I get two hundred a month and fifty on the side I read the papers and the magazine section on Sunday and I got through four books last year And yet there s something not there by Keefer not there I d give something to get it there to slide it under somehow and bring the rest of me up to regular manicuring and ice cream forks and the way my clothes fit mister Squem was interrupted in the expression of this craving There was a tremendous jar the car tore and bumped with an immense pounding over the ties then careened and sprawled down a short bank and settled on its side People who have been through such an experience will require no description To others none can be given In the bedlam chaos and jumble and chorus of shrieks and smashing glass Professor Browne struggling up through the bodies which had been hurled upon him was conscious of a pain almost intolerably sharp in his leg and then of a sort of striped whirlwind which seemed to be everywhere at once extricating calming ordering comforting and swearing It was like a machine gun Keep your clothes on nothing s going to bite you just a little shake up Yes chick we ll find your ma No you don t climb over those people sit down or I ll help you To hell with your valise pick up that child There go the axes everybody quiet now just where he is You with the side whiskers get back back hear me Now children first hand em along women next so men last Why didn t you say you was a doctor Get out there quick some of those people have got broke and need you Professor Browne was one of these last Lifted by Peter Squem and a very scared brakeman he lay on two Pullman mattresses at the side of the track waiting for the rabbit faced country doctor to reach him He was suffering very much it seemed to him that he had never really known pain before but his attention went to a white haired lady near by a slight slender woman with breeding written all over her She had made her way from the drawing room of the Pullman and leaned heavily upon her maid in a state approaching collapse Professor Browne was impressed by her air of distinction even in the midst of his pain Then he saw a striped arm supportingly encircle her and a hand dominated by an enormous seal ring press to her lips an open bottle of Scotch Let it trickle down auntie right down It s just what you need said Peter B Squem What did you think of when the car stopped rolling Professor Browne lying in his bed asked this question of mister Squem sitting at its side The latter had got the professor home to his house and his housekeeper after the accident the day before had found the best surgeon in town and stood by while he worked had in a dozen ways helped a bad business to go as well as possible and now having remained over night was awaiting the hour of his train Think of Nothing No time I was that cross eyed boy you ve heard about the one at the three ringed circus Did you see that newly wed rooster I ll bet he was that the one with the celluloid collar Good bye Maude he yells and then tries to butt himself through the roof He wouldn t have left one sound rib in the car if I hadn t pinned him No I hadn t any time to think He produced and consulted a watch one that struck the professor as being almost too loud an ornament for a Christmas tree An infant s face showed within as the case opened Your baby inquired Professor Browne Never Not good enough This kid I found where do you suppose On a picture postal at a news stand The picture was no good except the kid and I cut him out you see Say do you know the picture was painted by a man out in Montana Yes sir Montana They had the cards made over in Europe somewhere Dagoes likely and when they put his name on it they didn t do a thing to that word Montana Some spelling Why what you have there said the professor taking the watch with interest is the Holy Child of Andrea Mantegna s Circumcision it s in the Uffizi at Florence Singularly good it is too I m very much wrapped up in the question raised in a late book of Mantegna s influence upon Giovanni Bellini There s a rather fine point made in connection with another child in this same picture a larger one pressing against his mother s knees mister Squem was perfectly uncomprehending Come again he remarked No you needn t either for I don t know anything about the rest of the picture I told you it was no good There was an old party in a funny bathrobe and with heavy Belshazzars I remember but the picture was this He rose and began to get into his overcoat There s one thing about this kid he said in a casual tone which somehow let earnestness through I know a man he travels out of Phillie and he s some booze artist and other things that go along who s got one of those little Josephs You know those little dolls that Catholics tote around Separate him from it Not on your life Why he missed it one night on a sleeper and he cussed and reared around and made the coon rout everybody out till he found it It s luck you see Now this kid mister Squem was pulling on his gloves isn t luck but he works like luck He talks to me understand and here a pause he puts all sorts of cussedness on the blink You can t look at him and be an Indian I was making the wrong sort of date in Trenton one day and I saw him just in time sent the girl word I d been called out of town I was figuring on the right time to pinch a man in the door he d done me dirty and I saw him again Good night I m never so punk that he doesn t ginger me doesn t look good to me The management is mixed up with him and I hook up to him Here s the taxi So long professor Rats I haven t done one little thing Good luck to your game leg It was Sunday morning and service was under way in the Church of the Holy Faith For the thousandth time the Reverend Allan Dare had dearly beloved his people assembled to the number of four hundred before him exhorting them in such forthright English as cannot be written nowadays not to dissemble nor cloak their sins before God and to accompany him unto the throne of the heavenly grace He had had a sick feeling as he read this exhortation so full of pound rhythm heart search and splendid good sense to the courteous abstractedness in the pews Heavens he had thought once this burnt in He had wanted to shriek or fire a pistol in the air and then crush the meaning into his people crush God into them yes and into himself He was four tenths sag that morning the reverend Allan Dare In the Jubilate a small choir boy a phenomenon who was paid a thousand a year and was responsible for the presence of not a few of the four hundred had sung Be sure ye that the Lord he is God to the ravishment of the congregation not of the rector who stood looking dead ahead The First Lesson had been all about Jonadab the son of Rechab and drinking no wine frightful ineptness What could it mean to any one how help any one Here was Life with all its cruel tangles tighter and more choking every day Here was Arnold s darkling plain and the confused alarms and the ignorant armies clashing by night There came back to Dare the creed he had heard in the smoking compartment I think it ought to be run the world even if it s mussed up to the limit and I think it s up to us to keep it running I think there s a manager of it all in the central office a manager understand though he never seems to show up around the works and certainly does seem to have some of the darnedest ways O God breathed Allan Dare there are so many things so many things It was the same Sunday Professor William Emory Browne was for the first time on crutches and stood supported by them at his window Back again he ruminated I can probably drive to my classes in another week Then the same old grind showing ingenuous youth who fortunately will not see it how the search hath taught me that the search is vain Ho hum How very kind that mister Squem he did so much for me and how very funny I should like to produce him at the seminar with his just right clothes his dream of culture via his Universal History his approach to reality through a picture postal card He turned on himself almost savagely Then What the devil are you patronizing him for Don t you see that he is hooked to something and you are not that he is warm and you are freezing that he is part of the wave the wave man and that you are just a miserable tossing clot It was the same Sunday mister Squem sat in his room extremely dennish smitingly red as to walls oppressive with plush upholstery A huge deerhead jutting from over the mantel divided honors with a highly colored September Morn affrontingly framed On a shelf stood a small bottle It contained a finger of mister Squem amputated years before in alcohol On the knees of the owner of the room was Volume One of the Universal History Number thirty two so red ink figures affirmed of a limited edition of five hundred sets mister Squem s name was displayed in very large Old English on the fly leaf and above was an empty oval wherein his portrait might be placed No use soliloquized the owner of this treasure no use If I could chew it up and get it down or two of it that wouldn t slide under the thing that isn t there Nothing will ever put me in the class of Professor Browne or that preacher on the car or bring the rest of me up to my clothes He rose and stretched Maybe he said addressing a huge chocolate colored bust of an Indian lady maybe I can catch up to those fellows some time but not here Noon I bet looking at his watch and it is to eat He contemplated the Mantegna baby So long he said you re running things and snapped his watch BIOGRAPHICAL AND INTERPRETATIVE NOTES THE PRELIMINARIES Cornelia A P Comer accomplished critic essayist and writer of short stories was educated at Vassar and afterwards engaged in journalistic work in the Middle West and California She now lives in Seattle The plot of The Preliminaries might readily be told in a single paragraph Its significance lies in its lucid and austere psychology The young mister Oliver Pickersgill appears in four distinct situations and as we watch him in company with the four dominating and diverse personalities in turn we are engrossed in the swift and poignant play of his feelings feelings which finally deepen into a sincere and settled consciousness of attained truth and a confident loyalty to an imprisoned convict The verisimilitude of both situation and conversation is complete and in the process there is no exhaustion of emotional values Henry James would not have treated the situations with more clarity The author s further treatment of the problems connected with marriage is seen in two other noteworthy Atlantic stories The Kinzer Portraits and The Long Inheritance BUTTERCUP NIGHT JOHN GALSWORTHY an English novelist of much distinction and a playwright who has proved that the possession of ideas is not incompatible with popular success Endowed with an exquisite sense of pity he has put that sentiment to many chivalrous uses and since the war he has written in the public service on behalf of various patriotic and humanitarian objects Thus mister Galsworthy was described in the London Gazette as a recipient of the honor of knighthood in the list of New Year nineteen eighteen Honors his declination not having been received in time to forestall the publication Buttercup Night is hardly a story at all In company with mister Galsworthy we live out the quiet but impressive experience of a single evening night and morning all the while breathing the atmosphere of a rare June beauty that completely wins us to its aesthetic favor and repose The incident of the sick horse so gently cared for by the faithful keeper secures our sympathy but does not draw us away from the more insistent wooing of the charms of the buttercup night and the morning radiance of a suddenly awakened glow of blooming yellow The commonplace writer would use the scene for romantic effect Galsworthy enhances the beauty of the setting by a homely but sincere realism The significant merits of the style are its purity its restraint and its complete adaptability to the hoveringly quiescent mood HEPATICAS Anne Douglas Sedgwick Madame Basil de Selincourt is of American birth but has lived in England since her childhood For many years she has found an admiring audience as a writer of novels and short stories In nineteen oh eight she was married to M de Selincourt The title of the story hints at a reliance upon mere setting And the hepatica bed with all that its associations signify certainly makes its generous atmospheric contribution to the charm of the narrative But as domestic entanglements begin to ensue our interest in the flowers is soon shifted to plot and theme Our sustained sympathy rests with the mother the mother who has created in her home an atmosphere of the truest and most sensibly refined culture The promising son sharing this atmosphere and even enriching it yields while at Aldershot before the war to the superficial charm of a chorus girl and marries her Her loud and garish presence in the home of quiet beauty and repose provides an interesting but tragic study in contrast and makes us continually more anxious as we watch its influence upon the mother yearning pityingly for her absent son yet plaintively relieved when news comes that he has been killed in the war Death has released him from the grim necessity of living his mismated life and caring for the child born of parents of such divergent types The supreme merit of the mother s character lies in her willing acceptance of the burdening problem The strength of the story as we view it in its entirety rests in a skillful merging of effects which allows final emphasis upon character portrayal and thematic situation POSSESSING PRUDENCE Amy Wentworth Stone is a resident of Boston who combines a pleasant sense of the ludicrous with a rare understanding of the spirit of childhood This miniature sketch of Amy Wentworth Stone s is admirably handled and sparkles with the best and kindliest humor a humor that is in no sense spoiled by the sins that rest so lightly upon the imaginative soul of little Prudence Jane Her sins hark quickly back to the childhood periods of each reader who sympathetically remembers the world of fancy which conflicted so loudly with dull realism The charm of this humorous tracery will invite a rereading of Miss Stone s similar triumph in Capital Punishments published in the Atlantic for November nineteen thirteen THE GLORY BOX Elizabeth Ashe is the pen name of Georgiana Pentlarge a young and promising story writer living in Boston The Glory Box is an unforgettable story Its accuracy in the matter of minor household details and commonplace neighborliness creates an atmosphere of intimate realism which readily wins our sympathetic credence in situation and event We grow easily familiar with the three or four characters who are introduced and then we discover our interest centering in two of these Eunice the sweetheart and Stephen the lover as in their separated lives each in fancy penetrates the daily routine and comes fondly to rest in thoughts and plans of marriage The story interest is enhanced by the contrast of their daily routine Eunice s time is spent in teaching relieved by friendly village companionship Stephen s in the arduous work of the Columbia Law School relieved by glimpses of fashionable life in Washington Square All this routine and hope and relaxation end in the tragedy that the earlier realism of the story grimly accentuates and intensifies The art of the story lies in the author s quiet control of situations which might so easily in the hands of a lesser craftsman run a riotous course in the field of pseudo sentiment THE SPIRIT OF THE HERD Dallas Lore Sharp well known as a keen observer both of nature and of human nature is Professor of English at Boston University I have asked permission to extract this episode from a longer article Professor Sharp was as generous in this as he has been helpful in other matters relating to selections which make up this volume of narratives The paragraphs which precede the present beginning are expository in nature and while they bear interestingly upon the incident they are not a necessary part of the narrative The selection breathes the very atmosphere of highly hazardous adventure and even though the writer quickly generates in us a feeling of confidence in the superior powers of Ranchman Wade and Peroxide Jim we nevertheless restlessly live through the moments of the wild stampede as it makes its mad and frightened way along the perilous edge of the rim rock IN THE PASHA S GARDEN H G Dwight is the son of an American missionary to the Near East and lived for many years in Constantinople Being compelled to leave Turkey after her entrance into the war he returned to the United States and is now in the government service mister Dwight in this Stamboul romance has invested his scenes with the languorous and mystical spirit of the orientalism in which his characters so naturally move We are here far away from the O Henry type of story with its startling cleverness crisp humor and ingenious surprise We share instead the leisure and luxury of this eastern way of living felt all the more strongly because of the presence of the French wife whose independent customs and bearing offend the servants of the easy going Pasha The interest however is not confined to the atmosphere We are soon breathing the mystery of the kiosque a mystery which the author never fully solves but leaves silently merged in the intangible charm of the pervading orientalism LITTLE SELVES Mary Lerner a story writer of Cambridge Massachusetts first won attention by the publication of Little Selves in the Atlantic Monthly I have included this selection because it reveals so delicately and so immediately that quality which we may somewhat paradoxically call romantic realism The scenes which Miss Lerner s old Irish woman so intimately recalls are all peopled by the real creatures of a remembered past principally her little selves as they lived through their childish joys and sorrows and swiftly sequent perplexities But each of these experiences so intimately and realistically portrayed is seen through memories tinged with the charm of a happy Celtic romance THE FAILURE Charles Caldwell Dobie is a young writer living in San Francisco mister Dobie has in this story shown himself more than a mere realist The realistic details of John Scidmore s home the early morning routine of the insurance office the evening splendor of Julia Norris s hotel apartments all are graphically re created But the central idea is an ethical one John Scidmore s wavering action in the midst of a business situation where a frank admission of gross neglect was morally imperative His immediate failure to meet the situation is grimly contrasted with his wife s expressed faith in his honesty The story presents a graphic instance of a righteous act silently directed by a strongly influencing personality It closes with this particular problem solved but we end the reading with many interesting and conflicting surmises concerning the future domestic life in the Scidmore home BUSINESS IS BUSINESS Henry Seidel Canby essayist and critic and occasional writer of stories is a Professor of English at the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale University His books include several volumes on the short story The commercial theme has been freely exploited by the popular magazine writers When it is written merely for the sake of getting in line with a popular trend it is likely to be empty and blusterous In mister Canby s story we are of course interested in the business atmosphere but we are more deeply interested in the portrayal of character Cargan is most fully drawn and we watch him with increasing keenness as we see him dominated by the various moods which the other personalities and the shifting incidents and the changing environment engender The skill shown in the rapid but graphic sketching of missus Cargan and missus Waldron is equally engaging The story is perfect in its mastery of narrative technique NOTHING Zephine Humphrey missus Fahnestock long a contributor of essays and stories to the Atlantic is the author of a novel entitled Grail Fire In this and other contributions to the Atlantic Miss Humphrey has shown an acute sensitiveness to atmosphere and personality We are here charmingly led into an intimate understanding of the surroundings and character of the little blind woman who lives her lonely life in the simple cottage where in preparation for the imminent affliction she had long ago learned to do her work in the silent dark The story has almost no plot interest for we trace no significant movement of events except the few which are fragmentarily imparted in confidential retrospect The quietness of the style is in thorough keeping with the secured tone one of those happy revelations so difficult to accomplish yet when once accomplished suggesting by its inevitable touch the easy process of mastership A MOTH OF PEACE missus Katharine Fullerton Gerould distinguished as a writer of essays and stories and novels is the wife of Gordon Hall Gerould Professor at Princeton Aside from the unusually strong and flowing style here so impressively revealed we have a story marked by a sympathetic penetration into the atmosphere of Andecy an atmosphere when first felt richly laden with the languor of a lonely and pervading provincial peace This peace is suddenly broken by the rumors and processes of war and we feel the dread of the impending German attack and the personal solicitude of Miss Stanley the American heroine lovingly anxious for the fate of her English fiance Nearer and nearer comes the threatened danger Finally the heroine goes out to meet the troop of enemy soldiers without the gates whether to meet a tragic end the author does not say There is little dialogue and little haste in the action The narrative is continuously guided by the controlling spirit of Miss Stanley who grimly triumphs over the fear and dread of the perilous situation Her body may have suffered defeat her soul is splendidly victorious The author s skill at the end is finely revealed in the graphic portrayal of the psychology of the situation IN NO STRANGE LAND Katharine Butler a young writer of few and distinctive stories lives at Danvers Massachusetts The significant merit of this story is the mystical creation of a man s experience with death The things of earth and heaven become perplexingly intermingled Realism becomes strongly blended with the thoughts that move in weird circles on the tenuous wings of wanton fancy and we live a puzzled moment as we try to visualize the man s experiences in his new realm of consciousness with its incredible freedom and joy The whole narrative is wrought in the delicate tracery of one whose temperament is obviously the temperament of a poet LITTLE BROTHER Madeleine Z Doty of New York learned the true story of Little Brother when at The Hague in the summer of nineteen fifteen as a delegate to the Woman s International Congress Miss Doty is a lawyer by profession by practice a writer investigator and traveler With terrible concreteness Little Brother weights our soul sense with the horror and tragedy of war The story is told with a bared realism which the poignancy of the occasion freely extenuates In short crisp sentences the opening scene is exposed There follow in dizzy succession and in the same quick breathing style the little tragic ordeals that fill the story with a terrible passion It penetrates the very essence of our being and starkly confronts us with the bleak mystery of the existing condition of world carnage a carnage that wantonly wreaks its unselected vengeance on little sufferers unskilled and unschooled in squaring their strength to ill proportioned trials WHAT ROAD GOETH HE F J Louriet is a pseudonym representing the dual authorship of Captain and missus F J Green long of Australia and now of Honolulu By the free but not too lavish use of sea terms and common sailor talk we are brought into immediate and intimate knowledge of the affairs of a ship floundering in a storm Through graphic sensory images with their vivid and varied appeals the whole perilous situation is wonderfully intensified Seldom indeed are details better massed to secure an intended effect But the interest later comes to centre in the great theme of sacrifice a sacrifice all the more significant because it is performed with such absolute spontaneity The story is a noteworthy example of strong effect secured with great economy of time and material THE CLEARER SIGHT Ernest Starr a writer of occasional stories lives in North Carolina The most interesting element in mister Ernest Starr s narrative is the dramatic conflict of emotions Placed first in the gnomish atmosphere of a chemical laboratory the tone soon changes from scientific to ethical each interest being intensified and directed by the deep emotion of romantic love A serious accident in the laboratory creates the crisis it reveals to Noakes the young scientist the inexcusable baseness in his character a baseness which allowed him to act with direct disloyalty to his employer and with somewhat obvious disloyalty to the ideals cherished by the girl whom he loved The situation is finally relieved by his confessions and by the physician s hope that the young scientist s physical blindness is not necessarily permanent The author shows unusual skill in dialogue in analysis and in the handling of both conventional and dramatic situations THE GARDEN OF MEMORIES C A Mercer is an American author who has unfortunately been altogether silent of late years In this story the traditions and influence of Hawthorne are picturesquely revived The experience is one which is a bit fragile and tenuous but to readers who reproduce in their fancy the more delicate picturings of their childhood who delight in the re creation of mood who frequently re live their childhood sentiments to all such will come a sense of pleasure in the contemplation of the tracery here so artistically etched THE CLEAREST VOICE Margaret Sherwood a singularly sincere and graceful writer is Professor of English Literature at Wellesley College The clear voice which here speaks under Miss Sherwood s guidance is the voice of the absent And individually as we read the story we listen sympathetically to the separate messages of those voices which have entered sympathetically into our past experiences and wisely guided or wisely thwarted our separate deeds A Harvard graduate who had taken Professor Charles Eliot Norton s course in fine arts was years afterward selecting a cravat pin in a jeweler s shop in Paris As he finally decided upon one of plain simple and silently impressive design he said I think Professor Norton would have chosen this In decisions minor and in decisions major we are almost invariably influenced by the unconscious thought of those whose counsel we value This significant truth Miss Sherwood has impressively revealed in The Clearest Voice THE MARBLE CHILD E Nesbit missus Hubert Bland is an English writer who for many years has enjoyed widespread and deserved popularity as a writer of children s books The world where children live is so full of amazing and incredible looking things that turn out to be quite real This sentence from the story supplies us with the theme the wording of the bald analyst requires For him who simply reads for the mere narrative no such analyzing is really necessary provided there still linger with him the manifold fancies that peopled his childhood Of course Ernest was an extraordinary child like Shelley or William Blake it may be Just such a child as Hawthorne would adore To appreciate the story in all its fineness we must ourselves have something of that abnormality Else we shall be as impervious as the crinolined aunts and as unsympathetic toward Ernest s experience as are some readers to Hawthorne s fanciful Snow Image THE ONE LEFT E V Lucas is an English essayist a lover and biographer of Lamb known for many delicate and appreciative essays and for books of travel in familiar places It is semi occasionally only that mister Lucas addresses himself to fiction This admirably written story so brief as to be little more than a sketch is rich in emotional values which are safely held within the bonds of restraint Scientifically I am told there is nothing wrong in the description of the ingenious device which provides the means for the expression of the emotion though readers unfamiliar with such devices may question the verisimilitude of the action It is but one instance among thousands which provide modern literature with a broadened range within the field of realism THE LEGACY OF RICHARD HUGHES Margaret Lynn member of the English Department of the State University of Kansas at Lawrence is best known for her sympathetic appreciation of prairie life This story is a tragedy the tragedy of a wife s failure to understand the finer side of her husband s nature She learns her misjudgment all too late when the husband lies dead The emotional values are the greater because the reader inevitably contemplates the long years they lived together in their isolation The psychology of the situation is portrayed with remarkable clarity The method is very different from the method of such writers as de Maupassant De Maupassant s analysis and dissecting is usually done with cold and relentless indifference Miss Lynn s processes are here carried out determinedly but with full and lingering sympathy OF WATER AND THE SPIRIT Margaret P Montague living among the West Virginia mountains has written many successful stories of the Hill people whom she knows so well The chain of incidents narrated by the simple hearted Virginia dressmaker is of absorbing interest and seems to be the real experiences of one who had actually endured the tragedy of having lived in the horror of the aftermath of battle But even more interesting than these scenes of pitiful suffering is the effect produced upon the woman who endures it all Her whole attitude toward life was changed What matters it now that her father was not an aristocratic Virginian What if she were a poor dressmaker at the little village of Johnson s Falls What though she was not elected a member of the Laurel Literary Society She had been face to face with war and death and Hell and God The little things of life had unconsciously sunk away and the great enduring themes had boldly emerged to re create her spiritual self mister SQUEM Reverend Arthur Russell Taylor Rector of the Episcopal Church at York Pennsylvania whose career as a writer of fiction opened so auspiciously with mister Squem and a few companion stories died very suddenly early in January nineteen eighteen Here the central interest is in character In creating such a personage as mister Squem the writer of this story has boldly penetrated the veneer of culture and shown us that the character elements which are of enduring worth may be far aloof from any knowledge of art or religion or philosophy or any form of polite learning It is interesting to note the part which the railroad wreck plays in this story While there is enough in the situation to have made the wreck a point of central objective interest it is utilized here simply as the background for the display of mister Squem genial direct efficient ingenuous dominating interestingly crude In the February nineteen eighteen Atlantic mister Squem is equally interesting in a different environment Soon after the death of Reverend Arthur Russell Taylor Bishop James Henry Darlington sent to the Atlantic office an interesting appreciation of doctor Taylor s work and character From Bishop Darlington we learn that doctor Taylor had for years been suffering from a tumor on the brain which had totally destroyed the sight of one eye and which by its pressure caused him constant pain sleepless nights and the gradual failing of the other eye Like Robert Louis Stevenson he was cheerful and brightened the lives of others until the very last and almost his final writings were sent to The Atlantic The following corrections were made by the etext transcriber the chops looks so tasty the chops look so tasty had never critized had never criticized FOOTNOTES one The Atlantic Monthly vol one hundred
