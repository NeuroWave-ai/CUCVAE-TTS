written in eighteen oh four were not numerous and with the exception of The Small Celandine the stanzas beginning I wandered lonely as a cloud and She was a Phantom of delight they were less remarkable than those of the two preceding and the three following years Wordsworth s poetical activity in eighteen oh four is not recorded however in Lyrical Ballads or Sonnets but in The Prelude much of which was thought out and afterwards dictated to Dorothy or Mary Wordsworth on the terrace walk of Lancrigg during that year while the Ode Intimations of Immortality was altered and added to although it did not receive its final form till eighteen oh six In the sixth book of The Prelude p two hundred twenty two the lines occur Four years and thirty told this very week Have I been now a sojourner on earth That part of the great autobiographical poem must therefore have been composed in April eighteen oh four Ed SHE WAS A PHANTOM OF DELIGHT Composed eighteen oh four Published eighteen oh seven Written at Town end Grasmere The germ of this poem was four lines composed as a part of the verses on the Highland Girl Though beginning in this way it was written from my heart as is sufficiently obvious I F One of the Poems of the Imagination Ed She was a Phantom of delight When first she gleamed upon my sight A A lovely Apparition sent To be a moment s ornament Her eyes as stars of Twilight fair five Like Twilight s too her dusky hair But all things else about her drawn From May time and the cheerful Dawn one A dancing Shape an Image gay To haunt to startle and way lay ten I saw her upon nearer view A Spirit yet a Woman too Her household motions light and free And steps of virgin liberty A countenance in which did meet fifteen Sweet records promises as sweet A Creature not too bright or good For human nature s daily food For transient sorrows simple wiles Praise blame love kisses tears and smiles twenty And now I see with eye serene The very pulse of the machine A Being breathing thoughtful breath A Traveller between two life and death The reason firm the temperate will twenty five Endurance foresight strength and skill A perfect Woman three nobly planned To warn to comfort and command And yet a Spirit still and bright With something of angelic light four thirty VARIANTS ON THE TEXT Variant one eighteen oh seven From May time s brightest liveliest dawn

Another maid there was who also shed A gladness o er that season then to me By her exulting outside look of youth And placid under countenance first endeared Book vi l two hundred twenty four She came no more a phantom to adorn A moment but an inmate of the heart And yet a spirit there for me enshrined To penetrate the lofty and the low Book xiv l two hundred sixty eight Ed It is not easy to say what were the four lines composed as a part of the verses on the Highland Girl which the Fenwick note tells us was the germ of this poem They may be lines now incorporated in those To a Highland Girl vol ii p three hundred eighty nine or they may be lines in the present poem which Wordsworth wrote at first for the Highland Girl but afterwards transferred to this one They may have been the first four lines of the later poem The two should be read consecutively and compared After Wordsworth s death a writer in the Daily News January eighteen fifty nine then understood to be Miss Harriet Martineau wrote thus In the Memoirs by the nephew of the poet it is said that these verses refer to missus Wordsworth but for half of Wordsworth s life it was always understood that they referred to some other phantom which gleamed upon his sight before Mary Hutchinson This statement is much more than improbable it is I think disproved by the Fenwick note They cannot refer to the Lucy of the Goslar poems and Wordsworth indicates as plainly as he chose to whom they actually do refer Compare the honorable Justice Coleridge s account of a conversation with Wordsworth Memoirs vol ii p three hundred six in which the poet expressly said that the lines were written on his wife The question was however set at rest in a conversation of Wordsworth with Henry Crabb Robinson who wrote in his Diary on May twelve eighteen forty two Wordsworth said that the poems Our walk was far among the ancient trees vol ii p one hundred sixty seven then She was a Phantom of delight B and finally the two sonnets To a Painter should be read in succession as exhibiting the different phases of his affection to his wife Diary Reminiscences and Correspondence of Henry Crabb Robinson vol iii p one hundred ninety seven The use of the word machine in the third stanza of the poem has been much criticised but for a similar use of the term see the sequel to The Waggoner p one hundred seven Forgive me then for I had been On friendly terms with this Machine See also Hamlet act II scene ii l one hundred twenty four Thine evermore most dear lady whilst this machine is to him The progress of mechanical industry in Britain since the beginning of the present century has given a more limited and purely technical meaning to the word than it bore when Wordsworth used it in these two instances Ed Footnote B The poet expressly told me that these verses were on his wife H C R I WANDERED LONELY AS A CLOUD Composed eighteen oh four Published eighteen oh seven Town end eighteen oh four The two best lines in it are by Mary The daffodils grew and still grow on the margin of Ullswater and probably may be seen to this day as beautiful in the month of March nodding their golden heads beside the dancing and foaming waves I F This was No VII in the series of Poems entitled in the edition of eighteen oh seven Moods of my own Mind In eighteen fifteen and afterwards it was classed by Wordsworth among his Poems of the Imagination Ed I wandered lonely as a cloud That floats on high o er vales and hills When all at once I saw a crowd A host of golden one daffodils Beside the lake beneath the trees five Fluttering and dancing in the breeze two Continuous as the stars that shine And twinkle on the milky way They stretched in never ending line Along the margin of a bay ten Ten thousand saw I at a glance Tossing their heads in sprightly dance three The waves beside them danced but they Out did the sparkling waves in glee A poet could not but be gay four fifteen In such a jocund five company I gazed and gazed but little thought What wealth the show to me had brought For oft when on my couch I lie In vacant or in pensive mood twenty They flash upon that inward eye Which is the bliss of solitude And then my heart with pleasure fills And dances with the daffodils VARIANTS ON THE TEXT Variant one eighteen fifteen dancing eighteen oh seven Variant two eighteen fifteen Along the Lake beneath the trees Ten thousand dancing in the breeze eighteen oh seven Variant three This stanza was added in the edition of eighteen fifteen Variant four eighteen oh seven be but gay eighteen thirty six The eighteen forty edition returns to the text of eighteen oh seven Variant five eighteen fifteen laughing eighteen oh seven The following is from Dorothy Wordsworth s Journal under date Thursday April fifteen eighteen oh two When we were in the woods beyond Gowbarrow Park we saw a few daffodils close to the water side We fancied that the sea had floated the seeds ashore and that the little colony had so sprung up But as we went along there were more and yet more and at last under the boughs of the trees we saw that there was a long belt of them along the shore about the breadth of a country turnpike road I never saw daffodils so beautiful They grew among the mossy stones about and above them some rested their heads upon these stones as on a pillow for weariness and the rest tossed and reeled and danced and seemed as if they verily laughed with the wind that blew upon them over the lake They looked so gay ever glancing ever changing This wind blew directly over the lake to them There was here and there a little knot and a few stragglers higher up but they were so few as not to disturb the simplicity unity and life of that one busy highway We rested again and again The bays were stormy and we heard the waves at different distances and in the middle of the water like the sea In the edition of eighteen fifteen there is a footnote to the lines They flash upon that inward eye Which is the bliss of solitude to the following effect The subject of these Stanzas is rather an elementary feeling and simple impression approaching to the nature of an ocular spectrum upon the imaginative faculty than an exertion of it The one which follows A is strictly a Reverie and neither that nor the next after it in succession Power of Music would have been placed here except for the reason given in the foregoing note The being placed here refers to its being included among the Poems of the Imagination The foregoing note is the note appended to The Horn of Egremont Castle and the reason given in it is to avoid a needless multiplication of the Classes into which Wordsworth divided his poems This note of one hundred eighty one B is reprinted mainly to show the difficulties to which Wordsworth was reduced by the artificial method of arrangement referred to The following letter to mister Wrangham is a more appropriate illustration of the poem of The Daffodils It was written the late Bishop of Lincoln says sometime afterwards See Memoirs of Wordsworth vol i pp one hundred eighty three one hundred eighty four and for the whole of the letter see a subsequent volume of this edition GRASMERE Nov four MY DEAR WRANGHAM I am indeed much pleased that missus Wrangham and yourself have been gratified by these breathings of simple nature You mention Butler Montagu s friend not Tom Butler but the conveyancer when I was in town in spring he happened to see the volumes lying on Montagu s mantelpiece and to glance his eye upon the very poem of The Daffodils Aye says he a fine morsel this for the Reviewers When this was told me for I was not present I observed that there were two lines in that little poem which if thoroughly felt would annihilate nine tenths of the reviews of the kingdom as they would find no readers The lines I alluded to were these They flash upon that inward eye Which is the bliss of solitude These two lines were composed by missus Wordsworth In eighteen seventy seven the daffodils were still growing in abundance on the shore of Ullswater below Gowbarrow Park Compare the last four lines of James Montgomery s poem The Little Cloud Bliss in possession will not last Remembered joys are never past At once the fountain stream and sea They were they are they yet shall be Ed Footnote A It was The Reverie of Poor Susan Ed Footnote B This is an error in the original printed text Evidently a year before the above mentioned publication in eighteen fifteen one of eighteen ten eighteen fifteen text Ed THE AFFLICTION OF MARGARET A Composed eighteen oh four Published eighteen oh seven Written at Town end Grasmere This was taken from the case of a poor widow who lived in the town of Penrith Her sorrow was well known to missus Wordsworth to my sister and I believe to the whole town She kept a shop and when she saw a stranger passing by she was in the habit of going out into the street to enquire of him after her son I F Included by Wordsworth among his Poems founded on the Affections Ed I Where art thou my beloved Son Where art thou worse to me than dead Oh find me prosperous or undone Or if the grave be now thy bed Why am I ignorant of the same five That I may rest and neither blame Nor sorrow may attend thy name II Seven years alas to have received No tidings of an only child To have despaired have hoped believed ten And been for evermore beguiled one Sometimes with thoughts of very bliss I catch at them and then I miss Was ever darkness like to this III He was among the prime in worth fifteen An object beauteous to behold Well born well bred I sent him forth Ingenuous innocent and bold If things ensued that wanted grace As hath been said they were not base twenty And never blush was on my face IV Ah little doth the young one dream When full of play and childish cares What power is in two his wildest scream Heard by his mother unawares twenty five He knows it not he cannot guess Years to a mother bring distress But do not make her love the less V Neglect me no I suffered long From that ill thought and being blind thirty Said Pride shall help me in my wrong Kind mother have I been as kind As ever breathed and that is true I ve wet my path with tears like dew Weeping for him when no one knew thirty five VI My Son if thou be humbled poor Hopeless of honour and of gain Oh do not dread thy mother s door Think not of me with grief and pain I now can see with better eyes forty And worldly grandeur I despise And fortune with her gifts and lies VII Alas the fowls of heaven have wings And blasts of heaven will aid their flight They mount how short a voyage brings forty five The wanderers back to their delight Chains tie us down by land and sea And wishes vain as mine may be All that is left to comfort thee VIII Perhaps some dungeon hears thee groan fifty Maimed mangled by inhuman men Or thou upon a desert thrown Inheritest the lion s den Or hast been summoned to the deep Thou thou and all thy mates to keep fifty five An incommunicable sleep IX I look for ghosts but none will force Their way to me tis falsely said That there was ever intercourse Between three the living and the dead sixty For surely then I should have sight Of him I wait for day and night With love and longings infinite X My apprehensions come in crowds I dread the rustling of the grass sixty five The very shadows of the clouds Have power to shake me as they pass I question things and do not find One that will answer to my mind And all the world appears unkind seventy XI Beyond participation lie My troubles and beyond relief If any chance to heave a sigh They pity me and not my grief Then come to me my Son or send seventy five Some tidings that my woes may end I have no

in eighteen twenty it was The Affliction of Margaret and in eighteen forty five it was as above In an early MS it was The Affliction of Mary of For an as yet unpublished Preface to it see volume viii of this edition Ed THE FORSAKEN Composed eighteen oh four Published eighteen forty two This was an overflow from The Affliction of Margaret and was excluded as superfluous there but preserved in the faint hope that it may turn to account by restoring a shy lover to some forsaken damsel My poetry has been complained of as deficient in interests of this sort a charge which the piece beginning Lyre though such power do in thy magic live will scarcely tend to obviate The natural imagery of these verses was supplied by frequent I might say intense observation of the Rydal torrent What an animating contrast is the ever changing aspect of that and indeed of every one of our mountain brooks to the monotonous tone and unmitigated fury of such streams among the Alps as are fed all the summer long by glaciers and melting snows A traveller observing the exquisite purity of the great rivers such as the Rhone at Geneva and the Reuss at Lucerne when they issue out of their respective lakes might fancy for a moment that some power in nature produced this beautiful change with a view to make amends for those Alpine sullyings which the waters exhibit near their fountain heads but alas how soon does that purity depart before the influx of tributary waters that have flowed through cultivated plains and the crowded abodes of men I F Included by Wordsworth among his Poems founded on the Affections Ed The peace which others seek they find The heaviest storms not longest last Heaven grants even to the guiltiest mind An amnesty for what is past When will my sentence be reversed five I only pray to know the worst And wish as if my heart would burst O weary struggle silent years Tell seemingly no doubtful tale And yet they leave it short and fears ten And hopes are strong and will prevail My calmest faith escapes not pain And feeling that the hope is vain I think that he will come again REPENTANCE A PASTORAL BALLAD Composed eighteen oh four Published eighteen twenty Written at Town end Grasmere Suggested by the conversation of our next neighbour Margaret Ashburner I F This next neighbour is constantly referred to in Dorothy Wordsworth s Grasmere Journal Included in eighteen twenty among the Poems of Sentiment and Reflection in eighteen twenty seven and afterwards it was classed with those founded on the Affections Ed The fields which with covetous spirit we sold Those beautiful fields the delight of the day Would have brought us more good than a burthen of gold one Could we but have been as contented as they When the troublesome Tempter beset us said I five Let him come with his purse proudly grasped in his hand But Allan be true to me Allan we ll die two Before he shall go with an inch of the land There dwelt we as happy as birds in their bowers Unfettered as bees that in gardens abide ten We could do what we liked three with the land it was ours And for us the brook murmured that ran by its side But now we are strangers go early or late And often like one overburthened with sin With my hand on the latch of the half opened gate four fifteen I look at the fields but five I cannot go in When I walk by the hedge on a bright summer s day Or sit in the shade of my grandfather s tree A stern face it puts on as if ready to say What ails you that you must come creeping to me twenty With our pastures about us we could not be sad Our comfort was near if we ever were crost But the comfort the blessings and wealth that we had We slighted them all and our birth right was lost six Oh ill judging sire of an innocent son twenty five Who must now be a wanderer but peace to that strain Think of evening s repose when our labour was done The sabbath s return and its leisure s soft chain And in sickness if night had been sparing of sleep How cheerful at sunrise

DORA A ON BEING REMINDED THAT SHE WAS A MONTH OLD THAT DAY SEPTEMBER sixteen Composed September sixteen eighteen oh four Published eighteen fifteen Included by Wordsworth among his Poems of the Fancy Ed Hast thou then survived Mild Offspring of infirm humanity Meek Infant among all forlornest things The most forlorn one life of that bright star The second glory of the Heavens Thou hast five Already hast survived that great decay That transformation through the wide earth felt And by all nations In that Being s sight From whom the Race of human kind proceed A thousand years are but as yesterday ten And one day s narrow circuit is to Him Not less capacious than a thousand years But what is time What outward glory neither A measure is of Thee whose claims extend Through heaven s eternal year B Yet hail to Thee fifteen Frail feeble Monthling by that name methinks Thy scanty breathing time is portioned out Not idly Hadst thou been of Indian birth Couched on a casual bed of moss and leaves And rudely canopied by leafy boughs twenty Or to the churlish elements exposed On the blank plains the coldness of the night Or the night s darkness or its cheerful face Of beauty by the changing moon adorned Would with imperious admonition then twenty five Have scored thine age and punctually timed Thine infant history on the minds of those Who might have wandered with thee Mother s love Nor less than mother s love in other breasts Will among us warm clad and warmly housed thirty Do for thee what the finger of the heavens Doth all too often harshly execute For thy unblest coevals amid wilds Where fancy hath small liberty to grace The affections to exalt them or refine thirty five And the maternal sympathy itself Though strong is in the main a joyless tie Of naked instinct wound about the heart Happier far happier is thy lot and ours Even now to solemnise thy helpless state forty And to enliven in the mind s regard Thy passive beauty parallels have risen Resemblances or contrasts that connect Within the region of a father s thoughts Thee and thy mate and sister of the sky forty five And first thy sinless progress through a world By sorrow darkened and by care disturbed Apt likeness bears to hers through gathered clouds Moving untouched in silver purity And cheering oft times their reluctant gloom fifty Fair are ye both and both are free from stain But thou how leisurely thou fill saint thy horn With brightness leaving her to post along And range about disquieted in change And still impatient of the shape she wears fifty five Once up once down the hill one journey Babe That will suffice thee and it seems that now Thou hast fore knowledge that such task is thine Thou travellest so contentedly and sleep saint In such a heedless peace Alas full soon sixty Hath this conception grateful to behold Changed countenance like an object sullied o er By breathing mist and thine appears to be A mournful labour while to her is given Hope and a renovation without end sixty five That smile forbids the thought for on thy face Smiles are beginning like the beams of dawn To shoot and circulate smiles have there been seen Tranquil assurances that Heaven supports The feeble motions of thy life and cheers seventy Thy loneliness or shall those smiles be called Feelers of love put forth as if to explore This untried world and to prepare thy way Through a strait passage intricate and dim Such are they and the same are tokens signs seventy five Which when the appointed season hath arrived Joy as her holiest language shall adopt And Reason s godlike Power be proud to own FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT Footnote A The title from eighteen fifteen to eighteen forty five was Address to my Infant Daughter on being reminded that she was a Month old on that Day

the wall near the cottage and the kitten continued to leap up catching the leaves as here described The Infant was Dora J F One of the Poems of the Fancy In Henry Crabb Robinson s Diary et cetera

calm and frosty two air Of this morning bright and fair Eddying round and round they sink Softly slowly one might think ten From the motions that are made Every little leaf conveyed Sylph or Faery hither tending To this lower world descending Each invisible and mute fifteen In his wavering parachute But the Kitten how she starts Crouches stretches paws and darts three First at one and then its fellow Just as light and just as yellow twenty There are many now now one Now they stop and there are none What intenseness of desire In her upward eye of fire With a tiger leap half way twenty five Now she meets the coming prey Lets it go as fast and then Has it in her power again Now she works with three or four Like an Indian conjurer thirty Quick as he in feats of art Far beyond in joy of heart Were her antics played in the eye Of a thousand standers by Clapping hands with shout and stare thirty five What would little Tabby care For the plaudits of the crowd Over happy to be proud Over wealthy in the treasure Of her own exceeding pleasure forty Tis a pretty baby treat Nor I deem for me unmeet four Here for neither Babe nor five me Other play mate can I see Of the countless living things forty five That with stir of feet and wings In the sun or under shade Upon bough or grassy blade And with busy revellings Chirp and song and murmurings fifty Made this orchard s narrow space And this vale so blithe a place Multitudes are swept away Never more to breathe the day Some are sleeping some in bands fifty five Travelled into distant lands Others slunk to moor and wood Far from

it does and so bright and beautiful and in such profusion should not have been noticed earlier in English verse What adds much to the interest that attends it is its habit of shutting itself up and opening out according to the degree of light and temperature of the air I F In pencil on opposite page Has not Chaucer noticed it W W This was classed by Wordsworth among his Poems referring to the Period of Old Age Ed There is a Flower the lesser Celandine That shrinks like many more from cold and rain And the first moment that the sun may shine Bright as the sun himself one tis out again When hailstones have been falling swarm on swarm five Or blasts the green field and the trees distrest Oft have I seen it muffled up from harm In close self shelter like a Thing at rest But lately one rough day this Flower I passed And recognised it though an altered form ten Now standing forth an offering to the blast And buffeted at will by rain and storm I stopped and said with inly muttered voice It doth not love the shower nor seek the cold This neither is its courage nor its choice fifteen But its necessity in being old The sunshine may not cheer two it nor the dew It cannot help itself in its decay Stiff in its members withered changed of hue And in my spleen I smiled that it was grey twenty To be a Prodigal s Favourite then worse truth A Miser s Pensioner behold our lot O

house upon it for the sake of being near to Coleridge then living and likely to remain at Greta Hall near Keswick The severe necessities that prevented this arose from his domestic situation This little property with a considerable addition that still leaves it very small lies beautifully upon the banks of a rill that gurgles down the side of Skiddaw and the orchard and other parts of the

Beaumont in eighteen eleven Ed This little property at Applethwaite now belongs to mister Gordon Wordsworth the grandson of the poet It is a sunny dell only in its upper reaches above the spot where the cottage which still bears Wordsworth s name is built This sonnet and Sir George Beaumont s wish that Wordsworth and Coleridge should live so near each other as to be able to carry on joint literary labour recall the somewhat similar wish and proposal on the part of W Calvert unfolded in a letter from Coleridge to Sir Humphry Davy Ed VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA Composed eighteen oh four Published eighteen twenty The following Tale was written as an Episode in a work from which its length may perhaps exclude it A The facts are true no invention as to these has been exercised as none was needed W W eighteen twenty Written at Town end Grasmere Faithfully narrated though with the omission of many pathetic circumstances from the mouth of a French lady B who had been an eye and ear witness of all that was done and said Many long years after I was told that Dupligne was then a monk in the Convent of La Trappe I F This was included among the Poems founded on the Affections Ed O happy time of youthful lovers thus My story may begin O balmy time In which a love knot on a lady s brow Is fairer than the fairest star in heaven To such inheritance of blessed fancy five Fancy that sports more desperately with minds Than ever fortune hath been known to do The high born Vaudracour was brought by years Whose progress had a little overstepped His stripling prime A town of small repute ten Among the vine clad mountains of Auvergne Was the Youth s birth place There he wooed a Maid Who heard the heart felt music of his suit With answering vows Plebeian was the stock Plebeian though ingenuous the stock fifteen From which her graces and her honours sprung And hence the father of the enamoured Youth With haughty indignation spurned the thought Of such alliance From their cradles up With but a step between their several homes twenty Twins had they been in pleasure after strife And petty quarrels had grown fond again Each other s advocate each other s stay And in their happiest moments not content If more divided than a sportive pair one twenty five Of sea fowl conscious both that they are hovering Within the eddy of a common blast Or hidden only by the concave depth Of neighbouring billows from each other s sight Thus not without concurrence of an age thirty Unknown to memory was an earnest given By ready nature for a life of love For endless constancy and placid truth But whatsoe er of such rare treasure lay Reserved had fate permitted for support thirty five Of their maturer years his present mind Was under fascination he beheld A vision and adored the thing he saw Arabian fiction never filled the world With half the wonders that were wrought for him forty Earth breathed in one great presence of the spring Life turned the meanest of her

simple opening of a door Let itself in upon him pathways walks Swarmed with enchantment till his spirit sank Surcharged within him overblest to move fifty Beneath a sun that wakes a weary world To its dull round of ordinary cares A man too happy for mortality So passed the time till whether through effect Of some unguarded moment that dissolved fifty five Virtuous restraint ah speak it think it not Deem rather that the fervent Youth who saw So many bars between his present state And the dear haven where he wished to be In honourable wedlock with his Love sixty Was in his judgment tempted to decline To perilous weakness two and entrust his cause To nature for a happy end of all Deem that by such fond hope the Youth was swayed And bear with their transgression when I add sixty five That Julia wanting yet the name of wife Carried about her for a secret grief The promise of a mother To conceal The threatened shame the parents of the Maid seventy Found means to hurry her away by night And unforewarned that in some distant spot She might remain shrouded in privacy Until the babe was born When morning came The Lover thus bereft stung with his loss seventy five And all uncertain whither he should turn Chafed like a wild beast in the toils but soon Discovering traces of the fugitives Their steps he followed to the Maid s retreat Easily may the sequel be divined three eighty Walks to and fro watchings at every hour And the fair Captive who whene er she may Is busy at her casement as the swallow Fluttering its pinions almost within reach About the pendent nest did thus espy eighty five Her Lover thence a stolen interview Accomplished under friendly shade of night I pass the raptures of the pair such theme Is by innumerable poets touched In more delightful verse than skill of mine ninety Could fashion chiefly by that darling bard Who told of Juliet and her Romeo And of the lark s note heard before its time And of the streaks that laced the severing clouds In the unrelenting east Through all her courts ninety five The vacant city slept the busy winds That keep no certain intervals of rest Moved not meanwhile the galaxy displayed Her fires that like mysterious pulses beat Aloft momentous but uneasy bliss one hundred To their full hearts the universe seemed hung On that brief meeting s slender filament They parted and the generous Vaudracour Reached speedily the native threshold bent On making so the Lovers had agreed one hundred five A sacrifice of birthright to attain A final portion from his father s hand Which granted Bride and Bridegroom then would flee To some remote and solitary place Shady as night and beautiful as heaven one hundred ten Where they may live with no one to behold Their happiness or to disturb their love But now of this no whisper not the less If ever an obtrusive word were dropped Touching the matter of his passion still one hundred fifteen In his stern father s hearing Vaudracour Persisted openly that death alone Should abrogate his human privilege Divine of swearing everlasting truth Upon the altar to the Maid he loved one hundred twenty You shall be baffled in your mad intent If there be justice in the court of France Muttered the Father From these words the Youth four Conceived a terror and by night or day Stirred nowhere without weapons that full soon one hundred twenty five Found dreadful provocation for at night five When to his chamber he retired attempt Was made to seize him by three armed men Acting in furtherance of the father s will Under a private signet of the State one hundred thirty One the rash Youth s ungovernable hand Slew and as quickly to a second gave six A perilous wound he shuddered to behold The breathless corse then peacefully resigned His person to the law was lodged in prison one hundred thirty five And wore the fetters of a criminal Have you observed seven a tuft of winged seed That from the dandelion s naked stalk Mounted aloft is suffered not to use Its natural gifts for purposes of rest one hundred forty Driven by the autumnal whirlwind to and fro Through the wide element or have you marked The heavier substance of a leaf clad bough Within the vortex of a foaming flood Tormented by such aid you may conceive one hundred forty five The perturbation that ensued eight ah no Desperate the Maid the Youth is stained with blood Unmatchable on earth is their disquiet nine Yet ten as the troubled seed and tortured bough Is Man subjected to despotic sway one hundred fifty For him by private influence with the Court Was pardon gained and liberty procured But not without exaction of a pledge Which liberty and love dispersed in air He flew to her from whom they would divide him one hundred fifty five He clove to her who could not give him peace Yea his first word of greeting was All right Is gone from me my lately towering hopes To the least fibre of their lowest root Are withered thou no longer canst be mine one hundred sixty I thine the conscience stricken must not woo The unruffled Innocent I see thy face Behold thee and my misery is complete One are we not exclaimed the Maiden One For innocence and youth for weal and woe one hundred sixty five Then with the father s name she coupled words Of vehement indignation but the Youth Checked her with filial meekness for no thought Uncharitable crossed his mind no sense Of hasty anger rising in the eclipse eleven one hundred seventy Of true domestic loyalty did e er Find place within his bosom Once again The persevering wedge of tyranny Achieved their separation and once more Were they united to be yet again one hundred seventy five Disparted pitiable lot But here A portion of the tale may well be left In silence though my memory could add Much how the Youth in scanty space of time Was traversed from without much too of thoughts one hundred eighty That occupied his days in solitude Under privation and restraint and what Through dark and shapeless fear of things to come And what through strong compunction for the past He suffered breaking down in heart and mind one hundred eighty five Doomed to a third and last captivity His freedom he recovered on the eve Of Julia s travail When the babe was born Its presence tempted him to cherish schemes Of future happiness You shall return one hundred ninety Julia said he and to your father s house Go with the child You have been wretched yet The silver shower whose reckless burthen weighs Too heavily upon the lily s head Oft leaves a saving moisture at its root one hundred ninety five Malice beholding you will melt away Go tis a town where both of us were born None will reproach you for our truth is known And if amid those once bright bowers our fate Remain unpitied pity is not in man two hundred With ornaments the prettiest nature yields Or art can fashion shall you deck our twelve boy And feed his countenance with your own sweet looks Till no one can resist him Now even now I see him sporting on the sunny lawn two hundred five My father from the window sees him too Startled as if some new created thing Enriched the earth or Faery of the woods Bounded before him but the unweeting Child Shall by his beauty win his grandsire s heart two hundred ten So that it shall be softened and our loves End happily as they began These gleams Appeared but seldom oftener was he seen Propping a pale and melancholy face two hundred fifteen Upon the Mother s bosom resting thus His head upon one breast while from the other The Babe was drawing in its quiet food That pillow is no longer to be thine Fond Youth that mournful solace now must pass two hundred twenty Into the list of things that cannot be Unwedded Julia terror smitten hears The sentence by her mother s lip pronounced That dooms her to a convent Who shall tell Who dares report the tidings to the lord two hundred twenty five Of her affections so they blindly asked Who knew not to what quiet depths a weight Of agony had pressed the Sufferer down The word by others dreaded he can hear Composed and silent without visible sign two hundred thirty Of even the least emotion Noting this When the impatient object of his love Upbraided him with slackness he returned No answer only took the mother s hand And kissed it seemingly devoid of pain two hundred thirty five Or care that what so tenderly he pressed Was a dependant on thirteen the obdurate heart Of one who came to disunite their lives For ever sad alternative preferred By the unbending Parents of the Maid two hundred forty To secret spousals meanly disavowed So be it In the city he remained A season after Julia had withdrawn To those religious walls He too departs two hundred forty five Who with him even the senseless Little one With that sole charge he passed the city gates For the last time attendant by the side Of a close chair a litter or sedan In which the Babe was carried To a hill two hundred fifty That rose a brief league distant from the town The dwellers in that house where he had lodged Accompanied his steps by anxious love Impelled they parted from him there and stood Watching below till he had disappeared two hundred fifty five On the hill top His eyes he scarcely took Throughout that journey from the vehicle Slow moving ark of all his hopes that veiled The tender infant and at every inn And under every hospitable tree two hundred sixty At which the bearers halted or reposed Laid him with timid care upon his knees And looked as mothers ne er were known to look Upon the nursling which his arms embraced This was the manner in which Vaudracour two hundred sixty five Departed with his infant and thus reached His father s house where to the innocent child Admittance was denied The young man spake No word fourteen of indignation or reproof But of his father begged a last request two hundred seventy That a retreat might be assigned to him Where in forgotten quiet he might dwell With such allowance as his wants required For wishes he had none To a lodge that stood Deep in a forest with leave given at the age two hundred seventy five Of four and twenty summers he withdrew And thither took with him his motherless Babe fifteen And one domestic for their common needs An aged woman It consoled him here To attend upon the orphan and perform two hundred eighty Obsequious service to the precious child Which after a short time by some mistake Or indiscretion of the Father died The Tale I follow to its last recess Of suffering or of peace I know not which two hundred eighty five Theirs be the blame who caused the woe not mine From this time forth he never shared a smile With mortal creature An Inhabitant Of that same town in which the pair had left So lively a remembrance of their griefs two hundred ninety By chance of business coming within reach Of his retirement to the forest lodge Repaired but only found the matron there sixteen Who told him that his pains were thrown away For that her Master never uttered word two hundred ninety five To living thing not even to her Behold While they were speaking Vaudracour approached But seeing some one near as on the latch Of the garden gate his hand was laid he shrunk seventeen And like a shadow glided out of view three hundred Shocked at his savage aspect from the place The visitor retired Thus lived the Youth Cut off from all intelligence with man And shunning

had not I F One of the Poems of Sentiment and Reflection Ed A barking sound the Shepherd hears A cry as of a dog or fox He halts and searches with his eyes Among the scattered rocks And now at

thirty two Ed There is a Peele Castle on a small rocky island close to the town of Peele in the Isle of Man yet separated from it much as saint Michael s Mount in Cornwall is separated from the mainland This castle was believed by many to be the one which Sir George painted and which gave rise to the foregoing lines I visited it in eighteen seventy nine being then ignorant that any other Peele Castle existed and although the day being calm and the season summer I thought Sir George had idealized his subject much as I had just left Coleorton where the picture still exists I accepted the customary opinion But I am now convinced both from the testimony of the Arnold family B and as the result of a visit to Piel Castle near Barrow in Furness that Wordsworth refers to it The late Bishop of Lincoln in his uncle s Memoirs vol i p two hundred ninety nine quotes the line I was thy neighbour once thou rugged pile and adds He had spent four weeks there of a college summer vacation at the house of his cousin mister Barker This house was at Rampside the village opposite Piel on the coast of Lancashire The rugged pile too now cased in the unfeeling armour of old time painted by Beaumont is obviously this Piel Castle near Barrow I took the engraving of his picture with me when visiting it and although Sir George after the manner of landscape artists of his day took many liberties with his subjects it is apparent that it was this and not Peele Castle in Mona that he painted The four summer weeks referred to in the first stanza were those spent at Piel during the year

meeting of The Wordsworth Society held at Grasmere in July eighteen eighty one it was proposed by one of the members the reverend H D Rawnsley then Vicar of Wray to erect some memorial at the parting place of the brothers The brothers John and William Wordsworth parted at Grisedale Tarn on the twenty ninth September eighteen hundred The originator of the idea wrote thus of it in June eighteen eighty two A proposition made by one of its members to the Wordsworth Society when it met in Grasmere in eighteen eighty one to mark the spot in the Grisedale Pass of Wordsworth s parting from his brother John and to carry out a wish the poet seems to have hinted at in the last of his elegiac verses in memory of that parting is now being put into effect It has been determined after correspondence with Lord Coleridge doctor Cradock Professor Knight and mister Hills to have inscribed on the native rock if possible the first four lines of Stanzas III and VII of these verses Here did we stop and here looked round While each into himself descends For that last thought of parting Friends That is not to be found Brother and friend if verse of mine Have power to make thy virtues known Here let a monumental Stone Stand sacred as a Shrine The rock selected is a fine mass facing the east on the left of the track as one descends from Grisedale Tarn towards Patterdale and is about one hundred yards from the tarn No more suitable one can be found and we have the testimony of mister David Richardson of Newcastle who has practical knowledge of engineering that it is the fittest both from shape and from slight incline of plane It has been proposed to sink a panel in the face of the rock that so the inscription may be slightly protected and to engrave the letters upon the face of the panel thus obtained But it is not quite certain yet that the grain of the rock volcanic ash will admit of the lettering If this cannot be carried out it has been determined to have the letters engraved upon a slab of Langdale slate and imbed it in the Grisedale Rock It is believed that the simplicity of the design the lonely isolation of this mountain memorial will appeal at once to the few who pass this way Traveller or Shepherd And we in our turn appeal to English tourists who may chance to see it to forego the wish of adding to it or taking anything from it by engraving their own names and to let the Monumental Stone stand as the poet wished it might stand SACRED as a Shrine We owe great thanks to missus Sturge for first surveying the place to ascertain the possibility of finding a mountain rock sufficiently striking in position to mister Richardson jun for his etching of the rock upon which the inscription is to be made to his father for the kind trouble he took in the measurement of the said rock and particularly to the seconder of the original proposal and my coadjutor in the task of final selection and superintending the work mister W H Hills H D RAWNSLEY P S When we came to examine the rock we found the area for the panel less than we had hoped for owing to certain rock fissures which by acting as drains for the rainwater on the surface would have much interfered with the durability of the inscription The available space for the panel remains three feet seven in length by one foot nine inches in depth Owing to the fineness of the grain of the stone it may be quite possible to letter the native rock but it has been difficult to fix on a style of lettering for the inscription that shall be at once in good taste forcible and plain It was proposed that the Script type of letter which was made use of in the inscription cut on the rock in the late mister Ball s garden grounds below the Mount at Rydal should be adopted but a final decision has been given in favour of a style of lettering which missus Rawnsley has designed The panel is from its position certain to attract the eye of the wanderer from Patterdale up to the Grisedale Pass H D R

a Conclusion in eighteen sixty eight by the honorable Amelia Murray London Longmans Green and company eighteen sixty eight refers to the loss of the Abergavenny One morning coming down early I saw what I thought was a great big ship without any hull This was the Abergavenny East Indiaman which had sunk with all sails set hardly three miles from the shore and all on board perished Had any of the crew taken refuge in the main top they might have been saved but the bowsprit which was crowded with human beings gave a lurch into the sea as the ship settled down and thus all were washed off though the timber appeared again above water when the Abergavenny touched the ground The ship had sprung a leak off saint Alban s Head and in spite of pumps she went to the bottom just within reach of safety Pp twelve thirteen A Narrative of the loss of the Earl of Abergavenny East Indiaman off Portland Feb five eighteen oh five was published in pamphlet form eightvo eighteen oh five by Hamilton and Bird twenty one High Street Islington For much in reference to John Wordsworth which illustrates both these Elegiac Verses and the poem On the Naming of Places which follows them I must refer to his Life to be published in another volume of this series but there is one letter of Dorothy Wordsworth s written to her friend Miss Jane Pollard afterwards missus Marshall in reference to her brother s death which may find a place here For the use of it I am indebted to the kindness of missus Marshall s daughter the Dowager Lady Monteagle March sixteenth eighteen oh five Grasmere It does me good to weep for him and it does me good to find that others weep and I bless them for it It is with me when I write as when I am walking out in this vale once so full of joy I can turn to no object that does not remind me of our loss I see nothing that he would not have loved and enjoyed My consolations rather come to me in gusts of feeling than are the quiet growth of my mind I know it will not always be so The time will come when the light of the setting sun upon these mountain tops will be as heretofore a pure joy not the same gladness that can never be but yet a joy even more tender It will soothe me to know how happy he would have been could he have seen the same beautiful spectacle He was taken away in the freshness of his manhood pure he was and innocent as a child Never human being was more thoroughly modest and his courage I need not speak of He was seen speaking with apparent cheerfulness to the first mate a few minutes before the ship went down and when nothing more could be done He said the will of God be done I have no doubt when he felt that it was out of his power to save his life he was as calm as before if some thought of what we should endure did not awaken a pang He loved solitude and he rejoiced in society He would wander alone amongst these hills with his fishing rod or led on by the mere pleasure of walking for many hours or he would walk with W or me or both of us and was continually pointing out with a gladness which is seldom seen but in very young people something which perhaps would have escaped our observation for he had so fine an eye that no distinction was unnoticed by him and so tender a feeling that he never noticed anything in vain Many a time has he called out to me at evening to look at the moon or stars or a cloudy sky or this vale in the quiet moonlight but the stars and moon were his chief delight He made of them his companions when he was at sea and was never tired of those thoughts which the silence of the night fed in him Then he was so happy by the fireside Any little business of the house interested him He loved our cottage He helped us to furnish it and to make the garden Trees are growing now which he planted He staid with us till the twenty ninth of September having come to us about the end of January During that time Mary Hutchinson now Mary Wordsworth staid with us six weeks John used to walk with her everywhere and they were exceedingly attached to each other so my poor sister mourns with us not merely because we have lost one who was so dear to William and me but from tender love to John and an intimate knowledge of him Her hopes as well as ours were fixed on John I can think of nothing but of our departed Brother yet I am very tranquil to day I honour him and love him and glory in his memory Southey writing to his friend C W W Wynn on the third of April eighteen oh five says DEAR WYNN I have been grievously shocked this evening by the loss of the Abergavenny of which Wordsworth s brother was captain Of course the news came flying up to us from all quarters and it has disordered me from head to foot At such circumstances I believe we feel as much for others as for ourselves just as a violent blow occasions the same pain as a wound and he who breaks his shin feels as acutely at the moment as the man whose leg is shot off In fact I am writing to you merely because this dreadful shipwreck has left me utterly unable to do anything else It is the heaviest calamity Wordsworth has ever experienced and in all probability I shall have to communicate it to him as he will very likely be here before the tidings can reach him What renders any near loss of this kind so peculiarly distressing is that the recollection is perpetually freshened when any like event occurs by the mere mention of shipwreck or the sound of the wind Of all deaths it is the most dreadful from the circumstances of terror which accompany it See The Life and Correspondence of Robert Southey vol ii p three hundred twenty one The following is part of a letter from Mary Lamb to Dorothy Wordsworth on the same subject It is undated MY DEAR MISS WORDSWORTH I wished to tell you that you would one day feel the kind of peaceful state of mind and sweet memory of the dead which you so happily describe as now almost begun but I felt that it was improper and most grating to the feelings of the afflicted to say to them that the memory of their affliction would in time become a constant part not only of their dreams but of their most wakeful sense of happiness That you would see every object with and through your lost brother and that that would at last become a real and everlasting source of comfort to you I felt and well knew from my own experience in sorrow but till you yourself began to feel this I did not dare to tell you so but I send you some poor lines which I wrote under this conviction of mind and before I heard Coleridge was returning home Why is he wandering on the sea Coleridge should now with Wordsworth be By slow degrees he d steal away Their woes and gently bring a ray So happily he d time relief Of comfort from their very grief He d tell them that their brother dead When years have passed o er their head Will be remembered with such holy True and tender melancholy That ever this lost brother John Will be their heart s companion His voice they ll always hear His face they ll always see There s naught in life so sweet As such a memory See Final Memorials of Charles Lamb by Thomas Noon Talfourd vol ii pp two hundred thirty three two hundred thirty four Ed WHEN TO THE

shallow snow And sometimes on a speck of visible earth The redbreast near me hopped nor was I loth fifteen To sympathise with vulgar coppice birds That for protection from the nipping blast Hither repaired A single beech tree grew Within this grove of firs and on the fork Of that one beech appeared a thrush s nest twenty A last year s nest conspicuously built At such small elevation from the ground As gave sure sign that they who in that house Of nature and of love had made their home Amid the fir trees all the summer long twenty five Dwelt in a tranquil spot And oftentimes A few sheep stragglers from some mountain flock Would watch my motions with suspicious stare From the remotest outskirts of the grove Some nook where they had made their final stand thirty Huddling together from two fears the fear Of me and of the storm Full many an hour Here did I lose But in this grove the trees Had been so thickly planted and had thriven In such perplexed and intricate array thirty five

fifty seven Captain Wordsworth perished on the fifth of February eighteen oh five and if the poem was written in eighteen oh five it must have been in the month of January of that year The note to the poem is explicit Not long after he perished by shipwreck et cetera Thus the poem may have been written in the beginning of eighteen oh five but it is not at all certain that part of it at least does not belong to an earlier year John Wordsworth lived with his brother and sister at the Town end Cottage Grasmere during part of the winter and during the whole of the spring summer and autumn of eighteen hundred William and John going together on foot into Yorkshire from the fourteenth of May to the seventh of June John left Grasmere on Michaelmas day September twenty ninth eighteen hundred and never returned to it again The following is Miss Wordsworth s record of that day in her Journal of eighteen hundred On Monday twenty ninth John left us William and I parted with him in sight of Ullswater It was a fine day showery but with sunshine and fine clouds Poor fellow my heart was right sad I could not help thinking we should see him again because he was only going to Penrith In the spring of eighteen oh one John Wordsworth sailed for China in the Abergavenny He returned from this voyage in safety and the brothers met once again in London He went to sea again in eighteen oh three and returned to London in eighteen oh four but could not visit Grasmere and in the month of February eighteen oh five shortly after he was appointed to the command of the Abergavenny the ship was lost at the Bill of Portland and every one on board perished It is clear that the latter part of the poem When to the attractions of the busy world was written between John Wordsworth s departure from Grasmere and the loss of the Abergavenny i e between September eighteen hundred and February eighteen oh five as there are references in it both to what his brother did at Grasmere and to his return to sea Back to the joyless Ocean thou art gone There are some things in the earlier part of the poem that appear to negative the idea of its having been written in eighteen hundred The opening lines seem to hint at an experience somewhat distant He speaks of being wont to do certain things But on the other hand I find an entry in Dorothy Wordsworth s Journal which leads me to believe that the poem may have been begun in eighteen hundred and that the first part ending as it did then with the line While she is travelling through the dreary sea may have been finished before John Wordsworth left Grasmere the second part being written afterwards while he was at sea and that this is the explanation of the date given in the editions of eighteen fifteen and eighteen twenty viz eighteen oh two Passages occur in Dorothy Wordsworth s Journal to the following effect Monday Morning first September We walked in the wood by the lake William read Joanna and the Firgrove to Coleridge A little earlier there is the record Saturday twenty second August William was composing all the morning William read us the poem of Joanna beside the Rothay by the roadside Then on Friday the twenty fifth August there is the entry We walked over the hill by the Firgrove I sate upon a rock and observed a flight of swallows gathering together high above my head We walked through the wood to the stepping stones the lake of Rydale very beautiful partly still I left William to compose an inscription that about the path Then next day Saturday morning thirtieth August William finished his inscription of the Pathway then walked in the wood and when John returned he sought him and they bathed together To what poem Dorothy Wordsworth referred under the name of the Inscription of the Pathway has puzzled me much There is no poem amongst his Inscriptions written in or before August eighteen hundred that corresponds to it in the least But if my conjecture is right that this Poem on the Naming of Places beginning When to the attractions of the busy world was composed at two different times it is quite possible that the Firgrove which was read along with Joanna to Coleridge on September first eighteen hundred was the first part of this very poem If this supposition is correct some light is cast both on the Inscription of the Pathway and on the date assigned by Wordsworth himself to the poem There is a certain fitness however in this poem being placed as it now is in sequence to the Elegiac Verses in memory of John Wordsworth beginning The Sheep boy whistled loud and near the fourth poem To the Daisy beginning Sweet Flower belike one day to have The Fir grove still exists It is between Wishing Gate and White Moss Common and almost exactly opposite the former Standing at the gate and looking eastwards the grove is to the left not forty yards distant Some of the firs Scotch ones still survive and several beech trees not a single beech tree as in the poem From this one might infer that the present colony had sprung up since the beginning of the century and that the special tree in which was the thrush s nest had perished but doctor Cradock wrote to me that Wordsworth pointed out the tree to Miss Cookson a few days before Dora Wordsworth s death The tree is near the upper wall and tells its own tale The Fir grove John s Grove can easily be entered by a gate about a hundred yards beyond the Wishing gate as one goes toward Rydal The view from it the visionary scene the spectacle Of clouded splendour this dream like sight Of solemn loveliness is now much interfered with by the new larch plantations immediately below the firs It must have been very different in Wordsworth s time and is constantly referred to in his sister s Journal as a favourite retreat resorted to when cloudless suns Shone hot or wind blew troublesome and strong In the absence of contrary testimony it might be supposed that the track which the brother had worn By pacing here unwearied and alone faced Silver How and the Grasmere Island and that the single beech tree was nearer the lower than the upper wall But Miss Cookson s testimony is explicit Only a few fir trees survive at this part of the grove which is now open and desolate not as it was in those earlier days when the trees Had been so thickly planted and had thriven With such perplexed and intricate array That vainly did I seek beneath their stems A length of open space doctor Cradock remarks As to there being more than one beech Wordsworth would not have hesitated to sacrifice servile exactness to poetical effect He had a fancy for one Fair as a star when only one Is shining in the sky One abode no more Grasmere s one green island one green field Since the above note was printed new light has been cast on the Inscription of the Pathway for which see volume viii of this edition Ed THE COTTAGER TO HER INFANT BY MY SISTER Composed eighteen oh five Published eighteen fifteen Suggested to her while beside my sleeping children I F One of the Poems founded on the Affections Ed The days are cold the nights are long The north wind sings a doleful song Then hush again upon my breast All merry things are now at rest Save thee my pretty Love five The kitten sleeps upon the hearth The crickets long have ceased their mirth There s nothing stirring in the house Save one wee hungry nibbling mouse Then why so busy thou ten Nay start not at that sparkling light Tis but the moon that shines so bright On the window pane bedropped with rain Then little Darling sleep again And wake when it is day fifteen This poem underwent no change in successive editions The title in all the earlier ones eighteen fifteen to eighteen forty three was The Cottager to her Infant By a Female Friend and in the preface to the edition of eighteen fifteen Wordsworth wrote Three short pieces now first published are the work of a Female Friend if any one regard them with dislike or be disposed to condemn them let the censure fall upon him who trusting in his own sense of their merit and their fitness for the place which they occupy extorted them from the Authoress In the edition of eighteen forty five he disclosed the authorship and gave the more natural title By my Sister Other two poems by her were introduced into the edition of eighteen fifteen and subsequent ones viz the Address to a Child and The Mother s Return In an appendix to a MS copy of the Recollections of a Tour made in Scotland by Dorothy Wordsworth transcribed by missus Clarkson I find the poem The Cottager to her Infant with two additional stanzas which are there attributed to Wordsworth The appendix runs thus To my Niece Dorothy a sleepless Baby THE COTTAGER TO HER INFANT The third and fourth stanzas which follow by W W Ah if I were a lady gay I should not grieve with thee to play Right gladly would I lie awake Thy lively spirits to partake And ask no better cheer But Babe there s none to work for me And I must rise to industry Soon as the cock begins to crow Thy mother to the fold must go To tend the sheep and kine Ed THE WAGGONER A Composed eighteen oh five Published eighteen nineteen Written at Town end Grasmere The characters and story from fact I F In Cairo s crowded streets The impatient Merchant wondering waits in vain And Mecca saddens at the long delay THOMSON B TO CHARLES LAMB esquire MY DEAR FRIEND When I sent you a few weeks ago the Tale of Peter Bell you asked why THE WAGGONER was not added To say the truth from the higher tone of imagination and the deeper touches of passion aimed at in the former I apprehended this little Piece could not accompany it without disadvantage In the year eighteen oh six if I am not mistaken THE WAGGONER was read to you in manuscript and as you have remembered it for so long a time I am the more encouraged to hope that since the localities on which it partly depends did not prevent its being interesting to you it may prove acceptable to others Being therefore in some measure the cause of its present appearance you must allow me the gratification of inscribing it to you in acknowledgment of the pleasure I have derived from your Writings and of the high esteem with which I am Very truly yours WILLIAM WORDSWORTH RYDAL MOUNT May twentieth eighteen nineteen CANTO FIRST Tis spent this burning day of June Soft darkness o er its latest gleams is stealing The buzzing dor hawk round and round is wheeling That solitary bird Is all that can be heard one five In silence deeper far than that of deepest noon Confiding Glow worms tis a night Propitious to your earth born light But where the scattered stars are seen In hazy straits the clouds between ten Each in his station twinkling not Seems changed into a pallid spot two The mountains against heaven s grave weight Rise up and grow to wondrous height three The air as in a lion s den fifteen Is close and hot and now and then Comes a tired four and sultry breeze With a haunting and a panting Like the stifling of disease But the dews five allay the heat twenty And the silence makes it sweet Hush there is some one on the stir Tis Benjamin the Waggoner Who long hath trod this toilsome way Companion of the night and six day twenty five That far off tinkling s drowsy cheer Mix d with a faint yet grating sound In a moment lost and found The Wain announces by whose side Along the banks of Rydal Mere thirty He paces on a trusty Guide Listen you can scarcely hear Hither he his course is bending Now he leaves the lower ground And up the craggy hill ascending thirty five Many a stop and stay he makes Many a breathing fit he takes seven Steep the way and wearisome Yet all the while his whip is dumb The Horses have worked with right good will forty And so eight have gained the top of the hill He was patient they were strong And now they smoothly glide along Recovering nine breath and pleased to win The praises of mild Benjamin forty five Heaven shield him from mishap and snare But why so early with this prayer Is it for threatenings in the sky Or for some other danger nigh No none is near him yet though he fifty Be one of much infirmity ten For at the bottom of the brow Where once the DOVE and OLIVE BOUGH Offered a greeting of good ale To all who entered Grasmere Vale fifty five And called on him who must depart To leave it with a jovial heart There where the DOVE and OLIVE BOUGH Once hung a Poet harbours now A simple water drinking Bard sixty Why need our Hero then though frail His best resolves be on his guard He marches by secure and bold Yet while he thinks on times of old It seems that all looks wondrous cold sixty five He shrugs his shoulders shakes his head And for the honest folk within It is a doubt with Benjamin Whether they be alive or dead Here is no danger none at all seventy Beyond his wish he walks secure eleven But pass a mile and then for trial Then for the pride of self denial If he resist that tempting door Which with such friendly voice will call seventy five If he resist those casement panes And that bright gleam which thence will fall Upon his Leaders bells and manes Inviting him with cheerful lure For still though all be dark elsewhere eighty Some shining notice will be there Of open house and ready fare The place to Benjamin right well twelve Is known and by as strong a spell As used to be that sign of love eighty five And hope the OLIVE BOUGH and DOVE He knows it to his cost good Man Who does not know the famous SWAN Object uncouth and yet our boast thirteen For it was painted by the Host ninety His own conceit the figure planned Twas coloured all by his own hand And that frail Child of thirsty clay Of whom I sing fourteen this rustic lay Could tell with self dissatisfaction ninety five Quaint stories of the bird s attraction C Well that is past and in despite Of open door and shining light And now the conqueror essays The long ascent of Dunmail raise one hundred And with his team is gentle here As when he clomb from Rydal Mere His whip they do not dread his voice They only hear it to rejoice To stand or go is at their pleasure one hundred five Their efforts and their time they measure By generous pride within the breast And while they strain and while they rest He thus pursues his thoughts at leisure Now am I fairly safe to night one hundred ten And with proud cause my heart is light fifteen I trespassed lately worse than ever But Heaven has blest sixteen a good endeavour And to my soul s content seventeen I find The evil One is left behind one hundred fifteen Yes let my master fume and fret Here am I with my horses yet My jolly team he finds that ye Will work for nobody but me Full proof of this the Country gained one hundred twenty It knows how ye were vexed and strained And forced unworthy stripes to bear When trusted to another s care eighteen Here was it on this rugged slope Which now ye climb with heart and hope one hundred twenty five I saw you between rage and fear Plunge and fling back a spiteful ear And ever more and more confused As ye were more and more abused nineteen As chance would have it passing by one hundred thirty I saw you in that twenty jeopardy A word from me was like a charm D Ye pulled together with one mind twenty one And your huge burthen safe from harm Moved like a vessel in the wind one hundred thirty five Yes without me up hills so high Tis vain to strive for mastery Then grieve not jolly team though tough The road we travel steep and rough twenty two Though Rydal heights and Dunmail raise one hundred forty And all their fellow banks and braes Full often make you stretch and strain And halt for breath and halt again Yet to their sturdiness tis owing That side by side we still are going one hundred forty five While Benjamin in earnest mood His meditations thus pursued A storm which had been smothered long Was growing inwardly more strong And in its struggles to get free one hundred fifty Was busily employed as he The thunder had begun to growl He heard not too intent of soul The air was now without a breath He marked not that twas still as death one hundred fifty five But soon large rain drops on his head twenty three Fell with the weight of drops of lead He starts and takes at the admonition A sage survey of his condition twenty four The road is black before his eyes one hundred sixty Glimmering faintly where it lies Black is the sky and every hill Up to the sky is blacker still Sky hill and dale one dismal room twenty five Hung round and overhung with gloom one hundred sixty five Save that above a single height Is to be seen a lurid light Above Helm crag E a streak half dead A burning of portentous red And near that lurid light full well one hundred seventy The ASTROLOGER sage Sidrophel Where at his desk and book he sits Puzzling aloft twenty six his curious wits He whose domain is held in common With no one but the ANCIENT WOMAN one hundred seventy five Cowering beside her rifted cell As if intent on magic spell Dread pair that spite of wind and weather Still sit upon Helm crag together The ASTROLOGER was not unseen one hundred eighty By solitary Benjamin But total darkness came anon And he and every thing was gone And suddenly a ruffling breeze That would have rocked the sounding trees one hundred eighty five Had aught of sylvan growth been there Swept through the Hollow long and bare twenty seven The rain rushed down the road was battered As with the force of billows shattered The horses are dismayed nor know one hundred ninety Whether they should stand or go And Benjamin is groping near them Sees nothing and can scarcely hear them He is astounded wonder not With such a charge in such a spot one hundred ninety five Astounded in the mountain gap With thunder peals clap after clap Close treading on the silent flashes And somewhere as he thinks by crashes twenty eight Among the rocks with weight of rain two hundred And sullen twenty nine motions long and slow That to a dreary distance go Till breaking in upon the dying strain A rending o er his head begins the fray again Meanwhile uncertain what to do two hundred five And oftentimes compelled to halt The horses cautiously pursue Their way without mishap or fault And now have reached that pile of stones Heaped over brave King Dunmail s bones two hundred ten He who had once supreme command Last king of rocky Cumberland His bones and those of all his Power Slain here in a disastrous hour When passing through this narrow strait two hundred fifteen Stony and dark and desolate Benjamin can faintly hear A voice that comes from some one near A female voice Whoe er you be Stop it exclaimed and pity me two hundred twenty And less in pity than in wonder Amid the darkness and the thunder The Waggoner with prompt command Summons his horses to a stand While with increasing agitation two hundred twenty five The Woman urged her supplication In rueful words with sobs between The voice of tears that fell unseen thirty There came a flash a startling glare And all Seat Sandal was laid bare two hundred thirty Tis not a time for nice suggestion And Benjamin without a question Taking her for some way worn rover thirty one Said Mount and get you under cover Another voice in tone as hoarse two hundred thirty five As a swoln brook with rugged course Cried out Good brother why so fast I ve had a glimpse of you avast Or since it suits you to be civil Take her at once for good and evil two hundred forty It is my Husband softly said The Woman as if half afraid By this time she was snug within Through help of honest Benjamin She and her Babe which to her breast two hundred forty five With thankfulness the Mother pressed And now the same strong voice more near Said cordially My Friend what cheer Rough doings these as God s my judge The sky owes somebody a grudge two hundred fifty We ve had in half an hour or less A twelvemonth s terror thirty two and distress Then Benjamin entreats the Man Would mount too quickly as he can The Sailor Sailor now no more two hundred fifty five But such he had been heretofore To courteous Benjamin replied Go you your way and mind not me For I must have whate er betide My Ass and fifty things beside two hundred sixty Go and I ll follow speedily The Waggon moves and with its load Descends along the sloping road And the rough Sailor instantly Turns to a little tent hard by thirty three two hundred sixty five For when at closing in of day The family had come that way Green pasture and the soft warm air Tempted thirty four them to settle there Green is the grass for beast to graze two hundred seventy Around the stones of Dunmail raise The Sailor gathers up his bed Takes down the canvass overhead And after farewell to the place A parting word though not of grace two hundred seventy five Pursues with Ass and all his store The way the Waggon went before CANTO SECOND If Wytheburn s modest House of prayer As lowly as the lowliest dwelling Had with its belfry s humble stock two hundred eighty A little pair that hang in air Been mistress also of a clock And one too not in crazy plight Twelve strokes that clock would have been telling Under the brow of old Helvellyn two hundred eighty five Its bead roll of midnight Then when the Hero of my tale Was passing by and down the vale The vale now silent hushed I ween As if a storm had never been two hundred ninety Proceeding with a mind at ease While the old Familiar of the seas thirty five Intent to use his utmost haste Gained ground upon the Waggon fast And gives another lusty cheer two hundred ninety five For spite of rumbling of the wheels A welcome greeting he can hear It is a fiddle in its glee Dinning from the CHERRY TREE Thence the sound the light is there three hundred As Benjamin is now aware Who to his inward thoughts confined Had almost reached the festive door When startled by the Sailor s roar thirty six He hears a sound and sees the light three hundred five And in a moment calls to mind That tis the village MERRY NIGHT F Although before in no dejection At this insidious recollection His heart with sudden joy is filled three hundred ten His ears are by the music thrilled His eyes take pleasure in the road Glittering before him bright and broad And Benjamin is wet and cold And there are reasons manifold three hundred fifteen That make the good tow rds which he s yearning Look fairly like a lawful earning Nor has thought time to come and go To vibrate between yes and no For cries the Sailor Glorious chance three hundred twenty That blew us hither let him dance Who can or will my honest soul Our treat shall be a friendly bowl thirty seven He draws him to the door Come in Come come cries he to Benjamin three hundred twenty five And Benjamin ah woe is me Gave the word the horses heard And halted though reluctantly Blithe souls and lightsome hearts have we Feasting at the CHERRY TREE three hundred thirty This was the outside proclamation This was the inside salutation What bustling jostling high and low A universal overflow What tankards foaming from the tap three hundred thirty five What store of cakes in every lap What thumping stumping overhead The thunder had not been more busy With such a stir you would have said This little place may well be dizzy three hundred forty Tis who can dance with greatest vigour Tis what can be most prompt and eager As if it heard the fiddle s call The pewter clatters on the wall The very bacon shows its feeling three hundred forty five Swinging from the smoky ceiling A steaming bowl a blazing fire What greater good can heart desire Twere worth a wise man s while to try The utmost anger of the sky three hundred fifty To seek for thoughts of a gloomy cast If such the bright amends at last thirty eight Now should you say thirty nine I judge amiss The CHERRY TREE shows proof of this For soon of all forty the happy there three hundred fifty five Our Travellers are the happiest pair All care with Benjamin is gone A Caesar past the Rubicon He thinks not of his long long strife The Sailor Man by nature gay three hundred sixty Hath no resolves to throw away forty one And he hath now forgot his Wife Hath quite forgotten her or may be Thinks her the luckiest soul on earth Within that warm and peaceful berth forty two three hundred sixty five Under cover Terror over Sleeping by her sleeping Baby With bowl that sped from hand to hand The gladdest of the gladsome band three hundred seventy Amid their own delight and fun forty three They hear when every dance is done When every whirling bout is o er forty four The fiddle s squeak G that call to bliss Ever followed by a kiss three hundred seventy five They envy not the happy lot But enjoy their own the more While thus our jocund Travellers fare Up springs the Sailor from his chair Limps for I might have told before three hundred eighty That he was lame across the floor Is gone returns and with a prize With what a Ship of lusty size A gallant stately Man of war Fixed on a smoothly sliding car three hundred eighty five Surprise to all but most surprise To Benjamin who rubs his eyes Not knowing that he had befriended A Man so gloriously attended This cries the Sailor a Third rate is three hundred ninety Stand back and you shall see her gratis This was the Flag ship at the Nile The Vanguard you may smirk and smile But pretty Maid if you look near You ll find you ve much in little here three hundred ninety five A nobler ship did never swim And you shall see her in full trim I ll set my friends to do you honour Set every inch of sail upon her So said so done and masts sails yards four hundred He names them all and interlards His speech with uncouth terms of art Accomplished in the showman s part And then as from a sudden check Cries out Tis there the quarter deck four hundred five On which brave Admiral Nelson stood A sight that would have roused your blood One eye he had which bright as ten Burned like a fire among his men Let this be land and that be sea four hundred ten Here lay the French and thus came we H Hushed was by this the fiddle s sound The dancers all were gathered round And such the stillness of the house You might have heard a nibbling mouse four hundred fifteen While borrowing helps where er he may The Sailor through the story runs Of ships to ships and guns to guns And does his utmost to display The dismal conflict and the might four hundred twenty And terror of that marvellous forty five night A bowl a bowl of double measure Cries Benjamin a draught of length To Nelson England s pride and treasure Her bulwark and her tower of strength four hundred twenty five When Benjamin had seized the bowl The mastiff from beneath the waggon Where he lay watchful as a dragon Rattled his chain twas all in vain For Benjamin triumphant soul four hundred thirty He heard the monitory growl Heard and in opposition quaffed A deep determined desperate draught Nor did the battered Tar forget Or flinch from what he deemed his debt four hundred thirty five Then like a hero crowned with laurel Back to her place the ship he led Wheeled her back in full apparel And so flag flying at mast head Re yoked her to the Ass anon four hundred forty Cries Benjamin We must be gone Thus after two hours hearty stay Again behold them on their way CANTO THIRD Right gladly had the horses stirred When they the wished for greeting heard four hundred forty five The whip s loud notice from the door That they were free to move once more You think those forty six doings must have bred In them disheartening doubts and dread No not a horse of all the eight four hundred fifty Although it be a moonless night Fears either for himself or freight For this they know and let it hide In part the offences of their guide That Benjamin with clouded brains four hundred fifty five Is worth the best with all their pains And if they had a prayer to make The prayer would be that they may take With him whatever comes in course The better fortune or the worse four hundred sixty That no one else may have business near them And drunk or sober he may steer them So forth in dauntless mood they fare And with them goes the guardian pair Now heroes for the true commotion four hundred sixty five The triumph of your late devotion Can aught on earth impede delight Still mounting to a higher height And higher still a greedy flight Can any low born care pursue her four hundred seventy Can any mortal clog come to her J No notion have they not a thought That is from joyless regions brought And while they coast the silent lake Their inspiration I partake four hundred seventy five Share their empyreal spirits yea With their enraptured vision see O fancy what a jubilee What shifting pictures clad in gleams Of colour bright as feverish dreams four hundred eighty Earth spangled sky and lake serene Involved and restless all a scene Pregnant with mutual exaltation Rich change and multiplied creation This sight to me the Muse imparts four hundred eighty five And then what kindness in their hearts What tears of rapture what vow making Profound entreaties and hand shaking What solemn vacant interlacing As if they d fall asleep embracing four hundred ninety Then in the turbulence of glee And in the excess of amity Says Benjamin That Ass of thine He spoils thy sport and hinders mine If he were tethered to the waggon four hundred ninety five He d drag as well what he is dragging And we as brother should with brother Might trudge it alongside each other Forthwith obedient to command The horses made a quiet stand five hundred And to the waggon s skirts was tied The Creature by the Mastiff s side The Mastiff wondering and perplext With dread of what will happen next And thinking it but sorry cheer five hundred five To have such company so near forty seven This new arrangement made the Wain Through the still night proceeds again No Moon hath risen her light to lend But indistinctly may be kenned five hundred ten The VANGUARD following close behind Sails spread as if to catch the wind Thy wife and child are snug and warm Thy ship will travel without harm I like said Benjamin her shape and stature five hundred fifteen And this of mine this bulky creature Of which I have the steering this Seen fairly is not much amiss We want your streamers friend you know But altogether forty eight as we go five hundred twenty We make a kind of handsome show Among these hills from first to last We ve weathered many a furious blast Hard passage forcing on with head Against the storm and canvass spread five hundred twenty five I hate a boaster but to thee Will say t who know saint both land and sea The unluckiest hulk that stems forty nine the brine Is hardly worse beset than mine When cross winds on her quarter beat five hundred thirty And fairly lifted from my feet I stagger onward heaven knows how But not so pleasantly as now Poor pilot I by snows confounded And many a foundrous pit surrounded five hundred thirty five Yet here we are by night and day Grinding through rough and smooth our way Through foul and fair our task fulfilling And long shall be so yet God willing Ay said the Tar through fair and foul five hundred forty But save us from yon screeching owl That instant was begun a fray Which called their thoughts another way The mastiff ill conditioned carl What must he do but growl and snarl five hundred forty five Still more and more dissatisfied With the meek comrade at his side Till not incensed though put to proof The Ass uplifting a hind hoof Salutes the Mastiff on the head five hundred fifty And so were better manners bred And all was calmed and quieted Yon screech owl says the Sailor turning Back to his former cause of mourning Yon owl pray God that all be well five hundred fifty five Tis worse than any funeral bell As sure as I ve the gift of sight We shall be meeting ghosts to night Said Benjamin This whip shall lay A thousand if they cross our way five hundred sixty I know that Wanton s noisy station I know him and his occupation The jolly bird hath learned his cheer Upon fifty the banks of Windermere Where a tribe of them make merry five hundred sixty five Mocking the Man that keeps the ferry Hallooing from an open throat Like travellers shouting for a boat The tricks he learned at Windermere This vagrant owl is playing here five hundred seventy That is the worst of his employment He s at the top fifty one of his enjoyment This explanation stilled the alarm Cured the foreboder like a charm This and the manner and the voice five hundred seventy five Summoned the Sailor to rejoice His heart is up he fears no evil From life or death from man or devil He wheels fifty two and making many stops Brandished his crutch against the mountain tops five hundred eighty And while he talked of blows and scars Benjamin among the stars Beheld a dancing and a glancing Such retreating and advancing As I ween was never seen five hundred eighty five In bloodiest battle since the days of Mars CANTO FOURTH Thus they with freaks of proud delight Beguile the remnant of the night And many a snatch of jovial song Regales them as they wind along five hundred ninety While to the music from on high The echoes make a glad reply But the sage Muse the revel heeds No farther than her story needs Nor will she servilely attend five hundred ninety five The loitering journey to its end Blithe spirits of her own impel The Muse who scents the morning air To take of this transported pair A brief and unreproved farewell six hundred To quit the slow paced waggon s side And wander down yon hawthorn dell With murmuring Greta for her guide There doth she ken the awful form Of Raven crag black as a storm six hundred five Glimmering through the twilight pale And Ghimmer crag K his tall twin brother Each peering forth to meet the other And while she roves fifty three through saint John s Vale Along the smooth unpathwayed plain six hundred ten By sheep track or through cottage lane Where no disturbance comes to intrude Upon the pensive solitude Her unsuspecting eye perchance With the rude shepherd s favoured glance six hundred fifteen Beholds the faeries in array Whose party coloured garments gay The silent company betray Red green and blue a moment s sight For Skiddaw top with rosy light six hundred twenty Is touched and all the band take flight Fly also Muse and from the dell Mount to the ridge of Nathdale Fell Thence look thou forth o er wood and lawn Hoar with the frost like dews of dawn six hundred twenty five Across yon meadowy bottom look Where close fogs hide their parent brook And see beyond that hamlet small The ruined towers of Threlkeld hall Lurking in a double shade six hundred thirty By trees and lingering twilight made There at Blencathara s rugged feet Sir Lancelot gave a safe retreat To noble Clifford from annoy Concealed the persecuted boy six hundred thirty five Well pleased in rustic garb to feed His flock and pipe on shepherd s reed Among this multitude of hills Crags woodlands waterfalls and rills Which soon the morning shall enfold six hundred forty From east to west in ample vest Of massy gloom and radiance bold The mists that o er the streamlet s bed Hung low begin to rise and spread Even while I speak their skirts of grey six hundred forty five Are smitten by a silver ray And lo up Castrigg s naked steep Where smoothly urged the vapours sweep Along and scatter and divide Like fleecy clouds self multiplied six hundred fifty The stately waggon is ascending With faithful Benjamin attending Apparent now beside his team Now lost amid a glittering steam fifty four And with him goes his Sailor friend six hundred fifty five By this time near their journey s end And after their high minded riot Sickening into thoughtful quiet As if the morning s pleasant hour Had for their joys a killing power six hundred sixty And sooth for Benjamin a vein Is opened of still deeper pain As if his heart by notes were stung From out the lowly hedge rows flung As if the warbler lost in light L six hundred sixty five Reproved his soarings of the night In strains of rapture pure and holy Upbraided his distempered folly fifty five Drooping is he his step is dull fifty six But the horses stretch and pull six hundred seventy With increasing vigour climb Eager to repair lost time Whether by their own desert Knowing what cause there is fifty seven for shame They are labouring to avert six hundred seventy five As much as may be of the blame fifty eight Which they foresee must soon alight Upon his head whom in despite Of all his failings they love best fifty nine Whether for him they are distrest six hundred eighty Or by length of fasting roused Are impatient to be housed Up against the hill they strain Tugging at the iron chain Tugging all with might and main six hundred eighty five Last and foremost every horse To the utmost of his force And the smoke and respiration Rising like an exhalation Blend sixty with the mist a moving shroud six hundred ninety To form an undissolving cloud Which with slant ray the merry sun Takes delight to play upon Never golden haired Apollo Pleased some favourite chief to follow six hundred ninety five Through accidents of peace or war In a perilous moment threw Around the object of his care Veil of such celestial hue sixty one Interposed so bright a screen seven hundred Him and his enemies between Alas what boots it who can hide When the malicious Fates are bent On working out an ill intent Can destiny be turned aside seven hundred five No sad progress of my story Benjamin this outward glory Cannot shield sixty two thee from thy Master Who from Keswick has pricked forth Sour and surly as the north seven hundred ten And in fear of some disaster Comes to give what help he may And sixty three to hear what thou canst say If as needs he must forebode sixty four Thou hast been loitering sixty five on the road seven hundred fifteen His fears his doubts sixty six may now take flight The wished for object is in sight Yet trust the Muse it rather hath Stirred him up to livelier wrath Which he stifles moody man seven hundred twenty With all the patience that he can To the end that at your meeting He may give thee decent greeting There he is resolved to stop Till the waggon gains the top seven hundred twenty five But stop he cannot must advance Him Benjamin with lucky glance Espies and instantly is ready Self collected poised and steady And to be the better seen seven hundred thirty Issues from his radiant shroud From his close attending cloud With careless air and open mien Erect his port and firm his going So struts yon cock that now is crowing seven hundred thirty five And the morning light in grace Strikes upon his lifted face Hurrying the pallid hue away That might his trespasses betray But what can all avail to clear him seven hundred forty Or what need of explanation Parley or interrogation For the Master sees alas That unhappy Figure near him Limping o er the dewy grass seven hundred forty five Where the road it fringes sweet Soft and cool to way worn feet And O indignity an Ass By his noble Mastiffs side Tethered to the waggon s tail seven hundred fifty And the ship in all her pride Following after in full sail Not to speak of babe and mother Who contented with each other And snug as birds in leafy arbour seven hundred fifty five Find within a blessed harbour With eager eyes the Master pries Looks in and out and through and through Says nothing till at last he spies A wound upon the Mastiff s head seven hundred sixty A wound where plainly might be read What feats an Ass s hoof can do But drop the rest this aggravation This complicated provocation A hoard of grievances unsealed seven hundred sixty five All past forgiveness it repealed And thus and through distempered blood On both sides Benjamin the good The patient and the tender hearted Was from his team and waggon parted seven hundred seventy When duty of that day was o er Laid down his whip and served no more Nor could the waggon long survive Which Benjamin had ceased to drive It lingered on guide after guide seven hundred seventy five Ambitiously the office tried But each unmanageable hill Called for his patience and his skill And sure it is that through this night And what the morning brought to light seven hundred eighty Two losses had we to sustain We lost both WAGGONER and WAIN Accept O Friend for praise or blame The gift of this adventurous song A record which I dared to frame seven hundred eighty five Though timid scruples checked me long They checked me and I left the theme Untouched in spite of many a gleam Of fancy which thereon was shed Like pleasant sunbeams shifting still seven hundred ninety Upon the side of a distant hill But Nature might not be gainsaid For what I have and what I miss I sing of these it makes my bliss Nor is it I who play the part seven hundred ninety five But a shy spirit in my heart That comes and goes will sometimes leap From hiding places ten years deep Or haunts me with familiar face sixty seven Returning like a ghost unlaid eight hundred Until the debt I owe be paid Forgive me then for I had been On friendly terms with this Machine M In him while he was wont to trace Our roads through many a long year s space eight hundred five A living almanack had we We had a speaking diary That in this uneventful place Gave to the days a mark and name By which we knew them when they came eight hundred ten Yes I and all about me here Through all the changes of the year Had seen him through the mountains go In pomp of mist or pomp of snow Majestically huge and slow eight hundred fifteen Or with a milder grace sixty eight adorning The landscape of a summer s morning While Grasmere smoothed her liquid plain The moving image to detain And mighty Fairfield with a chime eight hundred twenty Of echoes to his march kept time When little other business stirred And little other sound was heard In that delicious hour of balm Stillness solitude and calm eight hundred twenty five While yet the valley is arrayed On this side with a sober shade On that is prodigally bright Crag lawn and wood with rosy light But most of all thou lordly Wain eight hundred thirty I wish to have thee here again When windows flap and chimney roars And all is dismal out of doors And sitting by my fire I see Eight sorry carts no less a train eight hundred thirty five Unworthy successors of thee Come straggling through the wind and rain And oft as they pass slowly on Beneath my windows sixty nine one by one See perched upon the naked height eight hundred forty The summit of a cumbrous freight A single traveller and there Another then perhaps a pair The lame the sickly and the old Men women heartless with the cold eight hundred forty five And babes in wet and starveling plight Which once seventy be weather as it might Had still a nest within a nest Thy shelter and their mother s breast Then most of all then far the most eight hundred fifty Do I regret what we have lost Am grieved for that unhappy sin Which robbed us of good Benjamin And of his stately Charge which none Could keep alive when He was gone eight hundred fifty five VARIANTS ON THE TEXT Variant one eighteen nineteen The Night hawk is singing his frog like

years after the event that forms the subject of the foregoing poem in company with my friend the late mister Coleridge I happened to fall in with the person to whom the name of Benjamin is given Upon our expressing regret that we had not for a long time seen upon the road either him or his waggon he said They could not do without me and as to the man who was put in my place no good could come out of him he was a man of no ideas The fact of my discarded hero s getting the horses out of a great difficulty with a word as related in the poem was told me by an eye witness II The Dor hawk solitary bird When the Poem was first written the note of the bird was thus described The Night hawk is singing his frog like tune Twirling his watchman s rattle about but from unwillingness to startle the reader at the outset by so bold a mode of expression the passage was altered as it now stands III After the line Can any mortal clog come to her followed in the MS an incident which has been kept back Part of the suppressed verses shall here be given as a gratification of private feeling which the well disposed reader will find no difficulty in excusing They are now printed for the first time Can any mortal clog come to her It can But Benjamin in his vexation Possesses inward consolation He knows his ground and hopes to find A spot with all things to his mind An upright mural block of stone Moist with pure water trickling down A slender spring but kind to man It is a true Samaritan Close to the highway pouring out Its offering from a chink or spout Whence all howe er athirst or drooping With toil may drink and without stooping Cries Benjamin Where is it where Voice it hath none but must be near A star declining towards the west Upon the watery surface threw Its image tremulously imprest That just marked out the object and withdrew Right welcome service ROCK OF NAMES Light is the strain but not unjust To Thee and thy memorial trust That once seemed only to express Love that was love in idleness Tokens as year hath followed year How changed alas in character For they were graven on thy smooth breast By hands of those my soul loved best Meek women men as true and brave As ever went to a hopeful grave Their hands and mine when side by side With kindred zeal and mutual pride We worked until the Initials took Shapes that defied a scornful look Long as for us a genial feeling Survives or one in need of healing The power dear Rock around thee cast Thy monumental power shall last For me and mine O thought of pain That would impair it or profane Take all in kindness then as said With a staid heart but playful head And fail not Thou loved Rock to keep Thy charge when we are laid asleep W W There is no poem more closely identified with the Grasmere district of the English Lakes and with the road from Grasmere to Keswick than The Waggoner is and in none are the topographical allusions more minute and faithful Wordsworth seemed at a loss to know in what class of his poems to place The Waggoner and his frequent changes removing it from one group to another shew the artificial character of these classes Thus in the edition of eighteen twenty it stood first among the Poems of the Fancy In eighteen twenty seven it was the last of the Poems founded on the Affections In eighteen thirty two it was reinstated among the Poems of the Fancy In eighteen thirty six it had a place of its own and was inserted between the Poems of the Fancy and those Founded on the Affections while in eighteen forty five it was sent back to its original place among the Poems of the Fancy although in the table of contents it was printed as an independent poem closing the series The original text of The Waggoner underwent little change till the year eighteen thirty six when it was carefully revised and altered throughout The final edition of eighteen forty five however reverted in many instances especially in the first canto to the original text of eighteen nineteen As this poem was dedicated to Charles Lamb it may be of interest to note that some six months afterwards Lamb presented Wordsworth with a copy of the first edition of Paradise Regained the edition of sixteen seventy one writing on it the following sentence Charles Lamb to the best knower of Milton and therefore the worthiest occupant of this pleasant edition Jan second eighteen twenty The opening stanzas are unrivalled in their description of a sultry June evening with a thunder storm imminent Tis spent this burning day of June Soft darkness o er its latest gleams is stealing The buzzing dor hawk round and round is wheeling That solitary bird Is all that can be heard In silence deeper far than that of deepest noon The mountains against heaven s grave weight Rise up and grow to wondrous height The air as in a lion s den Is close and hot and now and then Comes a tired and sultry breeze With a haunting and a panting Like the stifling of disease But the dews allay the heat And the silence makes it sweet The Waggoner takes what is now the middle road of the three leading from Rydal to Grasmere see the note to The Primrose of the Rock The craggy hill referred to in the lines Now he leaves the lower ground And up the craggy hill ascending Steep the way and wearisome is the road from Rydal Quarry up to White Moss Common with the Glowworm rock on the right and the two heath clad rocks referred to in the last of the Poems on the Naming of Places on the left He next passes The Wishing Gate on the left John s Grove on the right and descends by Dove Cottage where Wordsworth lived to Grasmere at the bottom of the brow Where once the DOVE and OLIVE BOUGH Offered a greeting of good ale To all who entered Grasmere Vale And called on him who must depart To leave it with a jovial heart There where the DOVE and OLIVE BOUGH Once hung a Poet harbours now A simple water drinking Bard He goes through Grasmere passes the Swan Inn He knows it to his cost good Man Who does not know the famous SWAN Object uncouth and yet our boast For it was painted by the Host His own conceit the figure planned Twas coloured all by his own hand As early as eighteen nineteen when the poem was first published this rude piece of self taught art had been supplanted by a more pretentious figure The Waggoner passes the Swan And now the conqueror essays The long ascent of Dunmail raise As he proceeds the storm gathers and struggles to get free Road hill and sky are dark and he barely sees the well known rocks at the summit of Helm crag where two figures seem to sit like those on the Cobbler near Arrochar in Argyle Black is the sky and every hill Up to the sky is blacker still Sky hill and dale one dismal room Hung round and overhung with gloom Save that above a single height Is to be seen a lurid light Above Helm crag a streak half dead A burning of portentous red And near that lurid light full well The ASTROLOGER sage Sidrophel Where at his desk and book he sits Puzzling aloft his curious wits He whose domain is held in common With no one but the ANCIENT WOMAN Cowering beside her rifted cell As if intent on magic spell Dread pair that spite of wind and weather Still sit upon Helm crag together At the top of the raise the water shed between the vales of Grasmere and Wytheburn he reaches the familiar pile of stones at the boundary between the shires of Westmoreland and Cumberland that pile of stones Heaped over brave King Dunmail s bones Green is the grass for beast to graze Around the stones of Dunmail raise The allusion to Seat Sandal laid bare by the flash of lightning and the description in the last canto of the ascent of the Raise by the Waggoner on a summer morning are as true to the spirit of the place as anything that Wordsworth has written He tells his friend Lamb fourteen years after he wrote the poem of The Waggoner Yes I and all about me here Through all the changes of the year Had seen him through the mountains go In pomp of mist or pomp of snow Majestically huge and slow Or with a milder grace adorning The landscape of a summer s morning While Grasmere smoothed her liquid plain The moving image to detain And mighty Fairfield with a chime Of echoes to his march kept time When little other business stirred And little other sound was heard In that delicious hour of balm Stillness solitude and calm While yet the valley is arrayed On this side with a sober shade On that is prodigally bright Crag lawn and wood with rosy light From Dunmail raise the Waggoner descends to Wytheburn Externally Wytheburn s modest House of prayer As lowly as the lowliest dwelling remains very much as it was in eighteen oh five but the primitive simplicity and lowliness of the chapel was changed by the addition a few years ago of an apse by the removal of some of the old rafters and by the reseating of the pews The Cherry Tree Tavern where the village Merry night was being celebrated still stands on the eastern or Helvellyn side of the road It is now a farm house but it will be regarded with interest from the description of the rustic dance which recalls longo intervallo The Jolly Beggars of Burns After two hours delay at the Cherry Tree the Waggoner and Sailor coast the silent lake of Thirlmere and pass the Rock of Names This rock was until lately one of the most interesting memorials of Wordsworth and his friends that survived in the Lake District but the vale of Thirlmere is now a Manchester water tank and the place which knew the Rock of Names now knows it no more It was a sort of trysting place of the poets of Grasmere and Keswick being nearly half way between the two places and there Wordsworth Coleridge and other members of their households often met When Coleridge left Grasmere for Keswick the Wordsworths usually accompanied him as far as this rock and they often met him there on his way over from Keswick to Grasmere Compare the honorable mister Justice Coleridge s Reminiscences Memoirs of Wordsworth vol ii p three hundred ten The rock was on the right hand of the road a little way past Waterhead at the southern end of Thirlmere and on it were cut the letters W W M H D W S T C J W S H the initials of William Wordsworth Mary Hutchinson Dorothy Wordsworth Samuel Taylor Coleridge John Wordsworth and Sarah Hutchinson The Wordsworths settled at Grasmere at the close of the year seventeen ninety nine As mentioned in a previous note John Wordsworth lived with his brother and sister during most of that winter and during the whole of the spring summer and autumn of eighteen hundred leaving it finally on September twenty nine eighteen hundred These names must therefore have been cut during the spring or summer of eighteen hundred There is no record of the occurrence and no allusion to the rock in Dorothy Wordsworth s Grasmere Journal of eighteen hundred But that Journal so far as I have seen it begins on the fourteenth of May eighteen hundred Almost every detail of the daily life and ways of the household at Dove Cottage is so minutely recorded in it that I am convinced that this incident of the cutting of names in the Thirlmere Rock would have been mentioned had it happened between the fourteenth of May and John Wordsworth s departure from Grasmere in September Such references as this for example occur in the Journal Saturday August two William and Coleridge went to Keswick John went with them to Wytheburn and staid all day fishing I therefore infer that it was in the spring or early summer of eighteen hundred that the names were cut I may add that the late Dean of Westminster Dean Stanley took much interest in this Rock of Names and doubt having been cast on the accuracy of the place and the genuineness of the inscriptions in a letter from doctor Fraser then Bishop of Manchester which he forwarded to me he entered into the question with all the interest with which he was wont to track out details in the architecture or the history of a Church There were few memorials connected with Wordsworth more worthy of preservation than this upright mural block of stone When one remembered that the initials on the rock were graven by the hands of William and John Wordsworth by Samuel Taylor Coleridge possibly with the assistance of Dorothy Wordsworth the two Hutchinsons Mary and Sarah and that Wordsworth says of it We worked until the Initials took Shapes that defied a scornful look this Thirlmere Rock was felt to be a far more interesting memento of the group of poets that used to meet beside it than the Stone in the grounds of Rydal Mount which was spared at Wordsworth s suit from some rude beauty of its own There was simplicity as well as strength in the way in which the initials were cut But the stone was afterwards desecrated by tourists and others who had the audacity to scratch their own names or initials upon it In eighteen seventy seven I wrote The rock is as yet wonderfully free from such and its preservation is probably due to the dark olive coloured moss with which the pure water trickling down has covered the face of the mural block and thus secured it from observation even on that highway but I found in the summer of eighteen eighty two that several other names had been ruthlessly added When the Manchester Thirlmere scheme was finally resolved upon an effort was made to remove the Stone with the view of its being placed higher up the hill on the side of the new roadway In the course of this attempt the Stone was broken to pieces There is a very good drawing of The Rock of Names by mister Harry Goodwin in Through the Wordsworth Country eighteen ninety two The Muse takes farewell of the Waggoner as he is proceeding with the Sailor and his quaint model of the Vanguard along the road toward Keswick She scents the morning air and Quits the slow paced waggon s side To wander down yon hawthorn dell With murmuring Greta for her guide The hawthorn dell is the upper part of the Vale of saint John There doth she ken the awful form Of Raven crag black as a storm Glimmering through the twilight pale And Ghimmer crag his tall twin brother Each peering forth to meet the other Raven crag is well known H C Robinson writes of it in his Diary in eighteen eighteen as the most significant of the crags at a spot where there is not one insignificant a rock on the western side of Thirlmere where the Greta issues from the lake But there is no rock in the district now called by the name of Ghimmer crag or the crag of the Ewe lamb I am inclined to think that Wordsworth referred to the Fisher crag of the Ordnance Survey and the Guide Books No other rock round Thirlmere can with any accuracy be called the tall twin brother of Raven crag certainly not Great How nor any spur of High Seat or Bleaberry Fell Fisher crag resembles Raven crag as seen from Thirlmere Bridge or from the high road above it and it is somewhat remarkable that Green in his Guide to the Lakes a volume which the poet possessed makes use of the same expression as that which Wordsworth adopts regarding these two crags Raven and Fisher The margin of the lake on the Dalehead side has its charms of wood and water and Fischer Crag twin brother to Raven Crag is no bad object when taken near the island called Buck s Holm A Description of Sixty Studies from Nature by William Green of Ambleside eighteen ten p fifty seven I cannot find any topographical allusion to a Ghimmer crag in contemporary local writers Clarke in his Survey of the Lakes does not mention it The Castle Rock in the Vale of Legberthwaite between High Fell and Great How is the fairy castle of Sir Walter Scott s Bridal of Triermain Nathdale Fell is the ridge between Naddle Vale Nathdale Vale and that of saint John now known as High Rigg The old Hall of Threlkeld has long been in a state of ruinous dilapidation the only habitable part of it having been for many years converted into a farmhouse The remaining local allusions in The Waggoner are obvious enough Castrigg is the shortened form of Castlerigg the ridge between Naddle Valley and Keswick In the Reminiscences of Wordsworth which the honorable mister Justice Coleridge wrote for the late Bishop of Lincoln in eighteen fifty there is the following reference to The Waggoner See Memoirs vol ii p three hundred ten The Waggoner seems a very favourite poem of his He said his object in it had not been understood It was a play of the fancy on a domestic incident and lowly character He wished by the opening descriptive lines to put his reader into the state of mind in which he wished it to be read If he failed in doing that he wished him to lay it down He pointed out with the same view the glowing lines on the state of exultation in which Ben and his companions are under the influence of liquor Then he read the sickening languor of the morning walk contrasted with the glorious uprising of Nature and the songs of the birds Here he has added about six most exquisite lines The lines referred to are doubtless the eight p one hundred one beginning Say more for by that power a vein which were added in the edition of eighteen thirty six The following is Sara Coleridge s criticism of The Waggoner See Biographia Literaria vol ii pp one hundred eighty three one hundred eighty four edition eighteen forty seven Due honour is done to Peter Bell at this time by students of poetry in general but some even of mister Wordsworth s greatest admirers do not quite satisfy me in their admiration of The Waggoner a poem which my dear uncle mister Southey preferred even to the former Ich will meine Denkungs Art hierin niemandem aufdringen as Lessing says I will force my way of thinking on nobody but take the liberty for my own gratification to express it The sketches of hill and valley in this poem have a lightness and spirit an Allegro touch distinguishing them from the grave and elevated splendour which characterises mister Wordsworth s representations of Nature in general and from the passive tenderness of those in The White Doe while it harmonises well with the human interest of the piece indeed it is the harmonious sweetness of the composition which is most dwelt upon by its special admirers In its course it describes with bold brief touches the striking mountain tract from Grasmere to Keswick it commences with an evening storm among the mountains presents a lively interior of a country inn during midnight and concludes after bringing us in sight of saint John s Vale and the Vale of Keswick seen by day break Skiddaw touched with rosy light and the prospect from Nathdale Fell hoar with the frost like dews of dawn thus giving a beautiful and well contrasted Panorama produced by the most delicate and masterly strokes of the pencil Well may mister Ruskin a fine observer and eloquent describer of various classes of natural appearances speak of mister Wordsworth as the great poetic landscape painter of the age But mister Ruskin has found how seldom the great landscape painters are powerful in expressing human passions and affections on canvas or even successful in the introduction of human figures into their foregrounds whereas in the poetic paintings of mister Wordsworth the landscape is always subordinate to a higher interest certainly in The Waggoner the little sketch of human nature which occupies as it were the front of that encircling background the picture of Benjamin and his temptations his humble friends and the mute companions of his way has a character of its own combining with sportiveness a homely pathos which must ever be delightful to some of those who are thoroughly conversant with the spirit of mister Wordsworth s poetry It may be compared with the ale house scene in Tam o Shanter parts of Voss s Luise or Ovid s Baucis and Philemon though it differs from each of them as much as they differ from each other The Epilogue carries on the feeling of the piece very beautifully The editor of Southey s Life and Correspondence his son the reverend Charles Cuthbert Southey tells us in a note to a letter from S T Coleridge to his father that the Waggoner s name was Jackson and that all the circumstances of the poem are accurately correct This Jackson after retiring from active work as waggoner became the tenant of Greta Hall where first Coleridge and afterwards Southey lived The Hall was divided into two houses one of which Jackson occupied and the other of which he let to Coleridge who speaks thus of him in the letter to Southey dated Greta Hall Keswick April thirteen eighteen oh one My landlord who dwells next door has a very respectable library which he has put with mine histories encyclopedias and all the modern poetry et cetera et cetera et cetera A more truly disinterested man I never met with severely frugal yet almost carelessly generous and yet he got all his money as a common carrier by hard labour and by pennies and pennies He is one instance among many in this country of the salutary effect of the love of knowledge he was from a boy a lover of learning See Life and Correspondence of Robert Southey vol ii pp one hundred forty seven one hundred forty eight Charles Lamb to whom The Waggoner was dedicated wrote thus to Wordsworth on seventh June eighteen nineteen My dear Wordsworth You cannot imagine how proud we are here of the dedication We read it twice for once that we do the poem I mean all through yet Benjamin is no common favourite there is a spirit of beautiful tolerance in it It is as good as it was in eighteen oh six and it will be as good in eighteen twenty nine if our dim eyes shall be awake to peruse it Methinks there is a kind of shadowing affinity between the subject of the narrative and the subject of the dedication I do not know which I like best the prologue the latter part especially to P Bell or the epilogue to Benjamin Yes I tell stories I do know I like the last best and the Waggoner altogether is a pleasanter remembrance to me than the Itinerant C LAMB See The Letters of Charles Lamb edited by Alfred Ainger vol ii pp twenty four twenty six To this may be added what Southey wrote to mister Wade Browne on fifteenth June eighteen nineteen I think you will be pleased with Wordsworth s Waggoner if it were only for the line of road which it describes The master of the waggon was my poor landlord Jackson and the cause of his exchanging it for the one horse cart was just as is represented in the poem nobody but Benjamin could manage it upon these hills and Benjamin could not resist the temptations by the wayside See The Life and Correspondence of Robert Southey vol iv p three hundred eighteen Ed THE PRELUDE OR GROWTH OF A POET S MIND AN AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL POEM Composed seventeen ninety nine eighteen oh five Published eighteen fifty ADVERTISEMENT The following Poem was commenced in the beginning of the year seventeen ninety nine and completed in the summer of eighteen oh five The design and occasion of the work are described by the Author in his Preface to the EXCURSION first published in eighteen fourteen where he thus speaks Several years ago when the Author retired to his native mountains with the hope of being enabled to construct a literary work that might live it was a reasonable thing that he should take a review of his own mind and examine how far Nature and Education had qualified him for such an employment As subsidiary to this preparation he undertook to record in verse the origin and progress of his own powers as far as he was acquainted with them That work addressed to a dear friend most distinguished for his knowledge and genius and to whom the author s intellect is deeply indebted has been long finished and the result of the investigation which gave rise to it was a determination to compose a philosophical Poem containing views of Man Nature and Society and to be entitled The Recluse as having for its principal subject the sensations and opinions of a poet living in retirement The preparatory poem is biographical and conducts the history of the Author s mind to the point when he was emboldened to hope that his faculties were sufficiently matured for entering upon the arduous labour which he had proposed to himself and the two works have the same kind of relation to each other if he may so express himself as the Ante chapel has to the body of a Gothic Church Continuing this allusion he may be permitted to add that his minor pieces which have been long before the public when they shall be properly arranged will be found by the attentive reader to have such connection with the main work as may give them claim to be likened to the little cells oratories and sepulchral recesses ordinarily included in those edifices Such was the Author s language in the year eighteen fourteen It will thence be seen that the present Poem was intended to be introductory to the RECLUSE and that the RECLUSE if completed would have consisted of Three Parts Of these the Second Part alone viz the EXCURSION was finished and given to the world by the Author The First Book of the First Part of the RECLUSE still remains in manuscript but the Third Part was only planned The materials of which it would have been formed have however been incorporated for the most part in the Author s other Publications written subsequently to the EXCURSION The Friend to whom the present Poem is addressed was the late SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE who was resident in Malta for the restoration of his health when the greater part of it was composed mister Coleridge read a considerable portion of the Poem while he was abroad and his feelings on hearing it recited by the Author after his return to his own country are recorded in his Verses addressed to mister Wordsworth which will be found in the Sibylline Leaves p one hundred ninety seven edition eighteen seventeen or Poetical Works by S T Coleridge vol i p two hundred six RYDAL MOUNT July thirteenth eighteen fifty This advertisement to the first edition of The Prelude published in eighteen fifty the year of Wordsworth s death was written by mister Carter who edited the volume mister Carter was for many years the poet s secretary and afterwards one of his literary executors The poem was not only kept back from publication during Wordsworth s life time but it remained without a title being alluded to by himself when he spoke or wrote of it as the poem on my own poetical education the poem on my own life et cetera As The Prelude is autobiographical a large part of Wordsworth s life might be written in the notes appended to it but besides breaking up the text of the poem unduly this plan has many disadvantages and would render a subsequent and detailed life of the poet either unnecessary or repetitive The notes which follow will therefore be limited to the explanation of local historical and chronological allusions or to references to Wordsworth s own career that are not obvious without them It has been occasionally difficult to decide whether some of the allusions to minute points in ancient history mediaeval mythology and contemporary politics should be explained or left alone but I have preferred to err on the side of giving a brief clue to details with which every scholar is familiar The Prelude was begun as Wordsworth left the imperial city of Goslar in Lower Saxony where he spent part of the last winter of last century and which he left on the tenth of February seventeen ninety nine Only lines one to forty five however were composed at that time and the poem was continued at desultory intervals after the settlement at Grasmere during eighteen hundred and following years Large portions of it were dictated to his devoted amanuenses as he walked or sat on the terraces of Lancrigg Six books were finished by eighteen oh five The seventh was begun in the opening of that year and the remaining seven were written before the end of June eighteen oh five when his friend Coleridge was in the island of Malta for the restoration of his health The late Bishop of Lincoln There is no uncertainty as to the year in which the later books were written but there is considerable difficulty in fixing the precise date of the earlier ones Writing from Grasmere to his friend Francis Wrangham the letter is undated Wordsworth says I am engaged in writing a poem on my own earlier life which will take five parts or books to complete three of which are nearly finished The late Bishop of Lincoln supposed that this letter to Wrangham was written at the close of eighteen oh three or beginning of eighteen oh four See Memoirs of Wordsworth vol i p three hundred three There is evidence that it belongs to eighteen oh four At the commencement of the seventh book p two hundred forty seven he says Six changeful years have vanished since I first Poured out saluted by that quickening breeze Which met me issuing from the City s walls A glad preamble to this Verse I sang Aloud with fervour irresistible Of short lived transport like a torrent bursting From a black thunder cloud down Scafell s side To rush and disappear But soon broke forth So willed the Muse a less impetuous stream That flowed awhile with unabating strength Then stopped for years not audible again Before last primrose time I have italicised the clauses which give some clue to the dates of composition From these it would appear that the glad preamble written on leaving Goslar in seventeen ninety nine which I think included only the first two paragraphs of book first was a short lived transport but that soon afterwards a less impetuous stream broke forth which after the settlement at Grasmere flowed awhile with unabating strength and then stopped for years Now the above passage recording these things was written in eighteen oh five and in the late autumn of that year as is evident from the reference which immediately follows to the choir of redbreasts and the approach of winter We must therefore assign the flowing of the less impetuous stream to eighteen oh two in order to leave room for the intervening years in which it ceased to flow till it was audible again in the spring of eighteen oh four last primrose time A second reference to date occurs in the sixth book p two hundred twenty four entitled Cambridge and the Alps in which he says Four years and thirty told this very week Have I been now a sojourner on earth This fixes definitely enough the date of the composition of that part of the work viz April eighteen oh four which corresponds exactly to the last primrose time of the previous extract from the seventh book in which he tells us that after its long silence his Muse was heard again So far Wordsworth s own allusions to the date of The Prelude But there are others supplied by his own and his sister s letters and also by the Grasmere Journal In the Dove Cottage household it was known and talked of as the Poem to Coleridge and Dorothy records on eleventh January eighteen oh three that her brother was working at it On thirteenth February eighteen oh four she writes to missus Clarkson that her brother was engaged on a poem on his own life and was going on with great rapidity On the sixth of March eighteen oh four Wordsworth wrote from Grasmere to De Quincey I am now writing a poem on my own earlier life I have just finished that part of it in which I speak of my residence at the University It is better than half complete viz four books amounting to about twenty five hundred lines A On the twenty fourth of March Dorothy wrote to missus Clarkson that since Coleridge left them which was in January eighteen oh four her brother had added fifteen hundred lines to the poem on his own life On the twenty ninth of April eighteen oh four Wordsworth wrote to Richard Sharpe I have been very busy these last ten weeks having written between two and three thousand lines accurately near three thousand in that time namely four books and a third of another I am at present at the Seventh Book On the twenty fifth December eighteen oh four he wrote to Sir George Beaumont I have written upwards of two thousand verses during the last ten weeks We thus find that Books I to IV had been written by the sixth of March eighteen oh four that from the nineteenth February to the twenty ninth of April nearly three thousand lines were written that March and April were specially productive months for by the twenty ninth April he had reached Book VII while from sixteenth October to twenty fifth December he wrote over two thousand lines Dorothy and Mary Wordsworth transcribed the earlier books more than once and a copy of some of them was given to Coleridge to take with him to Malta It is certain that the remaining books of The Prelude were all written in the spring and early summer of eighteen oh five the seventh eighth ninth tenth eleventh and part of the twelfth being finished about the middle of April the last three hundred lines of book twelfth in the last week of April and the two remaining books the thirteenth and fourteenth before the twentieth of May The following extracts from letters of Wordsworth to Sir George Beaumont make this clear and also cast light on matters much more important than the mere dates of composition GRASMERE Dec twenty five eighteen oh four My dear Sir George You will be pleased to hear that I have been advancing with my work I have written upwards of two thousand verses during the last ten weeks I do not know if you are exactly acquainted with the plan of my poetical labour It is twofold first a Poem to be called The Recluse in which it will be my object to express in verse my most interesting feelings concerning man nature and society and next a poem in which I am at present chiefly engaged on my earlier life or the growth of my own mind taken up upon a large scale This latter work I expect to have finished before the month of May and then I purpose to fall with all my might on the former which is the chief object upon which my thoughts have been fixed these many years Of this poem that of The Pedlar which Coleridge read to you is part and I may have written of it altogether about two thousand lines It will consist I hope of about ten or twelve thousand GRASMERE May one eighteen oh five Unable to proceed with this work B I turned my thoughts again to the Poem on my own Life and you will be glad to hear that I have added three hundred lines to it in the course of last week Two books more will conclude it It will not be much less than nine thousand lines not hundred but thousand lines long an alarming length and a thing unprecedented in literary history that a man should talk so much about himself It is not self conceit as you will know well that has induced me to do this but real humility I began the work because I was unprepared to treat any more arduous subject and diffident of my own powers Here at least I hoped that to a certain degree I should be sure of succeeding as I had nothing to do but describe what I had felt and thought and therefore could not easily be bewildered This might have been done in narrower compass by a man of more address but I have done my best If when the work shall be finished it appears to the judicious to have redundancies they shall be lopped off if possible but this is very difficult to do when a man has written with thought and this defect whenever I have suspected it or found it to exist in any writings of mine I have always found it incurable The fault lies too deep and is in the first conception GRASMERE June three eighteen oh five I have the pleasure to say that I finished my poem about a fortnight ago I had looked forward to the day as a most happy one But it was not a happy day for me I was dejected on many accounts when I looked back upon the performance it seemed to have a dead weight about it the reality so far short of the expectation It was the first long labour that I had finished and the doubt whether I should ever live to write The Recluse and the sense which I had of this poem being so far below what I seemed capable of executing depressed me much above all many heavy thoughts of my poor departed brother hung upon me the joy which I should have had in showing him the manuscript and a thousand other vain fancies and dreams I have spoken of this because it was a state of feeling new to me the occasion being new This work may be considered as a sort of portico to The Recluse part of the same building which I hope to be able ere long to begin with in earnest and if I am permitted to bring it to a conclusion and to write further a narrative poem of the epic kind I shall consider the task of my life as over I ought to add that I have the satisfaction of finding the present poem not quite of so alarming a length as I apprehended These letters explain the delay in the publication of The Prelude They show that what led Wordsworth to write so much about himself was not self conceit but self diffidence He felt unprepared as yet for the more arduous task he had set before himself He saw its faults as clearly or more clearly than the critics who condemned him He knew that its length was excessive He tried to condense it he kept it beside him unpublished and occasionally revised it with a view to condensation in vain The text received his final corrections in the year eighteen thirty two Wordsworth s reluctance to publish these portions of his great poem The Recluse other than The Excursion during his lifetime was a matter of surprise to his friends to whom he or the ladies of his household had read portions of it In the year eighteen nineteen Charles Lamb wrote to him If as you say The Waggoner in some sort came at my call oh for a potent voice to call forth The Recluse from his profound dormitory where he sleeps forgetful of his foolish charge the world The Letters of Charles Lamb edited by Alfred Ainger vol ii p twenty six The admission made in the letter of May first eighteen oh five is note worthy This defect of redundancy whenever I have suspected it or found it to exist in any writings of mine I have always found incurable The fault lies too deep and is in the first conception The actual result in the Poem he had at length committed to writing was so far inferior to the ideal he had tried to realise that he could never be induced to publish it He spoke of the MS as forming a sort of portico to his larger work the poem on Man Nature and Society which he meant to call The Recluse and of which one portion only viz The Excursion was finished It is clear that throughout the composition of The Prelude he felt that he was experimenting with his powers He wished to find out whether he could construct a literary work that might live on a larger scale than his Lyrics and it was on the writing of a philosophical poem dealing with Man and Nature in their deepest aspects that his thoughts had been fixed for many years From the letter to Sir George Beaumont December twenty five eighteen oh four it is evident that he regarded the autobiographical poem as a mere prologue to this larger work to which he hoped to turn with all his might after The Prelude was finished and of which he had already written about a fifth or a sixth see Memoirs vol i p three hundred four This was the part known in the Grasmere household as The Pedlar a title given to it from the character of the Wanderer but afterwards happily set aside He did not devote himself however to the completion of his wider purpose immediately after The Prelude was finished He wrote one book of The Recluse which he called Home at Grasmere and though detached from The Prelude it is a continuation of the narrative of his own life at the point where it is left off in the latter poem It consists of seven hundred thirty three lines Two extracts from it were published in the Memoirs of Wordsworth in eighteen fifty one vol i pp one hundred fifty one and one hundred fifty five beginning On Nature s invitation do I come and Bleak season was it turbulent and bleak These will be found in vol ii of this edition pp one hundred eighteen and one hundred twenty one respectively The autobiographical poem remained as already stated during Wordsworth s lifetime without a title The name finally adopted The Prelude was suggested by missus Wordsworth both to indicate its relation to the larger work and the fact of its having been written comparatively early As the poem was addressed to Coleridge it may be desirable to add in this place his critical verdict upon it along with the poem which he wrote on hearing Wordsworth read a portion of it to him in the winter of eighteen oh six at Coleorton In his Table Talk London eighteen thirty five vol ii p seventy Coleridge s opinion is recorded thus I cannot help regretting that Wordsworth did not first publish his thirteen fourteen books on the growth of an individual mind superior as I used to think upon the whole to The Excursion You may judge how I felt about them by my own Poem upon the occasion Then the plan laid out and I believe partly suggested by me was that Wordsworth should assume the station of a man in mental repose one whose principles were made up and so prepared to deliver upon authority a system of philosophy He was to treat man as man a subject of eye ear touch and taste in contact with external nature and informing the senses from the mind and not compounding a mind out of the senses then he was to describe the pastoral and other states of society assuming something of the Juvenalian spirit as he approached the high civilisation of cities and towns and opening a melancholy picture of the present state of degeneracy and vice thence he was to infer and reveal the proof of and necessity for the whole state of man and society being subject to and illustrative of a redemptive process in operation showing how this idea reconciled all the anomalies and promised future glory and restoration Something of this sort was I think agreed on It is in substance what I have been all my life doing in my system of philosophy I think Wordsworth possessed more of the genius of a great Philosopher than any man I ever knew or as I believe has existed in England since Milton but it seems to me that he ought never to have abandoned the contemplative position which is peculiarly perhaps I might say exclusively fitted for him His proper title is Spectator ab extra The following are Coleridge s Lines addressed to Wordsworth TO WILLIAM WORDSWORTH COMPOSED ON THE NIGHT AFTER HIS RECITATION OF A POEM ON THE GROWTH OF AN INDIVIDUAL MIND Friend of the wise and teacher of the good Into my heart have I received that lay More than historic that prophetic lay Wherein high theme by thee first sung aright Of the foundations and the building up Of a Human Spirit thou hast dared to tell What may be told to the understanding mind Revealable and what within the mind By vital breathings secret as the soul Of vernal growth oft quickens in the heart Thoughts all too deep for words Theme hard as high Of smiles spontaneous and mysterious fears The first born they of Reason and twin birth Of tides obedient to external force And currents self determined as might seem Or by some inner power of moments awful Now in thy inner life and now abroad When power streamed from thee and thy soul received The Light reflected as a light bestowed Of fancies fair and milder hours of youth Hyblean murmurs of poetic thought Industrious in its joy in vales and glens Native or outland lakes and famous hills Or on the lonely high road when the stars Were rising or by secret mountain streams The guides and the companions of thy way Of more than Fancy of the Social Sense Distending wide and man beloved as man Where France in all her towns lay vibrating Like some becalmed bark beneath the burst Of Heaven s immediate thunder when no cloud Is visible or shadow on the main For thou wert there thine own brows garlanded Amid the tremor of a realm aglow Amid a mighty nation jubilant When from the general heart of humankind Hope sprang forth like a full born Deity Of that dear Hope afflicted and struck down So summoned homeward thenceforth calm and sure From the dread watch tower of man s absolute self With light unwaning on her eyes to look Far on herself a glory to behold The Angel of the vision Then last strain Of Duty chosen laws controlling choice Action and joy An Orphic song indeed A song divine of high and passionate thoughts To their own music chanted O great Bard Ere yet that last strain dying awed the air With stedfast eye I viewed thee in the choir Of ever enduring men The truly great Have all one age and from one visible space Shed influence They both in power and act Are permanent and Time is not with them Save as it worketh for them they in it Nor less a sacred roll than those of old And to be placed as they with gradual fame Among the archives of mankind thy work Makes audible a linked lay of Truth Of Truth profound a sweet continuous lay Not learnt but native her own natural notes Ah as I listened with a heart forlorn The pulses of my being beat anew And even as life returns upon the drowned Life s joy rekindling roused a throng of pains Keen pangs of Love awakening as a babe Turbulent with an outcry in the heart And fears self willed that shunned the eye of hope And hope that scarce would know itself from fear Sense of past youth and manhood come in vain And genius given and knowledge won in vain And all which I had culled in wood walks wild And all which patient toil had reared and all Commune with thee had opened out but flowers Strewed on my corse and borne upon my bier In the same coffin for the self same grave Eve following eve Dear tranquil time when the sweet sense of Home Is sweetest moments for their own sake hailed And more desired more precious for thy song In silence listening like a devout child My soul lay passive by thy various strain Driven as in surges now beneath the stars With momentary stars of my own birth Fair constellated foam C still darting off Into the darkness now a tranquil sea Outspread and bright yet swelling to the moon And when O Friend my comforter and guide Strong in thyself and powerful to give strength Thy long sustained Song finally closed And thy deep voice had ceased yet thou thyself Wert still before my eyes and round us both That happy vision of beloved faces Scarce conscious and yet conscious of its close I sate my being blended in one thought Thought was it or aspiration or resolve Absorbed yet hanging still upon the sound And when I rose I found myself in prayer It was at Coleorton in Leicestershire where the Wordsworths lived during the winter of eighteen oh six seven in a farm house belonging to Sir George Beaumont and where Coleridge visited them that The Prelude was read aloud by its author on the occasion which gave birth to these lines

it brings From the green fields and from yon azure sky Whate er its mission the soft breeze can come five To none more grateful than to me escaped From the vast city A where I long had pined A discontented sojourner now free Free as a bird to settle where I will What dwelling shall receive me in what vale ten Shall be my harbour underneath what grove Shall I take up my home and what clear stream Shall with its murmur lull me into rest The earth is all before me B With a heart Joyous nor scared at its own liberty fifteen I look about and should the chosen guide Be nothing better than a wandering cloud I cannot miss my way I breathe again Trances of thought and mountings of the mind Come fast upon me it is shaken off twenty That burthen of my own unnatural self The heavy weight of many a weary day C Not mine and such as were not made for me Long months of peace if such bold word accord With any promises of human life twenty five Long months of ease and undisturbed delight Are mine in prospect whither shall I turn By road or pathway or through trackless field Up hill or down or shall some floating thing Upon the river point me out my course thirty Dear Liberty Yet what would it avail But for a gift that consecrates the joy For I methought while the sweet breath of heaven Was blowing on my body felt within A correspondent breeze that gently moved thirty five With quickening virtue but is now become A tempest a redundant energy Vexing its own creation Thanks to both And their congenial powers that while they join In breaking up a long continued frost forty Bring with them vernal promises the hope Of active days urged on by flying hours Days of sweet leisure taxed with patient thought Abstruse nor wanting punctual service high Matins and vespers of harmonious verse forty five Thus far O Friend D did I not used to make A present joy the matter of a song Pour forth that day my soul in measured strains That would not be forgotten and are here Recorded to the open fields I told fifty A prophecy poetic numbers came Spontaneously to clothe in priestly robe A renovated spirit singled out Such hope was mine for holy services My own voice cheered me and far more the mind s fifty five Internal echo of the imperfect sound To both I listened drawing from them both A cheerful confidence in things to come Content and not unwilling now to give A respite to this passion I paced on sixty With brisk and eager steps and came at length To a green shady place E where down I sate Beneath a tree slackening my thoughts by choice And settling into gentler happiness Twas autumn and a clear and placid day sixty five With warmth as much as needed from a sun Two hours declined towards the west a day With silver clouds and sunshine on the grass And in the sheltered and the sheltering grove A perfect stillness Many were the thoughts seventy Encouraged and dismissed till choice was made Of a known Vale F whither my feet should turn Nor rest till they had reached the very door Of the one cottage G which methought I saw No picture of mere memory ever looked seventy five So fair and while upon the fancied scene I gazed with growing love a higher power Than Fancy gave assurance of some work Of glory there forthwith to be begun Perhaps too there performed Thus long I mused eighty Nor e er lost sight of what I mused upon Save when amid the stately groves of oaks Now here now there an acorn from its cup Dislodged through sere leaves rustled or at once To the bare earth dropped with a startling sound eighty five From that soft couch I rose not till the sun Had almost touched the horizon casting then A backward glance upon the curling cloud Of city smoke by distance ruralised Keen as a Truant or a Fugitive ninety But as a Pilgrim resolute I took Even with the chance equipment of that hour The road that pointed toward the chosen Vale F It was a splendid evening and my soul Once more made trial of her strength nor lacked ninety five AEolian visitations but the harp Was soon defrauded and the banded host Of harmony dispersed in straggling sounds And lastly utter silence Be it so Why think of any thing but present good H one hundred So like a home bound labourer I pursued My way beneath the mellowing sun that shed Mild influence nor left in me one wish Again to bend the Sabbath of that time To a servile yoke What need of many words one hundred five A pleasant loitering journey through three days Continued brought me to my hermitage I I spare to tell of what ensued the life In common things the endless store of things Rare or at least so seeming every day one hundred ten Found all about me in one neighbourhood The self congratulation and from morn To night unbroken cheerfulness serene K But speedily an earnest longing rose To brace myself to some determined aim one hundred fifteen Reading or thinking either to lay up New stores or rescue from decay the old By timely interference and therewith Came hopes still higher that with outward life I might endue some airy phantasies one hundred twenty That had been floating loose about for years And to such beings temperately deal forth The many feelings that oppressed my heart That hope hath been discouraged welcome light Dawns from the east but dawns to disappear one hundred twenty five And mock me with a sky that ripens not Into a steady morning if my mind Remembering the bold promise of the past Would gladly grapple with some noble theme Vain is her wish where er she turns she finds one hundred thirty Impediments from day to day renewed And now it would content me to yield up Those lofty hopes awhile for present gifts Of humbler industry But oh dear Friend The Poet gentle creature as he is one hundred thirty five Hath like the Lover his unruly times His fits when he is neither sick nor well Though no distress be near him but his own Unmanageable thoughts his mind best pleased While she as duteous as the mother dove one hundred forty Sits brooding lives not always to that end But like the innocent bird hath goadings on That drive her as in trouble through the groves L With me is now such passion to be blamed No otherwise than as it lasts too long one hundred forty five When as becomes a man who would prepare For such an arduous work I through myself Make rigorous inquisition the report Is often cheering for I neither seem To lack that first great gift the vital soul one hundred fifty Nor general Truths which are themselves a sort Of Elements and Agents Under powers Subordinate helpers of the living mind Nor am I naked of external things Forms images nor numerous other aids one hundred fifty five Of less regard though won perhaps with toil And needful to build up a Poet s praise Time place and manners do I seek and these Are found in plenteous store but nowhere such As may be singled out with steady choice one hundred sixty No little band of yet remembered names Whom I in perfect confidence might hope To summon back from lonesome banishment And make them dwellers in the hearts of men Now living or to live in future years one hundred sixty five Sometimes the ambitious Power of choice mistaking Proud spring tide swellings for a regular sea Will settle on some British theme some old Romantic tale by Milton left unsung More often turning to some gentle place one hundred seventy Within the groves of Chivalry I pipe To shepherd swains or seated harp in hand Amid reposing knights by a river side Or fountain listen to the grave reports Of dire enchantments faced and overcome one hundred seventy five By the strong mind and tales of warlike feats Where spear encountered spear and sword with sword Fought as if conscious of the blazonry That the shield bore so glorious was the strife Whence inspiration for a song that winds one hundred eighty Through ever changing scenes of votive quest Wrongs to redress harmonious tribute paid To patient courage and unblemished truth To firm devotion zeal unquenchable And Christian meekness hallowing faithful loves one hundred eighty five Sometimes more sternly moved I would relate How vanquished Mithridates northward passed And hidden in the cloud of years became Odin the Father of a race by whom Perished the Roman Empire M how the friends one hundred ninety And followers of Sertorius N out of Spain Flying found shelter in the Fortunate Isles O And left their usages their arts and laws To disappear by a slow gradual death To dwindle and to perish one by one one hundred ninety five Starved in those narrow bounds P but not the soul Of Liberty which fifteen hundred years Survived and when the European came With skill and power that might not be withstood Did like a pestilence maintain its hold two hundred And wasted down by glorious death that race Of natural heroes or I would record How in tyrannic times some high souled man Unnamed among the chronicles of kings Suffered in silence for Truth s sake or tell two hundred five How that one Frenchman Q through continued force Of meditation on the inhuman deeds Of those who conquered first the Indian Isles Went single in his ministry across The Ocean not to comfort the oppressed two hundred ten But like a thirsty wind to roam about Withering the Oppressor how Gustavus sought Help at his need in Dalecarlia s mines R How Wallace fought for Scotland left the name Of Wallace to be found like a wild flower two hundred fifteen All over his dear Country S left the deeds Of Wallace like a family of Ghosts To people the steep rocks and river banks Her natural sanctuaries with a local soul Of independence and stern liberty two hundred twenty Sometimes it suits me better to invent A tale from my own heart more near akin To my own passions and habitual thoughts Some variegated story in the main Lofty but the unsubstantial structure melts two hundred twenty five Before the very sun that brightens it Mist into air dissolving Then a wish My best and favourite aspiration mounts With yearning toward some philosophic song Of Truth that cherishes our daily life two hundred thirty With meditations passionate from deep Recesses in man s heart immortal verse T Thoughtfully fitted to the Orphean lyre U But from this awful burthen I full soon Take refuge and beguile myself with trust two hundred thirty five That mellower years will bring a riper mind And clearer insight Thus my days are past In contradiction with no skill to part Vague longing haply bred by want of power From paramount impulse not to be withstood two hundred forty A timorous capacity from prudence From circumspection infinite delay Humility and modest awe themselves Betray me serving often for a cloak To a more subtle selfishness that now two hundred forty five Locks every function up in blank reserve Now dupes me trusting to an anxious eye That with intrusive restlessness beats off Simplicity and self presented truth Ah better far than this to stray about two hundred fifty Voluptuously through fields and rural walks And ask no record of the hours resigned To vacant musing unreproved neglect Of all things and deliberate holiday Far better never to have heard the name two hundred fifty five Of zeal and just ambition than to live Baffled and plagued by a mind that every hour Turns recreant to her task takes heart again Then feels immediately some hollow thought Hang like an interdict upon her hopes two hundred sixty This is my lot for either still I find Some imperfection in the chosen theme Or see of absolute accomplishment Much wanting so much wanting in myself That I recoil and droop and seek repose two hundred sixty five In listlessness from vain perplexity Unprofitably travelling toward the grave Like a false steward who hath much received And renders nothing back Was it for this That one the fairest of all rivers V loved two hundred seventy To blend his murmurs with my nurse s song And from his alder shades and rocky falls And from his fords and shallows sent a voice That flowed along my dreams For this didst thou O Derwent winding among grassy holms two hundred seventy five Where I was looking on a babe in arms Make ceaseless music that composed my thoughts To more than infant softness giving me Amid the fretful dwellings of mankind A foretaste a dim earnest of the calm two hundred eighty That Nature breathes among the hills and groves When he had left the mountains and received On his smooth breast the shadow of those towers W That yet survive a shattered monument Of feudal sway the bright blue river passed two hundred eighty five Along the margin of our terrace walk X A tempting playmate whom we dearly loved Oh many a time have I a five years child In a small mill race severed from his stream Made one long bathing of a summer s day two hundred ninety Basked in the sun and plunged and basked again Alternate all a summer s day or scoured The sandy fields leaping through flowery groves Of yellow ragwort or when rock and hill The woods and distant Skiddaw s lofty height two hundred ninety five Were bronzed with deepest radiance stood alone Beneath the sky as if I had been born On Indian plains and from my mother s hut Had run abroad in wantonness to sport A naked savage in the thunder shower three hundred Fair seed time had my soul and I grew up Fostered alike by beauty and by fear Much favoured in my birth place and no less In that beloved Vale to which erelong We were transplanted Y there were we let loose three hundred five For sports of wider range Ere I had told Ten birth days Z when among the mountain slopes Frost and the breath of frosty wind had snapped The last autumnal crocus a twas my joy With store of springes o er my shoulder hung three hundred ten To range the open heights where woodcocks run Along the smooth green turf b Through half the night Scudding away from snare to snare I plied That anxious visitation moon and stars Were shining o er my head I was alone three hundred fifteen And seemed to be a trouble to the peace That dwelt among them Sometimes it befel In these night wanderings that a strong desire O erpowered my better reason and the bird Which was the captive of another s toil three hundred twenty Became my prey and when the deed was done I heard among the solitary hills Low breathings coming after me and sounds Of undistinguishable motion steps Almost as silent as the turf they trod three hundred twenty five Nor less when spring had warmed the cultured Vale c Moved we as plunderers where the mother bird Had in high places built her lodge though mean Our object and inglorious yet the end Was not ignoble Oh when I have hung three hundred thirty Above the raven s nest by knots of grass And half inch fissures in the slippery rock But ill sustained and almost so it seemed Suspended by the blast that blew amain Shouldering the naked crag d oh at that time three hundred thirty five While on the perilous ridge I hung alone With what strange utterance did the loud dry wind Blow through my ear the sky seemed not a sky Of earth and with what motion moved the clouds Dust as we are the immortal spirit grows three hundred forty Like harmony in music there is a dark Inscrutable workmanship that reconciles Discordant elements makes them cling together In one society How strange that all The terrors pains and early miseries three hundred forty five Regrets vexations lassitudes interfused Within my mind should e er have borne a part And that a needful part in making up The calm existence that is mine when I Am worthy of myself Praise to the end three hundred fifty Thanks to the means which Nature deigned to employ Whether her fearless visitings or those That came with soft alarm like hurtless light Opening the peaceful clouds or she may use Severer interventions ministry three hundred fifty five More palpable as best might suit her aim One summer evening led by her I found A little boat tied to a willow tree Within a rocky cave e its usual home Straight I unloosed her chain and stepping in three hundred sixty Pushed from the shore It was an act of stealth And troubled pleasure nor without the voice Of mountain echoes did my boat move on Leaving behind her still on either side Small circles glittering idly in the moon three hundred sixty five Until they melted all into one track Of sparkling light But now like one who rows Proud of his skill to reach a chosen point With an unswerving line I fixed my view Upon the summit of a craggy ridge three hundred seventy The horizon s utmost boundary far above Was nothing but the stars and the grey sky She was an elfin pinnace lustily I dipped my oars into the silent lake And as I rose upon the stroke my boat three hundred seventy five Went heaving through the water like a swan When from behind that craggy steep till then The horizon s bound a huge peak black and huge As if with voluntary power instinct Upreared its head f I struck and struck again three hundred eighty And growing still in stature the grim shape Towered up between me and the stars and still For so it seemed with purpose of its own And measured motion like a living thing Strode after me With trembling oars I turned three hundred eighty five And through the silent water stole my way Back to the covert of the willow tree There in her mooring place I left my bark And through the meadows homeward went in grave And serious mood but after I had seen three hundred ninety That spectacle for many days my brain Worked with a dim and undetermined sense Of unknown modes of being o er my thoughts There hung a darkness call it solitude Or blank desertion No familiar shapes three hundred ninety five Remained no pleasant images of trees Of sea or sky no colours of green fields But huge and mighty forms that do not live Like living men moved slowly through the mind By day and were a trouble to my dreams four hundred Wisdom and Spirit of the universe Thou Soul that art the eternity of thought That givest to forms and images a breath And everlasting motion not in vain By day or star light thus from my first dawn four hundred five Of childhood didst thou intertwine for me The passions that build up our human soul Not with the mean and vulgar works of man But with high objects with enduring things With life and nature purifying thus four hundred ten The elements of feeling and of thought And sanctifying by such discipline Both pain and fear until we recognise A grandeur in the beatings of the heart Nor was this fellowship vouchsafed to me four hundred fifteen With stinted kindness In November days When vapours rolling down the valley made A lonely scene more lonesome among woods At noon and mid the calm of summer nights When by the margin of the trembling lake four hundred twenty Beneath the gloomy hills homeward I went In solitude such intercourse was mine Mine was it in the fields both day and night And by the waters all the summer long And in the frosty season when the sun four hundred twenty five Was set and visible for many a mile The cottage windows blazed through twilight gloom I heeded not their summons happy time It was indeed for all of us for me It was a time of rapture Clear and loud four hundred thirty The village clock tolled six I wheeled about Proud and exulting like an untired horse That cares not for his home All shod with steel We hissed along the polished ice in games Confederate imitative of the chase four hundred thirty five And woodland pleasures the resounding horn The pack loud chiming and the hunted hare So through the darkness and the cold we flew And not a voice was idle with the din Smitten the precipices rang aloud four hundred forty The leafless trees and every icy crag Tinkled like iron g while far distant hills Into the tumult sent an alien sound Of melancholy not unnoticed while the stars Eastward were sparkling clear and in the west four hundred forty five The orange sky of evening died away Not seldom from the uproar I retired Into a silent bay or sportively Glanced sideway leaving the tumultuous throng To cut across the reflex of a star four hundred fifty That fled and flying still before me gleamed Upon the glassy plain and oftentimes When we had given our bodies to the wind And all the shadowy banks on either side Came sweeping through the darkness spinning still four hundred fifty five The rapid line of motion then at once Have I reclining back upon my heels Stopped short yet still the solitary cliffs Wheeled by me even as if the earth had rolled With visible motion her diurnal round four hundred sixty Behind me did they stretch in solemn train Feebler and feebler and I stood and watched Till all was tranquil as a dreamless sleep h Ye Presences of Nature in the sky And on the earth Ye Visions of the hills four hundred sixty five And Souls of lonely places can I think A vulgar hope was yours when ye employed Such ministry when ye through many a year Haunting me thus among my boyish sports On caves and trees upon the woods and hills four hundred seventy Impressed upon all forms the characters Of danger or desire and thus did make The surface of the universal earth With triumph and delight with hope and fear Work like a sea Not uselessly employed four hundred seventy five Might I pursue this theme through every change Of exercise and play to which the year Did summon us in his delightful round We were a noisy crew the sun in heaven Beheld not vales more beautiful than ours four hundred eighty Nor saw a band in happiness and joy Richer or worthier of the ground they trod I could record with no reluctant voice The woods of autumn and their hazel bowers With milk white clusters hung the rod and line four hundred eighty five True symbol of hope s foolishness whose strong And unreproved enchantment led us on By rocks and pools shut out from every star All the green summer to forlorn cascades Among the windings hid of mountain brooks i four hundred ninety Unfading recollections at this hour The heart is almost mine with which I felt From some hill top on sunny afternoons j The paper kite high among fleecy clouds Pull at her rein like an impetuous courser four hundred ninety five Or from the meadows sent on gusty days Beheld her breast the wind then suddenly Dashed headlong and rejected by the storm Ye lowly cottages wherein we dwelt A ministration of your own was yours five hundred Can I forget you being as you were So beautiful among the pleasant fields In which ye stood or can I here forget The plain and seemly countenance with which Ye dealt out your plain comforts Yet had ye five hundred five Delights and exultations of your own k Eager and never weary we pursued Our home amusements by the warm peat fire At evening when with pencil and smooth slate In square divisions parcelled out and all five hundred ten With crosses and with cyphers scribbled o er We schemed and puzzled head opposed to head In strife too humble to be named in verse Or round the naked table snow white deal Cherry or maple sate in close array five hundred fifteen And to the combat Loo or Whist led on A thick ribbed army not as in the world Neglected and ungratefully thrown by Even for the very service they had wrought But husbanded through many a long campaign five hundred twenty Uncouth assemblage was it where no few Had changed their functions some plebeian cards l Which Fate beyond the promise of their birth m Had dignified and called to represent The persons of departed potentates five hundred twenty five Oh with what echoes on the board they fell Ironic diamonds clubs hearts diamonds spades A congregation piteously akin Cheap matter offered they to boyish wit Those sooty knaves precipitated down five hundred thirty With scoffs and taunts like Vulcan out of heaven The paramount ace a moon in her eclipse Queens gleaming through their splendour s last decay And monarchs surly at the wrongs sustained By royal visages Meanwhile abroad five hundred thirty five Incessant rain was falling or the frost Raged bitterly with keen and silent tooth And interrupting oft that eager game From under Esthwaite s splitting fields of ice The pent up air struggling to free itself five hundred forty Gave out to meadow grounds and hills a loud Protracted yelling like the noise of wolves Howling in troops along the Bothnic Main n Nor sedulous as I have been to trace How Nature by extrinsic passion first five hundred forty five Peopled the mind with forms sublime or fair And made me love them may I here omit How other pleasures have been mine and joys Of subtler origin how I have felt Not seldom even in that tempestuous time five hundred fifty Those hallowed and pure motions of the sense Which seem in their simplicity to own An intellectual charm that calm delight Which if I err not surely must belong To those first born affinities that fit five hundred fifty five Our new existence to existing things And in our dawn of being constitute The bond of union between life and joy Yes I remember when the changeful earth And twice five summers on my mind had stamped five hundred sixty The faces of the moving year even then I held unconscious intercourse with beauty Old as creation drinking in a pure Organic pleasure from the silver wreaths Of curling mist or from the level plain five hundred sixty five Of waters coloured by impending clouds o The sands of Westmoreland the creeks and bays Of Cumbria s rocky limits they can tell How when the Sea threw off his evening shade And to the shepherd s hut on distant hills five hundred seventy Sent welcome notice of the rising moon How I have stood to fancies such as these A stranger linking with the spectacle No conscious memory of a kindred sight And bringing with me no peculiar sense five hundred seventy five Of quietness or peace yet have I stood Even while mine eye hath moved o er many a league Of shining water gathering as it seemed Through every hair breadth in that field of light New pleasure like a bee among the flowers five hundred eighty Thus oft amid those fits of vulgar joy Which through all seasons on a child s pursuits Are prompt attendants mid that giddy bliss Which like a tempest works along the blood And is forgotten even then I felt five hundred eighty five Gleams like the flashing of a shield the earth And common face of Nature spake to me Rememberable things sometimes tis true By chance collisions and quaint accidents Like those ill sorted unions work supposed five hundred ninety Of evil minded fairies yet not vain Nor profitless if haply they impressed Collateral objects and appearances Albeit lifeless then and doomed to sleep Until maturer seasons called them forth five hundred ninety five To impregnate and to elevate the mind And if the vulgar joy by its own weight Wearied itself out of the memory The scenes which were a witness of that joy Remained in their substantial lineaments six hundred Depicted on the brain and to the eye Were visible a daily sight and thus By the impressive discipline of fear By pleasure and repeated happiness So frequently repeated and by force six hundred five Of obscure feelings representative Of things forgotten these same scenes so bright So beautiful so majestic in themselves Though yet the day was distant did become Habitually dear and all their forms six hundred ten And changeful colours by invisible links Were fastened to the affections I began My story early not misled I trust By an infirmity of love for days Disowned by memory ere the breath of spring six hundred fifteen Planting my snowdrops among winter snows p Nor will it seem to thee O Friend so prompt In sympathy that I have lengthened out With fond and feeble tongue a tedious tale Meanwhile my hope has been that I might fetch six hundred twenty Invigorating thoughts from former years Might fix the wavering balance of my mind And haply meet reproaches too whose power May spur me on in manhood now mature To honourable toil Yet should these hopes six hundred twenty five Prove vain and thus should neither I be taught To understand myself nor thou to know With better knowledge how the heart was framed Of him thou lovest need I dread from thee Harsh judgments if the song be loth to quit six hundred thirty Those recollected hours that have the charm Of visionary things those lovely forms And sweet sensations that throw back our life And almost make remotest infancy A visible scene on which the sun is shining q six hundred thirty five One end at least hath been attained my mind Hath been revived and if this genial mood Desert me not forthwith shall be brought down Through later years the story of my life The road lies plain before me tis a theme six hundred forty Single and of determined bounds and hence I choose it rather at this time than work Of ampler or more varied argument Where I might be discomfited and lost And certain hopes are with me that to thee six hundred forty five This labour will be welcome honoured Friend FOOTNOTES TO BOOK THE FIRST Footnote A On the authority of the poet s nephew and others the city here referred to has invariably been supposed to be Goslar where he spent the winter of seventeen ninety nine Goslar however is as unlike a vast city as it is possible to conceive Wordsworth could have walked from end to end of it in ten minutes One would think he was rather referring to London but there is no evidence to show that he visited the metropolis in the spring of seventeen ninety nine The lines which follow about the open fields l fifty are certainly more appropriate to a journey from London to Sockburn than from Goslar to Gottingen and what follows the green shady place of l sixty two the known Vale and the cottage of ll

Mithridates becoming Odin Probably Wordsworth means that he would invent rather than relate the story Gibbon Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire chap x says It is supposed that Odin was the chief of a tribe of barbarians who dwelt on the banks of Lake Maeotis till the fall of Mithridates and the arms of Pompey menaced the north with servitude that Odin yielding with indignant fury to a power which he was unable to resist conducted his tribe from the frontiers of Asiatic Sarmatia into Sweden See also Mallet Northern Antiquities and Crichton and Wheaton s Scandinavia Edinburgh Cabinet

had been driven by tempests he knew not whither and raved about an island in the far deep upon which he had landed and which he had found peopled and adorned with noble cities The inhabitants told him

refer to Cockermouth They are the fifth sixth and seventh in that series of Sonnets and are entitled respectively To the River Derwent In sight of the Town of Cockermouth and the Address from the Spirit of Cockermouth Castle It was proposed some time ago that this house which is known in Cockermouth as Wordsworth House should be purchased and since the Grammar School of the place is out of

School in seventeen seventy eight Ed Footnote a About mid October the autumn crocus in the garden snaps in that district Ed Footnote b Possibly in the Claife and Colthouse heights to the east of Esthwaite Water but more probably the round headed grassy hills that lead up and on to the moor between Hawkshead and Coniston where the turf is always green and smooth Ed Footnote c Yewdale see next note Cultured Vale exactly describes the little oat growing valley of Yewdale Ed Footnote d As there are no naked crags with half inch fissures in the slippery rocks in the cultured vale of Esthwaite the locality referred to is probably the Hohne Fells above Yewdale to the north of Coniston and only a few miles from Hawkshead where a crag now named Raven s Crag divides Tilberthwaite from Yewdale In his Epistle to Sir George Beaumont Wordsworth speaks of Yewdale as a plain spread Under a rock too steep for man to tread Where sheltered from the north and bleak north west Aloft the Raven hangs a visible nest Fearless of all assaults that would her brood molest Ed Footnote e doctor Cradock suggested the reading rocky cove Rocky cave is tautological and Wordsworth would hardly apply the epithet to an ordinary boat house Ed Footnote f The craggy steep till then the horizon s bound is probably the ridge of Ironkeld reaching from high Arnside to the Tom Heights above Tarn Hows while the huge peak black and huge as if with voluntary power instinct may he either the summit of Wetherlam or of Pike o Blisco mister Rawnsley however is of opinion that if Wordsworth rowed off from the west bank of Fasthwaite he might see beyond the craggy ridge of Loughrigg the mass of Nab Scar and Rydal Head would rise up black and huge If he rowed from the east side then Pike o Stickle or Harrison Stickle

interior It may be reached through a picturesque archway near the principal inn of the village The Lion and is on the right of a small open yard which is entered through this archway To the left a lane leads westwards to the open country It is a humble dwelling of two storeys The floor of the basement flat paved with the blue flags of Coniston slate is not likely to have been changed since

i four I was for that time lifted above earth And possess d joys not promised in my birth Ed Footnote n The notes to this edition are explanatory rather than critical but as this image has been objected to as inaccurate and out of all analogy with Wordsworth s use and wont it may be mentioned that the noise of the breaking up of the ice after a severe winter in these lakes when it cracks and splits in all directions is exactly as here described It is not of course in any sense peculiar to the English lakes but there are probably few districts where the peculiar noise referred to can be heard so easily or frequently Compare Coleridge s account of the Lake of Ratzeburg in winter in The Friend vol ii p three hundred twenty three edition of eighteen eighteen and his reference to the thunders and howlings of the breaking ice Ed Footnote o I here insert a very remarkable MS variation of the text or rather I think one of these experiments in dealing with his theme which were common with Wordsworth I found it in a copy of the Poems belonging to the poet s son I tread the mazes of this argument and paint How nature by collateral interest And by extrinsic passion peopled first My mind with beauteous objects may I well Forget what might demand a loftier song For oft the Eternal Spirit He that has His Life in unimaginable things And he who painting what He is in all The visible imagery of all the World Is yet apparent chiefly as the Soul Of our first sympathies O bounteous power In Childhood in rememberable days How often did thy love renew for me Those naked feelings which when thou would saint form A living thing thou sendest like a breeze Into its infant being Soul of things How often did thy love renew for me Those hallowed and pure motions of the sense Which seem in their simplicity to own An intellectual charm That calm delight Which if I err not surely must belong To those first born affinities which fit Our new existence to existing things And in our dawn of being constitute The bond of union betwixt life and joy Yes I remember when the changeful youth And twice five seasons on my mind had stamped The faces of the moving year even then A child I held unconscious intercourse With the eternal beauty drinking in A pure organic pleasure from the lines Of curling mist or from the smooth expanse Of waters coloured by the clouds of Heaven Ed Footnote p Snowdrops still grow abundantly in many an orchard and meadow by the road which skirts the western side of Esthwaite Lake Ed Footnote q Compare the Ode Intimations of Immortality stanza ix Ed BOOK SECOND SCHOOL TIME continued Thus far O Friend have we though leaving much Unvisited endeavoured to retrace The simple ways in which my childhood walked Those chiefly that first led me to the love Of rivers woods and fields The passion yet five Was in its birth sustained as might befal By nourishment that came unsought for still From week to week from month to month we lived A round of tumult Duly were our games Prolonged in summer till the day light failed ten No chair remained before the doors the bench And threshold steps were empty fast asleep The labourer and the old man who had sate A later lingerer yet the revelry Continued and the loud uproar at last fifteen When all the ground was dark and twinkling stars Edged the black clouds home and to bed we went Feverish with weary joints and beating minds Ah is there one who ever has been young Nor needs a warning voice to tame the pride twenty Of intellect and virtue s self esteem One is there though the wisest and the best Of all mankind who covets not at times Union that cannot be who would not give If so he might to duty and to truth twenty five The eagerness of infantine desire A tranquillising spirit presses now On my corporeal frame so wide appears The vacancy between me and those days Which yet have such self presence in my mind thirty That musing on them often do I seem Two consciousnesses conscious of myself And of some other Being A rude mass Of native rock left midway in the square Of our small market village was the goal thirty five Or centre of these sports A and when returned After long absence thither I repaired Gone was the old grey stone and in its place A smart Assembly room usurped the ground That had been ours There let the fiddle scream forty And be ye happy Yet my Friends I know That more than one of you will think with me Of those soft starry nights and that old Dame From whom the stone was named who there had sate And watched her table with its huckster s wares forty five Assiduous through the length of sixty years We ran a boisterous course the year span round With giddy motion But the time approached That brought with it a regular desire For calmer pleasures when the winning forms fifty Of Nature were collaterally attached To every scheme of holiday delight And every boyish sport less grateful else And languidly pursued When summer came Our pastime was on bright half holidays fifty five To sweep along the plain of Windermere With rival oars B and the selected bourne Was now an Island musical with birds That sang and ceased not now a Sister Isle Beneath the oaks umbrageous covert sown sixty With lilies of the valley like a field C And now a third small Island where survived In solitude the ruins of a shrine Once to Our Lady dedicate and served Daily with chaunted rites D In such a race sixty five So ended disappointment could be none Uneasiness or pain or jealousy We rested in the shade all pleased alike Conquered and conqueror Thus the pride of strength And the vain glory of superior skill seventy Were tempered thus was gradually produced A quiet independence of the heart And to my Friend who knows me I may add Fearless of blame that hence for future days Ensued a diffidence and modesty seventy five And I was taught to feel perhaps too much The self sufficing power of Solitude Our daily meals were frugal Sabine fare More than we wished we knew the blessing then Of vigorous hunger hence corporeal strength eighty Unsapped by delicate viands for exclude A little weekly stipend and we lived Through three divisions of the quartered year In penniless poverty But now to school From the half yearly holidays returned eighty five We came with weightier purses that sufficed To furnish treats more costly than the Dame Of the old grey stone from her scant board supplied Hence rustic dinners on the cool green ground Or in the woods or by a river side ninety Or shady fountains while among the leaves Soft airs were stirring and the mid day sun Unfelt shone brightly round us in our joy Nor is my aim neglected if I tell How sometimes in the length of those half years ninety five We from our funds drew largely proud to curb And eager to spur on the galloping steed And with the courteous inn keeper whose stud Supplied our want we haply might employ Sly subterfuge if the adventure s bound one hundred Were distant some famed temple where of yore The Druids worshipped E or the antique walls Of that large abbey where within the Vale Of Nightshade to saint Mary s honour built F Stands yet a mouldering pile with fractured arch one hundred five Belfry G and images and living trees A holy scene Along the smooth green turf Our horses grazed To more than inland peace Left by the west wind sweeping overhead From a tumultuous ocean trees and towers one hundred ten In that sequestered valley may be seen Both silent and both motionless alike Such the deep shelter that is there and such The safeguard for repose and quietness Our steeds remounted and the summons given one hundred fifteen With whip and spur we through the chauntry flew In uncouth race and left the cross legged knight And the stone abbot H and that single wren Which one day sang so sweetly in the nave Of the old church that though from recent showers one hundred twenty The earth was comfortless and touched by faint Internal breezes sobbings of the place And respirations from the roofless walls The shuddering ivy dripped large drops yet still So sweetly mid the gloom the invisible bird one hundred twenty five Sang to herself that there I could have made My dwelling place and lived for ever there To hear such music Through the walls we flew And down the valley and a circuit made In wantonness of heart through rough and smooth one hundred thirty We scampered homewards Oh ye rocks and streams And that still spirit shed from evening air Even in this joyous time I sometimes felt Your presence when with slackened step we breathed Along the sides of the steep hills or when one hundred thirty five Lighted by gleams of moonlight from the sea We beat with thundering hoofs the level sand Midway on long Winander s eastern shore Within the crescent of a pleasant bay I A tavern stood K no homely featured house one hundred forty Primeval like its neighbouring cottages But twas a splendid place the door beset With chaises grooms and liveries and within Decanters glasses and the blood red wine In ancient times and ere the Hall was built one hundred forty five On the large island had this dwelling been More worthy of a poet s love a hut Proud of its own bright fire and sycamore shade But though the rhymes were gone that once inscribed The threshold and large golden characters one hundred fifty Spread o er the spangled sign board had dislodged The old Lion and usurped his place in slight And mockery of the rustic painter s hand L Yet to this hour the spot to me is dear With all its foolish pomp The garden lay one hundred fifty five Upon a slope surmounted by a plain Of a small bowling green beneath us stood A grove with gleams of water through the trees And over the tree tops M nor did we want Refreshment strawberries and mellow cream one hundred sixty There while through half an afternoon we played On the smooth platform whether skill prevailed Or happy blunder triumphed bursts of glee Made all the mountains ring But ere night fall When in our pinnace we returned at leisure one hundred sixty five Over the shadowy lake and to the beach Of some small island steered our course with one The Minstrel of the Troop and left him there N And rowed off gently while he blew his flute Alone upon the rock oh then the calm one hundred seventy And dead still water lay upon my mind Even with a weight of pleasure and the sky Never before so beautiful sank down Into my heart and held me like a dream Thus were my sympathies enlarged and thus one hundred seventy five Daily the common range of visible things Grew dear to me already I began To love the sun a boy I loved the sun Not as I since have loved him as a pledge And surety of our earthly life a light one hundred eighty Which we behold and feel we are alive O Nor for his bounty to so many worlds But for this cause that I had seen him lay His beauty on the morning hills had seen The western mountain P touch his setting orb one hundred eighty five In many a thoughtless hour when from excess Of happiness my blood appeared to flow For its own pleasure and I breathed with joy And from like feelings humble though intense To patriotic and domestic love one hundred ninety Analogous the moon to me was dear For I could dream away my purposes Standing to gaze upon her while she hung Midway between the hills as if she knew No other region but belonged to thee Q one hundred ninety five Yea appertained by a peculiar right To thee and thy grey huts thou one dear Vale R Those incidental charms which first attached My heart to rural objects day by day Grew weaker and I hasten on to tell two hundred How Nature intervenient till this time And secondary now at length was sought For her own sake But who shall parcel out His intellect by geometric rules Split like a province into round and square two hundred five Who knows the individual hour in which His habits were first sown even as a seed Who that shall point as with a wand and say This portion of the river of my mind Came from yon fountain S Thou my Friend art one two hundred ten More deeply read in thy own thoughts to thee Science appears but what in truth she is Not as our glory and our absolute boast But as a succedaneum and a prop To our infirmity No officious slave two hundred fifteen Art thou of that false secondary power By which we multiply distinctions then Deem that our puny boundaries are things That we perceive and not that we have made To thee unblinded by these formal arts two hundred twenty The unity of all hath been revealed And thou wilt doubt with me less aptly skilled Than many are to range the faculties In scale and order class the cabinet Of their sensations and in voluble phrase two hundred twenty five Run through the history and birth of each As of a single independent thing Hard task vain hope to analyse the mind If each most obvious and particular thought Not in a mystical and idle sense two hundred thirty But in the words of Reason deeply weighed Hath no beginning Blest the infant Babe For with my best conjecture I would trace Our Being s earthly progress blest the Babe Nursed in his Mother s arms who sinks to sleep two hundred thirty five Rocked on his Mother s breast who with his soul Drinks in the feelings of his Mother s eye For him in one dear Presence there exists A virtue which irradiates and exalts Objects through widest intercourse of sense two hundred forty No outcast he bewildered and depressed Along his infant veins are interfused The gravitation and the filial bond Of nature that connect him with the world Is there a flower to which he points with hand two hundred forty five Too weak to gather it already love Drawn from love s purest earthly fount for him Hath beautified that flower already shades Of pity cast from inward tenderness Do fall around him upon aught that bears two hundred fifty Unsightly marks of violence or harm Emphatically such a Being lives Frail creature as he is helpless as frail An inmate of this active universe For feeling has to him imparted power two hundred fifty five That through the growing faculties of sense Doth like an agent of the one great Mind Create creator and receiver both Working but in alliance with the works Which it beholds Such verily is the first two hundred sixty Poetic spirit of our human life By uniform control of after years In most abated or suppressed in some Through every change of growth and of decay Pre eminent till death From early days two hundred sixty five Beginning not long after that first time In which a Babe by intercourse of touch I held mute dialogues with my Mother s heart I have endeavoured to display the means Whereby this infant sensibility two hundred seventy Great birthright of our being was in me Augmented and sustained Yet is a path More difficult before me and I fear That in its broken windings we shall need The chamois sinews and the eagle s wing two hundred seventy five For now a trouble came into my mind From unknown causes I was left alone Seeking the visible world nor knowing why The props of my affections were removed And yet the building stood as if sustained two hundred eighty By its own spirit All that I beheld Was dear and hence to finer influxes The mind lay open to a more exact And close communion Many are our joys In youth but oh what happiness to live two hundred eighty five When every hour brings palpable access Of knowledge when all knowledge is delight And sorrow is not there The seasons came And every season wheresoe er I moved Unfolded transitory qualities two hundred ninety Which but for this most watchful power of love Had been neglected left a register Of permanent relations else unknown Hence life and change and beauty solitude More active even than best society T two hundred ninety five Society made sweet as solitude By silent inobtrusive sympathies And gentle agitations of the mind From manifold distinctions difference Perceived in things where to the unwatchful eye three hundred No difference is and hence from the same source Sublimer joy for I would walk alone Under the quiet stars and at that time Have felt whate er there is of power in sound To breathe an elevated mood by form three hundred five Or image unprofaned and I would stand If the night blackened with a coming storm Beneath some rock listening to notes that are The ghostly language of the ancient earth Or make their dim abode in distant winds three hundred ten Thence did I drink the visionary power And deem not profitless those fleeting moods Of shadowy exultation not for this That they are kindred to our purer mind And intellectual life but that the soul three hundred fifteen Remembering how she felt but what she felt Remembering not retains an obscure sense Of possible sublimity whereto With growing faculties she doth aspire With faculties still growing feeling still three hundred twenty That whatsoever point they gain they yet Have something to pursue And not alone Mid gloom and tumult but no less mid fair And tranquil scenes that universal power And fitness in the latent qualities three hundred twenty five And essences of things by which the mind Is moved with feelings of delight to me Came strengthened with a superadded soul A virtue not its own My morning walks Were early oft before the hours of school U three hundred thirty I travelled round our little lake V five miles Of pleasant wandering Happy time more dear For this that one was by my side a Friend W Then passionately loved with heart how full Would he peruse these lines For many years three hundred thirty five Have since flowed in between us and our minds Both silent to each other at this time We live as if those hours had never been Nor seldom did I lift our cottage latch X Far earlier ere one smoke wreath had risen three hundred forty From human dwelling or the vernal thrush Was audible and sate among the woods Alone upon some jutting eminence Y At the first gleam of dawn light when the Vale Yet slumbering lay in utter solitude three hundred forty five How shall I seek the origin where find Faith in the marvellous things which then I felt Oft in these moments such a holy calm Would overspread my soul that bodily eyes Were utterly forgotten and what I saw three hundred fifty Appeared like something in myself a dream A prospect in the mind Z Twere long to tell What spring and autumn what the winter snows And what the summer shade what day and night Evening and morning sleep and waking thought three hundred fifty five From sources inexhaustible poured forth To feed the spirit of religious love In which I walked with Nature But let this Be not forgotten that I still retained My first creative sensibility three hundred sixty That by the regular action of the world My soul was unsubdued A plastic power Abode with me a forming hand at times Rebellious acting in a devious mood A local spirit of his own at war three hundred sixty five With general tendency but for the most Subservient strictly to external things With which it communed An auxiliar light Came from my mind which on the setting sun Bestowed new splendour the melodious birds three hundred seventy The fluttering breezes fountains that run on Murmuring so sweetly in themselves obeyed A like dominion and the midnight storm Grew darker in the presence of my eye Hence my obeisance my devotion hence three hundred seventy five And hence my transport Nor should this perchance Pass unrecorded that I still had loved The exercise and produce of a toil Than analytic industry to me More pleasing and whose character I deem three hundred eighty Is more poetic as resembling more Creative agency The song would speak Of that interminable building reared By observation of affinities In objects where no brotherhood exists three hundred eighty five To passive minds My seventeenth year was come And whether from this habit rooted now So deeply in my mind or from excess In the great social principle of life Coercing all things into sympathy three hundred ninety To unorganic ratures were transferred My own enjoyments or the power of truth Coming in revelation did converse With things that really are I at this time Saw blessings spread around me like a sea three hundred ninety five Thus while the days flew by and years passed on From Nature and her overflowing soul I had received so much that all my thoughts Were steeped in feeling I was only then Contented when with bliss ineffable four hundred I felt the sentiment of Being spread O er all that moves and all that seemeth still O er all that lost beyond the reach of thought And human knowledge to the human eye Invisible yet liveth to the heart four hundred five O er all that leaps and runs and shouts and sings Or beats the gladsome air o er all that glides Beneath the wave yea in the wave itself And mighty depth of waters Wonder not If high the transport great the joy I felt four hundred ten Communing in this sort through earth and heaven With every form of creature as it looked Towards the Uncreated with a countenance Of adoration with an eye of love One song they sang and it was audible four hundred fifteen Most audible then when the fleshly ear O ercome by humblest prelude of that strain Forgot her functions and slept undisturbed If this be error and another faith Find easier access to the pious mind four hundred twenty Yet were I grossly destitute of all Those human sentiments that make this earth So dear if I should fail with grateful voice To speak of you ye mountains and ye lakes And sounding cataracts ye mists and winds four hundred twenty five That dwell among the hills where I was born If in my youth I have been pure in heart If mingling with the world I am content With my own modest pleasures and have lived With God and Nature communing removed four hundred thirty From little enmities and low desires The gift is yours if in these times of fear This melancholy waste of hopes o erthrown If mid indifference and apathy And wicked exultation when good men four hundred thirty five On every side fall off we know not how To selfishness disguised in gentle names Of peace and quiet and domestic love Yet mingled not unwillingly with sneers On visionary minds if in this time four hundred forty Of dereliction and dismay I yet Despair not of our nature but retain A more than Roman confidence a faith That fails not in all sorrow my support The blessing of my life the gift is yours four hundred forty five Ye winds and sounding cataracts tis yours Ye mountains thine O Nature Thou hast fed My lofty speculations and in thee For this uneasy heart of ours I find A never failing principle of joy four hundred fifty And purest passion Thou my Friend wert reared In the great city mid far other scenes a But we by different roads at length have gained The self same bourne And for this cause to thee I speak unapprehensive of contempt four hundred fifty five The insinuated scoff of coward tongues And all that silent language which so oft In conversation between man and man Blots from the human countenance all trace Of beauty and of love For thou hast sought four hundred sixty The truth in solitude and since the days That gave thee liberty full long desired To serve in Nature s temple thou hast been The most assiduous of her ministers In many things my brother chiefly here four hundred sixty five In this our deep devotion Fare thee well Health and the quiet of a healthful mind Attend thee seeking oft the haunts of men And yet more often living with thyself And for thyself so haply shall thy days four hundred seventy Be many and a blessing to mankind b FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT Footnote A The square of the small market village of Hawkshead still remains and the presence of the new assembly room does not prevent us from realising it as open with the rude mass of native rock left midway in it the old grey stone which was the centre of the village sports Ed Footnote B Compare The Excursion book ix ll four hundred eighty seven ninety When on thy bosom spacious Windermere A Youth I practised this delightful art Tossed on the waves alone or mid a crew Of joyous comrades Ed Footnote C Compare The Excursion book ix l five hundred forty four describing a fair Isle with birch trees fringed where they gathered leaves of that shy plant its flower was shed the lily of the vale Ed Footnote D These islands in Windermere are easily identified In the Lily of the Valley Island the plant still grows though not abundantly but from Lady Holme the ruins of a shrine Once to Our Lady dedicate have disappeared as completely as the shrine in saint Herbert s Island Derwentwater The third island musical with birds That sang and ceased not may have been House Holme or that now called Thomson s Holme It could hardly have been Belle Isle since from its size it could not be described as a Sister Isle to the one where the lily of the valley grew beneath the oaks umbrageous covert Ed Footnote E Doubtless the circle was at Conishead Priory on the Cartmell Sands or that in the vale of Swinside on the north east side of Black Combe more probably the former The whole district is rich in Druidical remains but Wordsworth would not refer to the Keswick circle or to Long Meg and her Daughters in this connection and the proximity of the temple on the Cartmell Shore to the Furness Abbey ruins and the ease with which it could be visited on holidays by the boys from Hawkshead school make it almost certain that he refers to it Ed

house where she lived at Hawkshead Ed Footnote Y Probably on the western side of the Vale above the village There is but one jutting eminence on this side of the valley It is an old moraine now grass covered and from this point the view both of the village and of the vale is noteworthy The jutting eminence however may have been a crag amongst the Colthouse heights to the north east of Hawkshead Ed

Thomsons Castle of Indolence vol ii p three hundred five Ed BOOK THIRD RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE It was a dreary morning when the wheels Rolled over a wide plain o erhung with clouds And nothing cheered our way till first we saw The long roofed chapel of King s College lift Turrets and pinnacles in answering files five Extended high above a dusky grove A Advancing we espied upon the road A student clothed in gown and tasselled cap Striding along as if o ertasked by Time Or covetous of exercise and air ten He passed nor was I master of my eyes Till he was left an arrow s flight behind As near and nearer to the spot we drew It seemed to suck us in with an eddy s force Onward we drove beneath the Castle caught fifteen While crossing Magdalene Bridge a glimpse of Cam And at the Hoop alighted famous Inn B My spirit was up my thoughts were full of hope Some friends I had acquaintances who there Seemed friends poor simple school boys now hung round twenty With honour and importance in a world Of welcome faces up and down I roved Questions directions warnings and advice Flowed in upon me from all sides fresh day Of pride and pleasure to myself I seemed twenty five A man of business and expense and went From shop to shop about my own affairs To Tutor or to Tailor as befel From street to street with loose and careless mind I was the Dreamer they the Dream I roamed thirty Delighted through the motley spectacle Gowns grave or gaudy doctors students streets Courts cloisters flocks of churches gateways towers Migration strange for a stripling of the hills A northern villager As if the change thirty five Had waited on some Fairy s wand at once Behold me rich in monies and attired In splendid garb with hose of silk and hair Powdered like rimy trees when frost is keen My lordly dressing gown I pass it by forty With other signs of manhood that supplied The lack of beard The weeks went roundly on With invitations suppers wine and fruit Smooth housekeeping within and all without Liberal and suiting gentleman s array forty five The Evangelist saint John my patron was Three Gothic courts are his and in the first Was my abiding place a nook obscure C Right underneath the College kitchens made A humming sound less tuneable than bees fifty But hardly less industrious with shrill notes Of sharp command and scolding intermixed Near me hung Trinity s loquacious clock Who never let the quarters night or day Slip by him unproclaimed and told the hours fifty five Twice over with a male and female voice Her pealing organ was my neighbour too And from my pillow looking forth by light Of moon or favouring stars I could behold The antechapel where the statue stood sixty Of Newton with his prism and silent face The marble index of a mind for ever Voyaging through strange seas of Thought alone Of College labours of the Lecturer s room All studded round as thick as chairs could stand sixty five With loyal students faithful to their books Half and half idlers hardy recusants And honest dunces of important days Examinations when the man was weighed As in a balance of excessive hopes seventy Tremblings withal and commendable fears Small jealousies and triumphs good or bad Let others that know more speak as they know Such glory was but little sought by me And little won Yet from the first crude days seventy five Of settling time in this untried abode I was disturbed at times by prudent thoughts Wishing to hope without a hope some fears About my future worldly maintenance And more than all a strangeness in the mind eighty A feeling that I was not for that hour Nor for that place But wherefore be cast down For not to speak of Reason and her pure Reflective acts to fix the moral law Deep in the conscience nor of Christian Hope eighty five Bowing her head before her sister Faith As one far mightier hither I had come Bear witness Truth endowed with holy powers And faculties whether to work or feel Oft when the dazzling show no longer new ninety Had ceased to dazzle ofttimes did I quit My comrades leave the crowd buildings and groves And as I paced alone the level fields Far from those lovely sights and sounds sublime With which I had been conversant the mind ninety five Drooped not but there into herself returning With prompt rebound seemed fresh as heretofore At least I more distinctly recognised Her native instincts let me dare to speak A higher language say that now I felt one hundred What independent solaces were mine To mitigate the injurious sway of place Or circumstance how far soever changed In youth or to be changed in manhood s prime Or for the few who shall be called to look one hundred five On the long shadows in our evening years Ordained precursors to the night of death As if awakened summoned roused constrained I looked for universal things perused The common countenance of earth and sky one hundred ten Earth nowhere unembellished by some trace Of that first Paradise whence man was driven And sky whose beauty and bounty are expressed By the proud name she bears the name of Heaven I called on both to teach me what they might one hundred fifteen Or turning the mind in upon herself Pored watched expected listened spread my thoughts And spread them with a wider creeping felt Incumbencies more awful visitings Of the Upholder of the tranquil soul one hundred twenty That tolerates the indignities of Time And from the centre of Eternity All finite motions overruling lives In glory immutable But peace enough Here to record that I was mounting now one hundred twenty five To such community with highest truth A track pursuing not untrod before From strict analogies by thought supplied Or consciousnesses not to be subdued To every natural form rock fruit or flower one hundred thirty Even the loose stones that cover the high way I gave a moral life I saw them feel Or linked them to some feeling the great mass Lay bedded in a quickening soul and all That I beheld respired with inward meaning one hundred thirty five Add that whate er of Terror or of Love Or Beauty Nature s daily face put on From transitory passion unto this I was as sensitive as waters are To the sky s influence in a kindred mood one hundred forty Of passion was obedient as a lute That waits upon the touches of the wind Unknown unthought of yet I was most rich I had a world about me twas my own I made it for it only lived to me one hundred forty five And to the God who sees into the heart Such sympathies though rarely were betrayed By outward gestures and by visible looks Some called it madness so indeed it was If child like fruitfulness in passing joy one hundred fifty If steady moods of thoughtfulness matured To inspiration sort with such a name If prophecy be madness if things viewed By poets in old time and higher up By the first men earth s first inhabitants one hundred fifty five May in these tutored days no more be seen With undisordered sight But leaving this It was no madness for the bodily eye Amid my strongest workings evermore Was searching out the lines of difference one hundred sixty As they lie hid in all external forms Near or remote minute or vast an eye Which from a tree a stone a withered leaf To the broad ocean and the azure heavens Spangled with kindred multitudes of stars one hundred sixty five Could find no surface where its power might sleep Which spake perpetual logic to my soul And by an unrelenting agency Did bind my feelings even as in a chain And here O Friend have I retraced my life one hundred seventy Up to an eminence and told a tale Of matters which not falsely may be called The glory of my youth Of genius power Creation and divinity itself I have been speaking for my theme has been one hundred seventy five What passed within me Not of outward things Done visibly for other minds words signs Symbols or actions but of my own heart Have I been speaking and my youthful mind O Heavens how awful is the might of souls one hundred eighty And what they do within themselves while yet The yoke of earth is new to them the world Nothing but a wild field where they were sown This is in truth heroic argument This genuine prowess which I wished to touch one hundred eighty five With hand however weak but in the main It lies far hidden from the reach of words Points have we all of us within our souls Where all stand single this I feel and make Breathings for incommunicable powers one hundred ninety But is not each a memory to himself And therefore now that we must quit this theme I am not heartless for there s not a man That lives who hath not known his god like hours And feels not what an empire we inherit one hundred ninety five As natural beings in the strength of Nature No more for now into a populous plain We must descend A Traveller I am Whose tale is only of himself even so So be it if the pure of heart be prompt two hundred To follow and if thou my honoured Friend Who in these thoughts art ever at my side Support as heretofore my fainting steps It hath been told that when the first delight That flashed upon me from this novel show two hundred five Had failed the mind returned into herself Yet true it is that I had made a change In climate and my nature s outward coat Changed also slowly and insensibly Full oft the quiet and exalted thoughts two hundred ten Of loneliness gave way to empty noise And superficial pastimes now and then Forced labour and more frequently forced hopes And worst of all a treasonable growth Of indecisive judgments that impaired two hundred fifteen And shook the mind s simplicity And yet This was a gladsome time Could I behold Who less insensible than sodden clay In a sea river s bed at ebb of tide Could have beheld with undelighted heart two hundred twenty So many happy youths so wide and fair A congregation in its budding time Of health and hope and beauty all at once So many divers samples from the growth Of life s sweet season could have seen unmoved two hundred twenty five That miscellaneous garland of wild flowers Decking the matron temples of a place So famous through the world To me at least It was a goodly prospect for in sooth Though I had learnt betimes to stand unpropped two hundred thirty And independent musings pleased me so That spells seemed on me when I was alone Yet could I only cleave to solitude In lonely places if a throng was near That way I leaned by nature for my heart two hundred thirty five Was social and loved idleness and joy Not seeking those who might participate My deeper pleasures nay I had not once Though not unused to mutter lonesome songs Even with myself divided such delight two hundred forty Or looked that way for aught that might be clothed In human language easily I passed From the remembrances of better things And slipped into the ordinary works Of careless youth unburthened unalarmed two hundred forty five Caverns there were within my mind which sun Could never penetrate yet did there not Want store of leafy arbours where the light Might enter in at will Companionships Friendships acquaintances were welcome all two hundred fifty We sauntered played or rioted we talked Unprofitable talk at morning hours Drifted about along the streets and walks Read lazily in trivial books went forth To gallop through the country in blind zeal two hundred fifty five Of senseless horsemanship or on the breast Of Cam sailed boisterously and let the stars Come forth perhaps without one quiet thought Such was the tenor of the second act In this new life Imagination slept two hundred sixty And yet not utterly I could not print Ground where the grass had yielded to the steps Of generations of illustrious men Unmoved I could not always lightly pass Through the same gateways sleep where they had slept two hundred sixty five Wake where they waked range that inclosure old That garden of great intellects undisturbed Place also by the side of this dark sense Of noble feeling that those spiritual men Even the great Newton s own ethereal self two hundred seventy Seemed humbled in these precincts thence to be The more endeared Their several memories here Even like their persons in their portraits clothed With the accustomed garb of daily life Put on a lowly and a touching grace two hundred seventy five Of more distinct humanity that left All genuine admiration unimpaired Beside the pleasant Mill of Trompington D I laughed with Chaucer in the hawthorn shade Heard him while birds were warbling tell his tales two hundred eighty Of amorous passion And that gentle Bard Chosen by the Muses for their Page of State Sweet Spenser moving through his clouded heaven With the moon s beauty and the moon s soft pace I called him Brother Englishman and Friend two hundred eighty five Yea our blind Poet who in his later day Stood almost single uttering odious truth Darkness before and danger s voice behind Soul awful if the earth has ever lodged An awful soul I seemed to see him here two hundred ninety Familiarly and in his scholar s dress Bounding before me yet a stripling youth A boy no better with his rosy cheeks Angelical keen eye courageous look And conscious step of purity and pride two hundred ninety five Among the band of my compeers was one Whom chance had stationed in the very room Honoured by Milton s name O temperate Bard Be it confest that for the first time seated Within thy innocent lodge and oratory three hundred One of a festive circle I poured out Libations to thy memory drank till pride And gratitude grew dizzy in a brain Never excited by the fumes of wine Before that hour or since Then forth I ran three hundred five From the assembly through a length of streets Ran ostrich like to reach our chapel door In not a desperate or opprobrious time Albeit long after the importunate bell Had stopped with wearisome Cassandra voice three hundred ten No longer haunting the dark winter night Call back O Friend E a moment to thy mind The place itself and fashion of the rites With careless ostentation shouldering up My surplice F through the inferior throng I clove three hundred fifteen Of the plain Burghers who in audience stood On the last skirts of their permitted ground Under the pealing organ Empty thoughts I am ashamed of them and that great Bard And thou O Friend who in thy ample mind three hundred twenty Hast placed me high above my best deserts Ye will forgive the weakness of that hour In some of its unworthy vanities Brother to many more In this mixed sort The months passed on remissly not given up three hundred twenty five To wilful alienation from the right Or walks of open scandal but in vague And loose indifference easy likings aims Of a low pitch duty and zeal dismissed Yet Nature or a happy course of things three hundred thirty Not doing in their stead the needful work The memory languidly revolved the heart Reposed in noontide rest the inner pulse Of contemplation almost failed to beat Such life might not inaptly be compared three hundred thirty five To a floating island an amphibious spot Unsound of spongy texture yet withal Not wanting a fair face of water weeds And pleasant flowers G The thirst of living praise Fit reverence for the glorious Dead the sight three hundred forty Of those long vistas sacred catacombs Where mighty minds lie visibly entombed Have often stirred the heart of youth and bred A fervent love of rigorous discipline Alas such high emotion touched not me three hundred forty five Look was there none within these walls to shame My easy spirits and discountenance Their light composure far less to instil A calm resolve of mind firmly addressed To puissant efforts Nor was this the blame three hundred fifty Of others but my own I should in truth As far as doth concern my single self Misdeem most widely lodging it elsewhere For I bred up mid Nature s luxuries Was a spoiled child and rambling like the wind three hundred fifty five As I had done in daily intercourse With those crystalline rivers solemn heights And mountains ranging like a fowl of the air I was ill tutored for captivity To quit my pleasure and from month to month three hundred sixty Take up a station calmly on the perch Of sedentary peace Those lovely forms Had also left less space within my mind Which wrought upon instinctively had found A freshness in those objects of her love three hundred sixty five A winning power beyond all other power Not that I slighted books H that were to lack All sense but other passions in me ruled Passions more fervent making me less prompt To in door study than was wise or well three hundred seventy Or suited to those years Yet I though used In magisterial liberty to rove Culling such flowers of learning as might tempt A random choice could shadow forth a place If now I yield not to a flattering dream three hundred seventy five Whose studious aspect should have bent me down To instantaneous service should at once Have made me pay to science and to arts And written lore acknowledged my liege lord A homage frankly offered up like that three hundred eighty Which I had paid to Nature Toil and pains In this recess by thoughtful Fancy built Should spread from heart to heart and stately groves Majestic edifices should not want A corresponding dignity within three hundred eighty five The congregating temper that pervades Our unripe years not wasted should be taught To minister to works of high attempt Works which the enthusiast would perform with love Youth should be awed religiously possessed three hundred ninety With a conviction of the power that waits On knowledge when sincerely sought and prized For its own sake on glory and on praise If but by labour won and fit to endure The passing day should learn to put aside three hundred ninety five Her trappings here should strip them off abashed Before antiquity and stedfast truth And strong book mindedness and over all A healthy sound simplicity should reign A seemly plainness name it what you will four hundred Republican or pious If these thoughts Are a gratuitous emblazonry That mocks the recreant age we live in then Be Folly and False seeming free to affect Whatever formal gait of discipline four hundred five Shall raise them highest in their own esteem Let them parade among the Schools at will But spare the House of God Was ever known The witless shepherd who persists to drive A flock that thirsts not to a pool disliked four hundred ten A weight must surely hang on days begun And ended with such mockery Be wise Ye Presidents and Deans and till the spirit Of ancient times revive and youth be trained At home in pious service to your bells four hundred fifteen Give seasonable rest for tis a sound Hollow as ever vexed the tranquil air And your officious doings bring disgrace On the plain steeples of our English Church Whose worship mid remotest village trees four hundred twenty Suffers for this Even Science too at hand In daily sight of this irreverence Is smitten thence with an unnatural taint Loses her just authority falls beneath Collateral suspicion else unknown four hundred twenty five This truth escaped me not and I confess That having mid my native hills given loose To a schoolboy s vision I had raised a pile Upon the basis of the coming time That fell in ruins round me Oh what joy four hundred thirty To see a sanctuary for our country s youth Informed with such a spirit as might be Its own protection a primeval grove Where though the shades with cheerfulness were filled Nor indigent of songs warbled from crowds four hundred thirty five In under coverts yet the countenance Of the whole place should bear a stamp of awe A habitation sober and demure For ruminating creatures a domain For quiet things to wander in a haunt four hundred forty In which the heron should delight to feed By the shy rivers and the pelican Upon the cypress spire in lonely thought Might sit and sun himself Alas Alas In vain for such solemnity I looked four hundred forty five Mine eyes were crossed by butterflies ears vexed By chattering popinjays the inner heart Seemed trivial and the impresses without Of a too gaudy region Different sight Those venerable Doctors saw of old four hundred fifty When all who dwelt within these famous walls Led in abstemiousness a studious life When in forlorn and naked chambers cooped And crowded o er the ponderous books they hung Like caterpillars eating out their way four hundred fifty five In silence or with keen devouring noise Not to be tracked or fathered Princes then At matins froze and couched at curfew time Trained up through piety and zeal to prize Spare diet patient labour and plain weeds four hundred sixty O seat of Arts renowned throughout the world Far different service in those homely days The Muses modest nurslings underwent From their first childhood in that glorious time When Learning like a stranger come from far four hundred sixty five Sounding through Christian lands her trumpet roused Peasant and king when boys and youths the growth Of ragged villages and crazy huts Forsook their homes and errant in the quest Of Patron famous school or friendly nook four hundred seventy Where pensioned they in shelter might sit down From town to town and through wide scattered realms Journeyed with ponderous folios in their hands And often starting from some covert place Saluted the chance comer on the road four hundred seventy five Crying An obolus a penny give To a poor scholar I when illustrious men Lovers of truth by penury constrained Bucer Erasmus or Melancthon read Before the doors or windows of their cells four hundred eighty By moonshine through mere lack of taper light But peace to vain regrets We see but darkly Even when we look behind us and best things Are not so pure by nature that they needs Must keep to all as fondly all believe four hundred eighty five Their highest promise If the mariner When at reluctant distance he hath passed Some tempting island could but know the ills That must have fallen upon him had he brought His bark to land upon the wished for shore four hundred ninety Good cause would oft be his to thank the surf Whose white belt scared him thence or wind that blew Inexorably adverse for myself I grieve not happy is the gowned youth Who only misses what I missed who falls four hundred ninety five No lower than I fell I did not love Judging not ill perhaps the timid course Of our scholastic studies could have wished To see the river flow with ampler range And freer pace but more far more I grieved five hundred To see displayed among an eager few Who in the field of contest persevered Passions unworthy of youth s generous heart And mounting spirit pitiably repaid When so disturbed whatever palms are won five hundred five From these I turned to travel with the shoal Of more unthinking natures easy minds And pillowy yet not wanting love that makes The day pass lightly on when foresight sleeps And wisdom and the pledges interchanged five hundred ten With our own inner being are forgot Yet was this deep vacation not given up To utter waste Hitherto I had stood In my own mind remote from social life At least from what we commonly so name five hundred fifteen Like a lone shepherd on a promontory Who lacking occupation looks far forth Into the boundless sea and rather makes Than finds what he beholds And sure it is That this first transit from the smooth delights five hundred twenty And wild outlandish walks of simple youth To something that resembles an approach Towards human business to a privileged world Within a world a midway residence With all its intervenient imagery five hundred twenty five Did better suit my visionary mind Far better than to have been bolted forth Thrust out abruptly into Fortune s way Among the conflicts of substantial life By a more just gradation did lead on five hundred thirty To higher things more naturally matured For permanent possession better fruits Whether of truth or virtue to ensue In serious mood but oftener I confess With playful zest of fancy did we note five hundred thirty five How could we less the manners and the ways Of those who lived distinguished by the badge Of good or ill report or those with whom By frame of Academic discipline We were perforce connected men whose sway five hundred forty And known authority of office served To set our minds on edge and did no more Nor wanted we rich pastime of this kind Found everywhere but chiefly in the ring Of the grave Elders men unsecured grotesque five hundred forty five In character tricked out like aged trees Which through the lapse of their infirmity Give ready place to any random seed That chooses to be reared upon their trunks Here on my view confronting vividly five hundred fifty Those shepherd swains whom I had lately left Appeared a different aspect of old age How different yet both distinctly marked Objects embossed to catch the general eye Or portraitures for special use designed five hundred fifty five As some might seem so aptly do they serve To illustrate Nature s book of rudiments That book upheld as with maternal care When she would enter on her tender scheme Of teaching comprehension with delight five hundred sixty And mingling playful with pathetic thoughts The surfaces of artificial life And manners finely wrought the delicate race Of colours lurking gleaming up and down Through that state arras woven with silk and gold five hundred sixty five This wily interchange of snaky hues Willingly or unwillingly revealed I neither knew nor cared for and as such Were wanting here I took what might be found Of less elaborate fabric At this day five hundred seventy I smile in many a mountain solitude Conjuring up scenes as obsolete in freaks Of character in points of wit as broad As aught by wooden images performed For entertainment of the gaping crowd five hundred seventy five At wake or fair And oftentimes do flit Remembrances before me of old men Old humourists who have been long in their graves And having almost in my mind put off Their human names have into phantoms passed five hundred eighty Of texture midway between life and books I play the loiterer tis enough to note That here in dwarf proportions were expressed The limbs of the great world its eager strifes Collaterally pourtrayed as in mock fight five hundred eighty five A tournament of blows some hardly dealt Though short of mortal combat and whate er Might in this pageant be supposed to hit An artless rustic s notice this way less More that way was not wasted upon me five hundred ninety And yet the spectacle may well demand A more substantial name no mimic show Itself a living part of a live whole A creek in the vast sea for all degrees And shapes of spurious fame and short lived praise five hundred ninety five Here sate in state and fed with daily alms Retainers won away from solid good And here was Labour his own bond slave Hope That never set the pains against the prize Idleness halting with his weary clog six hundred And poor misguided Shame and witless Fear And simple Pleasure foraging for Death Honour misplaced and Dignity astray Feuds factions flatteries enmity and guile Murmuring submission and bald government six hundred five The idol weak as the idolater And Decency and Custom starving Truth And blind Authority beating with his staff The child that might have led him Emptiness Followed as of good omen and meek Worth six hundred ten Left to herself unheard of and unknown Of these and other kindred notices I cannot say what portion is in truth The naked recollection of that time And what may rather have been called to life six hundred fifteen By after meditation But delight That in an easy temper lulled asleep Is still with Innocence its own reward This was not wanting Carelessly I roamed As through a wide museum from whose stores six hundred twenty A casual rarity is singled out And has its brief perusal then gives way To others all supplanted in their turn Till mid this crowded neighbourhood of things That are by nature most unneighbourly six hundred twenty five The head turns round and cannot right itself And though an aching and a barren sense Of gay confusion still be uppermost With few wise longings and but little love Yet to the memory something cleaves at last six hundred thirty Whence profit may be drawn in times to come Thus in submissive idleness my Friend The labouring time of autumn winter spring Eight months rolled pleasingly away the ninth Came and returned me to my native hills six hundred thirty five FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT Footnote A Wordsworth went from York to Cambridge entering it by the coach road from the north west This was doubtless the road which now leads to the city from Girton The long roofed chapel of King s College must have been seen from that road Ed Footnote B The Hoop Inn still exists not now so famous as in the end of last century Ed Footnote C He entered saint John s College in October seventeen eighty seven His rooms in the College were unknown to the officials a dozen years ago although they are pretty clearly indicated by Wordsworth in this passage They were in the first of the three courts of saint John s they were above the College kitchens and from the window of his bedroom he could look into the antechapel of Trinity with its statue of Newton They have been recently removed in connection with sundry improvements in the college kitchen For details see the Life of Wordsworth which will follow

undergraduates Ed Footnote G Compare the poem Floating Island by Dorothy Wordsworth Ed Footnote H The following extract from a letter of Dorothy Wordsworth s illustrates the above and other passages of this book It was written from Forncett on the twenty sixth of June seventeen ninety one She is speaking of her two brothers William and Christopher Of Christopher she says His abilities though not so great perhaps as his brother s may be of more use to him as he has not fixed his mind upon any particular species of reading or conceived an aversion to any He is not fond of mathematics but has resolution sufficient to study them because it will be impossible for him to obtain a fellowship without them William lost the chance indeed the certainty of a fellowship by not combating his inclinations He gave way to his natural dislike to studies so dry as many parts of the mathematics consequently could not succeed in Cambridge He reads Italian Spanish French Greek Latin and English but never opens a mathematical book Do not think from what I have said that he reads not at all for he does read a great deal and not only poetry in these languages he is acquainted with but History also et cetera et cetera Ed Footnote I Date obolum Belisario Belisarius a general of the Emperor Justinian s died five hundred sixty four A D The story of his begging charity is probably a legend but the begging scholar was common in Christendom throughout the Middle Ages and was met with in the last century Ed BOOK FOURTH SUMMER VACATION Bright was the summer s noon when quickening steps Followed each other till a dreary moor Was crossed a bare ridge clomb upon whose top A Standing alone as from a rampart s edge I overlooked the bed of Windermere five Like a vast river stretching in the sun With exultation at my feet I saw Lake islands promontories gleaming bays A universe of Nature s fairest forms Proudly revealed with instantaneous burst ten Magnificent and beautiful and gay I bounded down the hill shouting amain For the old Ferryman to the shout the rocks Replied and when the Charon of the flood Had staid his oars and touched the jutting pier B fifteen I did not step into the well known boat Without a cordial greeting Thence with speed Up the familiar hill I took my way C Towards that sweet Valley D where I had been reared Twas but a short hour s walk ere veering round twenty I saw the snow white church upon her hill E Sit like a throned Lady sending out A gracious look all over her domain F Yon azure smoke betrays the lurking town With eager footsteps I advance and reach twenty five The cottage threshold where my journey closed Glad welcome had I with some tears perhaps From my old Dame so kind and motherly G While she perused me with a parent s pride The thoughts of gratitude shall fall like dew thirty Upon thy grave good creature While my heart Can beat never will I forget thy name Heaven s blessing be upon thee where thou liest After thy innocent and busy stir In narrow cares thy little daily growth thirty five Of calm enjoyments after eighty years And more than eighty of untroubled life H Childless yet by the strangers to thy blood Honoured with little less than filial love What joy was mine to see thee once again forty Thee and thy dwelling and a crowd of things About its narrow precincts all beloved I And many of them seeming yet my own Why should I speak of what a thousand hearts Have felt and every man alive can guess forty five The rooms the court the garden were not left Long unsaluted nor the sunny seat Round the stone table under the dark pine K Friendly to studious or to festive hours Nor that unruly child of mountain birth fifty The famous brook who soon as he was boxed Within our garden L found himself at once As if by trick insidious and unkind Stripped of his voice M and left to dimple down Without an effort and without a will fifty five A channel paved by man s officious care N I looked at him and smiled and smiled again And in the press of twenty thousand thoughts O Ha quoth I pretty prisoner are you there Well might sarcastic Fancy then have whispered sixty An emblem here behold of thy own life In its late course of even days with all Their smooth enthralment but the heart was full Too full for that reproach My aged Dame Walked proudly at my side she guided me sixty five I willing nay nay wishing to be led The face of every neighbour whom I met Was like a volume to me some were hailed Upon the road some busy at their work Unceremonious greetings interchanged seventy With half the length of a long field between Among my schoolfellows I scattered round Like recognitions but with some constraint Attended doubtless with a little pride But with more shame for my habiliments seventy five The transformation wrought by gay attire Not less delighted did I take my place At our domestic table and P dear Friend In this endeavour simply to relate A Poet s history may I leave untold eighty The thankfulness with which I laid me down In my accustomed bed more welcome now Perhaps than if it had been more desired Or been more often thought of with regret That lowly bed whence I had heard the wind eighty five Roar and the rain beat hard where I so oft Had lain awake on summer nights to watch The moon in splendour couched among the leaves Of a tall ash that near our cottage stood Q Had watched her with fixed eyes while to and fro ninety In the dark summit of the waving tree She rocked with every impulse of the breeze Among the favourites whom it pleased me well To see again was one by ancient right Our inmate a rough terrier of the hills ninety five By birth and call of nature pre ordained To hunt the badger and unearth the fox Among the impervious crags but having been From youth our own adopted he had passed Into a gentler service And when first one hundred The boyish spirit flagged and day by day Along my veins I kindled with the stir The fermentation and the vernal heat Of poesy affecting private shades Like a sick Lover then this dog was used one hundred five To watch me an attendant and a friend Obsequious to my steps early and late Though often of such dilatory walk Tired and uneasy at the halts I made A hundred times when roving high and low one hundred ten I have been harassed with the toil of verse Much pains and little progress and at once Some lovely Image in the song rose up Full formed like Venus rising from the sea Then have I darted forwards to let one hundred fifteen My hand upon his back with stormy joy Caressing him again and yet again And when at evening on the public way I sauntered like a river murmuring And talking to itself when all things one hundred twenty Are still the creature trotted on before Such was his custom but whene er he met A passenger approaching he would turn To give me timely notice and straightway Grateful for that admonishment I one hundred twenty five My voice composed my gait and with the air And mien of one whose thoughts are free advanced To give and take a greeting that might save My name from piteous rumours such as wait On men suspected to be crazed in brain one hundred thirty Those walks well worthy to be prized and loved Regretted that word too was on my tongue But they were richly laden with all good And cannot be remembered but with thanks And gratitude and perfect joy of heart one hundred thirty five Those walks in all their freshness now came back Like a returning Spring When first I made Once more the circuit of our little lake If ever happiness hath lodged with man That day consummate happiness was mine one hundred forty Wide spreading steady calm contemplative The sun was set or setting when I left Our cottage door and evening soon brought on A sober hour not winning or serene For cold and raw the air was and untuned one hundred forty five But as a face we love is sweetest then When sorrow damps it or whatever look It chance to wear is sweetest if the heart Have fulness in herself even so with me It fared that evening Gently did my soul one hundred fifty Put off her veil and self transmuted stood Naked as in the presence of her God While on I walked a comfort seemed to touch A heart that had not been disconsolate Strength came where weakness was not known to be one hundred fifty five At least not felt and restoration came Like an intruder knocking at the door Of unacknowledged weariness I took The balance and with firm hand weighed myself Of that external scene which round me lay one hundred sixty Little in this abstraction did I see Remembered less but I had inward hopes And swellings of the spirit was rapt and soothed Conversed with promises had glimmering views How life pervades the undecaying mind one hundred sixty five How the immortal soul with God like power Informs creates and thaws the deepest sleep That time can lay upon her how on earth Man if he do but live within the light Of high endeavours daily spreads abroad one hundred seventy His being armed with strength that cannot fail Nor was there want of milder thoughts of love Of innocence and holiday repose And more than pastoral quiet mid the stir Of boldest projects and a peaceful end one hundred seventy five At last or glorious by endurance won Thus musing in a wood I sate me down Alone continuing there to muse the slopes And heights meanwhile were slowly overspread With darkness and before a rippling breeze one hundred eighty The long lake lengthened out its hoary line And in the sheltered coppice where I sate Around me from among the hazel leaves Now here now there moved by the straggling wind Came ever and anon a breath like sound one hundred eighty five Quick as the pantings of the faithful dog The off and on companion of my walk And such at times believing them to be I turned my head to look if he were there Then into solemn thought I passed once more one hundred ninety A freshness also found I at this time In human Life the daily life of those Whose occupations really I loved The peaceful scene oft filled me with surprise Changed like a garden in the heat of spring one hundred ninety five After an eight days absence For to omit The things which were the same and yet appeared Fair otherwise amid this rural solitude A narrow Vale where each was known to all Twas not indifferent to a youthful mind two hundred To mark some sheltering bower or sunny nook Where an old man had used to sit alone Now vacant pale faced babes whom I had left In arms now rosy prattlers at the feet Of a pleased grandame tottering up and down two hundred five And growing girls whose beauty filched away With all its pleasant promises was gone To deck some slighted playmate s homely cheek Yes I had something of a subtler sense And often looking round was moved to smiles two hundred ten Such as a delicate work of humour breeds I read without design the opinions thoughts Of those plain living people now observed With clearer knowledge with another eye I saw the quiet woodman in the woods two hundred fifteen The shepherd roam the hills With new delight This chiefly did I note my grey haired Dame Saw her go forth to church or other work Of state equipped in monumental trim Short velvet cloak her bonnet of the like two hundred twenty A mantle such as Spanish Cavaliers Wore in old time Her smooth domestic life Affectionate without disquietude Her talk her business pleased me and no less Her clear though shallow stream of piety two hundred twenty five That ran on Sabbath days a fresher course With thoughts unfelt till now I saw her read Her Bible on hot Sunday afternoons And loved the book when she had dropped asleep And made of it a pillow for her head two hundred thirty Nor less do I remember to have felt Distinctly manifested at this time A human heartedness about my love For objects hitherto the absolute wealth Of my own private being and no more two hundred thirty five Which I had loved even as a blessed spirit Or Angel if he were to dwell on earth Might love in individual happiness But now there opened on me other thoughts Of change congratulation or regret two hundred forty A pensive feeling It spread far and wide The trees the mountains shared it and the brooks The stars of Heaven now seen in their old haunts White Sirius glittering o er the southern crags Orion with his belt and those fair Seven two hundred forty five Acquaintances of every little child And Jupiter my own beloved star Whatever shadings of mortality Whatever imports from the world of death Had come among these objects heretofore two hundred fifty Were in the main of mood less tender strong Deep gloomy were they and severe the scatterings Of awe or tremulous dread that had given way In later youth to yearnings of a love Enthusiastic to delight and hope two hundred fifty five As one who hangs down bending from the side Of a slow moving boat upon the breast Of a still water solacing himself With such discoveries as his eye can make Beneath him in the bottom of the deep two hundred sixty Sees many beauteous sights weeds fishes flowers Grots pebbles roots of trees and fancies more Yet often is perplexed and cannot part The shadow from the substance rocks and sky Mountains and clouds reflected in the depth two hundred sixty five Of the clear flood from things which there abide In their true dwelling now is crossed by gleam Of his own image by a sun beam now And wavering motions sent he knows not whence Impediments that make his task more sweet two hundred seventy Such pleasant office have we long pursued Incumbent o er the surface of past time With like success nor often have appeared Shapes fairer or less doubtfully discerned Than these to which the Tale indulgent Friend two hundred seventy five Would now direct thy notice Yet in spite Of pleasure won and knowledge not withheld There was an inner falling off I loved Loved deeply all that had been loved before More deeply even than ever but a swarm two hundred eighty Of heady schemes jostling each other gawds And feast and dance and public revelry And sports and games too grateful in themselves Yet in themselves less grateful I believe Than as they were a badge glossy and fresh two hundred eighty five Of manliness and freedom all conspired To lure my mind from firm habitual quest Of feeding pleasures to depress the zeal And damp those yearnings which had once been mine A wild unworldly minded youth given up two hundred ninety To his own eager thoughts It would demand Some skill and longer time than may be spared To paint these vanities and how they wrought In haunts where they till now had been unknown It seemed the very garments that I wore two hundred ninety five Preyed on my strength and stopped the quiet stream Of self forgetfulness Yes that heartless chase Of trivial pleasures was a poor exchange For books and nature at that early age Tis true some casual knowledge might be gained three hundred Of character or life but at that time Of manners put to school I took small note And all my deeper passions lay elsewhere Far better had it been to exalt the mind By solitary study to uphold three hundred five Intense desire through meditative peace And yet for chastisement of these regrets The memory of one particular hour Doth here rise up against me Mid a throng Of maids and youths old men and matrons staid three hundred ten A medley of all tempers I had passed The night in dancing gaiety and mirth With din of instruments and shuffling feet And glancing forms and tapers glittering And unaimed prattle flying up and down R three hundred fifteen Spirits upon the stretch and here and there Slight shocks of young love liking interspersed Whose transient pleasure mounted to the head And tingled through the veins Ere we retired The cock had crowed and now the eastern sky three hundred twenty Was kindling not unseen from humble copse And open field through which the pathway wound And homeward led my steps Magnificent The morning rose in memorable pomp Glorious as e er I had beheld in front three hundred twenty five The sea lay laughing at a distance near The solid mountains shone bright as the clouds Grain tinctured drenched in empyrean light And in the meadows and the lower grounds Was all the sweetness of a common dawn three hundred thirty Dews vapours and the melody of birds S And labourers going forth to till the fields Ah need I say dear Friend that to the brim My heart was full I made no vows but vows Were then made for me bond unknown to me three hundred thirty five Was given that I should be else sinning greatly A dedicated Spirit On I walked In thankful blessedness which yet survives T Strange rendezvous My mind was at that time A parti coloured show of grave and gay three hundred forty Solid and light short sighted and profound Of inconsiderate habits and sedate Consorting in one mansion unreproved The worth I knew of powers that I possessed Though slighted and too oft misused Besides three hundred forty five That summer swarming as it did with thoughts Transient and idle lacked not intervals When Folly from the frown of fleeting Time Shrunk and the mind experienced in herself Conformity as just as that of old three hundred fifty To the end and written spirit of God s works Whether held forth in Nature or in Man Through pregnant vision separate or conjoined When from our better selves we have too long Been parted by the hurrying world and droop three hundred fifty five Sick of its business of its pleasures tired How gracious how benign is Solitude How potent a mere image of her sway Most potent when impressed upon the mind With an appropriate human centre hermit three hundred sixty Deep in the bosom of the wilderness Votary in vast cathedral where no foot Is treading where no other face is seen Kneeling at prayers or watchman on the top Of lighthouse beaten by Atlantic waves three hundred sixty five Or as the soul of that great Power is met Sometimes embodied on a public road When for the night deserted it assumes A character of quiet more profound Than pathless wastes Once when those summer months three hundred seventy Were flown and autumn brought its annual show Of oars with oars contending sails with sails Upon Winander s spacious breast it chanced That after I had left a flower decked room Whose in door pastime lighted up survived three hundred seventy five To a late hour and spirits overwrought Were making night do penance for a day Spent in a round of strenuous idleness U My homeward course led up a long ascent Where the road s watery surface to the top three hundred eighty Of that sharp rising glittered to the moon And bore the semblance of another stream Stealing with silent lapse to join the brook That murmured in the vale V All else was still No living thing appeared in earth or air three hundred eighty five And save the flowing water s peaceful voice Sound there was none but lo an uncouth shape Shown by a sudden turning of the road So near that slipping back into the shade Of a thick hawthorn I could mark him well three hundred ninety Myself unseen He was of stature tall A span above man s common measure tall Stiff lank and upright a more meagre man Was never seen before by night or day Long were his arms pallid his hands his mouth three hundred ninety five Looked ghastly in the moonlight from behind A mile stone propped him I could also ken That he was clothed in military garb Though faded yet entire Companionless No dog attending by no staff sustained four hundred He stood and in his very dress appeared A desolation a simplicity To which the trappings of a gaudy world Make a strange back ground From his lips ere long Issued low muttered sounds as if of pain four hundred five Or some uneasy thought yet still his form Kept the same awful steadiness at his feet His shadow lay and moved not From self blame Not wholly free I watched him thus at length Subduing my heart s specious cowardice four hundred ten I left the shady nook where I had stood And hailed him Slowly from his resting place He rose and with a lean and wasted arm In measured gesture lifted to his head Returned my salutation then resumed four hundred fifteen His station as before and when I asked His history the veteran in reply Was neither slow nor eager but unmoved And with a quiet uncomplaining voice A stately air of mild indifference four hundred twenty He told in few plain words a soldier s tale That in the Tropic Islands he had served Whence he had landed scarcely three weeks past That on his landing he had been dismissed And now was travelling towards his native home four hundred twenty five This heard I said in pity Come with me He stooped and straightway from the ground took up An oaken staff by me yet unobserved A staff which must have dropt from his slack hand And lay till now neglected in the grass four hundred thirty Though weak his step and cautious he appeared To travel without pain and I beheld With an astonishment but ill suppressed His ghostly figure moving at my side Nor could I while we journeyed thus forbear four hundred thirty five To turn from present hardships to the past And speak of war battle and pestilence Sprinkling this talk with questions better spared On what he might himself have seen or felt He all the while was in demeanour calm four hundred forty Concise in answer solemn and sublime He might have seemed but that in all he said There was a strange half absence as of one Knowing too well the importance of his theme But feeling it no longer Our discourse four hundred forty five Soon ended and together on we passed In silence through a wood gloomy and still Up turning then along an open field We reached a cottage At the door I knocked And earnestly to charitable care four hundred fifty Commended him as a poor friendless man Belated and by sickness overcome Assured that now the traveller would repose In comfort I entreated that henceforth He would not linger in the public ways four hundred fifty five But ask for timely furtherance and help Such as his state required At this reproof With the same ghastly mildness in his look He said My trust is in the God of Heaven And in the eye of him who passes me four hundred sixty The cottage door was speedily unbarred And now the soldier touched his hat once more With his lean hand and in a faltering voice Whose tone bespake reviving interests Till then unfelt he thanked me I returned four hundred sixty five The farewell blessing of the patient man And so we parted Back I cast a look And lingered near the door a little space Then sought with quiet heart my distant home FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT Footnote A On the road from Kendal to Windermere Ed Footnote B At the Ferry below Bowness Ed Footnote C From the Ferry over the ridge to Sawrey Ed Footnote D The Vale of Esthwaite Ed Footnote E Hawkshead Church an old Norman structure built in eleven sixty the year of the foundation of Furness Abbey It is no longer snow white a so called Restoration having taken place within recent years on architectural principles The plaster is stripped from the outside of the church which is now of a dull stone colour Apart from poetic sentiment wrote doctor Cradock the late Principal of Brasenose College Oxford it may be doubted whether the pale colour still preserved at Grasmere and other churches in the district does not better harmonize with the scenery and atmosphere of the Lake country The most interesting feature in the interior is the private chapel of Archbishop Sandys Ed Footnote F Hawkshead Church is a conspicuous object as you approach the town whether by the Ambleside road or from Sawrey It is the latter approach that is here described Ed Footnote G Anne Tyson Ed Footnote H Anne Tyson seems to have removed from Hawkshead village to Colthouse on the opposite side of the Vale and lived there for some time before her death Along with doctor Cradock I examined the Parish Registers of Hawkshead in the autumn of eighteen eighty two and we found the following entry belonging to the year seventeen ninety six Anne Tyson of Colthouse widow died May twenty fifth buried twenty eighth in Churchyard aged eighty three Her removal to Colthouse is confirmed in a curious way by a reminiscence of William Wordsworth s the poet s son who told me that if asked where the dame s house was he would have pointed to a spot on the eastern side of the valley and out of the village altogether his father having taken him from Rydal Mount to Hawkshead when a mere boy and pointed out that spot Doubtless Wordsworth took his son to the cottage at Colthouse where Anne Tyson died as the earlier abode in Hawkshead village is well known and its site is indisputable Ed Footnote I Compare book i ll four hundred ninety nine five hundred six p one hundred forty eight Ed Footnote K There is no trace and no tradition at Hawkshead of the stone table under the dark pine For a curious parallel to this sunny seat Round the stone table under the dark pine I am indebted to doctor Cradock He points out that in the prologue to Peter Bell vol ii p nine we have the lines To the stone table in my garden Loved haunt of many a summer hour Ed Footnote L There can be little doubt as to the identity of the famous brook within our garden boxed which gives the name of Flag Street to one of the alleys of Hawkshead Persons have visited the cottage wrote doctor Cradock without discovering it and yet it is not forty yards distant and is still exactly as described On the opposite side of the lane leading to the cottage and a few steps above it is a narrow passage through some new stone buildings On emerging from this you meet a small garden the farther side of which is bounded by the brook confined on both sides by larger flags and also covered by flags of the same Coniston formation through the interstices of which you may see and hear the stream running freely The upper flags are now used as a footpath and lead by another passage back into the village No doubt the garden has been reduced in size by the use of that part of it fronting the lane for building purposes The stream before it enters the area of buildings and gardens is open by the lane side and seemingly comes from the hills to the westwards The large flags are extremely hard and durable and it is probably that the very flags which paved the channel in Wordsworth s time may still be doing the same duty The house adjoining this garden was not Dame Tyson s but a mister Watson s Possibly however some of the boys had free access to the latter so that Wordsworth could speak of it as our garden or Dame Tyson may have rented it See Note II in the Appendix to this volume p three hundred eighty six Ed Footnote M Not wholly so Ed Footnote N See note on preceding page Ed Footnote O Compare the sonnet in vol iv Beloved Vale I said when I shall con By doubts and thousand petty fancies crost There can be little doubt that it is to the famous brook of The Prelude that reference is made in the later sonnet and still more significantly in the earlier poem The Fountain vol ii p ninety one Compare the MS variants of that poem printed as footnotes from Lord Coleridge s copy of the Poems Down to the vale with eager speed Behold this streamlet run From subterranean bondage freed And glittering in the sun with the lines in The Prelude The famous brook who soon as he was boxed Within our garden found himself at once Stripped of his voice and left to dimple down et cetera This is doubtless the streamlet called Town Beck and it is perhaps the most interesting of all the spots alluded to by Wordsworth which can be traced out in the Hawkshead district I am indebted to mister Rawnsley for the following note From the village nay from the poet s very door when he lived at Anne Tyson s a good path leads on past the vicarage quite to its upland place of birth It has eaten its way deeply into the soil in one place there is a series of still pools that overflow and fall into others with quiet sound at other spots it is bustling and busy Fine timber is found on either side of it the roots of the trees often laid bare by the passing current In one or two places by the side of this beck and beneath the shadow of lofty oaks may be found boulder stones grey and moss covered Birds make hiding places for themselves in these oak and hazel bushes by the stream Following it up we find it receives at a tiny ford the tribute of another stream from the north west and comes down between the adjacent hills well wooded to the summit from meadows of short cropped grass and to these from the open moorland where it takes its rise Every conceivable variety of beauty of sound and sight in streamlet life is found as we follow the course of this Town Beck We owe much of Wordsworth s intimate acquaintance with streamlet beauty to it Compare The Fountain in detail with this passage in The Prelude Ed Footnote P So it is in the editions of eighteen fifty and eighteen fifty seven but it should evidently be nor dear Friend Ed Footnote Q The ash tree is gone but there is no doubt as to the place where it grew mister Watson whose father owned and inhabited the house immediately opposite to missus Tyson s cottage in Wordsworth s time see a previous note told me that a tall ash tree grew on the proper right front of the cottage where an outhouse is now built If this be so Wordsworth s bedroom must have been that on the proper left with the smaller of the two windows The cottage faces nearly south west In the upper flat there are two bedrooms to the front with oak flooring one of which must have been Wordsworth s See Note II p three hundred eighty six in Appendix to this volume Ed Footnote R In one of the small mountain farm houses near Hawkshead Ed Footnote S Compare Paradise Lost book viii l five hundred twenty eight Walks and the melody of birds Ed Footnote T doctor Cradock has suggested to me the probable course of that morning walk All that can be safely said as to the course of that memorable morning walk is that in that neighbourhood a view of the sea can only be obtained at a considerable elevation also that if the words in front the sea lay laughing are to be taken as rigidly exact the poet s progress towards Hawkshead must have been in a direction mainly southerly and therefore from the country north of that place These and all other conditions of the description are answered in several parts of the range of hills lying between Elterwater and Hawkshead See Appendix Note III p three hundred eighty nine Ed Footnote U Compare the sixth line of the poem beginning This Lawn a carpet all alive eighteen twenty nine And Horace Epistolae lib i ep xi l twenty eight Strenua nos exercet inertia Ed Footnote V The brook is Sawrey beck and the long ascent is the second of the two in crossing from Windermere to Hawkshead and going over the ridge between the two Sawreys It is only at that point that a brook can be heard murmuring in the vale The road is the old one above the ferry marked in the Ordnance Survey Map by the Briers not the new road which makes a curve to the south and cannot be described as a sharp rising Ed BOOK FIFTH BOOKS When Contemplation like the night calm felt Through earth and sky spreads widely and sends deep Into the soul its tranquillising power Even then I sometimes grieve for thee O Man Earth s paramount Creature not so much for woes five That thou endurest heavy though that weight be Cloud like it mounts or touched with light divine Doth melt away but for those palms achieved Through length of time by patient exercise Of study and hard thought there there it is ten That sadness finds its fuel Hitherto In progress through this Verse my mind hath looked Upon the speaking face of earth and heaven As her prime teacher intercourse with man Established by the sovereign Intellect fifteen Who through that bodily image hath diffused As might appear to the eye of fleeting time A deathless spirit Thou also man hast wrought For commerce of thy nature with herself Things that aspire to unconquerable life twenty And yet we feel we cannot choose but feel That they must perish Tremblings of the heart It gives to think that our immortal being No more shall need such garments and yet man As long as he shall be the child of earth twenty five Might almost weep to have A what he may lose Nor be himself extinguished but survive Abject depressed forlorn disconsolate A thought is with me sometimes and I say Should the whole frame of earth by inward throes thirty Be wrenched or fire come down from far to scorch Her pleasant habitations and dry up Old Ocean in his bed left singed and bare Yet would the living Presence still subsist Victorious and composure would ensue thirty five And kindlings like the morning presage sure Of day returning and of life revived B But all the meditations of mankind Yea all the adamantine holds of truth By reason built or passion which itself forty Is highest reason in a soul sublime The consecrated works of Bard and Sage Sensuous or intellectual wrought by men Twin labourers and heirs of the same hopes Where would they be Oh why hath not the Mind forty five Some element to stamp her image on In nature somewhat nearer to her own C Why gifted with such powers to send abroad Her spirit must it lodge in shrines so frail One day when from my lips a like complaint fifty Had fallen in presence of a studious friend He with a smile made answer that in truth Twas going far to seek disquietude But on the front of his reproof confessed That he himself had oftentimes given way fifty five To kindred hauntings Whereupon I told That once in the stillness of a summer s noon While I was seated in a rocky cave By the sea side perusing so it chanced The famous history of the errant knight sixty Recorded by Cervantes these same thoughts Beset me and to height unusual rose While listlessly I sate and having closed The book had turned my eyes toward the wide sea On poetry and geometric truth sixty five And their high privilege of lasting life From all internal injury exempt I mused upon these chiefly and at length My senses yielding to the sultry air Sleep seized me and I passed into a dream seventy I saw before me stretched a boundless plain Of sandy wilderness all black and void And as I looked around distress and fear Came creeping over me when at my side Close at my side an uncouth shape appeared seventy five Upon a dromedary mounted high He seemed an Arab of the Bedouin tribes A lance he bore and underneath one arm A stone and in the opposite hand a shell Of a surpassing brightness At the sight eighty Much I rejoiced not doubting but a guide Was present one who with unerring skill Would through the desert lead me and while yet I looked and looked self questioned what this freight Which the new comer carried through the waste eighty five Could mean the Arab told me that the stone To give it in the language of the dream Was Euclid s Elements and This said he Is something of more worth and at the word Stretched forth the shell so beautiful in shape ninety In colour so resplendent with command That I should hold it to my ear I did so And heard that instant in an unknown tongue Which yet I understood articulate sounds A loud prophetic blast of harmony ninety five An Ode in passion uttered which foretold Destruction to the children of the earth By deluge now at hand No sooner ceased The song than the Arab with calm look declared That all would come to pass of which the voice one hundred Had given forewarning and that he himself Was going then to bury those two books The one that held acquaintance with the stars And wedded soul to soul in purest bond Of reason undisturbed by space or time one hundred five The other that was a god yea many gods Had voices more than all the winds with power To exhilarate the spirit and to soothe Through every clime the heart of human kind While this was uttering strange as it may seem one hundred ten I wondered not although I plainly saw The one to be a stone the other a shell Nor doubted once but that they both were books Having a perfect faith in all that passed Far stronger now grew the desire I felt one hundred fifteen To cleave unto this man but when I prayed To share his enterprise he hurried on Reckless of me I followed not unseen For oftentimes he cast a backward look Grasping his twofold treasure Lance in rest one hundred twenty He rode I keeping pace with him and now He to my fancy had become the knight Whose tale Cervantes tells yet not the knight But was an Arab of the desert too Of these was neither and was both at once one hundred twenty five His countenance meanwhile grew more disturbed And looking backwards when he looked mine eyes Saw over half the wilderness diffused A bed of glittering light I asked the cause It is said he the waters of the deep one hundred thirty Gathering upon us quickening then the pace Of the unwieldy creature he bestrode He left me I called after him aloud He heeded not but with his twofold charge Still in his grasp before me full in view one hundred thirty five Went hurrying o er the illimitable waste With the fleet waters of a drowning world In chase of him whereat I waked in terror And saw the sea before me and the book In which I had been reading at my side D one hundred forty Full often taking from the world of sleep This Arab phantom which I thus beheld This semi Quixote I to him have given A substance fancied him a living man A gentle dweller in the desert crazed one hundred forty five By love and feeling and internal thought Protracted among endless solitudes Have shaped him wandering upon this quest Nor have I pitied him but rather felt Reverence was due to a being thus employed one hundred fifty And thought that in the blind and awful lair Of such a madness reason did lie couched Enow there are on earth to take in charge Their wives their children and their virgin loves Or whatsoever else the heart holds dear one hundred fifty five Enow to stir for these yea will I say Contemplating in soberness the approach Of an event so dire by signs in earth Or heaven made manifest that I could share That maniac s fond anxiety and go one hundred sixty Upon like errand Oftentimes at least Me hath such strong enhancement overcome When I have held a volume in my hand Poor earthly casket of immortal verse Shakespeare or Milton labourers divine one hundred sixty five Great and benign indeed must be the power Of living nature which could thus so long Detain me from the best of other guides And dearest helpers left unthanked unpraised Even in the time of lisping infancy one hundred seventy And later down in prattling childhood even While I was travelling back among those days How could I ever play an ingrate s part Once more should I have made those bowers resound By intermingling strains of thankfulness one hundred seventy five With their own thoughtless melodies at least It might have well beseemed me to repeat Some simply fashioned tale to tell again In slender accents of sweet verse some tale That did bewitch me then and soothes me now one hundred eighty O Friend O Poet brother of my soul Think not that I could pass along untouched By these remembrances Yet wherefore speak Why call upon a few weak words to say What is already written in the hearts one hundred eighty five Of all that breathe what in the path of all Drops daily from the tongue of every child Wherever man is found The trickling tear Upon the cheek of listening Infancy Proclaims it and the insuperable look one hundred ninety That drinks as if it never could be full That portion of my story I shall leave There registered whatever else of power Or pleasure sown or fostered thus may be Peculiar to myself let that remain one hundred ninety five Where still it works though hidden from all search Among the depths of time Yet is it just That here in memory of all books which lay Their sure foundations in the heart of man Whether by native prose or numerous verse E two hundred That in the name of all inspired souls From Homer the great Thunderer from the voice That roars along the bed of Jewish song And that more varied and elaborate Those trumpet tones of harmony that shake two hundred five Our shores in England from those loftiest notes Down to the low and wren like warblings made For cottagers and spinners at the wheel And sun burnt travellers resting their tired limbs Stretched under wayside hedge rows ballad tunes two hundred ten Food for the hungry ears of little ones And of old men who have survived their joys Tis just that in behalf of these the works And of the men that framed them whether known Or sleeping nameless in their scattered graves two hundred fifteen That I should here assert their rights attest Their honours and should once for all pronounce Their benediction speak of them as Powers For ever to be hallowed only less For what we are and what we may become two hundred twenty Than Nature s self which is the breath of God Or His pure Word by miracle revealed Rarely and with reluctance would I stoop To transitory themes yet I rejoice And by these thoughts admonished will pour out two hundred twenty five Thanks with uplifted heart that I was reared Safe from an evil which these days have laid Upon the children of the land a pest That might have dried me up body and soul This verse is dedicate to Nature s self two hundred thirty And things that teach as Nature teaches then Oh where had been the Man the Poet where Where had we been we two beloved Friend If in the season of unperilous choice In lieu of wandering as we did through vales two hundred thirty five Rich with indigenous produce open ground Of Fancy happy pastures ranged at will We had been followed hourly watched and noosed Each in his several melancholy walk Stringed like a poor man s heifer at its feed two hundred forty Led through the lanes in forlorn servitude Or rather like a stalled ox debarred From touch of growing grass that may not taste A flower till it have yielded up its sweets A prelibation to the mower s scythe F two hundred forty five Behold the parent hen amid her brood Though fledged and feathered and well pleased to part And straggle from her presence still a brood And she herself from the maternal bond Still undischarged yet doth she little more two hundred fifty Than move with them in tenderness and love A centre to the circle which they make And now and then alike from need of theirs And call of her own natural appetites She scratches ransacks up the earth for food two hundred fifty five Which they partake at pleasure Early died My honoured Mother she who was the heart And hinge of all our learnings and our loves G She left us destitute and as we might Trooping together Little suits it me two hundred sixty To break upon the sabbath of her rest With any thought that looks at others blame Nor would I praise her but in perfect love Hence am I checked but let me boldly say In gratitude and for the sake of truth two hundred sixty five Unheard by her that she not falsely taught Fetching her goodness rather from times past Than shaping novelties for times to come Had no presumption no such jealousy Nor did by habit of her thoughts mistrust two hundred seventy Our nature but had virtual faith that He Who fills the mother s breast with innocent milk Doth also for our nobler part provide Under His great correction and control As innocent instincts and as innocent food two hundred seventy five Or draws for minds that are left free to trust In the simplicities of opening life Sweet honey out of spurned or dreaded weeds This was her creed and therefore she was pure From anxious fear of error or mishap two hundred eighty And evil overweeningly so called Was not puffed up by false unnatural hopes Nor selfish with unnecessary cares Nor with impatience from the season asked More than its timely produce rather loved two hundred eighty five The hours for what they are than from regard Glanced on their promises in restless pride Such was she not from faculties more strong Than others have but from the times perhaps And spot in which she lived and through a grace two hundred ninety Of modest meekness simple mindedness A heart that found benignity and hope Being itself benign My drift I fear Is scarcely obvious but that common sense May try this modern system by its fruits two hundred ninety five Leave let me take to place before her sight A specimen pourtrayed with faithful hand Full early trained to worship seemliness This model of a child is never known To mix in quarrels that were far beneath three hundred Its dignity with gifts he bubbles o er As generous as a fountain selfishness May not come near him nor the little throng Of flitting pleasures tempt him from his path The wandering beggars propagate his name three hundred five Dumb creatures find him tender as a nun And natural or supernatural fear Unless it leap upon him in a dream Touches him not To enhance the wonder see How arch his notices how nice his sense three hundred ten Of the ridiculous not blind is he To the broad follies of the licensed world Yet innocent himself withal though shrewd And can read lectures upon innocence A miracle of scientific lore three hundred fifteen Ships he can guide across the pathless sea And tell you all their cunning he can read The inside of the earth and spell the stars He knows the policies of foreign lands Can string you names of districts cities towns three hundred twenty The whole world over tight as beads of dew Upon a gossamer thread he sifts he weighs All things are put to question he must live Knowing that he grows wiser every day Or else not live at all and seeing too three hundred twenty five Each little drop of wisdom as it falls Into the dimpling cistern of his heart For this unnatural growth the trainer blame Pity the tree Poor human vanity Wert thou extinguished little would be left three hundred thirty Which he could truly love but how escape For ever as a thought of purer birth Rises to lead him toward a better clime Some intermeddler still is on the watch To drive him back and pound him like a stray three hundred thirty five Within the pinfold of his own conceit Meanwhile old grandame earth is grieved to find The playthings which her love designed for him Unthought of in their woodland beds the flowers Weep and the river sides are all forlorn three hundred forty Oh give us once again the wishing cap Of Fortunatus and the invisible coat Of Jack the Giant killer Robin Hood And Sabra in the forest with saint George The child whose love is here at least doth reap three hundred forty five One precious gain that he forgets himself These mighty workmen of our later age Who with a broad highway have overbridged The froward chaos of futurity Tamed to their bidding they who have the skill three hundred fifty To manage books and things and make them act On infant minds as surely as the sun Deals with a flower the keepers of our time The guides and wardens of our faculties Sages who in their prescience would control three hundred fifty five All accidents and to the very road Which they have fashioned would confine us down Like engines when will their presumption learn That in the unreasoning progress of the world A wiser spirit is at work for us three hundred sixty A better eye than theirs most prodigal Of blessings and most studious of our good Even in what seem our most unfruitful hours H There was a Boy ye knew him well ye cliffs And islands of Winander many a time three hundred sixty five At evening when the earliest stars began To move along the edges of the hills Rising or setting would he stand alone Beneath the trees or by the glimmering lake And there with fingers interwoven both hands three hundred seventy Pressed closely palm to palm and to his mouth Uplifted he as through an instrument Blew mimic hootings to the silent owls That they might answer him I and they would shout Across the watery vale and shout again three hundred seventy five Responsive to his call with quivering peals And long halloos and screams and echoes loud Redoubled and redoubled concourse wild Of jocund din and when a lengthened pause Of silence came and baffled his best skill three hundred eighty Then sometimes in that silence while he hung Listening a gentle shock of mild surprise Has carried far into his heart the voice Of mountain torrents or the visible scene Would enter unawares into his mind three hundred eighty five With all its solemn imagery its rocks Its woods and that uncertain heaven received Into the bosom of the steady lake This Boy was taken from his mates and died In childhood ere he was full twelve years old three hundred ninety Fair is the spot most beautiful the vale Where he was born the grassy churchyard hangs Upon a slope above the village school K And through that churchyard when my way has led On summer evenings I believe that there three hundred ninety five A long half hour together I have stood Mute looking at the grave in which he lies L Even now appears before the mind s clear eye That self same village church I see her sit The throned Lady whom erewhile we hailed four hundred On her green hill forgetful of this Boy Who slumbers at her feet forgetful too Of all her silent neighbourhood of graves And listening only to the gladsome sounds That from the rural school ascending M play four hundred five Beneath her and about her May she long Behold a race of young ones like to those With whom I herded easily indeed We might have fed upon a fatter soil Of arts and letters but be that forgiven four hundred ten A race of real children not too wise Too learned or too good N but wanton fresh And bandied up and down by love and hate Not unresentful where self justified Fierce moody patient venturous modest shy four hundred fifteen Mad at their sports like withered leaves in winds Though doing wrong and suffering and full oft Bending beneath our life s mysterious weight Of pain and doubt and fear yet yielding not In happiness to the happiest upon earth four hundred twenty Simplicity in habit truth in speech Be these the daily strengtheners of their minds May books and Nature be their early joy And knowledge rightly honoured with that name Knowledge not purchased by the loss of power four hundred twenty five Well do I call to mind the very week When I was first intrusted to the care Of that sweet Valley when its paths its shores And brooks O were like a dream of novelty To my half infant thoughts that very week four hundred thirty While I was roving up and down alone Seeking I knew not what I chanced to cross One of those open fields which shaped like ears Make green peninsulas on Esthwaite s Lake Twilight was coming on yet through the gloom four hundred thirty five Appeared distinctly on the opposite shore A heap of garments as if left by one Who might have there been bathing Long I watched But no one owned them meanwhile the calm lake Grew dark with all the shadows on its breast four hundred forty And now and then a fish up leaping snapped The breathless stillness P The succeeding day Those unclaimed garments telling a plain tale Drew to the spot an anxious crowd some looked In passive expectation from the shore four hundred forty five While from a boat others hung o er the deep Sounding with grappling irons and long poles At last the dead man mid that beauteous scene Of trees and hills and water bolt upright Rose with his ghastly face a spectre shape four hundred fifty Of terror yet no soul debasing fear Young as I was a child not nine years old Possessed me for my inner eye had seen Such sights before among the shining streams Of faery land the forest of romance four hundred fifty five Their spirit hallowed the sad spectacle With decoration of ideal grace A dignity a smoothness like the works Of Grecian art and purest poesy A precious treasure had I long possessed four hundred sixty A little yellow canvas covered book A slender abstract of the Arabian tales And from companions in a new abode When first I learnt that this dear prize of mine Was but a block hewn from a mighty quarry four hundred sixty five That there were four large volumes laden all With kindred matter twas to me in truth A promise scarcely earthly Instantly With one not richer than myself I made A covenant that each should lay aside four hundred seventy The moneys he possessed and hoard up more Till our joint savings had amassed enough To make this book our own Through several months In spite of all temptation we preserved Religiously that vow but firmness failed four hundred seventy five Nor were we ever masters of our wish And when thereafter to my father s house The holidays returned me there to find That golden store of books which I had left What joy was mine How often in the course four hundred eighty Of those glad respites though a soft west wind Ruffled the waters to the angler s wish For a whole day together have I lain Down by thy side O Derwent murmuring stream On the hot stones and in the glaring sun four hundred eighty five And there have read devouring as I read Defrauding the day s glory desperate Till with a sudden bound of smart reproach Such as an idler deals with in his shame I to the sport betook myself again four hundred ninety A gracious spirit o er this earth presides And o er the heart of man invisibly It comes to works of unreproved delight And tendency benign directing those Who care not know not think not what they do four hundred ninety five The tales that charm away the wakeful night In Araby romances legends penned For solace by dim light of monkish lamps Fictions for ladies of their love devised By youthful squires adventures endless spun five hundred By the dismantled warrior in old age Out of the bowels of those very schemes In which his youth did first extravagate These spread like day and something in the shape Of these will live till man shall be no more five hundred five Dumb yearnings hidden appetites are ours And they must have their food Our childhood sits Our simple childhood sits upon a throne That hath more power than all the elements I guess not what this tells of Being past five hundred ten Nor what it augurs of the life to come Q But so it is and in that dubious hour That twilight when we first begin to see This dawning earth to recognise expect And in the long probation that ensues five hundred fifteen The time of trial ere we learn to live In reconcilement with our stinted powers To endure this state of meagre vassalage Unwilling to forego confess submit Uneasy and unsettled yoke fellows five hundred twenty To custom mettlesome and not yet tamed And humbled down oh then we feel we feel We know where we have friends Ye dreamers then Forgers of daring tales we bless you then Impostors drivellers dotards as the ape five hundred twenty five Philosophy will call you then we feel With what and how great might ye are in league Who make our wish our power our thought a deed An empire a possession ye whom time And seasons serve all Faculties to whom five hundred thirty Earth crouches the elements are potter s clay Space like a heaven filled up with northern lights Here nowhere there and everywhere at once Relinquishing this lofty eminence For ground though humbler not the less a tract five hundred thirty five Of the same isthmus which our spirits cross In progress from their native continent To earth and human life the Song might dwell On that delightful time of growing youth When craving for the marvellous gives way five hundred forty To strengthening love for things that we have seen When sober truth and steady sympathies Offered to notice by less daring pens Take firmer hold of us and words themselves Move us with conscious pleasure I am sad five hundred forty five At thought of raptures now for ever flown R Almost to tears I sometimes could be sad To think of to read over many a page Poems withal of name which at that time Did never fail to entrance me and are now five hundred fifty Dead in my eyes dead as a theatre Fresh emptied of spectators Twice five years Or less I might have seen when first my mind With conscious pleasure opened to the charm Of words in tuneful order found them sweet five hundred fifty five For their own sakes a passion and a power And phrases pleased me chosen for delight For pomp or love Oft in the public roads Yet unfrequented while the morning light Was yellowing the hill tops I went abroad five hundred sixty With a dear friend S and for the better part Of two delightful hours we strolled along By the still borders of the misty lake T Repeating favourite verses with one voice Or conning more as happy as the birds five hundred sixty five That round us chaunted Well might we be glad Lifted above the ground by airy fancies More bright than madness or the dreams of wine And though full oft the objects of our love Were false and in their splendour overwrought U five hundred seventy Yet was there surely then no vulgar power Working within us nothing less in truth Than that most noble attribute of man Though yet untutored and inordinate That wish for something loftier more adorned five hundred seventy five Than is the common aspect daily garb Of human life What wonder then if sounds Of exultation echoed through the groves For images and sentiments and words And everything encountered or pursued five hundred eighty In that delicious world of poesy Kept holiday a never ending show With music incense festival and flowers Here must we pause this only let me add From heart experience and in humblest sense five hundred eighty five Of modesty that he who in his youth A daily wanderer among woods and fields With living Nature hath been intimate Not only in that raw unpractised time Is stirred to extasy as others are five hundred ninety By glittering verse but further doth receive In measure only dealt out to himself Knowledge and increase of enduring joy From the great Nature that exists in works Of mighty Poets Visionary power five hundred ninety five Attends the motions of the viewless winds Embodied in the mystery of words There darkness makes abode and all the host Of shadowy things work endless changes there As in a mansion like their proper home six hundred Even forms and substances are circumfused By that transparent veil with light divine And through the turnings intricate of verse Present themselves as objects recognised In flashes and with glory not their own six hundred five VARIANTS ON THE TEXT Footnote A This quotation I am unable to trace Ed Footnote B Compare Emily Bronte s statement of the same in the last verse she wrote Though Earth and Man were gone And suns and universes ceased to be And Thou wert left alone Every existence would exist in Thee There is not room for Death Nor atom that His might could render void Thou THOU art Being and Breath And what THOU art may never be destroyed Ed Footnote C Because she would then become farther and farther removed from the source of essential life and being diffused instead of concentrated William Davies Ed Footnote D mister A J Duffield the translator of Don Quixote wrote me the following letter on Wordsworth and Cervantes which I transcribe in full So far as I can learn Wordsworth had not read any critical work on Don Quixote before he wrote the fifth book of The Prelude a nor for that matter had any criticism of the master piece of Cervantes then appeared Yet Wordsworth by patient exercise Of study and hard thought has given us not only a most poetical insight into the real nature of the Illustrious Hidalgo of La Mancha he has shown us that it was a nature compacted of the madman and the poet and this in language so appropriate that the consideration of it cannot fail to give pleasure to all who have found a reason for weighing Wordsworth s words He demands Oh why hath not the Mind Some element to stamp her image on then falls asleep his senses yielding to the sultry air and he sees before him stretched a boundless plain Of sandy wilderness all black and void And as I looked around distress and fear Came creeping over me when at my side Close at my side an uncouth shape appeared Upon a dromedary mounted high He seemed an Arab Here we have the plains of Montiel and the poet realising all that Don Quixote felt on that day of July the hottest of the year when he first set out on his quest and met with nothing worth recording The uncouth shape is of course the Don himself the dromedary is Rozinante and the Arab doubtless is Cid Hamete Benengeli Taking such an one for the guide who with unerring skill Would through the desert lead me is a most sweet play of humour like to the lambent flame of his whose satire was as a summer breath and who smiled all the time he wrote although he wrote chiefly in a prison The loud prophetic blast of harmony is doubtless a continuation of this humour down to the lines Nor doubted once but that they both were books Having a perfect faith in all that passed Our poet now becomes positive Lance in rest He rode I keeping pace with him and now He to my fancy had become the knight Whose tale Cervantes tells yet not the knight But was an Arab of the desert too Of these was neither and was both at once This is absolutely true and was one of the earliest complaints made a century and a half ago when Spaniards began to criticise their one great book They could not tell at times whether Don Quixote was speaking or Cervantes or Cid Hamete Benengeli A bed of glittering light is a delightful description of the attitude of Don Quixote s mind towards external nature while passing through the desert It is said he the waters of the deep Gathering upon us It was of course only the mirage but this he changed to suit his own purpose into the waters of the deep as he changed the row of Castilian wind mills into giants and the roar of the fulling mills into the din of war Wordsworth is now awake from his dream but turning all he saw in it into a reality as only the poet can he feels that Reverence was due to a being thus employed And thought that in the blind and awful lair Of such a madness reason did lie couched Here again is a most profound description of the creation of Cervantes Don Quixote was mad but his was a madness that proceeded from that blind and awful lair a disordered stomach rather than from an injured brain Had Don Quixote not forsaken the exercise of the chase and early rising if he had not taken to eating chestnuts at night cold spiced meat together with onions and ollas podridas then proceeding to read exciting unnatural tales of love and war he would not have gone mad But his reason only lay couched not overthrown Only give him a dose of the balsam of Fierabras his reason shall spring out of its lair like a lion from out its hiding place as indeed it did and you then have that wonderful piece of rhetoric which describes the army of Alifanfaron in the eighteenth chapter Part I There are many other things worthy of note such as crazed By love and feeling and internal thought Protracted among endless solitudes all of which are fit epithets blessed in the marriage of pure words which the author of The Prelude without any special learning or personal knowledge of Spain has given us and are so striking as to compel us once again to go to Wordsworth and say we do not all understand thee yet not all that thou hast given us Very truly yours A J Duffield Ed Footnote E Compare Paradise Lost v one one hundred fifty In prose or numerous verse Ed Footnote F Wordsworth s earliest teachers before he was sent to Hawkshead School were his mother and the reverend mister Gilbanks at Cockermouth and missus Anne Birkett at Penrith His mother and Dame Birkett taught him to read and trained his infant memory mister Gilbanks also gave him elementary instruction while his father made him commit to memory portions of the English poets At Hawkshead he read English literature learned Latin and Mathematics and wrote both English and Latin verse There was little or no method and no mechanical or artificial drill in his early education Though he was taught both languages and mathematics he was left as free to range the happy pastures of literature as to range the Hawkshead woods on autumn nights in pursuit of woodcocks It is likely that the reference in the above passage is to his education both in childhood and in youth although specially to the former In his Autobiographical Memoranda Wordsworth says Of my earliest days at School I have little to say but that they were very happy ones chiefly because I was left at liberty then and in the vacations to read whatever books I liked For example I read all Fielding s works Don Quixote Gil Blas and any part of Swift that I liked Gulliver s Travels and the Tale of a Tub being both much to my taste As Wordsworth alludes to Coleridge s education along with his own in the season of unperilous choice the reference is probably to Coleridge s early time at the vicarage of Ottery saint Mary s Devonshire and at the Grammar School there as well as at Christ s Hospital in London where with Charles Lamb as school companion he was as enthusiastic in his exploits in the New River as he was an eager student

Lyrical Ballads eighteen hundred and appeared in all the subsequent collective editions of the poems standing first in the group of Poems of the Imagination The grave of this immortal boy cannot be identified His name and everything about him except what is here recorded is unknown but he was in all likelihood a school companion of Wordsworth s at Hawkshead And through that churchyard when my way has led On summer evenings One may localize the above description almost anywhere at Hawkshead Ed Footnote M Hawkshead School in which Wordsworth was taught for eight years from seventeen seventy eight to seventeen eighty six was founded by Archbishop Sandys of York in fifteen eighty five and the building is still very much as it was in Wordsworth s time The main school room is on the ground floor One small chamber on the first floor was used in the end of last century by the head master as a private class room for teaching a few advanced pupils In another is a small library formed in part by the donations of the scholars it having been a custom for each pupil to present a volume on leaving the school or to send one afterwards Very probably one of the volumes now in the library was presented by Wordsworth There are several which were presented by his school fellows during the years in which Wordsworth was at Hawkshead The master in eighteen seventy seven promised me that he would search through his somewhat musty treasures to see if he could discover a book with the poet s autograph but I never heard of his success On the wall of the room containing the library is a tablet recording the names of several masters There also in an old oak chest is kept the original charter of the school The oak benches downstairs are covered with the names or initials of the boys deeply cut and amongst them the name of William Wordsworth but not those of his brothers Richard John or Christopher may be seen For further details as to the Hawkshead School see the Life of the Poet in this edition Towards the close of last century when Wordsworth and his three brothers were educated there the school was one of the best educational institutions in the north of England Ed Footnote

is the immortal Boy of Windermere who blew mimic hootings to the silent owls and who sleeps in the churchyard above the village school of Hawkshead and the Lucy of the Goslar poems Compare however p one hundred sixty three Wordsworth may refer to John Fleming of Rayrigg with whom he used to take morning walks round Esthwaite five miles Of pleasant wandering Ed Footnote T Esthwaite Ed Footnote U Probably they were passages from Goldsmith or Pope or writers of their school The verses which he wrote upon the completion of the second century of the foundation of the school were as he himself

I bade farewell and one among the youth Who summoned by that season reunite As scattered birds troop to the fowler s lure five Went back to Granta s cloisters A not so prompt Or eager though as gay and undepressed In mind as when I thence had taken flight A few short months before I turned my face Without repining from the coves and heights ten Clothed in the sunshine of the withering fern B Quitted not both the mild magnificence Of calmer lakes and louder streams and you Frank hearted maids of rocky Cumberland You and your not unwelcome days of mirth fifteen Relinquished and your nights of revelry And in my own unlovely cell sate down In lightsome mood such privilege has youth That cannot take long leave of pleasant thoughts The bonds of indolent society twenty Relaxing in their hold henceforth I lived More to myself Two winters may be passed Without a separate notice many books Were skimmed devoured or studiously perused But with no settled plan C I was detached twenty five Internally from academic cares Yet independent study seemed a course Of hardy disobedience toward friends And kindred proud rebellion and unkind This spurious virtue rather let it bear thirty A name it now deserves this cowardice Gave treacherous sanction to that over love Of freedom which encouraged me to turn From regulations even of my own As from restraints and bonds Yet who can tell thirty five Who knows what thus may have been gained both then And at a later season or preserved What love of nature what original strength Of contemplation what intuitive truths The deepest and the best what keen research forty Unbiassed unbewildered and unawed The Poet s soul was with me at that time Sweet meditations the still overflow Of present happiness while future years Lacked not anticipations tender dreams forty five No few of which have since been realised And some remain hopes for my future life Four years and thirty told this very week D Have I been now a sojourner on earth By sorrow not unsmitten yet for me fifty Life s morning radiance hath not left the hills Her dew is on the flowers Those were the days Which also first emboldened me to trust With firmness hitherto but lightly touched By such a daring thought that I might leave fifty five Some monument behind me which pure hearts Should reverence The instinctive humbleness Maintained even by the very name and thought Of printed books and authorship began To melt away and further the dread awe sixty Of mighty names was softened down and seemed Approachable admitting fellowship Of modest sympathy Such aspect now Though not familiarly my mind put on Content to observe to achieve and to enjoy sixty five All winter long whenever free to choose Did I by night frequent the College groves And tributary walks the last and oft The only one who had been lingering there Through hours of silence till the porter s bell seventy A punctual follower on the stroke of nine Rang with its blunt unceremonious voice Inexorable summons Lofty elms Inviting shades of opportune recess Bestowed composure on a neighbourhood seventy five Unpeaceful in itself A single tree With sinuous trunk boughs exquisitely wreathed Grew there E an ash which Winter for himself Decked out with pride and with outlandish grace Up from the ground and almost to the top eighty The trunk and every master branch were green With clustering ivy and the lightsome twigs And outer spray profusely tipped with seeds That hung in yellow tassels while the air Stirred them not voiceless Often have I stood eighty five Foot bound uplooking at this lovely tree Beneath a frosty moon The hemisphere Of magic fiction verse of mine perchance May never tread but scarcely Spenser s self Could have more tranquil visions in his youth ninety Or could more bright appearances create Of human forms with superhuman powers Than I beheld loitering on calm clear nights Alone beneath this fairy work of earth On the vague reading of a truant youth F ninety five Twere idle to descant My inner judgment Not seldom differed from my taste in books As if it appertained to another mind And yet the books which then I valued most Are dearest to me now for having scanned one hundred Not heedlessly the laws and watched the forms Of Nature in that knowledge I possessed A standard often usefully applied Even when unconsciously to things removed From a familiar sympathy In fine one hundred five I was a better judge of thoughts than words Misled in estimating words not only By common inexperience of youth But by the trade in classic niceties The dangerous craft of culling term and phrase one hundred ten From languages that want the living voice To carry meaning to the natural heart To tell us what is passion what is truth What reason what simplicity and sense Yet may we not entirely overlook one hundred fifteen The pleasure gathered from the rudiments Of geometric science Though advanced In these inquiries with regret I speak No farther than the threshold G there I found Both elevation and composed delight one hundred twenty With Indian awe and wonder ignorance pleased With its own struggles did I meditate On the relation those abstractions bear To Nature s laws and by what process led Those immaterial agents bowed their heads one hundred twenty five Duly to serve the mind of earth born man From star to star from kindred sphere to sphere From system on to system without end More frequently from the same source I drew A pleasure quiet and profound a sense one hundred thirty Of permanent and universal sway And paramount belief there recognised A type for finite natures of the one Supreme Existence the surpassing life Which to the boundaries of space and time one hundred thirty five Of melancholy space and doleful time Superior and incapable of change Nor touched by welterings of passion is And hath the name of God Transcendent peace And silence did await upon these thoughts one hundred forty That were a frequent comfort to my youth Tis told by one whom stormy waters threw With fellow sufferers by the shipwreck spared Upon a desert coast that having brought To land a single volume saved by chance one hundred forty five A treatise of Geometry he wont Although of food and clothing destitute And beyond common wretchedness depressed To part from company and take this book Then first a self taught pupil in its truths one hundred fifty To spots remote and draw his diagrams With a long staff upon the sand and thus Did oft beguile his sorrow and almost Forget his feeling so if like effect From the same cause produced mid outward things one hundred fifty five So different may rightly be compared So was it then with me and so will be With Poets ever Mighty is the charm Of those abstractions to a mind beset With images and haunted by herself one hundred sixty And specially delightful unto me Was that clear synthesis built up aloft So gracefully even then when it appeared Not more than a mere plaything or a toy To sense embodied not the thing it is one hundred sixty five In verity an independent world Created out of pure intelligence Such dispositions then were mine unearned By aught I fear of genuine desert Mine through heaven s grace and inborn aptitudes one hundred seventy And not to leave the story of that time Imperfect with these habits must be joined Moods melancholy fits of spleen that loved A pensive sky sad days and piping winds The twilight more than dawn autumn than spring H one hundred seventy five A treasured and luxurious gloom of choice And

Compelled to be a life unto herself And unrelentingly possessed by thirst Of greatness love and beauty Not alone three hundred five Ah surely not in singleness of heart Should I have seen the light of evening fade From smooth Cam s silent waters had we met Even at that early time needs must I trust In the belief that my maturer age three hundred ten My calmer habits and more steady voice Would with an influence benign have soothed Or chased away the airy wretchedness That battened on thy youth But thou hast trod A march of glory which doth put to shame three hundred fifteen These vain regrets health suffers in thee else Such grief for thee would be the weakest thought That ever harboured in the breast of man A passing word erewhile did lightly touch On wanderings of my own that now embraced three hundred twenty With livelier hope a region wider far When the third summer freed us from restraint A youthful friend he too a mountaineer c Not slow to share my wishes took his staff

in truth the scheme been formed by me Without uneasy forethought of the pain three hundred thirty The censures and ill omening of those To whom my worldly interests were dear But Nature then was sovereign in my mind And mighty forms seizing a youthful fancy Had given a charter to irregular hopes three hundred thirty five In any age of uneventful calm Among the nations surely would my heart Have been possessed by similar desire But Europe at that time was thrilled with joy France standing on the top of golden hours e three hundred forty And human nature seeming born again f Lightly equipped g and but a few brief looks Cast on the white cliffs of our native shore From the receding vessel s deck we chanced To land at Calais on the very eve three hundred forty five Of that great federal day h and there we saw In a mean city and among a few How bright a face is worn when joy of one Is joy for tens of millions h Southward thence We held our way direct through hamlets towns i three hundred fifty Gaudy with reliques of that festival Flowers left to wither on triumphal arcs And window garlands On the public roads And once three days successively through paths By which our toilsome journey was abridged k three hundred fifty five Among sequestered villages we walked And found benevolence and blessedness Spread like a fragrance everywhere when spring Hath left no corner of the land untouched Where elms for many and many a league in files three hundred sixty With their thin umbrage on the stately roads Of that great kingdom rustled o er our heads m For ever near us as we paced along How sweet at such a time with such delight On every side in prime of youthful strength three hundred sixty five To feed a Poet s tender melancholy And fond conceit of sadness with the sound Of undulations varying as might please The wind that swayed them once and more than once Unhoused beneath the evening star we saw three hundred seventy Dances of liberty and in late hours Of darkness dances in the open air Deftly prolonged though grey haired lookers on Might waste their breath in chiding Under hills The vine clad hills and slopes of Burgundy three hundred seventy five Upon the bosom of the gentle Saone We glided forward with the flowing stream n Swift Rhone thou wert the wings on which we cut A winding passage with majestic ease Between thy lofty rocks o Enchanting show three hundred eighty Those woods and farms and orchards did present And single cottages and lurking towns Reach after reach succession without end Of deep and stately vales A lonely pair Of strangers till day closed we sailed along three hundred eighty five Clustered together with a merry crowd Of those emancipated a blithe host Of travellers chiefly delegates returning From the great spousals newly solemnised At their chief city in the sight of Heaven three hundred ninety Like bees they swarmed gaudy and gay as bees Some vapoured in the unruliness of joy And with their swords flourished as if to fight The saucy air In this proud company We landed took with them our evening meal three hundred ninety five Guests welcome almost as the angels were To Abraham of old The supper done With flowing cups elate and happy thoughts We rose at signal given and formed a ring And hand in hand danced round and round the board four hundred All hearts were open every tongue was loud With amity and glee we bore a name Honoured in France the name of Englishmen And hospitably did they give us hail As their forerunners in a glorious course four hundred five And round and round the board we danced again With these blithe friends our voyage we renewed At early dawn The monastery bells Made a sweet jingling in our youthful ears The rapid river flowing without noise four hundred ten And each uprising or receding spire Spake with a sense of peace at intervals Touching the heart amid the boisterous crew By whom we were encompassed Taking leave Of this glad throng foot travellers side by side four hundred fifteen Measuring our steps in quiet we pursued Our journey and ere twice the sun had set Beheld the Convent of Chartreuse and there Rested within an awful solitude p Yes for even then no other than a place four hundred twenty Of soul affecting solitude appeared That far famed region though our eyes had seen As toward the sacred mansion we advanced Arms flashing and a military glare Of riotous men commissioned to expel four hundred twenty five The blameless inmates and belike subvert That frame of social being which so long Had bodied forth the ghostliness of things In silence visible and perpetual calm Stay stay your sacrilegious hands The voice four hundred thirty Was Nature s uttered from her Alpine throne I heard it then and seem to hear it now Your impious work forbear perish what may Let this one temple last be this one spot Of earth devoted to eternity four hundred thirty five She ceased to speak but while saint Bruno s pines q Waved their dark tops not silent as they waved And while below along their several beds Murmured the sister streams of Life and Death r Thus by conflicting passions pressed my heart four hundred forty Responded Honour to the patriot s zeal Glory and hope to new born Liberty Hail to the mighty projects of the time Discerning sword that Justice wields do thou Go forth and prosper and ye purging fires four hundred forty five

knowledge spare four hundred fifty These courts of mystery where a step advanced Between the portals of the shadowy rocks Leaves far behind life s treacherous vanities For penitential tears and trembling hopes Exchanged to equalise in God s pure sight four hundred fifty five Monarch and peasant be the house redeemed With its unworldly votaries for the sake Of conquest over sense hourly achieved Through faith and meditative reason resting Upon the word of heaven imparted truth four hundred sixty Calmly triumphant and for humbler claim Of that imaginative impulse sent From these majestic floods yon shining cliffs The untransmuted shapes of many worlds Cerulean ether s pure inhabitants four hundred sixty five These forests unapproachable by death That shall endure as long as man endures To think to hope to worship and to feel To struggle to be lost within himself In trepidation from the blank abyss four hundred seventy To look with bodily eyes and be consoled Not seldom since that moment have I wished That thou O Friend the trouble or the calm Hadst shared when from profane regards apart In sympathetic reverence we trod four hundred seventy five The floors of those dim cloisters till that hour From their foundation strangers to the presence Of unrestricted and unthinking man Abroad how cheeringly the sunshine lay Upon the open lawns Vallombre s groves four hundred eighty Entering s we fed the soul with darkness thence Issued and with uplifted eyes beheld In different quarters of the bending sky The cross of Jesus stand erect as if Hands of angelic powers had fixed it there t four hundred eighty five Memorial reverenced by a thousand storms Yet then from the undiscriminating sweep And rage of one State whirlwind insecure Tis not my present purpose to retrace That variegated journey step by step four hundred ninety A march it was of military speed u And Earth did change her images and forms Before us fast as clouds are changed in heaven Day after day up early and down late From hill to vale we dropped from vale to hill four hundred ninety five Mounted from province on to province swept Keen hunters in a chase of fourteen weeks u Eager as birds of prey or as a ship Upon the stretch when winds are blowing fair Sweet coverts did we cross of pastoral life five hundred Enticing valleys greeted them and left Too soon while yet the very flash and gleam v Of salutation were not passed away Oh sorrow for the youth who could have seen Unchastened unsubdued unawed unraised five hundred five To patriarchal dignity of mind And pure simplicity of wish and will Those sanctified abodes of peaceful man Pleased though to hardship born and compassed round With danger varying as the seasons change five hundred ten Pleased with his daily task or if not pleased Contented from the moment that the dawn Ah surely not without attendant gleams Of soul illumination calls him forth To industry by glistenings flung on rocks five hundred fifteen Whose evening shadows lead him to repose w Well might a stranger look with bounding heart Down on a green recess x the first I saw Of those deep haunts an aboriginal vale Quiet and lorded over and possessed five hundred twenty By naked huts wood built and sown like tents Or Indian cabins over the fresh lawns And by the river side That very day From a bare ridge y we also first beheld Unveiled the summit of Mont Blanc and grieved five hundred twenty five To have a soulless image on the eye That had usurped upon a living thought That never more could be The wondrous Vale Of Chamouny stretched far below and soon With its dumb cataracts and streams of ice five hundred thirty A motionless array of mighty waves Five rivers broad and vast z made rich amends And reconciled us to realities There small birds warble from the leafy trees The eagle soars high in the element five hundred thirty five There doth the reaper bind the yellow sheaf The maiden spread the haycock in the sun While Winter like a well tamed lion walks Descending from the mountain to make sport Among the cottages by beds of flowers five hundred forty Whate er in this wide circuit we beheld Or heard was fitted to our unripe state Of intellect and heart With such a book Before our eyes we could not choose but read Lessons of genuine brotherhood the plain five hundred forty five And universal reason of mankind The truths of young and old Nor side by side Pacing two social pilgrims or alone Each with his humour could we fail to abound In dreams and fictions pensively composed five hundred fifty Dejection taken up for pleasure s sake And gilded sympathies the willow wreath And sober posies of funereal flowers Gathered among those solitudes sublime From formal gardens of the lady Sorrow five hundred fifty five Did sweeten many a meditative hour Yet still in me with those soft luxuries Mixed something of stem mood an under thirst Of vigour seldom utterly allayed And from that source how different a sadness five hundred sixty Would issue let one incident make known When from the Vallais we had turned and clomb Along the Simplon s steep and rugged road Aa Following a band of muleteers we reached A halting place where all together took five hundred sixty five Their noon tide meal Hastily rose our guide Leaving us at the board awhile we lingered Then paced the beaten downward way that led Right to a rough stream s edge and there broke off The only track now visible was one five hundred seventy That from the torrent s further brink held forth Conspicuous invitation to ascend A lofty mountain After brief delay Crossing the unbridged stream that road we took And clomb with eagerness till anxious fears five hundred seventy five Intruded for we failed to overtake Our comrades gone before By fortunate chance While every moment added doubt to doubt A peasant met us from whose mouth we learned That to the spot which had perplexed us first five hundred eighty We must descend and there should find the road Which in the stony channel of the stream Lay a few steps and then along its banks And that our future course all plain to sight Was downwards with the current of that stream five hundred eighty five Loth to believe what we so grieved to hear For still we had hopes that pointed to the clouds We questioned him again and yet again But every word that from the peasant s lips Came in reply translated by our feelings five hundred ninety Ended in this that we had crossed the Alps Imagination here the Power so called Through sad incompetence of human speech That awful Power rose from the mind s abyss Like an unfathered vapour that enwraps five hundred ninety five At once some lonely traveller I was lost Halted without an effort to break through But to my conscious soul I now can say I recognise thy glory in such strength Of usurpation when the light of sense six hundred Goes out but with a flash that has revealed The invisible world doth greatness make abode There harbours whether we be young or old Our destiny our being s heart and home Is with infinitude and only there six hundred five With hope it is hope that can never die Effort and expectation and desire And something evermore about to be Under such banners militant the soul Seeks for no trophies struggles for no spoils six hundred ten That may attest her prowess blest in thoughts That are their own perfection and reward Strong in herself and in beatitude That hides her like the mighty flood of Nile Poured from his fount of Abyssinian clouds six hundred fifteen To fertilise the whole Egyptian plain The melancholy slackening that ensued Upon those tidings by the peasant given Was soon dislodged Downwards we hurried fast And with the half shaped road which we had missed six hundred twenty Entered a narrow chasm The brook and road one Were fellow travellers in this gloomy strait Bb And with them did we journey several hours At a slow pace two The immeasurable height Of woods decaying never to be decayed six hundred twenty five The stationary blasts of waterfalls And in the narrow rent at every turn Winds thwarting winds bewildered and forlorn The torrents shooting from the clear blue sky The rocks that muttered close upon our ears six hundred thirty Black drizzling crags that spake by the way side As if a voice were in them the sick sight And giddy prospect of the raving stream The unfettered clouds and region of the Heavens Tumult and peace the darkness and the light six hundred thirty five Were all like workings of one mind the features Of the same face blossoms upon one tree Characters of the great Apocalypse The types and symbols of Eternity Of first and last and midst and without end six hundred forty That night our lodging was a house that stood Alone within the valley at a point Where tumbling from aloft a torrent swelled The rapid stream whose margin we had trod A dreary mansion large beyond all need Cc six hundred forty five With high and spacious rooms deafened and stunned By noise of waters making innocent sleep Lie melancholy among weary bones Uprisen betimes our journey we renewed Led by the stream ere noon day magnified six hundred fifty Into a lordly river broad and deep Dimpling along in silent majesty With mountains for its neighbours and in view Of distant mountains and their snowy tops And thus proceeding to Locarno s Lake Dd six hundred fifty five Fit resting place for such a visitant Locarno spreading out in width like Heaven How dost thou cleave to the poetic heart Bask in the sunshine of the memory And Como thou a treasure whom the earth six hundred sixty Keeps to herself confined as in a depth Of Abyssinian privacy I spake Of thee thy chestnut woods Ee and garden plots Of Indian corn tended by dark eyed maids Thy lofty steeps and pathways roofed with vines six hundred sixty five Winding from house to house from town to town Sole link that binds them to each other Ff walks League after league and cloistral avenues Where silence dwells if music be not there While yet a youth undisciplined in verse six hundred seventy Through fond ambition of that hour I strove To chant your praise Gg nor can approach you now Ungreeted by a more melodious Song Where tones of Nature smoothed by learned Art May flow in lasting current Like a breeze six hundred seventy five Or sunbeam over your domain I passed In motion without pause but ye have left Your beauty with me a serene accord Of forms and colours passive yet endowed In their submissiveness with power as sweet six hundred eighty And gracious almost might I dare to say As virtue is or goodness sweet as love Or the remembrance of a generous deed Or mildest visitations of pure thought When God the giver of all joy is thanked six hundred eighty five Religiously in silent blessedness Sweet as this last herself for such it is With those delightful pathways we advanced For two days space in presence of the Lake That stretching far among the Alps assumed six hundred ninety A character more stern The second night From sleep awakened and misled by sound Of the church clock telling the hours with strokes Whose import then we had not learned we rose By moonlight doubting not that day was nigh six hundred ninety five And that meanwhile by no uncertain path Along the winding margin of the lake Led as before we should behold the scene Hushed in profound repose We left the town Of Gravedona Hh with this hope but soon seven hundred Were lost bewildered among woods immense And on a rock sate down to wait for day An open place it was and overlooked From high the sullen water far beneath On which a dull red image of the moon seven hundred five Lay bedded changing oftentimes its form Like an uneasy snake From hour to hour We sate and sate wondering as if the night Had been ensnared by witchcraft On the rock At last we stretched our weary limbs for sleep seven hundred ten But could not sleep tormented by the stings Of insects which with noise like that of noon Filled all the woods the cry of unknown birds The mountains more by blackness visible And their own size than any outward light seven hundred fifteen The breathless wilderness of clouds the clock That told with unintelligible voice The widely parted hours the noise of streams And sometimes rustling motions nigh at hand That did not leave us free from personal fear seven hundred twenty And lastly the withdrawing moon that set Before us while she still was high in heaven These were our food and such a summer s night Ii Followed that pair of golden days that shed On Como s Lake and all that round it lay seven hundred twenty five Their fairest softest happiest influence But here I must break off and bid farewell To days each offering some new sight or fraught With some untried adventure in a course Prolonged till sprinklings of autumnal snow seven hundred thirty Checked our unwearied steps Let this alone Be mentioned as a parting word that not In hollow exultation dealing out Hyperboles of praise comparative Not rich one moment to be poor for ever seven hundred thirty five Not prostrate overborne as if the mind Herself were nothing a mere pensioner On outward forms did we in presence stand Of that magnificent region On the front Of this whole Song is written that my heart seven hundred forty Must in such Temple needs have offered up A different worship Finally whate er I saw or heard or felt was but a stream That flowed into a kindred stream a gale Confederate with the current of the soul seven hundred forty five To speed my voyage every sound or sight In its degree of power administered To grandeur or to tenderness to the one Directly but to tender thoughts by means Less often instantaneous in effect seven hundred fifty Led me to these by paths that in the main Were more circuitous but not less sure Duly to reach the point marked out by Heaven Oh most beloved Friend a glorious time A happy time that was triumphant looks seven hundred fifty five Were then the common language of all eyes As if awaked from sleep the Nations hailed Their great expectancy the fife of war Was then a spirit stirring sound indeed A black bird s whistle in a budding grove seven hundred sixty We left the Swiss exulting in the fate Of their near neighbours and when shortening fast Our pilgrimage nor distant far from home We crossed the Brabant armies on the fret Kk For battle in the cause of Liberty seven hundred sixty five A stripling scarcely of the household then Of social life I looked upon these things As from a distance heard and saw and felt Was touched but with no intimate concern I seemed to move along them as a bird seven hundred seventy Moves through the air or as a fish pursues Its sport or feeds in its proper element I wanted not that joy I did not need Such help the ever living universe Turn where I might was opening out its glories seven hundred seventy five And the independent spirit of pure youth

Grantchester is still the name of a village near Cambridge It is uncertain whether the village or the city itself is the spot of which Bede writes venerunt ad civitatulam quandam desolatam quae lingua

Granta s sons p one hundred twenty one Ed Footnote B Note the meaning as well as the curiosa felicitas of this phrase Ed Footnote C His Cambridge studies were very miscellaneous partly owing to his strong natural disinclination to work by rule partly to unmethodic training at Hawkshead and to the fact that he had already mastered so much of Euclid and Algebra as to have a twelvemonth s start of the freshmen of his year Accordingly he tells us I got into rather an idle way reading nothing but Classic authors according to my fancy and Italian poetry As I took to these studies with much interest my Italian master was proud of the progress I made Under his correction I translated the Vision of Mirza and two or three other papers of the Spectator into Italian Speaking of her brother Christopher then at Cambridge Dorothy Wordsworth wrote thus in seventeen ninety three He is not so ardent in any of his pursuits as William is but he is yet particularly attached to the same pursuits which have so irresistible an influence over William and deprive him of the power of chaining his attention to others discordant to his feelings Ed Footnote D April eighteen oh four Ed Footnote E

years and to those spent at Cambridge but doubtless the brother and sister met at Penrith in vacation time from Hawkshead School and after William Wordsworth had gone to the university Dorothy visited Cambridge while the brother spent the Christmas holidays of seventeen ninety at Forncett Rectory in Norfolk where his sister was then staying and where she spent several years with their uncle Cookson

vanity quick Spirit that appears Almost as deeply seated and as strong In a Child s heart as fear itself conceived one hundred five For my enjoyment Would that I could now Recal what then I pictured to myself Of mitred Prelates Lords in ermine clad The King and the King s Palace and not last Nor least Heaven bless him the renowned Lord Mayor one hundred ten Dreams not unlike to those which once begat A change of purpose in young Whittington When he a friendless and a drooping boy Sate on a stone and heard the bells speak out Articulate music L Above all one thought one hundred fifteen Baffled my understanding how men lived Even next door neighbours as we say yet still Strangers not knowing each the other s name O wond rous power of words by simple faith Licensed to take the meaning that we love one hundred twenty Vauxhall and Ranelagh I then had heard Of your green groves M and wilderness of lamps Dimming the stars and fireworks magical And gorgeous ladies under splendid domes Floating in dance or warbling high in air one hundred twenty five The songs of spirits Nor had Fancy fed With less delight upon that other class Of marvels broad day wonders permanent The River proudly bridged the dizzy top And Whispering Gallery of saint Paul s the tombs one hundred thirty Of Westminster the Giants of Guildhall Bedlam and those carved maniacs at the gates N Perpetually recumbent Statues man And the horse under him in gilded pomp Adorning flowery gardens mid vast squares one hundred thirty five The Monument O and that Chamber of the Tower P Where England s sovereigns sit in long array Their steeds bestriding every mimic shape Cased in the gleaming mail the monarch wore Whether for gorgeous tournament addressed one hundred forty Or life or death upon the battle field Those bold imaginations in due time Had vanished leaving others in their stead And now I looked upon the living scene Familiarly perused it oftentimes one hundred forty five In spite of strongest disappointment pleased Through courteous self submission as a tax Paid to the object by prescriptive right Rise up thou monstrous ant hill on the plain Of a too busy world Before me flow one hundred fifty Thou endless stream of men and moving things Thy every day appearance as it strikes With wonder heightened or sublimed by awe On strangers of all ages the quick dance Of colours lights and forms the deafening din one hundred fifty five The comers and the goers face to face Face after face the string of dazzling wares Shop after shop with symbols blazoned names And all the tradesman s honours overhead Here fronts of houses like a title page one hundred sixty With letters huge inscribed from top to toe Stationed above the door like guardian saints There allegoric shapes female or male Or physiognomies of real men Land warriors kings or admirals of the sea one hundred sixty five Boyle Shakespeare Newton or the attractive head Of some quack doctor famous in his day Meanwhile the roar continues till at length Escaped as from an enemy we turn Abruptly into some sequestered nook one hundred seventy Still as a sheltered place when winds blow loud At leisure thence through tracts of thin resort And sights and sounds that come at intervals We take our way A raree show is here With children gathered round another street one hundred seventy five Presents a company of dancing dogs Or dromedary with an antic pair Of monkeys on his back a minstrel band Of Savoyards or single and alone An English ballad singer Private courts one hundred eighty Gloomy as coffins and unsightly lanes Thrilled by some female vendor s scream belike The very shrillest of all London cries May then entangle our impatient steps Conducted through those labyrinths unawares one hundred eighty five To privileged regions and inviolate Where from their airy lodges studious lawyers Look out on waters walks and gardens green Thence back into the throng until we reach Following the tide that slackens by degrees one hundred ninety Some half frequented scene where wider streets Bring straggling breezes of suburban air Here files of ballads dangle from dead walls Advertisements of giant size from high Press forward in all colours on the sight one hundred ninety five These bold in conscious merit lower down That fronted with a most imposing word Is peradventure one in masquerade As on the broadening causeway we advance Behold turned upwards a face hard and strong two hundred In lineaments and red with over toil Tis one encountered here and everywhere A travelling cripple by the trunk cut short And stumping on his arms In sailor s garb Another lies at length beside a range two hundred five Of well formed characters with chalk inscribed Upon the smooth flat stones the Nurse is here The Bachelor that loves to sun himself The military Idler and the Dame That field ward takes her walk with decent steps two hundred ten Now homeward through the thickening hubbub where See among less distinguishable shapes The begging scavenger with hat in hand The Italian as he thrids his way with care Steadying far seen a frame of images two hundred fifteen Upon his head with basket at his breast The Jew the stately and slow moving Turk With freight of slippers piled beneath his arm Enough the mighty concourse I surveyed With no unthinking mind well pleased to note two hundred twenty Among the crowd all specimens of man Through all the colours which the sun bestows And every character of form and face The Swede the Russian from the genial south The Frenchman and the Spaniard from remote two hundred twenty five America the Hunter Indian Moors Malays Lascars the Tartar the Chinese And Negro Ladies in white muslin gowns At leisure then I viewed from day to day The spectacles within doors birds and beasts two hundred thirty Of every nature and strange plants convened From every clime and next those sights that ape The absolute presence of reality Expressing as in mirror sea and land And what earth is and what she has to shew two hundred thirty five I do not here allude to subtlest craft By means refined attaining purest ends But imitations fondly made in plain Confession of man s weakness and his loves Whether the Painter whose ambitious skill two hundred forty Submits to nothing less than taking in A whole horizon s circuit do with power Like that of angels or commissioned spirits Fix us upon some lofty pinnacle Or in a ship on waters with a world two hundred forty five Of life and life like mockery beneath Above behind far stretching and before Or more mechanic artist represent By scale exact in model wood or clay From blended colours also borrowing help two hundred fifty Some miniature of famous spots or things saint Peter s Church or more aspiring aim In microscopic vision Rome herself Or haply some choice rural haunt the Falls Of Tivoli and high upon that steep two hundred fifty five The Sibyl s mouldering Temple every tree Villa or cottage lurking among rocks Throughout the landscape tuft stone scratch minute All that the traveller sees when he is there Add to these exhibitions mute and still two hundred sixty Others of wider scope where living men Music and shifting pantomimic scenes Diversified the allurement Need I fear To mention by its name as in degree Lowest of these and humblest in attempt two hundred sixty five Yet richly graced with honours of her own Half rural Sadler s Wells Q Though at that time Intolerant as is the way of youth Unless itself be pleased here more than once Taking my seat I saw nor blush to add two hundred seventy With ample recompense giants and dwarfs Clowns conjurors posture masters harlequins Amid the uproar of the rabblement Perform their feats Nor was it mean delight To watch crude Nature work in untaught minds two hundred seventy five To note the laws and progress of belief Though obstinate on this way yet on that How willingly we travel and how far To have for instance brought upon the scene The champion Jack the Giant killer Lo two hundred eighty He dons his coat of darkness on the stage Walks and achieves his wonders from the eye Of living Mortal covert as the moon Hid in her vacant interlunar cave R Delusion bold and how can it be wrought two hundred eighty five The garb he wears is black as death the word Invisible flames forth upon his chest Here too were forms and pressures of the time S Rough bold as Grecian comedy displayed When Art was young dramas of living men two hundred ninety And recent things yet warm with life a sea fight Shipwreck or some domestic incident Divulged by Truth and magnified by Fame Such as the daring brotherhood of late Set forth too serious theme for that light place two hundred ninety five I mean O distant Friend a story drawn From our own ground the Maid of Buttermere T And how unfaithful to a virtuous wife Deserted and deceived the spoiler came And wooed the artless daughter of the hills three hundred And wedded her in cruel mockery Of love and marriage bonds U These words to thee Must needs bring back the moment when we first Ere the broad world rang with the maiden s name Beheld her serving at the cottage inn three hundred five Both stricken as she entered or withdrew With admiration of her modest mien And carriage marked by unexampled grace We since that time not unfamiliarly Have seen her her discretion have observed three hundred ten Her just opinions delicate reserve Her patience and humility of mind Unspoiled by commendation and the excess Of public notice an offensive light To a meek spirit suffering inwardly three hundred fifteen From this memorial tribute to my theme I was returning when with sundry forms Commingled shapes which met me in the way That we must tread thy image rose again Maiden of Buttermere She lives in peace three hundred twenty Upon the spot where she was born and reared Without contamination doth she live In quietness without anxiety Beside the mountain chapel sleeps in earth Her new born infant fearless as a lamb three hundred twenty five That thither driven from some unsheltered place Rests underneath the little rock like pile When storms are raging Happy are they both Mother and child These feelings in themselves Trite do yet scarcely seem so when I think three hundred thirty On those ingenuous moments of our youth Ere we have learnt by use to slight the crimes And sorrows of the world Those simple days Are now my theme and foremost of the scenes Which yet survive in memory appears three hundred thirty five One at whose centre sate a lovely Boy A sportive infant who for six months space Not more had been of age to deal about Articulate prattle Child as beautiful As ever clung around a mother s neck three hundred forty Or father fondly gazed upon with pride There too conspicuous for stature tall And large dark eyes beside her infant stood The mother but upon her cheeks diffused False tints too well accorded with the glare three hundred forty five From play house lustres thrown without reserve On every object near The Boy had been The pride and pleasure of all lookers on In whatsoever place but seemed in this A sort of alien scattered from the clouds three hundred fifty Of lusty vigour more than infantine He was in limb in cheek a summer rose Just three parts blown a cottage child if e er By cottage door on breezy mountain side Or in some sheltering vale was seen a babe three hundred fifty five By Nature s gifts so favoured Upon a board Decked with refreshments had this child been placed His little stage in the vast theatre And there he sate surrounded with a throng Of chance spectators chiefly dissolute men three hundred sixty And shameless women treated and caressed Ate drank and with the fruit and glasses played While oaths and laughter and indecent speech Were rife about him as the songs of birds Contending after showers The mother now three hundred sixty five Is fading out of memory but I see The lovely Boy as I beheld him then Among the wretched and the falsely gay Like one of those who walked with hair unsinged Amid the fiery furnace Charms and spells three hundred seventy Muttered on black and spiteful instigation Have stopped as some believe the kindliest growths Ah with how different spirit might a prayer Have been preferred that this fair creature checked By special privilege of Nature s love three hundred seventy five Should in his childhood be detained for ever But with its universal freight the tide Hath rolled along and this bright innocent Mary may now have lived till he could look With envy on thy nameless babe that sleeps three hundred eighty Beside the mountain chapel undisturbed Four rapid years had scarcely then been told V Since travelling southward from our pastoral hills I heard and for the first time in my life The voice of woman utter blasphemy three hundred eighty five Saw woman as she is to open shame Abandoned and the pride of public vice I shuddered for a barrier seemed at once Thrown in that from humanity divorced Humanity splitting the race of man three hundred ninety In twain yet leaving the same outward form Distress of mind ensued upon the sight And ardent meditation Later years Brought to such spectacle a milder sadness Feelings of pure commiseration grief three hundred ninety five For the individual and the overthrow Of her soul s beauty farther I was then But seldom led or wished to go in truth The sorrow of the passion stopped me there But let me now less moved in order take four hundred Our argument Enough is said to show How casual incidents of real life Observed where pastime only had been sought Outweighed or put to flight the set events And measured passions of the stage albeit four hundred five By Siddons trod in the fulness of her power Yet was the theatre my dear delight The very gilding lamps and painted scrolls And all the mean upholstery of the place Wanted not animation when the tide four hundred ten Of pleasure ebbed but to return as fast With the ever shifting figures of the scene Solemn or gay whether some beauteous dame Advanced in radiance through a deep recess Of thick entangled forest like the moon four hundred fifteen Opening the clouds or sovereign king announced With flourishing trumpet came in full blown state Of the world s greatness winding round with train Of courtiers banners and a length of guards Or captive led in abject weeds and jingling four hundred twenty His slender manacles or romping girl Bounced leapt and pawed the air or mumbling sire A scare crow pattern of old age dressed up In all the tatters of infirmity All loosely put together hobbled in four hundred twenty five Stumping upon a cane with which he smites From time to time the solid boards and makes them Prate somewhat loudly of the whereabout W Of one so overloaded with his years But what of this the laugh the grin grimace four hundred thirty The antics striving to outstrip each other Were all received the least of them not lost With an unmeasured welcome Through the night Between the show and many headed mass Of the spectators and each several nook four hundred thirty five Filled with its fray or brawl how eagerly And with what flashes as it were the mind Turned this way that way sportive and alert And watchful as a kitten when at play While winds are eddying round her among straws four hundred forty And rustling leaves Enchanting age and sweet Romantic almost looked at through a space How small of intervening years For then Though surely no mean progress had been made In meditations holy and sublime four hundred forty five Yet something of a girlish child like gloss Of novelty survived for scenes like these Enjoyment haply handed down from times When at a country playhouse some rude barn Tricked out for that proud use if I perchance four hundred fifty Caught on a summer evening through a chink In the old wall an unexpected glimpse Of daylight the bare thought of where I was Gladdened me more than if I had been led Into a dazzling cavern of romance four hundred fifty five Crowded with Genii busy among works Not to be looked at by the common sun The matter that detains us now may seem To many neither dignified enough Nor arduous yet will not be scorned by them four hundred sixty Who looking inward have observed the ties That bind the perishable hours of life Each to the other and the curious props By which the world of memory and thought Exists and is sustained More lofty themes four hundred sixty five Such as at least do wear a prouder face Solicit our regard but when I think Of these I feel the imaginative power Languish within me even then it slept When pressed by tragic sufferings the heart four hundred seventy Was more than full amid my sobs and tears It slept even in the pregnant season of youth For though I was most passionately moved And yielded to all changes of the scene With an obsequious promptness yet the storm four hundred seventy five Passed not beyond the suburbs of the mind Save when realities of act and mien The incarnation of the spirits that move In harmony amid the Poet s world Rose to ideal grandeur or called forth four hundred eighty By power of contrast made me recognise As at a glance the things which I had shaped And yet not shaped had seen and scarcely seen When having closed the mighty Shakespeare s page I mused and thought and felt in solitude four hundred eighty five Pass we from entertainments that are such Professedly to others titled higher Yet in the estimate of youth at least More near akin to those than names imply I mean the brawls of lawyers in their courts four hundred ninety Before the ermined judge or that great stage X Where senators tongue favoured men perform Admired and envied Oh the beating heart When one among the prime of these rose up One of whose name from childhood we had heard four hundred ninety five Familiarly a household term like those The Bedfords Glosters Salsburys of old Whom the fifth Harry talks of Y Silence hush This is no trifler no short flighted wit No stammerer of a minute painfully five hundred Delivered No the Orator hath yoked The Hours like young Aurora to his car Thrice welcome Presence how can patience e er Grow weary of attending on a track That kindles with such glory All are charmed five hundred five Astonished like a hero in romance He winds away his never ending horn Words follow words sense seems to follow sense What memory and what logic till the strain Transcendent superhuman as it seemed five hundred ten Grows tedious even in a young man s ear Genius of Burke forgive the pen seduced By specious wonders and too slow to tell Of what the ingenuous what bewildered men Beginning to mistrust their boastful guides five hundred fifteen And wise men willing to grow wiser caught Rapt auditors from thy most eloquent tongue Now mute for ever mute in the cold grave I see him old but Vigorous in age Stand like an oak whose stag horn branches start five hundred twenty Out of its leafy brow the more to awe The younger brethren of the grove But some While he forewarns denounces launches forth Against all systems built on abstract rights Keen ridicule the majesty proclaims five hundred twenty five Of Institutes and Laws hallowed by time Declares the vital power of social ties Endeared by Custom and with high disdain Exploding upstart Theory insists Upon the allegiance to which men are born five hundred thirty Some say at once a froward multitude Murmur for truth is hated where not loved As the winds fret within the AEolian cave Galled by their monarch s chain The times were big With ominous change which night by night provoked five hundred thirty five Keen struggles and black clouds of passion raised But memorable moments intervened When Wisdom like the Goddess from Jove s brain Broke forth in armour of resplendent words Startling the Synod Could a youth and one five hundred forty In ancient story versed whose breast had heaved Under the weight of classic eloquence Sit see and hear unthankful uninspired Nor did the Pulpit s oratory fail To achieve its higher triumph Not unfelt five hundred forty five Were its admonishments nor lightly heard The awful truths delivered thence by tongues Endowed with various power to search the soul Yet ostentation domineering oft Poured forth harangues how sadly out of place five hundred fifty There have I seen a comely bachelor Fresh from a toilette of two hours ascend His rostrum with seraphic glance look up And in a tone elaborately low Beginning lead his voice through many a maze five hundred fifty five A minuet course and winding up his mouth From time to time into an orifice Most delicate a lurking eyelet small And only not invisible again Open it out diffusing thence a smile five hundred sixty Of rapt irradiation exquisite Meanwhile the Evangelists Isaiah Job Moses and he who penned the other day The Death of Abel Z Shakespeare and the Bard Whose genius spangled o er a gloomy theme five hundred sixty five With fancies thick as his inspiring stars a And Ossian doubt not tis the naked truth Summoned from streamy Morven b each and all Would in their turns lend ornaments and flowers To entwine the crook of eloquence that helped five hundred seventy This pretty Shepherd pride of all the plains To rule and guide his captivated flock I glance but at a few conspicuous marks Leaving a thousand others that in hall Court theatre conventicle or shop five hundred seventy five In public room or private park or street Each fondly reared on his own pedestal Looked out for admiration Folly vice Extravagance in gesture mien and dress And all the strife of singularity five hundred eighty Lies to the ear and lies to every sense Of these and of the living shapes they wear There is no end Such candidates for regard Although well pleased to be where they were found I did not hunt after nor greatly prize five hundred eighty five Nor made unto myself a secret boast Of reading them with quick and curious eye But as a common produce things that are To day to morrow will be took of them Such willing note as on some errand bound five hundred ninety That asks not speed a Traveller might bestow On sea shells that bestrew the sandy beach Or daisies swarming through the fields of June But foolishness and madness in parade Though most at home in this their dear domain five hundred ninety five Are scattered everywhere no rarities Even to the rudest novice of the Schools Me rather it employed to note and keep In memory those individual sights Of courage or integrity or truth six hundred Or tenderness which there set off by foil Appeared more touching One will I select A Father for he bore that sacred name Him saw I sitting in an open square Upon a corner stone of that low wall six hundred five Wherein were fixed the iron pales that fenced A spacious grass plot there in silence sate This One Man with a sickly babe outstretched Upon his knee whom he had thither brought For sunshine and to breathe the fresher air six hundred ten Of those who passed and me who looked at him He took no heed but in his brawny arms The Artificer was to the elbow bare And from his work this moment had been stolen He held the child and bending over it six hundred fifteen As if he were afraid both of the sun And of the air which he had come to seek Eyed the poor babe with love unutterable As the black storm upon the mountain top Sets off the sunbeam in the valley so six hundred twenty That huge fermenting mass of human kind Serves as a solemn back ground or relief To single forms and objects whence they draw For feeling and contemplative regard More than inherent liveliness and power six hundred twenty five How oft amid those overflowing streets Have I gone forward with the crowd and said Unto myself The face of every one That passes by me is a mystery Thus have I looked nor ceased to look oppressed six hundred thirty By thoughts of what and whither when and how Until the shapes before my eyes became A second sight procession such as glides Over still mountains or appears in dreams And once far travelled in such mood beyond six hundred thirty five The reach of common indication lost Amid the moving pageant I was smitten Abruptly with the view a sight not rare Of a blind Beggar who with upright face Stood propped against a wall upon his chest six hundred forty Wearing a written paper to explain His story whence he came and who he was Caught by the spectacle my mind turned round As with the might of waters an apt type This label seemed of the utmost we can know six hundred forty five Both of ourselves and of the universe And on the shape of that unmoving man His steadfast face and sightless eyes I gazed As if admonished from another world Though reared upon the base of outward things six hundred fifty Structures like these the excited spirit mainly Builds for herself scenes different there are Full formed that take with small internal help Possession of the faculties the peace That comes with night the deep solemnity six hundred fifty five Of nature s intermediate hours of rest When the great tide of human life stands still The business of the day to come unborn Of that gone by locked up as in the grave The blended calmness of the heavens and earth six hundred sixty Moonlight and stars and empty streets and sounds Unfrequent as in deserts at late hours Of winter evenings when unwholesome rains Are falling hard with people yet astir The feeble salutation from the voice six hundred sixty five Of some unhappy woman now and then Heard as we pass when no one looks about Nothing is listened to But these I fear Are falsely catalogued things that are are not As the mind answers to them or the heart six hundred seventy Is prompt or slow to feel What say you then To times when half the city shall break out Full of one passion vengeance rage or fear To executions to a street on fire Mobs riots or rejoicings From these sights six hundred seventy five Take one that ancient festival the Fair Holden where martyrs suffered in past time And named of saint Bartholomew c there see A work completed to our hands that lays If any spectacle on earth can do six hundred eighty The whole creative powers of man asleep For once the Muse s help will we implore And she shall lodge us wafted on her wings Above the press and danger of the crowd Upon some showman s platform What a shock six hundred eighty five For eyes and ears what anarchy and din Barbarian and infernal a phantasma Monstrous in colour motion shape sight sound Below the open space through every nook Of the wide area twinkles is alive six hundred ninety With heads the midway region and above Is thronged with staring pictures and huge scrolls Dumb proclamations of the Prodigies With chattering monkeys dangling from their poles And children whirling in their roundabouts six hundred ninety five With those that stretch the neck and strain the eyes And crack the voice in rivalship the crowd Inviting with buffoons against buffoons Grimacing writhing screaming him who grinds The hurdy gurdy at the fiddle weaves seven hundred Rattles the salt box thumps the kettle drum And him who at the trumpet puffs his cheeks The silver collared Negro with his timbrel Equestrians tumblers women girls and boys Blue breeched pink vested with high towering plumes seven hundred five All moveables of wonder from all parts Are here Albinos painted Indians Dwarfs The Horse of knowledge and the learned Pig The Stone eater the man that swallows fire Giants Ventriloquists the Invisible Girl seven hundred ten The Bust that speaks and moves its goggling eyes The Wax work Clock work all the marvellous craft Of modern Merlins Wild Beasts Puppet shows All out o the way far fetched perverted things All freaks of nature all Promethean thoughts seven hundred fifteen Of man his dullness madness and their feats All jumbled up together to compose A Parliament of Monsters Tents and Booths Meanwhile as if the whole were one vast mill Are vomiting receiving on all sides seven hundred twenty Men Women three years Children Babes in arms Oh blank confusion true epitome Of what the mighty City is herself To thousands upon thousands of her sons Living amid the same perpetual whirl seven hundred twenty five Of trivial objects melted and reduced To one identity by differences That have no law no meaning and no end Oppression under which even highest minds Must labour whence the strongest are not free d seven hundred thirty But though the picture weary out the eye By nature an unmanageable sight It is not wholly so to him who looks In steadiness who hath among least things An under sense of greatest sees the parts seven hundred thirty five As parts but with a feeling of the whole This of all acquisitions first awaits On sundry and most widely different modes Of education nor with least delight On that through which I passed Attention springs seven hundred forty And comprehensiveness and memory flow From early converse with the works of God Among all regions chiefly where appear Most obviously simplicity and power Think how the everlasting streams and woods seven hundred forty five Stretched and still stretching far and wide exalt The roving Indian on his desert sands What grandeur not unfelt what pregnant show Of beauty meets the sun burnt Arab s eye And as the sea propels from zone to zone seven hundred fifty Its currents magnifies its shoals of life Beyond all compass spreads and sends aloft Armies of clouds even so its powers and aspects Shape for mankind by principles as fixed The views and aspirations of the soul seven hundred fifty five To majesty Like virtue have the forms Perennial of the ancient hills nor less The changeful language of their countenances Quickens the slumbering mind and aids the thoughts However multitudinous to move seven hundred sixty With order and relation This if still As hitherto in freedom I may speak Not violating any just restraint As may be hoped of real modesty This did I feel in London s vast domain seven hundred sixty five The Spirit of Nature was upon me there The soul of Beauty and enduring Life Vouchsafed her inspiration and diffused Through meagre lines and colours and the press Of self destroying transitory things

discordant opposition strong And gorgeous as the colours side by side Bedded among rich plumes of tropic birds And mountains over all embracing all ninety five And all the landscape endlessly enriched With waters running falling or asleep But lovelier far than this the paradise Where I was reared H in Nature s primitive gifts Favoured no less and more to every sense one hundred Delicious seeing that the sun and sky The elements and seasons as they change Do find a worthy fellow labourer there Man free man working for himself with choice Of time and place and object by his wants one hundred five His comforts native occupations cares Cheerfully led to individual ends Or social and still followed by a train Unwooed unthought of even simplicity And beauty and inevitable grace one hundred ten Yea when a glimpse of those imperial bowers Would to a child be transport over great When but a half hour s roam through such a place Would leave behind a dance of images That shall break in upon his sleep for weeks one hundred fifteen Even then the common haunts of the green earth And ordinary interests of man Which they embosom all without regard As both may seem are fastening on the heart Insensibly each with the other s help one hundred twenty For me when my affections first were led From kindred friends and playmates to partake Love for the human creature s absolute self That noticeable kindliness of heart Sprang out of fountains there abounding most one hundred twenty five Where sovereign Nature dictated the tasks And occupations which her beauty adorned And Shepherds were the men that pleased me first I Not such as Saturn ruled mid Latian wilds With arts and laws so tempered that their lives one hundred thirty Left even to us toiling in this late day A bright tradition of the golden age K Not such as mid Arcadian fastnesses Sequestered handed down among themselves Felicity in Grecian song renowned L one hundred thirty five Nor such as when an adverse fate had driven From house and home the courtly band whose fortunes Entered with Shakespeare s genius the wild woods Of Arden amid sunshine or in shade Culled the best fruits of Time s uncounted hours one hundred forty Ere Phoebe sighed for the false Ganymede M Or there where Perdita and Florizel Together danced Queen of the feast and King N Nor such as Spenser fabled True it is That I had heard what he perhaps had seen one hundred forty five Of maids at sunrise bringing in from far Their May bush O and along the streets in flocks Parading with a song of taunting rhymes Aimed at the laggards slumbering within doors Had also heard from those who yet remembered one hundred fifty Tales of the May pole dance and wreaths that decked Porch door way or kirk pillar O and of youths Each with his maid before the sun was up By annual custom issuing forth in troops To drink the waters of some sainted well one hundred fifty five And hang it round with garlands Love survives But for such purpose flowers no longer grow The times too sage perhaps too proud have dropped These lighter graces and the rural ways And manners which my childhood looked upon one hundred sixty Were the unluxuriant produce of a life Intent on little but substantial needs Yet rich in beauty beauty that was felt But images of danger and distress Man suffering among awful Powers and Forms one hundred sixty five Of this I heard and saw enough to make Imagination restless nor was free Myself from frequent perils nor were tales Wanting the tragedies of former times Hazards and strange escapes of which the rocks one hundred seventy Immutable and overflowing streams Where er I roamed were speaking monuments Smooth life had flock and shepherd in old time Long springs and tepid winters on the banks Of delicate Galesus P and no less one hundred seventy five Those scattered along Adria s myrtle shores Q Smooth life had herdsman and his snow white herd To triumphs and to sacrificial rites Devoted on the inviolable stream Of rich Clitumnus R and the goat herd lived one hundred eighty As calmly underneath the pleasant brows Of cool Lucretilis S where the pipe was heard Of Pan Invisible God thrilling the rocks With tutelary music from all harm The fold protecting I myself mature one hundred eighty five In manhood then have seen a pastoral tract Like one of these where Fancy might run wild Though under skies less generous less serene There for her own delight had Nature framed A pleasure ground diffused a fair expanse one hundred ninety Of level pasture islanded with groves And banked with woody risings but the Plain T Endless here opening widely out and there Shut up in lesser lakes or beds of lawn And intricate recesses creek or bay one hundred ninety five Sheltered within a shelter where at large The shepherd strays a rolling hut his home Thither he comes with spring time there abides All summer and at sunrise ye may hear His flageolet to liquid notes of love two hundred Attuned or sprightly fife resounding far Nook is there none nor tract of that vast space Where passage opens but the same shall have In turn its visitant telling there his hours In unlaborious pleasure with no task two hundred five More toilsome than to carve a beechen bowl For spring or fountain which the traveller finds When through the region he pursues at will His devious course A glimpse of such sweet life I saw when from the melancholy walls two hundred ten Of Goslar once imperial I renewed My daily walk along that wide champaign U That reaching to her gates spreads east and west And northwards from beneath the mountainous verge Of the Hercynian forest V Yet hail to you two hundred fifteen Moors mountains headlands and ye hollow vales Ye long deep channels for the Atlantic s voice W Powers of my native region Ye that seize The heart with firmer grasp Your snows and streams Ungovernable and your terrifying winds two hundred twenty That howl so dismally for him who treads Companionless your awful solitudes There tis the shepherd s task the winter long To wait upon the storms of their approach Sagacious into sheltering coves he drives two hundred twenty five His flock and thither from the homestead bears A toilsome burden up the craggy ways And deals it out their regular nourishment Strewn on the frozen snow And when the spring Looks out and all the pastures dance with lambs two hundred thirty And when the flock with warmer weather climbs Higher and higher him his office leads To watch their goings whatsoever track The wanderers choose For this he quits his home At day spring and no sooner doth the sun two hundred thirty five Begin to strike him with a fire like heat Than he lies down upon some shining rock And breakfasts with his dog When they have stolen As is their wont a pittance from strict time For rest not needed or exchange of love two hundred forty Then from his couch he starts and now his feet Crush out a livelier fragrance from the flowers Of lowly thyme by Nature s skill enwrought In the wild turf the lingering dews of morn Smoke round him as from hill to hill he hies two hundred forty five His staff protending like a hunter s spear Or by its aid leaping from crag to crag And o er the brawling beds of unbridged streams Philosophy methinks at Fancy s call Might deign to follow him through what he does two hundred fifty Or sees in his day s march himself he feels In those vast regions where his service lies A freeman wedded to his life of hope And hazard and hard labour interchanged With that majestic indolence so dear two hundred fifty five To native man A rambling school boy thus I felt his presence in his own domain As of a lord and master or a power Or genius under Nature under God Presiding and severest solitude two hundred sixty Had more commanding looks when he was there When up the lonely brooks on rainy days Angling I went or trod the trackless hills By mists bewildered X suddenly mine eyes Have glanced upon him distant a few steps two hundred sixty five In size a giant stalking through thick fog His sheep like Greenland bears or as he stepped Beyond the boundary line of some hill shadow His form hath flashed upon me glorified By the deep radiance of the setting sun two hundred seventy Or him have I descried in distant sky A solitary object and sublime Above all height like an aerial cross Stationed alone upon a spiry rock Of the Chartreuse for worship Y Thus was man two hundred seventy five Ennobled outwardly before my sight And thus my heart was early introduced To an unconscious love and reverence Of human nature hence the human form To me became an index of delight two hundred eighty Of grace and honour power and worthiness Meanwhile this creature spiritual almost As those of books but more exalted far Far more of an imaginative form Than the gay Corin of the groves Z who lives two hundred eighty five For his own fancies or to dance by the hour In coronal with Phyllis in the midst Z Was for the purposes of kind a man With the most common husband father learned Could teach admonish suffered with the rest two hundred ninety From vice and folly wretchedness and fear Of this I little saw cared less for it But something must have felt Call ye these appearances Which I beheld of shepherds in my youth This sanctity of Nature given to man two hundred ninety five A shadow a delusion ye who pore On the dead letter miss the spirit of things Whose truth is not a motion or a shape Instinct with vital functions but a block Or waxen image which yourselves have made three hundred And ye adore But blessed be the God Of Nature and of Man that this was so That men before my inexperienced eyes Did first present themselves thus purified Removed and to a distance that was fit three hundred five And so we all of us in some degree Are led to knowledge wheresoever led And howsoever were it otherwise And we found evil fast as we find good In our first years or think that it is found three hundred ten How could the innocent heart bear up and live But doubly fortunate my lot not here Alone that something of a better life Perhaps was round me than it is the privilege Of most to move in but that first I looked three hundred fifteen At Man through objects that were great or fair First communed with him by their help And thus Was founded a sure safeguard and defence Against the weight of meanness selfish cares Coarse manners vulgar passions that beat in three hundred twenty On all sides from the ordinary world In which we traffic Starting from this point I had my face turned toward the truth began With an advantage furnished by that kind Of prepossession without which the soul three hundred twenty five Receives no knowledge that can bring forth good No genuine insight ever comes to her From the restraint of over watchful eyes Preserved I moved about year after year Happy a and now most thankful that my walk three hundred thirty Was guarded from too early intercourse With the deformities of crowded life And those ensuing laughters and contempts Self pleasing which if we would wish to think With a due reverence on earth s rightful lord three hundred thirty five Here placed to be the inheritor of heaven Will not permit us but pursue the mind That to devotion willingly would rise Into the temple and the temple s heart Yet deem not Friend that human kind with me three hundred forty Thus early took a place pre eminent Nature herself was at this unripe time But secondary to my own pursuits And animal activities and all Their trivial pleasures b and when these had drooped three hundred forty five And gradually expired and Nature prized For her own sake became my joy even then b And upwards through late youth until not less Than two and twenty summers had been told c Was Man in my affections and regards three hundred fifty Subordinate to her her visible forms And viewless agencies a passion she A rapture often and immediate love Ever at hand he only a delight Occasional an accidental grace three hundred fifty five His hour being not yet come Far less had then The inferior creatures beast or bird attuned My spirit to that gentleness of love Though they had long been carefully observed Won from me those minute obeisances three hundred sixty Of tenderness d which I may number now With my first blessings Nevertheless on these The light of beauty did not fall in vain Or grandeur circumfuse them to no end But when that first poetic faculty three hundred sixty five Of plain Imagination and severe No longer a mute influence of the soul Ventured at some rash Muse s earnest call To try her strength among harmonious words e And to book notions and the rules of art three hundred seventy Did knowingly conform itself there came Among the simple shapes of human life A wilfulness of fancy and conceit e And Nature and her objects beautified These fictions as in some sort in their turn three hundred seventy five They burnished her From touch of this new power Nothing was safe the elder tree that grew Beside the well known charnel house had then A dismal look the yew tree had its ghost That took his station there for ornament three hundred eighty The dignities of plain occurrence then Were tasteless and truth s golden mean a point Where no sufficient pleasure could be found Then if a widow staggering with the blow Of her distress was known to have turned her steps three hundred eighty five To the cold grave in which her husband slept One night or haply more than one through pain Or half insensate impotence of mind The fact was caught at greedily and there She must be visitant the whole year through three hundred ninety Wetting the turf with never ending tears Through quaint obliquities I might pursue These cravings when the fox glove one by one Upwards through every stage of the tall stem Had shed beside the public way its bells three hundred ninety five And stood of all dismantled save the last Left at the tapering ladder s top that seemed To bend as doth a slender blade of grass Tipped with a rain drop Fancy loved to seat Beneath the plant despoiled but crested still four hundred With this last relic soon itself to fall Some vagrant mother whose arch little ones All unconcerned by her dejected plight Laughed as with rival eagerness their hands Gathered the purple cups that round them lay four hundred five Strewing the turf s green slope A diamond light Whene er the summer sun declining smote A smooth rock wet with constant springs was seen Sparkling from out a copse clad bank that rose Fronting our cottage f Oft beside the hearth four hundred ten Seated with open door often and long Upon this restless lustre have I gazed That made my fancy restless as itself Twas now for me a burnished silver shield Suspended over a knight s tomb who lay four hundred fifteen Inglorious buried in the dusky wood An entrance now into some magic cave Or palace built by fairies of the rock Nor could I have been bribed to disenchant The spectacle by visiting the spot four hundred twenty Thus wilful Fancy in no hurtful mood Engrafted far fetched shapes on feelings bred By pure Imagination busy Power g She was and with her ready pupil turned Instinctively to human passions then four hundred twenty five Least understood Yet mid the fervent swarm Of these vagaries with an eye so rich As mine was through the bounty of a grand And lovely region h I had forms distinct To steady me each airy thought revolved four hundred thirty Round a substantial centre which at once Incited it to motion and controlled I did not pine like one in cities bred As was thy melancholy lot dear Friend i Great Spirit as thou art in endless dreams four hundred thirty five Of sickliness disjoining joining things Without the light of knowledge Where the harm If when the woodman languished with disease Induced by sleeping nightly on the ground Within his sod built cabin Indian wise four hundred forty I called the pangs of disappointed love And all the sad etcetera of the wrong To help him to his grave Meanwhile the man If not already from the woods retired To die at home was haply as I knew four hundred forty five Withering by slow degrees mid gentle airs Birds running streams and hills so beautiful On golden evenings while the charcoal pile Breathed up its smoke an image of his ghost Or spirit that full soon must take her flight four hundred fifty Nor shall we not be tending towards that point Of sound humanity to which our Tale Leads though by sinuous ways if here I shew How Fancy in a season when she wove Those slender cords to guide the unconscious Boy four hundred fifty five For the Man s sake could feed at Nature s call Some pensive musings which might well beseem Maturer years A grove there is whose boughs Stretch from the western marge of Thurston mere k With length of shade so thick that whoso glides four hundred sixty Along the line of low roofed water moves As in a cloister Once while in that shade Loitering I watched the golden beams of light Flung from the setting sun as they reposed In silent beauty on the naked ridge four hundred sixty five Of a high eastern hill thus flowed my thoughts In a pure stream of words fresh from the heart Dear native Regions m wheresoe er shall close My mortal course there will I think on you Dying will cast on you a backward look four hundred seventy Even as this setting sun albeit the Vale Is no where touched by one memorial gleam Doth with the fond remains of his last power Still linger and a farewell lustre sheds On the dear mountain tops where first he rose four hundred seventy five Enough of humble arguments recal My Song those high emotions which thy voice Has heretofore made known that bursting forth Of sympathy inspiring and inspired When everywhere a vital pulse was felt four hundred eighty And all the several frames of things like stars Through every magnitude distinguishable Shone mutually indebted or half lost Each in the other s blaze a galaxy Of life and glory In the midst stood Man four hundred eighty five Outwardly inwardly contemplated As of all visible natures crown though born Of dust and kindred to the worm a Being Both in perception and discernment first In every capability of rapture four hundred ninety Through the divine effect of power and love As more than anything we know instinct With godhead and by reason and by will Acknowledging dependency sublime Ere long the lonely mountains left I moved four hundred ninety five Begirt from day to day with temporal shapes Of vice and folly thrust upon my view Objects of sport and ridicule and scorn Manners and characters discriminate And little bustling passions that eclipse five hundred As well they might the impersonated thought The idea or abstraction of the kind An idler among academic bowers Such was my new condition as at large Has been set forth n yet here the vulgar light five hundred five Of present actual superficial life Gleaming through colouring of other times Old usages and local privilege Was welcome softened if not solemnised This notwithstanding being brought more near five hundred ten To vice and guilt forerunning wretchedness I trembled thought at times of human life With an indefinite terror and dismay Such as the storms and angry elements Had bred in me but gloomier far a dim five hundred fifteen Analogy to uproar and misrule Disquiet danger and obscurity It might be told but wherefore speak of things Common to all that seeing I was led Gravely to ponder judging between good five hundred twenty And evil not as for the mind s delight But for her guidance one who was to act As sometimes to the best of feeble means I did by human sympathy impelled And through dislike and most offensive pain five hundred twenty five Was to the truth conducted of this faith Never forsaken that by acting well And understanding I should learn to love The end of life and every thing we know Grave Teacher stern Preceptress for at times five hundred thirty Thou canst put on an aspect most severe London to thee I willingly return Erewhile my verse played idly with the flowers Enwrought upon thy mantle satisfied With that amusement and a simple look five hundred thirty five Of child like inquisition now and then Cast upwards on thy countenance to detect Some inner meanings which might harbour there But how could I in mood so light indulge Keeping such fresh remembrance of the day five hundred forty When having thridded the long labyrinth Of the suburban villages I first Entered thy vast dominion o On the roof Of an itinerant vehicle I sate With vulgar men about me trivial forms five hundred forty five Of houses pavement streets of men and things Mean shapes on every side but at the instant When to myself it fairly might be said The threshold now is overpast how strange That aught external to the living mind five hundred fifty Should have such mighty sway yet so it was A weight of ages did at once descend Upon my heart no thought embodied no Distinct remembrances but weight and power Power growing under weight alas I feel five hundred fifty five That I am trifling twas a moment s pause All that took place within me came and went As in a moment yet with Time it dwells And grateful memory as a thing divine The curious traveller who from open day five hundred sixty Hath passed with torches into some huge cave The Grotto of Antiparos p or the Den In old time haunted by that Danish Witch Yordas q he looks around and sees the vault Widening on all sides sees or thinks he sees five hundred sixty five Erelong the massy roof above his head That instantly unsettles and recedes Substance and shadow light and darkness all Commingled making up a canopy Of shapes and forms and tendencies to shape five hundred seventy That shift and vanish change and interchange Like spectres ferment silent and sublime That after a short space works less and less Till every effort every motion gone The scene before him stands in perfect view five hundred seventy five Exposed and lifeless as a written book But let him pause awhile and look again And a new quickening shall succeed at first Beginning timidly then creeping fast Till the whole cave so late a senseless mass five hundred eighty Busies the eye with images and forms Boldly assembled here is shadowed forth From the projections wrinkles cavities A variegated landscape there the shape Of some gigantic warrior clad in mail five hundred eighty five The ghostly semblance of a hooded monk Veiled nun or pilgrim resting on his staff Strange congregation yet not slow to meet Eyes that perceive through minds that can inspire Even in such sort had I at first been moved five hundred ninety Nor otherwise continued to be moved As I explored the vast metropolis Fount of my country s destiny and the world s That great emporium chronicle at once And burial place of passions and their home five hundred ninety five Imperial their chief living residence With strong sensations teeming as it did Of past and present such a place must needs Have pleased me seeking knowledge at that time Far less than craving power yet knowledge came six hundred Sought or unsought and influxes of power Came of themselves or at her call derived In fits of kindliest apprehensiveness From all sides when whate er was in itself Capacious found or seemed to find in me six hundred five A correspondent amplitude of mind Such is the strength and glory of our youth The human nature unto which I felt That I belonged and reverenced with love Was not a punctual presence but a spirit six hundred ten Diffused through time and space with aid derived Of evidence from monuments erect Prostrate or leaning towards their common rest In earth the widely scattered wreck sublime Of vanished nations or more clearly drawn six hundred fifteen From books and what they picture and record Tis true the history of our native land With those of Greece compared and popular Rome And in our high wrought modern narratives Stript of their harmonising soul the life six hundred twenty Of manners and familiar incidents Had never much delighted me And less Than other intellects had mine been used To lean upon extrinsic circumstance Of record or tradition but a sense six hundred twenty five Of what in the Great City had been done And suffered and was doing suffering still Weighed with me could support the test of thought And in despite of all that had gone by Or was departing never to return six hundred thirty There I conversed with majesty and power Like independent natures Hence the place Was thronged with impregnations like the Wilds In which my early feelings had been nursed Bare hills and valleys full of caverns rocks six hundred thirty five And audible seclusions dashing lakes Echoes and waterfalls and pointed crags That into music touch the passing wind Here then my young imagination found No uncongenial element could here six hundred forty Among new objects serve or give command Even as the heart s occasions might require To forward reason s else too scrupulous march The effect was still more elevated views Of human nature Neither vice nor guilt six hundred forty five Debasement undergone by body or mind Nor all the misery forced upon my sight Misery not lightly passed but sometimes scanned Most feelingly could overthrow my trust In what we may become induce belief six hundred fifty That I was ignorant had been falsely taught A solitary who with vain conceits Had been inspired and walked about in dreams From those sad scenes when meditation turned Lo every thing that was indeed divine six hundred fifty five Retained its purity inviolate Nay brighter shone by this portentous gloom Set off such opposition as aroused The mind of Adam yet in Paradise Though fallen from bliss when in the East he saw six hundred sixty r Darkness ere day s mid course and morning light More orient in the western cloud that drew O er the blue firmament a radiant white Descending slow with something heavenly fraught Add also that among the multitudes six hundred sixty five Of that huge city oftentimes was seen Affectingly set forth more than elsewhere Is possible the unity of man One spirit over ignorance and vice Predominant in good and evil hearts six hundred seventy One sense for moral judgments as one eye For the sun s light The soul when smitten thus By a sublime idea whencesoe er Vouchsafed for union or communion feeds On the pure bliss and takes her rest with God six hundred seventy five Thus from a very early age O Friend My thoughts by slow gradations had been drawn To human kind and to the good and ill Of human life Nature had led me on And oft amid the busy hum I seemed s six hundred eighty To travel independent of her help As if I had forgotten her but no The world of human kind outweighed not hers In my habitual thoughts the scale of love Though filling daily still was light compared six hundred eighty five With that in which her mighty objects lay VARIANTS ON THE TEXT Variant one which MS letter to

Footnote f It is difficult to say where this smooth rock wet with constant springs and the copse clad bank were There is no copse clad bank fronting Anne Tyson s cottage at Hawkshead It may have been a rock on the wooded slope of the rounded hill that rises west of Cowper Ground north west of Hawkshead A rock wet with springs existed there till it was quarried for road metal a few years since But it is quite possible that the cottage referred to is Dove Cottage Grasmere In that case the rock and copse clad bank may have been on Loughrigg or more probably on Silver How The summer sun goes down behind Silver How so that it might smite a wet rock either on Hammar Scar or on the wooded crags above Red Bank These could be seen from the window of one of the rooms of Dove Cottage Seated beside the hearth of the half kitchen and half parlour fire in that cottage and looking along the passage through the low door the eye would rest on Hammar Scar the wooded hill behind Allan Bank The context of the poem points to Hawkshead but the details of the description suggest the Grasmere cottage rather than Anne Tyson s Ed Footnote g See the distinction drawn by Wordsworth between Fancy and

lines may be transcribed Dear native regions I foretell From what I feel at this farewell That wheresoe er my steps may tend And whensoe er my course shall end If in that hour a single tie Survive of local sympathy My soul will cast the backward view The longing look alone on you Thus while the Sun sinks down to rest Far in the regions of the west Though to the vale no parting beam Be given not one memorial gleam A lingering light he fondly throws On the dear hills where first he rose The Fenwick note to this poem is as follows The beautiful image with which this poem concludes suggested itself to me while I was resting in a boat along with my companions under the shade of a magnificent row of sycamores which then extended their branches from the shore of the promontory upon with stands the ancient and at that time the more picturesque Hall of Coniston There is nothing in either poem definitely to connect Thurstonmere with Coniston although their identity is suggested by the Fenwick note I find however that Thurston was the ancient name of Coniston and this carries us back to the time of the worship of Thor See Lewis s Topographical Dictionary of England vol i p six

But now relinquishing the scrip and staff And all enjoyment which the summer sun Sheds round the steps of those who meet the day With motion constant as his own I went Prepared to sojourn in a pleasant town C forty Washed by the current of the stately Loire Through Paris lay my readiest course and there Sojourning a few days I visited In haste each spot of old or recent fame The latter chiefly from the field of Mars forty five Down to the suburbs of saint Antony And from Mont Martyr southward to the Dome Of Genevieve D In both her clamorous Halls The National Synod and the Jacobins I saw the Revolutionary Power fifty Toss like a ship at anchor rocked by storms E The Arcades I traversed in the Palace huge Of Orleans F coasted round and round the line Of Tavern Brothel Gaming house and Shop Great rendezvous of worst and best the walk fifty five Of all who had a purpose or had not I stared and listened with a stranger s ears To Hawkers and Haranguers hubbub wild And hissing Factionists with ardent eyes In knots or pairs or single Not a look sixty Hope takes or Doubt or Fear is forced to wear But seemed there present and I scanned them all Watched every gesture uncontrollable Of anger and vexation and despite All side by side and struggling face to face sixty five With gaiety and dissolute idleness Where silent zephyrs sported with the dust Of the Bastille I sate in the open sun And from the rubbish gathered up a stone And pocketed the relic G in the guise seventy Of an enthusiast yet in honest truth I looked for something that I could not find Affecting more emotion than I felt For tis most certain that these various sights However potent their first shock with me seventy five Appeared to recompense the traveller s pains Less than the painted Magdalene of Le Brun H A beauty exquisitely wrought with hair Dishevelled gleaming eyes and rueful cheek Pale and bedropped with everflowing tears eighty But hence to my more permanent abode I hasten there by novelties in speech Domestic manners customs gestures looks And all the attire of ordinary life Attention was engrossed and thus amused eighty five I stood mid those concussions unconcerned Tranquil almost and careless as a flower Glassed in a green house or a parlour shrub That spreads its leaves in unmolested peace While every bush and tree the country through ninety Is shaking to the roots indifference this Which may seem strange but I was unprepared With needful knowledge had abruptly passed Into a theatre whose stage was filled And busy with an action far advanced ninety five Like others I had skimmed and sometimes read With care the master pamphlets of the day Nor wanted such half insight as grew wild Upon that meagre soil helped out by talk And public news but having never seen one hundred A chronicle that might suffice to show Whence the main organs of the public power Had sprung their transmigrations when and how Accomplished giving thus unto events A form and

earnest dialogues I slipped in thought And let remembrance steal to other times When o er those interwoven roots moss clad four hundred forty And smooth as marble or a waveless sea Some Hermit from

wandered on With that revered companion And sometimes four hundred sixty five When to a convent in a meadow green By a brook side we came a roofless pile And not by reverential touch of Time Dismantled but by violence abrupt In spite of those heart bracing colloquies four hundred seventy In spite of real fervour and of that Less genuine and wrought up within myself I could not but bewail a wrong so harsh And for the Matin bell to sound no more Grieved and the twilight taper and the cross four hundred seventy five High on the topmost pinnacle a sign How welcome to the weary traveller s

sustenance while the girl with pallid hands Was busy knitting in a heartless mood five hundred fifteen Of solitude and at the sight my friend In agitation said Tis against that That we are fighting I

Loire I paused and cast Upon his rich domains vineyard and tilth Green meadow ground and many coloured woods Again and yet again a farewell look Then from the quiet of that scene passed on ten Bound to the fierce Metropolis A From his throne The King had fallen B and that invading host Presumptuous cloud on whose black front was written The tender mercies of the dismal wind That bore it on the plains of Liberty fifteen Had burst innocuous Say in bolder words They who had come elate as eastern hunters Banded beneath the Great Mogul when he Erewhile went forth from Agra or Lahore Rajahs and Omrahs C in his train intent twenty To drive their prey enclosed within a ring Wide as a province but the signal given Before the point of the life threatening spear Narrowing itself by moments they rash men Had seen the anticipated quarry turned twenty five Into avengers from whose wrath they fled In terror Disappointment and dismay Remained for all whose fancies had run wild With evil

crushed Spared not the empty throne and in proud haste Assumed the body and venerable name forty Of a Republic D Lamentable crimes Tis true had gone before this hour dire work Of massacre E in which the senseless sword Was prayed to as a judge but these were past Earth free from them for ever as was thought forty five Ephemeral monsters to be seen but once Things that could only show themselves and die Cheered with this hope to Paris I returned F And ranged with ardour heretofore unfelt The spacious city and in progress passed fifty The prison where the unhappy Monarch lay Associate with his

dead upon the dying heaped and gazed On this and other spots as doth a man Upon a volume whose contents he knows Are memorable but from him locked up sixty Being written in a tongue he cannot read So that he questions the mute leaves with pain And half upbraids their silence But that night I felt most deeply in what world I was What ground I trod on and what air I breathed sixty five High was my room and lonely near the roof Of a large mansion or hotel a lodge That would have pleased me in more quiet times Nor was it wholly without pleasure then With unextinguished taper I kept watch seventy Reading at intervals the fear gone by Pressed on me almost like a fear to come I thought of those September massacres Divided from me by one little month H Saw them and touched the rest was conjured up seventy five From tragic fictions or true history Remembrances and dim admonishments The horse is taught his manage and no star Of wildest course but treads back his own steps For the spent hurricane the air provides eighty As fierce a successor the tide retreats But to return out of its hiding place In the great deep all things have second birth The earthquake is not satisfied at once And in this way I wrought upon myself eighty five Until I seemed to hear a voice that cried To the whole city Sleep no more The trance Fled with the voice to which it had given birth But vainly comments of a calmer mind Promised soft peace and sweet forgetfulness ninety The place all hushed and silent as it was Appeared unfit for the repose of night Defenceless as a wood where tigers roam With early morning towards the Palace walk Of Orleans eagerly I turned as yet ninety five The streets were still not so those long Arcades There mid a peal of ill matched sounds and cries That greeted me on entering I could hear Shrill voices from the hawkers in the throng Bawling Denunciation of the Crimes one hundred Of Maximilian Robespierre the hand Prompt as the voice held forth a printed speech The same that had been recently pronounced When Robespierre not ignorant for what mark Some words of indirect reproof had been one hundred five Intended rose in hardihood and dared The man who had an ill surmise of him To bring his charge in openness whereat When a dead pause ensued and no one stirred In silence of all present from his seat one hundred ten Louvet walked single through the avenue And took his station in the Tribune saying I Robespierre accuse thee I Well is known The inglorious issue of that charge and how He who had launched the startling thunderbolt one hundred fifteen The one bold man whose voice the attack had sounded Was left without a follower to discharge His perilous duty and retire lamenting That Heaven s best aid is wasted upon men Who to themselves are false K But these are things one hundred twenty Of which I speak only as they were storm Or sunshine to my individual mind No further Let me then relate that now In some sort seeing with my proper eyes That Liberty and Life and Death would soon one hundred twenty five To the remotest corners of the land Lie in the arbitrement of those who ruled The capital City what was struggled for And by what combatants victory must be won The indecision on their part whose aim one hundred thirty Seemed best and the straightforward path of those Who in attack or in defence were strong Through their impiety my inmost soul Was agitated yea I could almost Have prayed that throughout earth upon all men one hundred thirty five By patient exercise of reason made Worthy of liberty all spirits filled With zeal expanding in Truth s holy light The gift of tongues might fall and power arrive From the four quarters of the winds to do one hundred forty For France what without help she could not do A work of honour think not that to this I added work of safety from all doubt Or trepidation for the end of things Far was I far as angels are from guilt one hundred forty five Yet did I grieve nor only grieved but thought Of opposition and of remedies An insignificant stranger and obscure And one moreover little graced with power Of eloquence even in my native speech one hundred fifty And all unfit for tumult or intrigue Yet would I at this time with willing heart Have undertaken for a cause so great Service however dangerous I revolved How much the destiny of Man had still one hundred fifty

humblest eyes one hundred sixty That Man is only weak through his mistrust And want of hope where evidence divine Proclaims to him that hope should be most sure Nor did the inexperience of my youth Preclude conviction that a spirit strong one hundred sixty five In hope and trained to noble aspirations A spirit thoroughly faithful to itself Is for Society s unreasoning herd A domineering instinct serves at once For way and guide a fluent receptacle one hundred seventy That gathers up each petty straggling rill And vein of water glad to be rolled on In safe obedience that a mind whose rest Is where it ought to be in self restraint In circumspection and simplicity one hundred seventy five Falls rarely in entire discomfiture Below its aim or meets with from without A treachery that foils it or defeats And lastly if the means on human will Frail human will dependent should betray one hundred eighty Him who too boldly trusted them I felt That mid the loud distractions of the world A sovereign voice subsists within the soul Arbiter undisturbed of right and wrong Of life and death in majesty severe one hundred eighty five Enjoining as may best promote the aims Of truth and justice either sacrifice From whatsoever region of our cares Or our infirm affections Nature pleads Earnest and blind against the stern decree one hundred ninety On the other side I called to mind those truths That are the common places of the schools A theme for boys too hackneyed for their sires Yet with a revelation s liveliness In all their comprehensive bearings known one hundred ninety five And visible to philosophers of old Men who to business of the world untrained Lived in the shade and to Harmodius known And his compeer Aristogiton L known To Brutus that tyrannic power is weak two hundred Hath neither gratitude nor faith nor love Nor the support of good or evil men To trust in that the godhead which is ours Can never utterly be charmed or stilled That nothing hath a natural right to last two hundred five But equity and reason that all else Meets foes irreconcilable and at best Lives only by variety of disease Well might my wishes be intense my thoughts Strong and perturbed not doubting at that time two hundred ten But that the virtue of one paramount mind Would have abashed those impious crests have quelled Outrage and bloody power and in despite Of what the People long had been and were Through ignorance and false teaching sadder proof two hundred fifteen Of immaturity and in the teeth Of desperate opposition from without Have cleared a passage for just government And left a solid birthright to the State Redeemed according to example given two hundred twenty By ancient lawgivers In this frame of mind Dragged by a chain of harsh necessity So seemed it now I thankfully acknowledge Forced by the gracious providence of Heaven To England I returned M else though assured two hundred twenty five That I both was and must be of small weight No better than a landsman on the deck Of a ship struggling with a hideous storm Doubtless I should have then made common cause With some who perished haply perished too N two hundred thirty A poor mistaken and bewildered offering Should to the breast of Nature have gone back With all my resolutions all my hopes A Poet only to myself to men Useless and even beloved Friend a soul two hundred thirty five To thee unknown Twice had the trees let fall Their leaves as often Winter had put on His hoary crown since I had seen the surge Beat against Albion s shore O since ear of mine Had caught the accents of my native speech two hundred forty Upon our native country s sacred ground A patriot of the world how could I glide Into communion with her sylvan shades Erewhile my tuneful haunt It pleased me more To abide in the great City P where I found two hundred forty five The general air still busy with the stir Of that first memorable onset made By a strong levy of humanity Upon the traffickers in Negro blood Q Effort which though defeated had recalled two hundred fifty To notice old forgotten principles And through the nation spread a novel heat Of virtuous feeling For myself I own That this particular strife had wanted power To rivet my affections nor did now two hundred fifty five Its unsuccessful issue much excite My sorrow for I brought with me the faith That if France prospered good men would not long Pay fruitless worship to humanity And this most rotten branch of human shame two hundred sixty Object so seemed it of superfluous pains Would fall together with its parent tree What then were my emotions when in arms Britain put forth her free born strength in league Oh pity and shame with those confederate Powers two hundred sixty five Not in my single self alone I found But in the minds of all ingenuous youth Change and subversion from that hour No shock Given to my moral nature had I known Down to that very moment neither lapse two hundred seventy Nor turn of sentiment that might be named A revolution save at this one time All else was progress on the self same path On which with a diversity of pace I had been travelling this a stride at once two hundred seventy five Into another region As a light And pliant harebell swinging in the breeze On some grey rock its birth place so had I Wantoned fast rooted on the ancient tower Of my beloved country wishing not two hundred eighty A happier fortune than to wither there Now was I from that pleasant station torn And tossed about in whirlwind I rejoiced Yea afterwards truth most painful to record Exulted in the triumph of my soul two hundred eighty five When Englishmen by thousands were o erthrown Left without glory on the field or driven Brave hearts to shameful flight It was a grief Grief call it not twas anything but that A conflict of sensations without name two hundred ninety Of which he only who may love the sight Of a village steeple as I do can judge When in the congregation bending all To their great Father prayers were offered up Or praises for our country s victories two hundred ninety five And mid the simple worshippers perchance I only like an uninvited guest Whom no one owned sate silent shall I add Fed on the day of vengeance yet to come Oh much have they to account for who could tear three hundred By violence at one decisive rent From the best youth in England their dear pride Their joy in England this too at a time In which worst losses easily might wean The best of names when patriotic love three hundred five Did of itself in modesty give way Like the Precursor when the Deity Is come Whose harbinger he was a time In which apostasy from ancient faith Seemed but conversion to a higher creed three hundred ten Withal a season dangerous and wild A time when sage Experience would have snatched Flowers out of any hedge row to compose A chaplet in contempt of his grey locks When the proud fleet that bears the red cross flag R three hundred fifteen In that unworthy service was prepared To mingle I beheld the vessels lie A brood of gallant creatures on the deep I saw them in their rest a sojourner Through a whole month of calm and glassy days three hundred twenty In that delightful island which protects Their place of convocation S there I heard Each evening pacing by the still sea shore A monitory sound that never failed The sunset cannon While the orb went down three hundred twenty five In the tranquillity of nature came That voice ill requiem seldom heard by me Without a spirit overcast by dark Imaginations sense of woes to come Sorrow for human kind and pain of heart three hundred thirty In France the men who for their desperate ends Had plucked up mercy by the roots were glad Of this new enemy Tyrants strong before In wicked pleas were strong as demons now And thus on every side beset with foes three hundred thirty five The goaded land waxed mad the crimes of few Spread into madness of the many blasts From hell came sanctified like airs from heaven The sternness of the just the faith of those Who doubted not that Providence had times three hundred forty Of vengeful retribution theirs who throned The human Understanding paramount And made of that their God T the hopes of men Who were content to barter short lived pangs For a paradise of ages the blind rage three hundred forty five Of insolent tempers the light vanity Of intermeddlers steady purposes Of the suspicious slips of the indiscreet And all the accidents of life were pressed Into one service busy with one work three hundred fifty The Senate stood aghast her prudence quenched Her wisdom stifled and her justice scared Her frenzy only active to extol Past outrages and shape the way for new Which no one dared to oppose or mitigate three hundred fifty five Domestic carnage now filled the whole year With feast days old men from the chimney nook The maiden from the bosom of her love The mother from the cradle of her babe The warrior from the field all perished all three hundred sixty Friends enemies of all parties ages ranks Head after head and never heads enough For those that bade them fall They found their joy They made it proudly eager as a child If like desires of innocent little ones three hundred sixty five May with such heinous appetites be compared Pleased in some open field to exercise A toy that mimics with revolving wings The motion of a wind mill though the air Do of itself blow fresh and make the vanes three hundred seventy Spin in his eyesight that contents him not But with the plaything at arm s length he sets His front against the blast and runs amain That it may whirl the faster Amid the depth Of those enormities even thinking minds three hundred seventy five Forgot at seasons whence they had their being Forgot that such a sound was ever heard As Liberty upon earth yet all beneath Her innocent authority was wrought Nor could have been without her blessed name three hundred eighty The illustrious wife of Roland in the hour Of her composure felt that agony And gave it vent in her last words U O Friend It was a lamentable time for man Whether a hope had e er been his or not three hundred eighty five A woful time for them whose hopes survived The shock most woful for those few who still Were flattered and had trust in human kind They had the deepest feeling of the grief Meanwhile the Invaders fared as they deserved three hundred ninety The Herculean Commonwealth had put forth her arms And throttled with an infant godhead s might The snakes about her cradle that was well And as it should be yet no cure for them Whose souls were sick with pain of what would be three hundred ninety five Hereafter brought in charge against mankind Most melancholy at that time O Friend Were my day thoughts my nights were miserable Through months through years long after the last beat Of those atrocities the hour of sleep four hundred To me came rarely charged with natural gifts Such ghastly visions had I of despair And tyranny and implements of death And innocent victims sinking under fear And momentary hope and worn out prayer four hundred five Each in his separate cell or penned in crowds For sacrifice and struggling with fond mirth And levity in dungeons where the dust Was laid with tears Then suddenly the scene Changed and the unbroken dream entangled me four hundred ten In long orations which I strove to plead Before unjust tribunals with a voice Labouring a brain confounded and a sense Death like of treacherous desertion felt In the last place of refuge my own soul four hundred fifteen When I began in youth s delightful prime To yield myself to Nature when that strong And holy passion overcame me first Nor day nor night evening or morn was free From its oppression But O Power Supreme four hundred twenty Without Whose call this world would cease to breathe Who from the fountain of Thy grace dost fill The veins that branch through every frame of life Making man what he is creature divine In single or in social eminence four hundred twenty five Above the rest raised infinite ascents When reason that enables him to be Is not sequestered what a change is here How different ritual for this after worship What countenance to promote this second love four hundred thirty The first was service paid to things which lie Guarded within the bosom of Thy will Therefore to serve was high beatitude Tumult was therefore gladness and the fear Ennobling venerable sleep secure four hundred thirty five And waking thoughts more rich than happiest dreams But as the ancient Prophets borne aloft In vision yet constrained by natural laws With them to take a troubled human heart Wanted not consolations nor a creed four hundred forty Of reconcilement then when they denounced On towns and cities wallowing in the abyss Of their offences punishment to come Or saw like other men with bodily eyes Before them in some desolated place four hundred forty five The wrath consummate and the threat fulfilled So with devout humility be it said So did a portion of that spirit fall On me uplifted from the vantage ground Of pity and sorrow to a state of being four hundred fifty That through the time s exceeding fierceness saw Glimpses of retribution terrible And in the order of sublime behests But even if that were not amid the awe Of unintelligible chastisement four hundred fifty five Not only acquiescences of faith Survived but daring sympathies with power Motions not treacherous or profane else why Within the folds of no ungentle breast Their dread vibration to this hour prolonged four hundred sixty Wild blasts of music thus could find their way Into the midst of turbulent events So that worst tempests might be listened to Then was the truth received into my heart That under heaviest sorrow earth can bring four hundred sixty five If from the affliction somewhere do not grow Honour which could not else have been a faith An elevation and a sanctity If new strength be not given nor old restored The blame is ours not Nature s When a taunt four hundred seventy Was taken up by scoffers in their pride Saying Behold the harvest that we reap From popular government and equality I clearly saw that neither these nor aught Of wild belief engrafted on their names four hundred seventy five By false philosophy had caused the woe But a terrific reservoir of guilt And ignorance rilled up from age to age That could no longer hold its loathsome charge But burst and spread in deluge through the land four hundred eighty And as the desert hath green spots the sea Small islands scattered amid stormy waves So that disastrous period did not want Bright sprinklings of all human excellence To which the silver wands of saints in Heaven four hundred eighty five Might point with rapturous joy Yet not the less For those examples in no age surpassed Of fortitude and energy and love And human nature faithful to herself Under worst trials was I driven to think four hundred ninety Of the glad times when first I traversed France A youthful pilgrim V above all reviewed That eventide when under windows bright With happy faces and with garlands hung And through a rainbow arch that spanned the street four hundred ninety five Triumphal pomp for liberty confirmed W I paced a dear companion at my side The town of Arras X whence with promise high Issued on delegation to sustain Humanity and right that Robespierre five hundred He who thereafter and in how short time Wielded the sceptre of the Atheist crew When the calamity spread far and wide And this same city that did then appear To outrun the rest in exultation groaned five hundred five Under the vengeance of her cruel son As Lear reproached the winds I could almost Have quarrelled with that blameless spectacle For lingering yet an image in my mind To mock me under such a strange reverse five hundred ten O Friend few happier moments have been mine Than that which told the downfall of this Tribe So dreaded so abhorred Y The day deserves A separate record Over the smooth sands Of Leven s ample estuary lay five hundred fifteen My journey and beneath a genial sun With distant prospect among gleams of sky And clouds and intermingling mountain tops In one inseparable glory clad Creatures of one ethereal substance met five hundred twenty In consistory like a diadem Or crown of burning seraphs as they sit In the empyrean Underneath that pomp Celestial lay unseen the pastoral vales Among whose happy fields I had grown up five hundred twenty five From childhood On the fulgent spectacle That neither passed away nor changed I gazed Enrapt but brightest things are wont to draw Sad opposites out of the inner heart As even their pensive influence drew from mine five hundred thirty How could it otherwise for not in vain That very morning had I turned aside To seek the ground where mid a throng of graves An honoured teacher of my youth was laid Z And on the stone were graven by his desire five hundred thirty five Lines from the churchyard elegy of Gray a This faithful guide speaking from his death bed Added no farewell to his parting counsel But said to me My head will soon lie low And when I saw the turf that covered him five hundred forty After the lapse of full eight years b those words With sound of voice and countenance of the Man Came back upon me so that some few tears Fell from me in my own despite But now I thought still traversing that widespread plain five hundred forty five With tender pleasure of the verses graven Upon his tombstone whispering to myself He loved the Poets and if now alive Would have loved me as one not destitute Of promise nor belying the kind hope five hundred fifty That he had formed when I at his command Began to spin with toil my earliest songs c As I advanced all that I saw or felt Was gentleness and peace Upon a small And rocky island near a fragment stood five hundred fifty five Itself like a sea rock the low remains With shells encrusted dark with briny weeds Of a dilapidated structure once A Romish chapel d where the vested priest Said matins at the hour that suited those five hundred sixty Who crossed the sands with ebb of morning tide Not far from that still ruin all the plain Lay spotted with a variegated crowd Of vehicles and travellers horse and foot Wading beneath the conduct of their guide five hundred sixty five In loose procession through the shallow stream Of inland waters the great sea meanwhile Heaved at safe distance far retired I paused Longing for skill to paint a scene so bright And cheerful but the foremost of the band five hundred seventy As he approached no salutation given In the familiar language of the day Cried Robespierre is dead nor was a doubt After strict question left within my mind That he and his supporters all were fallen five hundred seventy five Great was my transport deep my gratitude To everlasting Justice by this fiat Made manifest Come now ye golden times Said I forth pouring on those open sands A hymn of triumph as the morning comes five hundred eighty From out the bosom of the night come ye Thus far our trust is verified behold They who with clumsy desperation brought A river of Blood and preached that nothing else Could cleanse the Augean stable by the might five hundred eighty five Of their own helper have been swept away Their madness stands declared and visible Elsewhere will safety now be sought and earth March firmly towards righteousness and peace Then schemes I framed more calmly when and how five hundred ninety The madding factions might be tranquillised And how through hardships manifold and long The glorious renovation would proceed Thus interrupted by uneasy bursts Of exultation I pursued my way five hundred ninety five Along that very shore which I had skimmed In former days when spurring from the Vale Of Nightshade and saint Mary s mouldering fane e And the stone abbot after circuit made In wantonness of heart a joyous band six hundred Of school boys hastening to their distant home Along the margin of the moonlight sea We beat with thundering hoofs the level sand f FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT Footnote A

concluded From that time forth A Authority in France Put on a milder face Terror had ceased Yet every thing was wanting that might give Courage to them who looked for good by light Of rational Experience for the shoots five And hopeful blossoms of a second spring Yet in me confidence was unimpaired The Senate s language and the public acts And measures of the Government though both Weak and of heartless omen had not power ten To daunt me in the People was my trust And in the virtues which mine eyes had seen one I knew that wound external could not take Life from the young Republic that new foes Would only follow in the path of shame fifteen Their brethren and her triumphs be in the end Great universal irresistible This intuition led me to confound One victory with another higher far Triumphs of unambitious peace at home twenty And noiseless fortitude Beholding still Resistance strong as heretofore I thought That what was in degree the same was likewise The same in quality that as the worse Of the two spirits then at strife remained twenty five Untired the better surely would preserve The heart that first had roused him Youth maintains In all conditions of society Communion more direct and intimate With Nature hence ofttimes with reason too thirty Than age or manhood even To Nature then Power had reverted habit custom law Had left an interregnum s open space For her to move about in uncontrolled Hence could I see how Babel like their task thirty five Who by the recent deluge stupified With their whole souls went culling from the day Its petty promises to build a tower For their own safety laughed with my compeers At gravest heads by enmity to France forty Distempered till they found in every blast Forced from the street disturbing newsman s horn For her great cause record or prophecy Of utter ruin How might we believe That wisdom could in any shape come near forty five Men clinging to delusions so insane And thus experience proving that no few Of our opinions had been just we took Like credit to ourselves where less was due And thought that other notions were as sound fifty Yea could not but be right because we saw That foolish men opposed them To a strain More animated I might here give way And tell since juvenile errors are my theme What in those days through Britain was performed fifty five To turn all judgments out of their right course But this is passion over near ourselves Reality too close and too intense And intermixed with something in my mind Of scorn and condemnation personal sixty That would profane the sanctity of verse Our Shepherds this say merely at that time Acted or seemed at least to act like men Thirsting to make the guardian crook of law A tool of murder B they who ruled the State sixty five Though with such awful proof before their eyes That he who would sow death reaps death or worse And can reap nothing better child like longed To imitate not wise enough to avoid Or left by mere timidity betrayed seventy The plain straight road for one no better chosen Than if their wish had been to undermine Justice and make an end of Liberty B But from these bitter truths I must return To my own history It hath been told seventy five That I was led to take an eager part In arguments of civil polity Abruptly and indeed before my time I had approached like other youths the shield Of human nature from the golden side eighty And would have fought even to the death to attest The quality of the metal which I saw What there is best in individual man Of wise in passion and sublime in power Benevolent in small societies eighty five And great in large ones I had oft revolved Felt deeply but not thoroughly understood By reason nay far from it they were yet As cause was given me afterwards to learn Not proof against the injuries of the day ninety Lodged only at the sanctuary s door Not safe within its bosom Thus prepared And with such general insight into evil And of the bounds which sever it from good As books and common intercourse with life ninety five Must needs have given to the inexperienced mind When the world travels in a beaten road Guide faithful as is needed I began To meditate with ardour on the rule And management of nations what it is one hundred And ought to be and strove to learn how far Their power or weakness wealth or poverty Their happiness or misery depends Upon their laws and fashion of the State O pleasant exercise of hope and joy C one hundred five For mighty were the auxiliars which then stood Upon our side us who were strong in love Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive But to be young was very Heaven D O times In which the meagre stale forbidding ways one hundred ten Of custom law and statute took at once The attraction of a country in romance When Reason seemed the most to assert her rights When most intent on making of herself A prime enchantress to assist the work one hundred fifteen Which then was going forward in her name Not favoured spots alone but the whole Earth The beauty wore of promise that which sets As at some moments might not be unfelt Among the bowers of Paradise itself one hundred twenty The budding rose above the rose full blown What temper at the prospect did not wake To happiness unthought of The inert Were roused and lively natures rapt away They who had fed their childhood upon dreams one hundred twenty five The play fellows of fancy who had made All powers of swiftness subtilty and strength Their ministers who in lordly wise had stirred Among the grandest objects of the sense And dealt with whatsoever they found there one hundred thirty As if they had within some lurking right To wield it they too who of gentle mood Had watched all gentle motions and to these Had fitted their own thoughts schemers more mild And in the region of their peaceful selves one hundred thirty five Now was it that both found the meek and lofty Did both find helpers to their hearts desire And stuff at hand plastic as they could wish Were called upon to exercise their skill Not in Utopia subterranean fields one hundred forty Or some secreted island Heaven knows where But in the very world which is the world Of all of us the place where in the end We find our happiness or not at all Why should I not confess that Earth was then one hundred forty five To me what an inheritance new fallen Seems when the first time visited to one Who thither comes to find in it his home He walks about and looks upon the spot With cordial transport moulds it and remoulds one hundred fifty And is half pleased with things that are amiss Twill be such joy to see them disappear An active partisan I thus convoked From every object pleasant circumstance To suit my ends I moved among mankind one hundred fifty five With genial feelings still predominant When erring erring on the better part And in the kinder spirit placable Indulgent as not uninformed that men See as they have been taught Antiquity one hundred sixty Gives rights to error and aware no less That throwing off oppression must be work As well of License as of Liberty And above all for this was more than all Not caring if the wind did now and then one hundred sixty five Blow keen upon an eminence that gave Prospect so large into futurity In brief a child of Nature as at first Diffusing only those affections wider That from the cradle had grown up with me one hundred seventy And losing in no other way than light Is lost in light the weak in the more strong In the main outline such it might be said Was my condition till with open war Britain opposed the liberties of France E one hundred seventy five This threw me first out of the pale of love Soured and corrupted upwards to the source My sentiments was not as hitherto A swallowing up of lesser things in great But change of them into their contraries one hundred eighty And thus a way was opened for mistakes And false conclusions in degree as gross In kind more dangerous What had been a pride Was now a shame my likings and my loves Ran in new channels leaving old ones dry one hundred eighty five And hence a blow that in maturer age Would but have touched the judgment struck more deep Into sensations near the heart meantime As from the first wild theories were afloat To whose pretensions sedulously urged one hundred ninety I had but lent a careless ear assured That time was ready to set all things right And that the multitude so long oppressed Would be oppressed no more But when events Brought less encouragement and unto these one hundred ninety five The immediate proof of principles no more Could be entrusted while the events themselves Worn out in greatness stripped of novelty Less occupied the mind and sentiments Could through my understanding s natural growth two hundred No longer keep their ground by faith maintained Of inward consciousness and hope that laid Her hand upon her object evidence Safer of universal application such As could not be impeached was sought elsewhere two hundred five But now become oppressors in their turn Frenchmen had changed a war of self defence For one of conquest F losing sight of all Which they had struggled for now mounted up Openly in the eye of earth and heaven two hundred ten The scale of liberty I read her doom With anger vexed with disappointment sore But not dismayed nor taking to the shame Of a false prophet While resentment rose Striving to hide what nought could heal the wounds two hundred fifteen Of mortified presumption I adhered More firmly to old tenets and to prove Their temper strained them more and thus in heat Of contest did opinions every day Grow into consequence till round my mind two hundred twenty They clung as if they were its life nay more The very being of the immortal soul This was the time when all things tending fast To depravation speculative schemes That promised to abstract the hopes of Man two hundred twenty five Out of his feelings to be fixed thenceforth For ever in a purer element Found ready welcome Tempting region that For Zeal to enter and refresh herself Where passions had the privilege to work two hundred thirty And never hear the sound of their own names But speaking more in charity the dream Flattered the young pleased with extremes nor least With that which makes our Reason s naked self The object of its fervour What delight two hundred thirty five How glorious in self knowledge and self rule To look through all the frailties of the world And with a resolute mastery shaking off Infirmities of nature time and place Build social upon personal Liberty two hundred forty Which to the blind restraints of general laws Superior magisterially adopts One guide the light of circumstances flashed Upon an independent intellect Thus expectation rose again thus hope two hundred forty five From her first ground expelled grew proud once more Oft as my thoughts were turned to human kind I scorned indifference but inflamed with thirst Of a secure intelligence and sick Of other longing I pursued what seemed two hundred fifty A more exalted nature wished that Man Should start out of his earthy worm like state And spread abroad the wings of Liberty Lord of himself in undisturbed delight A noble aspiration yet I feel two hundred fifty five Sustained by worthier as by wiser thoughts The aspiration nor shall ever cease To feel it but return we to our course Enough tis true could such a plea excuse Those aberrations had the clamorous friends two hundred sixty Of ancient Institutions said and done To bring disgrace upon their very names Disgrace of which custom and written law And sundry moral sentiments as props Or emanations of those institutes two hundred sixty five Too justly bore a part A veil had been Uplifted why deceive ourselves in sooth Twas even so and sorrow for the man Who either had not eyes wherewith to see Or seeing had forgotten A strong shock two hundred seventy Was given to old opinions all men s minds Had felt its power and mine was both let loose Let loose and goaded After what hath been Already said of patriotic love Suffice it here to add that somewhat stern two hundred seventy five In temperament withal a happy man And therefore bold to look on painful things Free likewise of the world and thence more bold I summoned my best skill and toiled intent To anatomise the frame of social life two hundred eighty Yea the whole body of society Searched to its heart Share with me Friend the wish That some dramatic tale endued with shapes Livelier and flinging out less guarded words Than suit the work we fashion might set forth two hundred eighty five What then I learned or think I learned of truth And the errors into which I fell betrayed By present objects and by reasonings false From their beginnings inasmuch as drawn Out of a heart that had been turned aside two hundred ninety From Nature s way by outward accidents And which was thus confounded more and more Misguided and misguiding So I fared Dragging all precepts judgments maxims creeds Like culprits to the bar calling the mind two hundred ninety five Suspiciously to establish in plain day Her titles and her honours now believing Now disbelieving endlessly perplexed With impulse motive right and wrong the ground Of obligation what the rule and whence three hundred The sanction till demanding formal proof And seeking it in every thing I lost All feeling of conviction and in fine Sick wearied out with contrarieties Yielded up moral questions in despair three hundred five This was the crisis of that strong disease This the soul s last and lowest ebb I drooped Deeming our blessed reason of least use Where wanted most The lordly attributes Of will and choice I bitterly exclaimed three hundred ten What are they but a mockery of a Being Who hath in no concerns of his a test Of good and evil knows not what to fear Or hope for what to covet or to shun And who if those could be discerned would yet three hundred fifteen Be little profited would see and ask Where is the obligation to enforce And to acknowledged law rebellious still As selfish passion urged would act amiss The dupe of folly or the slave of crime three hundred twenty Depressed bewildered thus I did not walk With scoffers seeking light and gay revenge From indiscriminate laughter nor sate down In reconcilement with an utter waste Of intellect such sloth I could not brook three hundred twenty five Too well I loved in that my spring of life Pains taking thoughts and truth their dear reward But turned to abstract science and there sought Work for the reasoning faculty enthroned Where the disturbances of space and time three hundred thirty Whether in matters various properties Inherent or from human will and power Derived find

admonition like a brook I That did but cross a lonely road and now Is seen heard felt and caught at every turn Companion never lost through many a league three hundred forty Maintained for me a saving intercourse With my true self for though bedimmed and changed Much as it seemed I was no further changed Than as a clouded and a waning moon She whispered still that brightness would return three hundred forty five She in the midst of all preserved me still A Poet made me seek beneath that name And that alone my office upon earth And lastly as hereafter will be shown If willing audience fail not Nature s self three hundred fifty By all varieties of human love Assisted led me back through opening day To those sweet counsels between head and heart Whence grew that genuine knowledge fraught

retinue Hath dropped all functions by the gods bestowed And turned into a gewgaw a machine Sets like an Opera phantom Thus O Friend three hundred seventy Through times of honour and through times of

reanimating influence lost Of memory to virtue lost and hope three hundred ninety Though with the wreck of loftier years bestrewn But indignation works where hope is not And thou O Friend wilt be refreshed There is One great society alone on earth The noble Living and the noble Dead three hundred ninety five Thine be such converse strong and sanative A ladder for thy spirit to reascend To

sorrow disappointment vexing thoughts Confusion of the judgment zeal decayed five And lastly utter loss of hope itself And things to hope for Not with these began Our song and not with these our song must end Ye motions of delight that haunt the sides Of the green hills ye breezes and soft airs ten Whose subtle intercourse with breathing flowers Feelingly watched might teach Man s haughty race How without injury to take to give Without offence A ye who as if to show The wondrous influence of power gently used fifteen Bend the complying heads of lordly pines And with a touch shift the stupendous clouds Through the whole compass of the sky ye brooks Muttering along the stones a busy noise By day a quiet sound in silent night twenty Ye waves that out of the great deep steal forth In a calm hour to kiss the pebbly shore Not mute and then retire fearing no storm And you ye groves whose ministry it is To interpose the covert of your shades twenty five Even as a sleep between the heart of man And outward troubles between man himself Not seldom and his own uneasy heart Oh that I had a music and a voice Harmonious as your own that I might tell thirty What ye have done for me The morning shines Nor heedeth Man s perverseness Spring returns I saw the Spring return and could rejoice In common with the children of her love Piping on boughs or sporting on fresh fields thirty five Or boldly seeking pleasure nearer heaven On wings that navigate cerulean skies So neither were complacency nor peace Nor tender yearnings wanting for my good Through these distracted times in Nature still forty Glorying I found a counterpoise in her Which when the spirit of evil reached its height Maintained for me a secret happiness This narrative my Friend hath chiefly told Of intellectual power fostering love forty five Dispensing truth and over men and things Where reason yet might hesitate diffusing Prophetic sympathies of genial faith So was I favoured such my happy lot Until that natural graciousness of mind fifty Gave way to overpressure from the times And their disastrous issues What availed When spells forbade the voyager to land That fragrant notice of a pleasant shore Wafted at intervals from many a bower fifty five Of blissful gratitude and fearless love Dare I avow that wish was mine to see And hope that future times would surely see The man to come parted as by a gulph From him who had been that I could no more sixty Trust the elevation which had made me one With the great family that still survives To illuminate the abyss of ages past Sage warrior patriot hero for it seemed That their best virtues were not free from taint sixty five Of something false and weak that could not stand The open eye of Reason Then I said Go to the Poets they will speak to thee More perfectly of purer creatures yet If reason be nobility in man seventy Can aught be more ignoble than the man Whom they delight in blinded as he is By prejudice the miserable slave Of low ambition or distempered love In such strange passion if I may once more seventy five Review the past I warred against myself A bigot to a new idolatry Like a cowled monk who hath forsworn the world Zealously laboured to cut off my heart From all the sources of her former strength eighty And as by simple waving of a wand The wizard instantaneously dissolves Palace or grove even so could I unsoul As readily by syllogistic words Those mysteries of being which have made eighty five And shall continue evermore to make Of the whole human race one brotherhood What wonder then if to a mind so far Perverted even the visible Universe Fell under the dominion of a taste ninety Less spiritual with microscopic view Was scanned as I had scanned the moral world O Soul of Nature excellent and fair That didst rejoice with me with whom I too Rejoiced through early youth before the winds ninety five And roaring waters and in lights and shades That marched and countermarched about the hills In glorious apparition Powers on whom I daily waited now all eye and now All ear but never long without the heart one hundred Employed and man s unfolding intellect O Soul of Nature that by laws divine Sustained and governed still dost overflow With an impassioned life what feeble ones Walk on this earth how feeble have I been one hundred five When thou wert in thy strength Nor this through stroke Of human suffering such as justifies Remissness and inaptitude of mind But through presumption even in pleasure pleased Unworthily disliking here and there one hundred ten Liking by rules of mimic art transferred To things above all art but more for this Although a strong infection of the age Was never much my habit giving way To a comparison of scene with scene one hundred fifteen Bent overmuch on superficial things Pampering myself with meagre novelties Of colour and proportion to the moods Of time and season to the moral power The affections and the spirit of the place one hundred twenty Insensible Nor only did the love Of sitting thus in judgment interrupt My deeper feelings but another cause More subtle and less easily explained That almost seems inherent in the creature one hundred twenty five A twofold frame of body and of mind I speak in recollection of a time When the bodily eye in every stage of life The most despotic of our senses gained Such strength in me as often held my mind one hundred thirty In absolute dominion Gladly here Entering upon abstruser argument Could I endeavour to unfold the means Which Nature studiously employs to thwart This tyranny summons all the senses each one hundred thirty five To counteract the other and themselves And makes them all and the objects with which all Are conversant subservient in their turn To the great ends of Liberty and Power But leave we this enough that my delights one hundred forty Such as they were were sought insatiably Vivid the transport vivid though not profound I roamed from hill to hill from rock to rock Still craving combinations of new forms New pleasure wider empire for the sight one hundred forty five Proud of her own endowments and rejoiced To lay the inner faculties asleep Amid the turns and counterturns the strife And various trials of our complex being As we grow up such thraldom of that sense one hundred fifty Seems hard to shun And yet I knew a maid B A young enthusiast who escaped these bonds Her eye was not the mistress of her heart Far less did rules prescribed by passive taste Or barren intermeddling subtleties one hundred fifty five Perplex her mind but wise as women are When genial circumstance hath favoured them She welcomed what was given and craved no more Whate er the scene presented to her view That was the best to that she was attuned one hundred sixty By her benign simplicity of life And through a perfect happiness of soul Whose variegated feelings were in this Sisters that they were each some new delight Birds in the bower and lambs in the green field one hundred sixty five Could they have known her would have loved methought Her very presence such a sweetness breathed That flowers and trees and even the silent hills And every thing she looked on should have had An intimation how she bore herself one hundred seventy Towards them and to all creatures God delights In such a being for her common thoughts Are piety her life is gratitude Even like this maid before I was called forth From the retirement of my native hills one hundred seventy five I loved whate er I saw nor lightly loved But most intensely never dreamt of aught More grand more fair more exquisitely framed Than those few nooks to which my happy feet Were limited I had not at that time one hundred eighty Lived long enough nor in the least survived The first diviner influence of this world As it appears to unaccustomed eyes Worshipping then among the depth of things As piety ordained could I submit one hundred eighty five To measured admiration or to aught That should preclude humility and love I felt observed and pondered did not judge Yea never thought of judging with the gift Of all this glory filled and satisfied one hundred ninety And afterwards when through the gorgeous Alps Roaming I carried with me the same heart In truth the degradation howsoe er Induced effect in whatsoe er degree Of custom that prepares a partial scale one hundred ninety five In which the little oft outweighs the great Or any other cause that hath been named Or lastly aggravated by the times And their impassioned sounds which well might make The milder minstrelsies of rural scenes two hundred Inaudible was transient I had known Too forcibly too early in my life Visitings of imaginative power For this to last I shook the habit off Entirely and for ever and again two hundred five In Nature s presence stood as now I stand A sensitive being a creative soul There are in our existence spots of time That with distinct pre eminence retain A renovating virtue whence depressed two hundred ten By false opinion and contentious thought Or aught of heavier or more deadly weight In trivial occupations and the round Of ordinary intercourse our minds Are nourished and invisibly repaired two hundred fifteen A virtue by which pleasure is enhanced That penetrates enables us to mount When high more high and lifts us up when fallen This efficacious spirit chiefly lurks Among those passages of life that give two hundred twenty Profoundest knowledge to what point and how The mind is lord and master outward sense The obedient servant of her will Such moments Are scattered everywhere taking their date From our first childhood C I remember well two hundred twenty five That once while yet my inexperienced hand Could scarcely hold a bridle with proud hopes I mounted and we journeyed towards the hills D An ancient servant of my father s house Was with me my encourager and guide two hundred thirty We had not travelled long ere some mischance Disjoined me from my comrade and through fear Dismounting down the rough and stony moor I led my horse and stumbling on at length Came to a bottom where in former times two hundred thirty five A murderer had been hung in iron chains The gibbet mast had mouldered down the bones And iron case were gone but on the turf Hard by soon after that fell deed was wrought Some unknown hand had carved the murderer s name two hundred forty The monumental letters were inscribed In times long past but still from year to year By superstition of the neighbourhood The grass is cleared away and to this hour The characters are fresh and visible two hundred forty five A casual glance had shown them and I fled Faltering and faint and ignorant of the road Then reascending the bare common saw A naked pool that lay beneath the hills The beacon on the summit and more near two hundred fifty A girl who bore a pitcher on her head And seemed with difficult steps to force her way Against the blowing wind It was in truth An ordinary sight but I should need Colours and words that are unknown to man two hundred fifty five To paint the visionary dreariness Which while I looked all round for my lost guide Invested moorland waste and naked pool The beacon crowning the lone eminence The female and her garments vexed and tossed two hundred sixty By the strong wind When in the blessed hours Of early love the loved one at my side E I roamed in daily presence of this scene Upon the naked pool and dreary crags And on the melancholy beacon fell two hundred sixty five A spirit of pleasure and youth s golden gleam And think ye not with radiance more sublime For these remembrances and for the power They had left behind So feeling comes in aid Of feeling and diversity of strength two hundred seventy Attends us if but once we have been strong Oh mystery of man from what a depth Proceed thy honours I am lost but see In simple childhood something of the base On which thy greatness stands but this I feel two hundred seventy five That from thyself it comes that thou must give Else never canst receive The days gone by Return upon me almost from the dawn Of life the hiding places of man s power Open I would approach them but they close two hundred eighty I see by glimpses now when age comes on May scarcely see at all and I would give While yet we may as far as words can give Substance and life to what I feel enshrining Such is my hope the spirit of the Past two hundred eighty five For future restoration Yet another Of these memorials One Christmas time F On the glad eve of its dear holidays Feverish and tired and restless I went forth Into the fields impatient for the sight two hundred ninety Of those led palfreys that should bear us home My brothers and myself There rose a crag That from the meeting point of two highways F Ascending overlooked them both far stretched Thither uncertain on which road to fix two hundred ninety five My expectation thither I repaired Scout like and gained the summit twas a day Tempestuous dark and wild and on the grass I sate half sheltered by a naked wall Upon my right hand couched a single sheep three hundred Upon my left a blasted hawthorn stood With those companions at my side I watched Straining my eyes intensely as the mist Gave intermitting prospect of the copse And plain beneath Ere we to school returned three hundred five That dreary time ere we had been ten days Sojourners in my father s house he died And I and my three brothers orphans then Followed his body to the grave The event With all the sorrow that it brought appeared three hundred ten A chastisement and when I called to mind That day so lately past when from the crag I looked in such anxiety of hope With trite reflections of morality Yet in the deepest passion I bowed low three hundred fifteen To God Who thus corrected my desires And afterwards the wind and sleety rain And all the business of the elements The single sheep and the one blasted tree And the bleak music from that old stone wall three hundred twenty The noise of wood and water and the mist That on the line of each of those two roads Advanced in such indisputable shapes All these were kindred spectacles and sounds To which I oft repaired and thence would drink three hundred twenty five As at a fountain and on winter nights Down to this very time when storm and rain Beat on my roof or haply at noon day While in a grove I walk whose lofty trees Laden with summer s thickest foliage rock three hundred thirty In a strong wind some working of the spirit Some inward agitations thence are brought Whate er their office whether to beguile Thoughts over busy in the course they took Or animate an hour of vacant ease three hundred thirty five FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT Footnote A Compare Shakespeare s Stealing and giving odour Twelfth Night act I scene i l seven Ed Footnote B Mary Hutchinson Ed Footnote C Compare the Ode Intimations of Immortality stanzas v and ix Ed Footnote D Either amongst the Lorton Fells or the north western slopes of Skiddaw Ed Footnote E His sister Ed Footnote F The year was evidently seventeen eighty three but the locality is difficult to determine It may have been one or other of two places Wordsworth s father died at Penrith and it was there that the sons went for their Christmas holiday The road from Penrith to Hawkshead was by Kirkstone Pass and Ambleside and the led palfreys sent to take the boys home would certainly come through the latter town Now there are only two roads from Ambleside to Hawkshead which meet at a point about a mile north of Hawkshead called in the Ordnance map Outgate The eastern road is now chiefly used by carriages being less hilly and better made than the western one The latter would be quite as convenient as the former for horses If one were to walk out from Hawkshead village to the place where the two roads separate at Outgate and then ascend the ridge between them he would find several places from which he could overlook both roads far stretched were the view not now intercepted by numerous plantations The latter are of comparatively recent growth doctor Cradock to whom I am indebted for this and for many other suggestions as to localities alluded to by Wordsworth thinks that a point marked on the map as High Crag between the two roads and about three quarters of a mile from their point of divergence answers the description as well as any other It may be nearly two miles from Hawkshead a distance of which an active eager school boy would think nothing The blasted hawthorn and the naked wall are probably things of the past as much as the single sheep Doubtless this may be the spot a green rocky knoll with a steep face to the north where a quarry is wrought and with a plantation to the east It commands a view of both roads The other possible place is a crag not a quarter of a mile from Outgate a little to the right of the place where the two roads divide A low wall runs up across it to the top dividing a plantation of oak hazel and ash from the firs that crown the summit These firs which are larch and spruce seem all of this century The top of the crag may have been bare when Wordsworth lived at Hawkshead But at the foot of the path along the dividing wall there are a few probably older trees and a solitary walk beneath them at noon or dusk is almost as suggestive to the imagination as repose under the yews of Borrowdale listening to the mountain flood on Glaramara There one may still hear the bleak music from the old stone wall and the noise of wood and water while the loud dry wind whistles through the underwood or moans amid the fir trees of the Crag on the summit of which there is a blasted hawthorn tree It may be difficult now to determine the precise spot to which the boy Wordsworth climbed on that eventful day afterwards so significant to him and from the events of which he says he drank as at a fountain but I think it may have been to one or other of these two crags See however mister Rawnsley s conjecture in Note V in the Appendix to this volume p three hundred ninety one Ed BOOK THIRTEENTH IMAGINATION AND TASTE HOW IMPAIRED AND RESTORED concluded From Nature doth emotion come and moods Of calmness equally are Nature s gift This is her glory these two attributes Are sister horns that constitute her strength Hence Genius born to thrive by interchange five Of peace and excitation finds in her His best and purest friend from her receives That energy by which he seeks the truth From her that happy stillness of the mind Which fits him to receive it when unsought A ten Such benefit the humblest intellects Partake of each in their degree tis mine To speak what I myself have known and felt Smooth task for words find easy way inspired By gratitude and confidence in truth fifteen Long time in search of knowledge did I range The field of human life in heart and mind Benighted but the dawn beginning now To re appear twas proved that not in vain I had been taught to reverence a Power twenty That is the visible quality and shape And image of right reason that matures Her processes by steadfast laws gives birth To no impatient or fallacious hopes No heat of passion or excessive zeal twenty five No vain conceits provokes to no quick turns Of self applauding intellect but trains To meekness and exalts by humble faith Holds up before the mind intoxicate With present objects and the busy dance thirty Of things that pass away a temperate show Of objects that endure and by this course Disposes her when over fondly set On throwing off incumbrances to seek In man and in the frame of social life thirty five Whate er there is desirable and good Of kindred permanence unchanged in form And function or through strict vicissitude Of life and death revolving Above all Were re established now those watchful thoughts forty Which seeing little worthy or sublime In what the Historian s pen so much delights To blazon power and energy detached From moral purpose early tutored me To look with feelings of fraternal love forty five Upon the unassuming things that hold A silent station in this beauteous world Thus moderated thus composed I found Once more in Man an object of delight Of pure imagination and of love fifty And as the horizon of my mind enlarged Again I took the intellectual eye For my instructor studious more to see Great truths than touch and handle little ones Knowledge was given accordingly my trust fifty five Became more firm in feelings that had stood The test of such a trial clearer far My sense of excellence of right and wrong The promise of the present time retired Into its true proportion sanguine schemes sixty Ambitious projects pleased me less I sought For present good in life s familiar face And built thereon my hopes of good to come With settling judgments now of what would last And what would disappear prepared to find sixty five Presumption folly madness in the men Who thrust themselves upon the passive world As Rulers of the world to see in these Even when the public welfare is their aim Plans without thought or built on theories seventy Vague and unsound and having brought the books Of modern statists to their proper test Life human life with all its sacred claims Of sex and age and heaven descended rights Mortal or those beyond the reach of death seventy five And having thus discerned how dire a thing Is worshipped in that idol proudly named The Wealth of Nations where alone that wealth Is lodged and how increased and having gained A more judicious knowledge of the worth eighty And dignity of individual man No composition of the brain but man Of whom we read the man whom we behold With our own eyes I could not but inquire Not with less interest than heretofore eighty five But greater though in spirit more subdued Why is this glorious creature to be found One only in ten thousand What one is Why may not millions be What bars are thrown By Nature in the way of such a hope ninety Our animal appetites and daily wants Are these obstructions insurmountable If not then others vanish into air Inspect the basis of the social pile Inquire said I how much of mental power ninety five And genuine virtue they possess who live By bodily toil labour exceeding far Their due proportion under all the weight Of that injustice which upon ourselves Ourselves entail Such estimate to frame one hundred I chiefly looked what need to look beyond Among the natural abodes of men Fields with their rural works B recalled to mind My earliest notices with these compared The observations made in later youth one hundred five And to that day continued For the time Had never been when throes of mighty Nations And the world s tumult unto me could yield How far soe er transported and possessed Full measure of content but still I craved one hundred ten An intermingling of distinct regards And truths of individual sympathy Nearer ourselves Such often might be gleaned From the great City else it must have proved To me a heart depressing wilderness one hundred fifteen But much was wanting therefore did I turn To you ye pathways and ye lonely roads Sought you enriched with everything I prized With human kindnesses and simple joys Oh next to one dear state of bliss vouchsafed one hundred twenty Alas to few in this untoward world The bliss of walking daily in life s prime Through field or forest with the maid we love While yet our hearts are young while yet we breathe Nothing but happiness in some lone nook one hundred twenty five Deep vale or any where the home of both From which it would be misery to stir Oh next to such enjoyment of our youth In my esteem next to such dear delight Was that of wandering on from day to day one hundred thirty Where I could meditate in peace and cull Knowledge that step by step might lead me on To wisdom or as lightsome as a bird Wafted upon the wind from distant lands Sing notes of greeting to strange fields or groves one hundred thirty five Which lacked not voice to welcome me in turn And when that pleasant toil had ceased to please Converse with men where if we meet a face We almost meet a friend on naked heaths With long long ways before by cottage bench one hundred forty Or well spring where the weary traveller rests Who doth not love to follow with his eye The windings of a public way the sight Familiar object as it is hath wrought On my imagination since the morn one hundred forty five Of childhood when a disappearing line One daily present to my eyes that crossed The naked summit of a far off hill Beyond the limits that my feet had trod Was like an invitation into space one hundred fifty Boundless or guide into eternity C Yes something of the grandeur which invests The mariner who sails the roaring sea Through storm and darkness early in my mind Surrounded too the wanderers of the earth one hundred fifty five Grandeur as much and loveliness far more Awed have I been by strolling Bedlamites From many other uncouth vagrants passed In fear have walked with quicker step but why Take note of this When I began to enquire one hundred sixty To watch and question those I met and speak Without reserve to them the lonely roads Were open schools in which I daily read With most delight the passions of mankind Whether by words looks sighs or tears revealed one hundred sixty five There saw into the depth of human souls Souls that appear to have no depth at all To careless eyes And now convinced at heart How little those formalities to which With overweening trust alone we give one hundred seventy The name of Education have to do With real feeling and just sense how vain A correspondence with the talking world Proves to the most and called to make good search If man s estate by doom of Nature yoked one hundred seventy five With toil be therefore yoked with ignorance If virtue be indeed so hard to rear And intellectual strength so rare a boon I prized such walks still more for there I found Hope to my hope and to my pleasure peace one hundred eighty And steadiness and healing and repose To every angry passion There I heard From mouths of men obscure and lowly truths Replete with honour sounds in unison With loftiest promises of good and fair one hundred eighty five There are who think that strong affection love D Known by whatever name is falsely deemed A gift to use a term which they would use Of vulgar nature that its growth requires Retirement leisure language purified one hundred ninety By manners studied and elaborate That whoso feels such passion in its strength Must live within the very light and air Of courteous usages refined by art True is it where oppression worse than death one hundred ninety five Salutes the being at his birth where grace Of culture hath been utterly unknown And poverty and labour in excess From day to day pre occupy the ground Of the affections and to Nature s self two hundred Oppose a deeper nature there indeed Love cannot be nor does it thrive with ease Among the close and overcrowded haunts Of cities where the human heart is sick And the eye feeds it not and cannot feed two hundred five Yes in those wanderings deeply did I feel How we mislead each other above all How books mislead us seeking their reward From judgments of the wealthy Few who see By artificial lights how they debase two hundred ten The Many for the pleasure of those Few Effeminately level down the truth To certain general notions for the sake Of being understood at once or else Through want of better knowledge in the heads two hundred fifteen That framed them nattering self conceit with words That while they most ambitiously set forth Extrinsic differences the outward marks Whereby society has parted man From man neglect the universal heart two hundred twenty Here calling up to mind what then I saw A youthful traveller and see daily now In the familiar circuit of my home Here might I pause and bend in reverence To Nature and the power of human minds two hundred twenty five To men as they are men within themselves How oft high service is performed within When all the external man is rude in show Not like a temple rich with pomp and gold But a mere mountain chapel that protects two hundred thirty Its simple worshippers from sun and shower Of these said I shall be my song of these If future years mature me for the task Will I record the praises making verse Deal boldly with substantial things in truth two hundred thirty five And sanctity of passion speak of these That justice may be done obeisance paid Where it is due thus haply shall I teach Inspire through unadulterated ears Pour rapture tenderness and hope my theme two hundred forty No other than the very heart of man As found among the best of those who live Not unexalted by religious faith Nor uninformed by books good books though few In Nature s presence thence may I select two hundred forty five Sorrow that is not sorrow but delight And miserable love that is not pain To hear of for the glory that redounds Therefrom to human kind and what we are Be mine to follow with no timid step two hundred fifty Where knowledge leads me it shall be my pride That I have dared to tread this holy ground Speaking no dream but things oracular Matter not lightly to be heard by those Who to the letter of the outward promise two hundred fifty five Do read the invisible soul by men adroit In speech and for communion with the world Accomplished minds whose faculties are then Most active when they are most eloquent And elevated most when most admired two hundred sixty Men may be found of other mould than these Who are their own upholders to themselves Encouragement and energy and will Expressing liveliest thoughts in lively words As native passion dictates Others too two hundred sixty five There are among the walks of homely life Still higher men for contemplation framed Shy and unpractised in the strife of phrase Meek men whose very souls perhaps would sink Beneath them summoned to such intercourse two hundred seventy Theirs is the language of the heavens the power The thought the image and the silent joy Words are but under agents in their souls When they are grasping with their greatest strength They do not breathe among them this I speak two hundred seventy five In gratitude to God Who feeds our hearts For His own service knoweth loveth us When we are unregarded by the world Also about this time did I receive Convictions still more strong than heretofore two hundred eighty Not only that the inner frame is good And graciously composed but that no less Nature for all conditions wants not power To consecrate if we have eyes to see The outside of her creatures and to breathe two hundred eighty five Grandeur upon the very humblest face Of human life I felt that the array Of act and circumstance and visible form Is mainly to the pleasure of the mind What passion makes them that meanwhile the forms two hundred ninety Of Nature have a passion in themselves That intermingles with those works of man To which she summons him although the works Be mean have nothing lofty of their own And that the Genius of the Poet hence two hundred ninety five May boldly take his way among mankind Wherever Nature leads that he hath stood By Nature s side among the men of old And so shall stand for ever Dearest Friend If thou partake the animating faith three hundred That Poets even as Prophets each with each Connected in a mighty scheme of truth Have each his own peculiar

To a hope Not less ambitious once among the wilds Of Sarum s Plain E my youthful spirit was raised There as I ranged at will the pastoral downs three hundred fifteen Trackless and smooth or paced the bare white roads Lengthening in solitude their dreary line Time with his retinue of ages fled Backwards nor checked his flight until I saw Our dim ancestral Past in vision clear three hundred twenty Saw multitudes of men and here and there A single Briton clothed in wolf skin vest With shield and stone axe stride across the wold The voice of spears was heard the rattling spear Shaken by arms of mighty bone in strength three hundred twenty five Long mouldered of barbaric majesty I called on Darkness but before the word Was uttered midnight darkness seemed to take All objects from my sight and lo again The Desert visible by dismal flames three hundred thirty It is the sacrificial altar fed With living men how deep the groans the voice Of those that crowd the giant wicker thrills The monumental hillocks and the pomp Is for both worlds the living and the dead three hundred thirty five At other moments for through that wide waste Three summer days I roamed where er the Plain Was figured o er with circles lines or mounds F That yet survive a work as some divine Shaped by the Druids so to represent three hundred forty Their knowledge of the heavens and image forth The constellations gently was I charmed Into a waking dream a reverie That with believing eyes where er I turned Beheld long bearded teachers with white wands three hundred forty five Uplifted pointing to the starry sky Alternately and plain below while breath Of music swayed their motions and the waste Rejoiced with them and me in those sweet sounds This for the past and things that may be viewed

and there my mind had exercised three hundred fifty five Upon the vulgar forms of present things The actual world of our familiar days Yet higher power had caught from them a tone An image and a character by books Not hitherto reflected H Call we this three hundred sixty A partial judgment and yet why for then We were as strangers and I may not speak Thus wrongfully of verse however rude Which on thy young imagination trained In the great City broke like light from far three hundred sixty five Moreover each man s Mind is to herself Witness and judge and I remember well That in life s every day appearances I seemed about this time to gain clear sight Of a new world a world too that was fit three hundred seventy To be transmitted and to other eyes Made visible as ruled by those fixed laws Whence spiritual dignity originates Which do both give it being and maintain A balance an ennobling interchange three hundred seventy five Of action from without and from within The excellence pure function and best power Both of the object seen and eye that sees FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT Footnote A Compare Expostulation and Reply vol i p two hundred seventy three Nor less I deem that there are Powers Which of themselves our minds impress That we can feed this mind of ours In a wise passiveness Think you mid all this mighty sum Of things for ever speaking That nothing of itself will come But we must still be seeking mister William Davies writes Is he absolutely right in attributing these powers to the objects of Nature which are only symbols after all Is there not a more penetrative and ethereal perceptive power in the human mind which is able to transfer itself immediately to the spiritual plane transcending that of visible Nature Plato saw it the old Vedantist

illimitable but positive and abstract universally diffused smaller than small greater than great the internal Light Monitor Guide Rest waiting to be seen recognised and known in every heart not depending on the powers of Nature for enlightenment and instruction but itself enlightening and instructing not merely a receptive but the motive power of Nature which bestows itself upon Nature and only receives from it that which it bestows Is it not as he says farther on better to see great truths even if not so strictly in line and form touch and handle little ones to take the highest point of view we can reach not a lower one And surely it is a higher thing to rule over and subdue Nature than to lie ruled and subdued by it The highest form of Religion has always done this Ed Footnote B Compare The Old Cumberland Beggar l forty nine vol i p three hundred one Ed Footnote C For a hint in reference to this road I am indebted to the late doctor Henry Dodgson of Cockermouth Referring to my suggestion that it might be the road from Cockermouth to Bridekirk he wrote July eighteen seventy eight I scarcely think that road answers to the description The hill over which it goes is not naked but well wooded and has probably been so for many years Besides it is not visible from Wordsworth s house nor from the garden behind it This garden extends from the house to the river Derwent from which it is separated by a wall with a raised terraced walk on the inner side and nearly on a level with the top I understand that this terrace was in existence in the poet s time Its direction is nearly due east and west and looking eastward from it there is a hill which bounds the view in that direction and which fully corresponds to the description in The Prelude It is from one and a half to two miles distant of considerable height is bare and destitute of trees and has a road going directly over its summit as seen from the terrace in Wordsworth s garden This road is now used only as a footpath but fifty or sixty years ago it was the highroad to Isel a hamlet on the Derwent about three and a half miles from Cockermouth in the direction of Bassenthwaite Lake The hill is locally called the Hay but on the Ordnance map it is marked Watch Hill There can be little doubt as to the accuracy of this suggestion No other hill road is visible from the house or garden at Cockermouth The view from the front of the old mansion is limited by houses doubtless more so now than in last century but there is no hill towards the Lorton Fells on the south or south east with a road over it visible from any part of the town Besides as this was a very early experience of Wordsworth s it was in the morn of childhood that the road was daily present to his sight it must have been seen either from the house or from the garden It is almost certain that he refers to the path over the Hay or Watch Hill which he and his sister Emmeline could see daily from the high terrace at the foot of their garden in Cockermouth where they used to chase the butterfly and visit the sparrow s nest in the impervious shelter of privet and roses doctor Cradock wrote to me January eighteen eighty six an old map of the county round about Keswick including Cockermouth dated seventeen eighty nine entirely confirms doctor Dodgson s statement The road over Hay Hill is marked clearly as a carriage road to Isel The miles are marked on the map The summit of the hill is naked for the map marks woods where they existed and none are marked on Hay Hill Ed Footnote D A part of the following paragraph is written

may they ne er Fade from remembrance through the Northern tracts Of Cambria ranging with a youthful friend A I left Bethgelert s huts at couching time And westward took my way to see the sun five Rise from the top of Snowdon To the door Of a rude cottage at the mountain s base We came and roused the shepherd who attends The adventurous stranger s steps a trusty guide Then cheered by short refreshment sallied forth ten It was a close warm breezeless summer night Wan dull and glaring with a dripping fog Low hung and thick that covered all the sky But undiscouraged we began to climb The mountain side The mist soon girt us round fifteen And after ordinary travellers talk With our conductor pensively we sank Each into commerce with his private thoughts Thus did we breast the ascent and by myself Was nothing either seen or heard that checked twenty Those musings or diverted save that once The shepherd s lurcher who among the crags Had to his joy unearthed a hedgehog teased His coiled up prey with barkings turbulent This small adventure for even such it seemed twenty five In that wild place and at the dead of night Being over and forgotten on we wound In silence as before With forehead bent Earthward as if in opposition set Against an enemy I panted up thirty With eager pace and no less eager thoughts Thus might we wear a midnight hour away Ascending at loose distance each from each And I as chanced the foremost of the band When at my feet the ground appeared to brighten thirty five And with a step or two seemed brighter still Nor was time given to ask or learn the cause For instantly a light upon the turf Fell like a flash and lo as I looked up The Moon hung naked in a firmament forty Of azure without cloud and at my feet Rested a silent sea of hoary mist A hundred hills their dusky backs upheaved All over this still ocean and beyond Far far beyond the solid vapours stretched forty five In headlands tongues and promontory shapes Into the main Atlantic that appeared To dwindle and give up his majesty Usurped upon far as the sight could reach Not so the ethereal vault encroachment none fifty Was there nor loss only the inferior stars Had disappeared or shed a fainter light In the clear presence of the full orbed Moon Who from her sovereign elevation gazed Upon the billowy ocean as it lay fifty five All meek and silent save that through a rift Not distant from the shore whereon we stood A fixed abysmal gloomy breathing place Mounted the roar of waters torrents streams Innumerable roaring with one voice sixty Heard over earth and sea and in that hour For so it seemed felt by the starry heavens When into air had partially dissolved That vision given to spirits of the night And three chance human wanderers in calm thought sixty five Reflected it appeared to me the type Of a majestic intellect its acts And its possessions what it has and craves What in itself it is and would become There I beheld the emblem of a mind seventy That feeds upon infinity that broods Over the dark abyss B intent to hear Its voices issuing forth to silent light In one continuous stream a mind sustained By recognitions of transcendent power seventy five In sense conducting to ideal form In soul of more than mortal privilege One function above all of such a mind Had Nature shadowed there by putting forth Mid circumstances awful and sublime eighty That mutual domination which she loves To exert upon the face of outward things So moulded joined abstracted so endowed With interchangeable supremacy That men least sensitive see hear perceive eighty five And cannot choose but feel The power which all Acknowledge when thus moved which Nature thus To bodily sense exhibits is the express Resemblance of that glorious faculty That higher minds bear with them as their own ninety This is the very spirit in which they deal With the whole compass of the universe They from their native selves can send abroad Kindred mutations for themselves create A like existence and whene er it dawns ninety five Created for them catch it or are caught By its inevitable mastery Like angels stopped upon the wind by sound Of harmony from Heaven s remotest spheres Them the enduring and the transient both one hundred Serve to exalt they build up greatest things From least suggestions ever on the watch Willing to work and to be wrought upon They need not extraordinary calls To rouse them in a world of life they live one hundred five By sensible impressions not enthralled But by their quickening impulse made more prompt To hold fit converse with the spiritual world And with the generations of mankind Spread over time past present and to come one hundred ten Age after age till Time shall be no more Such minds are truly from the Deity For they are Powers and hence the highest bliss That flesh can know is theirs the consciousness Of Whom they are habitually infused one hundred fifteen Through every image and through every thought And all affections by communion raised From earth to heaven from human to divine Hence endless occupation for the Soul Whether discursive or intuitive C one hundred twenty Hence cheerfulness for acts of daily life Emotions which best foresight need not fear Most worthy then of trust when most intense Hence amid ills that vex and wrongs that crush Our hearts if here the words of Holy Writ one hundred twenty five May with fit reverence be applied that peace Which passeth understanding that repose In moral judgments which from this pure source Must come or will by man be sought in vain Oh who is he that hath his whole life long one hundred thirty Preserved enlarged this freedom in himself For this alone is genuine liberty Where is the favoured being who hath held That course unchecked unerring and untired In one perpetual progress smooth and bright one hundred thirty five A humbler destiny have we retraced And told of lapse and hesitating choice And backward wanderings along thorny ways Yet compassed round by mountain solitudes Within whose solemn temple I received one hundred forty My earliest visitations careless then Of what was given me and which now I range A meditative oft a suffering man Do I declare in accents which from truth Deriving cheerful confidence shall blend one hundred forty five Their modulation with these vocal streams That whatsoever falls my better mind Revolving with the accidents of life May have sustained that howsoe er misled Never did I in quest of right and wrong one hundred fifty Tamper with conscience from a private aim Nor was in any public hope the dupe Of selfish passions nor did ever yield Wilfully to mean cares or low pursuits But shrunk with apprehensive jealousy one hundred fifty five From every combination which might aid The tendency too potent in itself Of use and custom to bow down the soul Under a growing weight of vulgar sense And substitute a universe of death one hundred sixty For that which moves with light and life informed Actual divine and true To fear and love To love as prime and chief for there fear ends Be this ascribed to early intercourse In presence of sublime or beautiful forms one hundred sixty five With the adverse principles of pain and joy Evil as one is rashly named by men Who know not what they speak By love subsists All lasting grandeur by pervading love That gone we are as dust Behold the fields one hundred seventy In balmy spring time full of rising flowers And joyous creatures see that pair the lamb And the lamb s mother and their tender ways Shall touch thee to the heart thou callest this love And not inaptly so for love it is one hundred seventy five Far as it carries thee In some green bower Rest and be not alone but have thou there The One who is thy choice of all the world There linger listening gazing with delight Impassioned but delight how pitiable one hundred eighty Unless this love by a still higher love Be hallowed love that breathes not without awe Love that adores but on the knees of prayer By heaven inspired that frees from chains the soul Lifted in union with the purest best one hundred eighty five Of earth born passions on the wings of praise Bearing a tribute to the Almighty s Throne This spiritual Love acts not nor can exist Without Imagination which in truth Is but another name for absolute power one hundred ninety And clearest insight amplitude of mind And Reason in her most exalted mood This faculty hath been the feeding source Of our long labour we have traced the stream From the blind cavern whence is faintly heard one hundred ninety five Its natal murmur followed it to light And open day accompanied its course Among the ways of Nature for a time Lost sight of it bewildered and engulphed Then given it greeting as it rose once more two hundred In strength reflecting from its placid breast The works of man and face of human life And lastly from its progress have we drawn Faith in life endless the sustaining thought Of human Being Eternity and God two hundred five Imagination having been our theme So also hath that intellectual Love For they are each in each and cannot stand Dividually Here must thou be O Man Power to thyself no Helper hast thou here two hundred ten Here keepest thou in singleness thy state No other can divide with thee this work No secondary hand can intervene To fashion this ability tis thine The prime and vital principle is thine two hundred fifteen In the recesses of thy nature far From any reach of outward fellowship Else is not thine at all But joy to him Oh joy to him who here hath sown hath laid Here the foundation of his future years two hundred twenty For all that friendship all that love can do All that a darling countenance can look Or dear voice utter to complete the man Perfect him made imperfect in himself All shall be his and he whose soul hath risen two hundred twenty five Up to the height of feeling intellect Shall want no humbler tenderness his heart Be tender as a nursing mother s heart Of female softness shall his life be full Of humble cares and delicate desires two hundred thirty Mild interests and gentlest sympathies Child of my parents Sister of my soul Thanks in sincerest verse have been elsewhere Poured out D for all the early tenderness Which I from thee imbibed and tis most true two hundred thirty five That later seasons owed to thee no less For spite of thy sweet influence and the touch Of kindred hands that opened out the springs Of genial thought in childhood and in spite Of all that unassisted I had marked two hundred forty In life or nature of those charms minute That win their way into the heart by stealth Still to the very going out of youth I too exclusively esteemed that love And sought that beauty which as Milton sings two hundred forty five Hath terror in it E Thou didst soften down This over sternness but for thee dear Friend My soul too reckless of mild grace had stood In her original self too confident Retained too long a countenance severe two hundred fifty A rock with torrents roaring with the clouds Familiar and a favourite of the stars But thou didst plant its crevices with flowers Hang it with shrubs that twinkle in the breeze And teach the little birds to build their nests two hundred fifty five And warble in its chambers At a time When Nature destined to remain so long Foremost in my affections had fallen back Into a second place pleased to become A handmaid to a nobler than herself two hundred sixty When every day brought with it some new sense Of exquisite regard for common things And all the earth was budding with these gifts Of more refined humanity thy breath Dear Sister was a kind of gentler spring two hundred sixty five That went before my steps Thereafter came One whom with thee friendship had early paired She came no more a phantom to adorn A moment F but an inmate of the heart And yet a spirit there for me enshrined two hundred seventy To penetrate the lofty and the low Even as one essence of pervading light Shines in the brightest of ten thousand stars And the meek worm that feeds her lonely lamp Couched in the dewy grass With such a theme two hundred seventy five Coleridge with this my argument of thee Shall I be silent O capacious Soul Placed on this earth to love and understand And from thy presence shed the light of love Shall I be mute ere thou be spoken of two hundred eighty Thy kindred influence to my heart of hearts Did also find its way Thus fear relaxed Her over weening grasp thus thoughts and things In the self haunting spirit learned to take More rational proportions mystery two hundred eighty five The incumbent mystery of sense and soul Of life and death time and eternity Admitted more habitually a mild Interposition a serene delight In closelier gathering cares such as become two hundred ninety A human creature howsoe er endowed Poet or destined for a humbler name And so the deep enthusiastic joy The rapture of the hallelujah sent From all that breathes and is was chastened stemmed two hundred ninety five And balanced by pathetic truth by trust In hopeful reason leaning on the stay Of Providence and in reverence for duty Here if need be struggling with storms and there Strewing in peace life s humblest ground with herbs three hundred At every season green sweet at all hours And now O Friend this history is brought To its appointed close the discipline And consummation of a Poet s mind In everything that stood most prominent three hundred five Have faithfully been pictured we have reached The time our guiding object from the first When we may not presumptuously I hope Suppose my powers so far confirmed and such My knowledge as to make me capable three hundred ten Of building up a Work that shall endure G Yet much hath been omitted as need was Of books how much and even of the other wealth That is collected among woods and fields Far more for Nature s secondary grace three hundred fifteen Hath hitherto been barely touched upon The charm more superficial that attends Her works as they present to Fancy s choice Apt illustrations of the moral world Caught at a glance or traced with curious pains three hundred twenty Finally and above all O Friend I speak With due regret how much is overlooked In human nature and her subtle ways As studied first in our own hearts and then In life among the passions of mankind three hundred twenty five Varying their composition and their hue Where er we move under the diverse shapes That individual character presents To an attentive eye For progress meet Along this intricate and difficult path three hundred thirty Whate er was wanting something had I gained As one of many schoolfellows compelled In hardy independence to stand up Amid conflicting interests and the shock Of various tempers to endure and note three hundred thirty five What was not understood though known to be Among the mysteries of love and hate Honour and shame looking to right and left Unchecked by innocence too delicate And moral notions too intolerant three hundred forty Sympathies too contracted Hence when called To take a station among men the step Was easier the transition more secure More profitable also for the mind Learns from such timely exercise to keep three hundred forty five In wholesome separation the two natures The one that feels the other that observes Yet one word more of personal concern Since I withdrew unwillingly from France I led an undomestic wanderer s life three hundred fifty In London chiefly harboured whence I roamed Tarrying at will in many a pleasant spot Of rural England s cultivated vales Or Cambrian solitudes H A youth he bore The name of Calvert I it shall live if words three hundred fifty five Of mine can give it life in firm belief That by endowments not from me withheld Good might be furthered in his last decay By a bequest sufficient for my needs Enabled me to pause for choice and walk three hundred sixty At large and unrestrained nor damped too soon By mortal cares Himself no Poet yet Far less a common follower of the world He deemed that my pursuits and labours lay Apart from all that leads to wealth or even three hundred sixty five A necessary maintenance insures Without some hazard to the finer sense He cleared a passage for me and the stream Flowed in the bent of Nature K Having now Told what best merits mention further pains three hundred seventy Our present purpose seems not to require And I have other tasks Recall to mind The mood in which this labour was begun O Friend The termination of my course Is nearer now much nearer yet even then three hundred seventy five In that distraction and intense desire I said unto the life which I had lived Where art thou Hear I not a voice from thee Which tis reproach to hear Anon I rose As if on wings and saw beneath me stretched three hundred eighty Vast prospect of the world which I had been And was and hence this Song which like a lark I have protracted in the unwearied heavens Singing and often with more plaintive voice To earth attempered and her deep drawn sighs three hundred eighty five Yet centring all in love and in the end All gratulant if rightly understood Whether to me shall be allotted life And with life power to accomplish aught of worth That will be deemed no insufficient plea three hundred ninety For having given the story of myself Is all uncertain but beloved Friend When looking back thou seest in clearer view Than any liveliest sight of yesterday That summer under whose indulgent skies three hundred ninety five Upon smooth Quantock s airy ridge we roved Unchecked or loitered mid her sylvan combs L Thou in bewitching words with happy heart Didst chaunt the vision of that Ancient Man The bright eyed Mariner L and rueful woes four hundred Didst utter of the Lady Christabel L And I associate with such labour steeped In soft forgetfulness the livelong hours Murmuring of him who joyous hap was found After the perils of his moonlight ride four hundred five Near the loud waterfall L or her who sate In misery near the miserable Thorn L When thou dost to that summer turn thy thoughts And hast before thee all which then we were To thee in memory of that happiness four hundred ten It will be known by thee at least my Friend Felt that the history of a Poet s mind Is labour not unworthy of regard To thee the work shall justify itself The last and later portions of this gift four hundred fifteen Have been prepared not with the buoyant spirits That were our daily portion when we first Together wantoned in wild Poesy But under pressure of a private grief M Keen and enduring which the mind and heart four hundred twenty That in this meditative history Have been laid open needs must make me feel More deeply yet enable me to bear More firmly and a comfort now hath risen From hope that thou art near and wilt be soon four hundred twenty five Restored to us in renovated health When after the first mingling of our tears Mong other consolations we may draw Some pleasure from this offering of my love Oh yet a few short years of useful life four hundred thirty And all will be complete thy race be run Thy monument of glory will be raised Then though too weak to tread the ways of truth This age fall back to old idolatry Though men return to servitude as fast four hundred thirty five As the tide ebbs to ignominy and shame By nations sink together we shall still Find solace knowing what we have learnt to know Rich in true happiness if allowed to be Faithful alike in forwarding a day four hundred forty Of firmer trust joint labourers in the work Should Providence such grace to us vouchsafe Of their deliverance surely yet to come Prophets of Nature we to them will speak A lasting inspiration sanctified four hundred forty five By reason blest by faith what we have loved Others will love and we will teach them how Instruct them how the mind of man becomes A thousand times more beautiful than the earth On which he dwells above this frame of things four hundred fifty Which mid all revolution in the hopes And fears of men doth still remain unchanged In beauty exalted as it is itself Of quality and fabric more divine FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT Footnote A With Robert Jones in the summer of seventeen ninety three Ed Footnote B Compare Paradise Lost book i l twenty one Ed Footnote

on the next three sonnets I mentioned Michael Angelo s poetry some time ago it is the most difficult to construe I ever met with but just what you would expect from such a man shewing abundantly how conversant his soul was with great things There is a mistake in the world concerning the Italian language the poetry of Dante and Michael Angelo proves that if there be little majesty and strength in Italian verse the fault is in the authors and not in the tongue I can translate and have translated two books of Ariosto at the rate nearly of one hundred lines a day but so much meaning has been put by Michael Angelo into so little room and that meaning sometimes so excellent in itself that I found the difficulty of translating him insurmountable I attempted at least fifteen of the sonnets but could not anywhere succeed I have sent you the only one I was able to finish it is far from being the best or most characteristic but the others were too much for me The last of the three sonnets probably belongs to the year eighteen oh four as it is quoted in a letter to Sir George Beaumont dated Grasmere August six The year is not given but I think it must have been eighteen oh four as he says that within the last month he had written seven hundred additional lines of The Prelude and that poem was finished in May eighteen oh five The titles given to them make it necessary to place

NOTE II THE HAWKSHEAD BECK See pp one hundred eighty eight eighty nine The Prelude book iv mister Rawnsley formerly of Wray Vicarage now Canon Rawnsley of Crosthwaite Vicarage Keswick sent me the following letter in reference to that unruly child of mountain birth The famous brook who soon as he was boxed Within our garden found himself at once As if by trick insidious and unkind Stripped of his voice and left to dimple down I looked at him and smiled and smiled again Ha quoth I pretty prisoner are you there I was not quite content with doctor Cradock s identification of this brook or of the garden partly because beyond the present garden square I found on going up the brook other garden squares which were much more likely to have been the garden belonging to Anne Tyson s cottage and because in these garden plots the stream was not stripped of his voice by the covering of Coniston flags as is the case lower down towards the market place and partly because as you notice you can both hear and see the stream through the interstices of the flags and that it can hardly be described by one who will listen as stripped of its voice At the same time I was bound to admit that in comparing the voice of the stream here in the channel paved by man s officious care with the sound of it up in the fields beyond the vicarage nearer its birth place it certainly might be said to be softer voiced and as the poet speaks of it as that unruly child of mountain birth it looks as if he too had realised the difference But whilst I thought that the identification of doctor Cradock and yourself was very happy in absence of other possibilities I had not thought that Wordsworth would describe the stream as dimpling down or address it as a pretty prisoner A smaller stream seemed necessary It was therefore not a little curious that in poking about among the garden plots on the west bank of the stream fronting as nearly as I could judge Anne Tyson s cottage to seek for remains of the ash tree in which so often the poet as he lay awake on summer nights had watched the moon in splendour couched among the leaves rocking with every impulse of the breeze I not only stumbled upon the remains of an ash tree now a pollard which is evidently sprung from a larger tree since decayed and which for all I know may be one of the actual parts of the ancient tree itself but also had the good luck to fall into conversation with a certain Isaac Hodgson who volunteered the following information First that Wordsworth it was commonly said had lodged part of his time with one Betty Braithwaite in the very house called Church Hill House She was a widow and kept a confectionery shop and did a deal of baking he believed Secondly that there was a little patch of garden at the back of the house with a famous spring well still called Old Betty s Well in it and that only a few paces from where I was then standing by the pollard ash On jumping over the fence I found myself on the western side of the quaint old Church Hill House with magnificent views of the whole of the western side of Hawkshead Vale grassy swell and wooded rises taking the eye up to the moorland ridge between us and Coniston But said I what about Betty s Well Oh said my friend that s a noted spring that never freezes and always runs we all drink of it and neighbours send to it Here it is he continued and gazing down I saw a little dripping well of water lustrous clear coming evidently in continuous force from the springs or secret channels up hill pausing for a moment at the trough thence falling into a box or channel paved by man s officious care and in a moment out of sight and soundless to pursue its way stripped of its voice towards the main Town beck that ran at the north east border of the garden plot Ha pretty prisoner and the words dimple down came to my mind at once as appropriate Old Betty s Well gave the key note of the famous brook and boxed within our garden seemed an appropriate and exact description Trace of the sunny seat Round the stone table under the dark pine was there none Not so however the Ash tree the remains of which I have spoken of From the bedroom of Betty Braithwaite s house the boy could have watched the moon while to and fro In the dark summit of the waving tree She rocked with every impulse of the breeze In old times said my friend the wall fence ran across the garden just beyond this spring well so you see it was but a small spot was this garden close Yes but the crowd of things About its narrow precincts all beloved were known the better and loved the more on that account Certainly thought I to myself here is the famous spring a brook that Wordsworth must have known and that may have been the centre of memory to him in his description of those early Hawkshead days with its metaphor of fountain life May we not as we gaze on this little fountain well in a garden plot at the back of one of the grey huts of this one dear vale point as with a wand and say This portion of the river of his mind Came from yon fountain Is it not possible that the old dame whose Clear though shallow stream of piety Ran on the Sabbath days a fresher course was Betty Braithwaite the aged dame who owned the cottage hard by The following additional extract from a letter of mister Rawnsley s Christmas eighteen eighty two casts light both on the Hawkshead beck and fountain and on the stone seat in the market square referred to in the fourth book of The Prelude Postlethwaite of the Sun Inn at Hawkshead has a father aged eighty two who can remember that there was a stone bench not called old Betty s but Old Jane s Stone on which she used to spread nuts and cakes for the scholars of the Grammar School but that it did not stand where the Market Hall now is and no one ever remembers a stone or stone bench standing there This stone or stone bench stood about opposite the Red Lion inn in front of the little row of houses that run east and west just as you pass out of the village in a northerly direction by the Red Lion This stone or stone bench is not associated with dark pine trees but they may have passed away root and branch in an earlier generation Next and most interesting I think as showing that I was right in the matter of the famous fountain or spring in the garden behind Betty Braithwaite s house There exists in Hawkshead near this house a covered in place or shed to which all the village repair for their drinking water and always have done so It is known by the name of the Spout House and the water which flows all the year from a longish spout with an overflow one by its side comes direct from the little drop well in Betty B s garden after having its voice stripped and boxed therein and falling out of the spout into a deep stone basin and culvert runs through the town to join the Town Beck So wedded are the Hawkshead folk to this their familiar fountainhead that though water is supplied in stand pipes now from a Reservoir the folks won t have it and come here to this spout house bucket and jug in hand morn noon and night I have never seen anything so like a continental scene at the gathering at Hawkshead spout house Lastly there is a very aged thorn tree in the churchyard blown over but propped up in which the forefathers of the hamlet used to sit as boys in the thorn that is not the churchyard and which has been worn smooth by many Hawkshead generations The tradition is that Wordsworth used to sit a deal in it when at school Ed NOTE III THE HAWKSHEAD MORNING WALK SUMMER VACATION See p one hundred ninety seven The Prelude book iv ll three hundred twenty three thirty eight If the farm house where Wordsworth spent the evening before this memorable morning walk was either at Elterwater or High Arnside and the homeward pathway led across the ridge of Ironkeld either by the old mountain road now almost disused or over the pathless fells there are two points from either of which the sea might be seen in the distance The one is from the heights looking down to the Duddon estuary across the Coniston valley the other is from a spot nearer Hawkshead where Morecambe Bay is visible In the former case the meadows and the lower grounds would be those in Yewdale in the latter case they would be those between Latterbarrow and Hawkshead and on either alternative the solid mountains would be those of the Coniston group the Old Man and Wetherlam It is also possible that the course of the walk was over the Latterbarrow fells or heights of Colthouse but from the reference to the sunrise not unseen from the copse and field through which the homeward pathway wound it may be supposed that the course was south east and therefore not over these fells when his back would have been to the sun doctor Cradock s note Footnote T to book iv to the text p one hundred ninety seven sums up all that can be safely said but mister Rawnsley has supplied me with the following interesting remarks After a careful reading of the passage describing the poet s return from a festal night spent in some farm house beyond the hills I am quite unable to say that the path from High Arnside over the Ironkeld range entirely suits the description Is it not possible that the lad had school fellows whose parents lived in Yewdale If he had and was returning from the party in one of the Yewdale farms he would as he ascended towards Tarn Howes and faced about south to gain the main Coniston road by traversing the meadows between Berwick ground and the top of the Hawkshead and Coniston Hill command a view of the sea that lay laughing at a distance and near the solid mountains Wetherlam and Coniston Old Man would shine bright as the clouds I think this is likely to have been the poet s track because he speaks of labourers going forth to till the fields and the Yewdale valley is one that is at its head chiefly arable so that he would be likelier to have gazed on them there than in the vale of Hawkshead itself One is here however as in a former passage when we fixed on Yewdale as the one described as being a cultured vale obliged to remember that in Wordsworth s boyhood wheat was grown more extensively than is now the case in these parts Of course the Furness Fell above Colthouse might have been the scene It is eminently suited to the description Ed NOTE IV DOROTHY WORDSWORTH AT CAMBRIDGE IN eighteen oh eight THE ASH TREE AT saint JOHN S COLLEGE See p two hundred twenty four The Prelude book vi ll seventy six ninety four The following is an extract from a letter of Dorothy Wordsworth s to Lady Beaumont at Coleorton dated fourteenth August probably in eighteen oh eight We reached Cambridge at half past nine In our way to the Inn we stopped at the gate of saint John s College to set down one of our passengers The stopping of the carriage roused me from a sleepy musing and I was awe stricken with the solemnity of the old gateway and the light from a great distance within streaming along the pavement When they told me it was the entrance to saint John s College I was still more affected by the gloomy yet beautiful sight before me for I thought of my dearest brother in his youthful days passing through that gateway to his home and I could have believed that I saw him there even then as I had seen him in the first year of his residence I met with mister Clarkson at the Inn and was you may believe rejoiced to hear his voice at the coach door We supped together and immediately after supper I went to bed and slept well and at eight o clock next morning went to Trinity Chapel There I stood for many minutes in silence before the statue of Newton while the organ sounded I never saw a statue that gave me one hundredth part so much pleasure but pleasure that is not the word it is a sublime sensation in harmony with sentiments of devotion to the Divine Being and reverence for the holy places where He is worshipped We walked in the groves all the morning and visited the Colleges I sought out a favourite ash tree which my brother speaks of in his poem on his own life a tree covered with ivy We dined with a fellow of Peter House in his rooms and after dinner I went to King s College Chapel There and everywhere else at Cambridge I was even much more impressed with the effect of the buildings than I had been formerly and I do believe that this power of receiving an enlarged enjoyment from the sight of buildings is one of the privileges of our later years I have this moment received a letter from William Ed NOTE V THE MEETING POINT OF TWO HIGHWAYS See p three hundred fifty three The Prelude book xii l two hundred ninety three The following extract from a letter of mister Rawnsley s casts important light on a difficult question of localization doctor Cradock is inclined now to select the Outgate Crag the second of the four places referred to by mister Rawnsley But the first may have been the place and the extract which follows will show how much is yet to be done in this matter of localizing poetical allusions As to the crag That from the meeting point of two highways Ascending overlooked them both far stretched there seems to be no doubt but that we have four competitors for the honour of being the place to which the poet impatient for the sight Of those led palfreys that should bear them home repaired with his brothers one Christmas time On the glad eve of its dear holidays And unless as it seems is quite possible from what one sees in other of Wordsworth s poems he really stood on one of the crags and then in his description drew the picture of the landscape at his feet from his memory of what it was as seen from another of the vantage places we need a high crag rising gradually or abruptly from the actual meeting place of two highways with if possible at this distance of time a wall or traces of it quite at its summit I may mention that the wallers in this country still give two hundred years as the length of time that a dry wall will stand We need also traces of an old thorn tree close by The wall too must be so placed on the summit of the crag that as it faces the direction in which the lad is looking for his palfrey it shall afford shelter to him against the sleety rain And all the business of the elements It is evident that the lad would be looking out in a north easterly direction i e towards the head of Windermere and Ambleside So that the mist That on the line of each of those two roads Advanced in such indisputable shapes was urged by a wind that found the poet at his look out station glad to have the wall between him and it Further there must be in close proximity wood and the sound of rushing water or the lapping of a lake wind driven against the marge for the boy remembers that the bleak music from that old stone wall was mingled with the noise of wood and water The roads spoken of must be two highways and must be capable of being seen for some distance unless as it is just possible the epithet far stretched may be taken as applying not so much to the roads as to the gradual ascent of the crag from the meeting place of the two highways The scene from the crag must be extended and half plain half wood land at least one gathers as much from the lines as the mist Gave intermitting prospect of the copse And plain beneath Lastly it was a day of driving sleet and mist and this of itself would necessitate that the poet and his brothers should only go to the place close to which the ponies must pass or from which most plainly the roads were visible The boys too were feverish and tired and restless and a schoolboy to gain his point on such a day and on such an errand does not take much account of a mile of country to be travelled over So that it is immaterial I think to make the distance from Hawkshead of either of the four crags or vantage grounds a factor in decision The farther the lads were from home when they met their ponies the longer ride back they would have and this to schoolboys is matter of consideration at such times Taking then a survey of the ground of choice we have to decide whether the crag in question is situated at the first division or main split of the road from Ambleside furthest from Hawkshead or whether at the place where the two roads converge again into one nearer Hawkshead Whether that is the crag above the Pullwyke quarry at the junction of the road to Water Barngates and the road to Wray and Outgate is to be selected about two miles from Hawkshead or whether we are to fix on the spot you have chosen at the point about a mile north east of Hawkshead called in the ordnance map Outgate Of the two I incline to the former for these reasons The boys could not be so certain of not missing the ponies at any other place than here at Pullwyke The crag exactly answers the poet s description a rising ground the meeting place of two highways For in the poet s time the old Hawkshead and Outgate road at the Pullwyke corner ran at the very foot of the rising ground roughly speaking parallel to and some sixty to one hundred yards west of the present road from the Pull to Wray It is true that no trace of wall is visible at its summit but the summit has been planted since with trees and walls are often removed at time of planting The poet would have a full view of the main road down to and round the Pullwyke Bay he would see the branch road from the fork as it mounted the Water Barngates Hill to the west and would see the other road of the fork far stretched and going south He would also have an extended view of copse and meadow land He might if the wind were south easterly hear the noise of Windermere sobbing in the Pullwyke Bay and would without doubt hear also the roar of the Pull Beck water as it passed down from the Ironkeld slopes on his left towards the lake It might be objected that the poem gives us the idea of a crag which from the Hawkshead side at any rate would require to be of more difficult ascent than this is to justify the idea of difficulty as suggested in the lines thither I repaired Scout like and gained the summit but I do not think we need read more into the lines than that the boy felt as he scanned the country with his eyes on the qui vive at every rise in the ground the feelings of a scout who questions constantly the distant prospect And certainly the Pullwyke quarry crag rises most steeply from the meeting point of the two highways Next as to the Outgate crag which you have chosen I am out of love with it First if the lads wanted to make sure of the ponies they would not have ascended it but would have stayed just at the Hawkshead side of Outgate or at the village itself at the point of convergence of the ways Secondly the crag can hardly be described as rising from the meeting point of two highways only one highway passes near it The crag is of so curious a formation geologically that I can t fancy the poet describing his memory of it without calling it a terraced hill or an ascent by natural terraces Then again the prospect is not sufficiently extended from it The stream not near enough or rather not of size enough to be heard Blelham Tarn is not too far to have added to the watery sound it is true but the wind we suppose to have been north east and the sound of the Blelham Tarn would be much carried away from him The present stone wall is not near the summit and is of comparatively recent date It is difficult to believe from the slope of the outcrop of rock that a wall could ever have been at the summit But there are two other vantage grounds intermediate between those extremes both of which were probably in the mind and memory of the poet as he described the scene and The intermitting prospect of the copse And plain beneath allowed him by the mist One of these is the High Crag about three quarters of a mile from the divergence or convergence of the two highways which doctor Cradock has selected There can be no doubt that this is the crag par excellence for a wide and extended look out over all the country between Outgate and Ambleside Close at its summit there remain aged thorn trees but no trace of a wall But High Crag can hardly be said to have risen at the meeting point of two highways unless we are to understand the epithet far stretched as applying to the south western slopes or skirts of the hill and the two highways the roads between Water Barngates on the west and the bridle road between Pullwyke and Outgate at their Outgate junction and this is rather too far a stretch It is quite true that if bridle paths can be described as highways there may be said to be a meeting point of these close at the north eastern side of the crag But remembering that the ponies came from Penrith the driver was not likely to have had any intimate knowledge of these bridle paths while at the same time on that misty day I much question whether the boys on the look out at High Crag could have seen ponies creeping along between walled roads at so great a distance as half a mile or more And this would seem to have been the problem for them on that day I ought in fairness to say that it is not likely that the roads were then as to day walled up high on either side To day even from the summit of High Crag only the head and ears of a pony could be seen as it passed up the Water Barngates Road but at the end of last century many of the roads were only partially walled off from the moorlands they passed over in the Lake Country Still as I said High Crag was a point of vantage that the poet as a lad must have often climbed in this part of the country if he wanted to indulge in the delights of panoramic scene There is a wall some hundred yards from the summit on the south westerly flank of High Crag near this at a point close by two large holly trees the boy might have sheltered himself against the north eastern wind and have got a closer and better view of the road between Barngates and Outgate and Randy Pike and Outgate Here too he could possibly hear the sound of the stream in the dingle or woody hollow immediately at his feet but I am far from content with this as being the spot the poet watched from There is again a fourth possible look out place to which you will remember I directed your attention nearer Randy Pike The slope covered with larches rises up from the Randy Pike Road to a precipitous crag which faces north and east From this a grand view of the country between Randy Pike and Pullwyke is obtained and if the bridle paths might as is possible but unlikely be called two highways then this crag could be spoken of as rising from the meeting place of the two highways For the old Hawkshead Road passed along to the east within calling distance say ninety yards and a bridle road from Pullwyke now used chiefly by the quarrymen passed within eighty yards to the west while it is certain that the brook below when swollen by winter rains might be loud enough to be heard from the copse This crag is known as Coldwell or Caudwell Crag and is situated about half a mile east south east of the High Crag It has this much in its favour that a wall of considerable age crests its summit and one can whilst sitting down on a rock close behind it be sheltered from the north and east and yet obtain an extensive view of the subadjacent country IF it were certain that the ponies when they got to Pullwyke did not go up towards Water Barngates and so to Hawkshead then there is no crag in the district which would so thoroughly answer to all the needs of the boys and to all the points of description the poet has placed on record But it is just this IF that makes me decide on the Pullwyke Crag the one first described as being the actual spot to which scout like the schoolboys clomb on that eventful eve of their dear holidays while at the same time it is my firm conviction that Wordsworth as he painted the memories of that event had also before his mind s eye the scene as viewed from Coldwell and High Crag Ed NOTE VI COLERIDGE S LINES TO WORDSWORTH ON HEARING THE PRELUDE RECITED BY HIM AT COLEORTON IN eighteen oh six The following is a copy of a

Prelude book ix Professor Emile Legouis of Lyons a thorough student and a very competent expounder of our modern English Literature supplied me some years ago with numerous facts in reference to Wordsworth s friend General Beaupuy and his family from which I extract the following The Prelude gives us very little precise information about the republican officer with whom Wordsworth became acquainted in France and on whom he bestowed more praise than on almost any other of his contemporaries We only gather the following facts That his name was Beaupuy that he was quartered at Orleans with royalist officers sometime between November seventeen ninety one and the spring of seventeen ninety two and that He perished fighting in supreme command Upon the borders of the unhappy Loire For liberty against deluded men His fellow countrymen Though it seems very easy to identify a general even with such scanty data the task is rendered more difficult by two inaccuracies in Wordsworth s statement which however can be explained and redressed without much difficulty The first inaccuracy is in the spelling of the name which is Beaupuy and not Beaupuis a slight mistake considering that Wordsworth was a foreigner and besides wrote down his friend s name ten years and perhaps more after losing sight of him Moreover the name of the general who I think was meant by Wordsworth I have found spelt Beaupuy in one instance viz the signature of a letter of his as printed in Vie et Correspondance de Merlin de Thionville publiee par Jean Reynaud Paris eighteen sixty two e partie p two hundred forty one The spelling of proper names was not so fixed then as it is nowadays and this irregularity is not to be wondered at The second inaccuracy consists in stating that General Beaupuy died on the banks of the Loire during the Vendean war Indeed he was grievously wounded at the Battle of Chateau Gonthier on the twenty sixth of October seventeen ninety three and reported as dead His soldiers thought he had been killed and the rumour must have spread abroad as it was recorded by A Thiers himself in his Histoire de la Revolution and by A Challemel in his Histoire Musee de la Republique Francaise It is no wonder that Wordsworth who was then in England and could only read imperfect accounts of what took place in France should have been mistaken too No other General Beaupuy is recorded in the history of the Revolution so far as I have been able to ascertain The moral character of the officer whose life I shall relate answers to Wordsworth s description and is worthy of his high estimate Armand Michel de Bachelier Chevalier de Beaupuy was born at Mussidan in Perigord on the fifteenth of July seventeen fifty seven He belonged to a noble family less proud of its antiquity than of the blood it had shed for France on many battlefields On his mother s side Mlle de Villars he reckoned Montaigne the celebrated essayist among his ancestors His parents having imbibed the philanthropic ideas of the time educated him according to their principles He had four brothers who were all destined to turn republicans and do good service to the new cause though their interest certainly lay in the opposite direction He was made sub lieutenant in the regiment of Bassigny thirty third division of foot on the second of March seventeen seventy three and lieutenant of grenadiers on the first of October of the same year In seventeen ninety one he was first lieutenant in the same regiment Having sided with the Revolution he was appointed commander of a battalion of national volunteers in the department of Dordogne I have not found the exact date of this appointment but it must have taken place immediately after his stay at Orleans with Wordsworth I have found no further mention of his name till September seventeen ninety two when he is known to have served in the Armee du Rhin under General Custine and contributed to the taking of Spire He took an important part in the taking of Worms fourth October of Mayence Maenz twenty first October He was among the garrison of Mayence when this place was besieged by the Prussians and obliged to capitulate after a long and famous siege from sixth April seventeen ninety three to twenty second July seventeen ninety three A During the siege he wrote a journal of all the operations Unfortunately this journal is very short and purely military It has been handed down to us and is found in the Bibliotheque Nationale of Paris in the Papiers de Merlin de Thionville n acq fr Nos two hundred forty four two hundred fifty two eight vol in eight deg Beaupuy s journal is in the third volume fol two hundred thirteen two hundred twenty eight In the Vendean war the Mayencais or soldiers returned from Mayence made themselves conspicuous and bore almost all the brunt of the campaign But none of them distinguished himself more than Beaupuy then a General of Brigade The Mayencais arrived in Vendee at the end of August or beginning of September seventeen ninety three To Beaupuy s skill the victory of Chollet Oct seventeen seventeen ninety three is attributed by Jomini In this battle he fought hand to hand with and overcame a Vendean cavalier He himself had three horses killed and had a very narrow escape On the battlefield he was made general of division by the Representants du peuple It was after Chollet that the Vendeans made the memorable crossing of the Loire at saint Florent At Laval and Chateau Gonthier Oct twenty six a terrible defeat was inflicted on the Republicans owing to the incapacity of their commander in chief Lechelle The whole corps commanded by General Beaupuy was crushed by a terrible fire He himself after withstanding for two or three hours with two thousand or three thousand men all the attacks of the royalists was disabled by a shot and fell crying out Laissez moi la et portez a mes grenadiers ma chemise sanglante His soldiers thought he was dead and then the error was spread which was repeated by Wordsworth Thiers and Challamel Wordsworth s mistake is so far interesting as it seems to prove that very little or no correspondence passed between the two friends after they had parted Beaupuy moreover had too much work upon his hands to give much of his time to letter writing Though severely wounded Beaupuy lived on and less than six weeks after the battle of Chateau Gonthier he was seen on the ramparts of Angers where he required himself to be carried to animate his soldiers and head the defenders of the place from which the Vendeans were driven after a severe contest Dec five and six On the twenty second of December seventeen ninety three he shared in the victory of Savenay with his celebrated friends Marceau Kleber and Westermann After this battle which put an end to the great Vendean war he wrote the following letter to his friend Merlin de Thionville the celebrated representant du peuple SAVENAY le four Nivose au two e twenty five Dec seventy three Enfin enfin mon cher Merlin elle n est plus cette armee royale ou catholique comme tu voudras J en ai vu avec tes braves collegues Prieur et Eurreau les debris consistant en one hundred fifty cavaliers battant l eau dans le marais de Montaire et comme tu connais ma veracite tu peux dire avec assurance que les deux combats de Savenay ont mis fin a la guerre de la nouvelle Vendee et aux chimeriques esperances des royalists L histoire ne vous presente point de combat dont le suites aient ete plus decisives Ah mon brave comme tu aurais joui quelle attaque mais quelle deroute aussi Il fallait les voir ces soldats de Jesus et de Louis XVII se jetant dans les marais ou obliges de se rendre par five ou six hundred a la fois et Langreniere pris et les autres generaux disperses et aux abois Cette armee dont tu avais vu les restes de la terrasse de saint Florent etait redevenue formidable par son recrutement dans les departements envahis Je les ai bien vus bien examines j ai reconnu meme de mes figures de Chollet et de Laval et a leur contenance et a leur mine je l assure qu il ne leur manquait du soldat que l habit Des troupes qui ont battu de tels Francais peuvent se flatter ainsi de vainere des peuples assez laaches pour se reunir centre un seul et encore pour la cause des rois Enfin je ne sais si je me trompe mais cette guerre de brigands de paysans sur laquelle on a jete tant de ridicule que l on dedaignait que l on affectait de regarder comme meprisable m a toujours paru pour la republique la grande partie et il me semble a present qu avec nos autres ennemis nous ne ferrons plus que peloter Adieu brave montagnard adieu Actuellement que cette execrable guerre est terminee que les manes de nos freres sont satisfaits je vais guerir J ai obtenu de tes confreres un conge qui finira au moment ou la guerre recommencera LE GENERAL DE BRIGADE BEAUPUY I think I can recognize in this letter some traits of Beaupuy s character as pointed out by Wordsworth not excepting the half suppressed criticism somewhat vain he was Or seemed so yet it was not vanity But fondness and a kind of radiant joy Diffused around him Passing over numerous military incidents on the twenty sixth of June seventeen ninety six Beaupuy received seven or eight sabre cuts at Jorich Wildstadt But on the eighth of July he was already back at his post He again greatly distinguished himself on the first of September seventeen ninety six at Greisenfeld and Langenbruck where the victory of the French was owing to a timely attack made by Desaix and himself He was one of the generals under Moreau when the latter achieved his well known retreat through the Black Forest begun on the fifteenth of September seventeen ninety six and during which many battles were fought In one of the actions on the banks of the Elz Beaupuy was killed by a cannon ball while opposing General Latour on the heights of Malterdingen His soldiers who loved him passionately fought desperately to avenge his death Oct nineteen seventeen ninety six One of Beaupuy s colleagues General Duhem in his account of the battle to the Government thus expressed himself on General Beaupuy Ecrivains patriotes orateurs chaleureux je vous propose un noble sujet l eloge du General Beaupuy de Beaupuy le Nestor et l Achille de notre armee Vous n avez pas de recherches a faire interrogez le premier soldat de l armee du Rhin et Moselle ses larmes exciteront les votres Ecrivez alors ce que est vous en dira et vous peindrez le Bayard de la Republique Francaise Such bombastic style was then common but what we have seen of Beaupuy in this sketch shows that he had through his career united Nestor s prudence B with Achilles bodily courage and Bayard s chivalric spirit to use the language of the time General Moreau had Beaupuy s remains transported to Brisach where a monument was erected to his memory in eighteen oh two after the peace of Luneville In short Beaupuy seems to have always remained worthy of the high praise bestowed on him by Wordsworth His name is to be remembered along with those of the unspotted generals of the first years of the Revolution Hoche Marceau et cetera before the craving for conquest had developed and the love of liberty yielded to a fond admiration of Bonaparte as it did in the case of Kleber Desaix and so many others C N B The great influence which Beaupuy exercised at that time on Wordsworth will be easily understood if we take into account not only his real qualities but also his age When they met Wordsworth was only twenty one Beaupuy nearly thirty five The grown up man could impart much of his knowledge of life and of the favourite authors of the time to a youth fresh from the University though that youth was Wordsworth EMILE LEGOUIS FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT Footnote A His bravery shone forth at Coethen where he was left alone in a group of Prussians He fought with their chief and disarmed him A few days after he was named General of Brigade eighth March seventeen ninety three Footnote B The pacification of Vendee was for a great part owing to his valour and prudence Footnote C Beaupuy is said to have united civic virtues with military talents A good son and a good brother he showed in many a circumstance that true valour does not exclude humanity and that the soul can be both strong and full of feeling These notes B and C are taken from
