twenty two TO OWEN SEAMAN AFFECTIONATELY IN MEMORY OF NINE HAPPY YEARS AT THE PUNCH OFFICE CONTENTS CHAPTER INTRODUCTION TO THE AMERICAN EDITION I ORANGES AND LEMONS II MEN OF LETTERS III SUMMER DAYS IV WAR TIME V HOME NOTES VI A FEW GUESTS VII AND OTHERS INTRODUCTION My publisher wants me to apologize for introduce was the kindly word he used this collection of articles and verses from Punch I do so with pleasure Among the many interests of a long and varied career No I don t think I shall begin like that It was early in eighteen seventy one Nor like that Really it is very difficult you know I wrote these things for a number of years and well here they are But just to say Here they are is to be too informal for my publisher He wants not a casual introduction but a presentation Let me tell you a little story instead When war broke out I had published three of these books in England the gleanings of nine years regular work for Punch There are I understand a few Americans who read Punch and it was suggested to me that a suitable collection of articles from these three books might have some sort of American sale So I made such a collection leaving out the more topical and allusive sketches and including those with a more general appeal I called the result Happy Days an attractive title you will agree and in nineteen fifteen a New York publisher was found for it This is a funny story at least it appeals to me so I won t remind myself of the number of copies which we sold That was tragedy not comedy The joke lay in one of the few notices which the book received from the press For a New York critic ended his review of Happy Days with these immortal words Mr Milne is at present in the trenches facing the German bullets so this will probably be his last book You see now why an apology is necessary Here we are seven years later and I am still at it But at any rate it is the last of this sort of book As I said in a foreword to the English edition It is the last time because this sort of writing depends largely upon the irresponsibility and high spirits of youth for its success and I want to stop before may I say before the high spirits become mechanical and the irresponsibility a trick Perhaps the fact that this collection is final will excuse its air of scrappiness Odd Verses have crept in on the unanswerable plea that if they didn t do it now they never would War Sketches protested that I shouldn t have a book at all if I left them out an Early Article omitted from three previous volumes paraded for the fourth time with such a pathetic I suppose you don t want me in its eye that it could not decently be rejected So here they all are One further word of explanation You may find the first section of this book Oranges and Lemons a little difficult The characters of it are old friends to that limited public which reads my books in England their earlier adventures have been told in those previous volumes and purposely omitted from Happy Days as being a little too insular I feel somehow that strangers will not be on such easy terms with them and I would recommend that you approach them last By that time you will have discovered whether you are in a mood to stop and listen to their chatter or prefer to pass them by with a nod A A M THE SUNNY SIDE I ORANGES AND LEMONS I THE INVITATION Dear Myra wrote Simpson at the beginning of the year I have an important suggestion to make to you both and I am coming round to morrow night after dinner about nine o clock As time is so short I have asked Dahlia and Archie to meet me there and if by any chance you have gone out we shall wait till you come back Yours ever SAMUEL P S I have asked Thomas too Well said Myra eagerly as I gave her back the letter In deep thought I buttered a piece of toast We could stop Thomas I said We might ring up the Admiralty and ask them to give him something to do this evening I don t know about Archie Is he Oh what do you think it is Aren t you excited She sighed and added Of course I know what Samuel is Yes Probably he wants us all to go to the Zoo together or he s discovered a new way of putting or I say I didn t know Archie and Dahlia were in town They aren t But I expect Samuel telegraphed to them to meet him under the clock at Charing Cross disguised when they would hear of something to their advantage Oh I wonder what it is It must be something real this time Since the day when Simpson woke me up at six o clock in the morning to show me his stance for a full wooden club shot I have distrusted his enthusiasms but Myra loves him as a mother and I I couldn t do without him and when a man like that invites a whole crowd of people to come to your flat just about the time when you are wondering what has happened to the sardines on toast well it isn t polite to put the chain on the door and explain through the letter box that you have gone away for a week We d better have dinner a bit earlier to be on the safe side I said as Myra gave me a parting brush down in the hall If any further developments occur in the course of the day ring me up at the office By the way Simpson doesn t seem to have invited Peter I wonder why not He s nearly two and he ought to be in it Myra I m sure I m tidy now Pipe tobacco matches keys money Everything I said Bless you Goodbye Good bye said Myra lingeringly What do you think he meant by as time is so short I don t know At least I added looking at my watch I do know I shall be horribly late Good bye I fled down the stairs into the street waved to Myra at the window and then came cautiously up again for my pipe Life is very difficult on the mornings when you are in a hurry At dinner that night Myra could hardly eat for excitement You ll be sorry afterwards I warned her when it turns out to be nothing more than that he has had his hair cut But even if it is I don t see why I shouldn t be excited at seeing my only brother again not to mention sister in law Then let s move I said They ll be here directly Archie and Dahlia came first We besieged them with questions as soon as they appeared Haven t an idea said Archie I wanted to bring a revolver in case it was anything really desperate but Dahlia wouldn t let me It would have been useful too I said if it turned out to be something merely futile You re not going to hurt my Samuel however futile it is said Myra Dahlia how s Peter and will you have some coffee Peter s lovely You ve had coffee haven t you Archie Better have some more I suggested in case Simpson is merely soporific We anticipate a slumbering audience and Samuel explaining a new kind of googlie he s invented Entered Thomas lazily Hallo he said in his slow voice What s it all about It s a raid on the Begum s palace explained Archie rapidly Dahlia decoys the Chief Mucilage you Thomas drive the submarine Myra has charge of the clockwork mouse and we others hang about and sing To say more at this stage would be to bring about a European conflict Coffee Thomas said Myra I bet he s having us on said Thomas gloomily as he stirred his coffee There was a hurricane in the hall Chairs were swept over coats and hats fell to the ground a high voice offered continuous apologies and Simpson came in Hallo Myra he said eagerly Hallo old chap Hallo Dahlia Hallo Archie Hallo Thomas old boy He fixed his spectacles firmly on his nose and beamed round the room We re all here thanking you very much for inviting us I said Have a cigar if you ve brought any with you Fortunately he had brought several with him Now then I ll give any of you three guesses what it s all about No you don t We re all waiting and you can begin your apology right away Simpson took a deep breath and began I ve been lent a villa he said There was a moment s silence and then Archie got up Good bye he said to Myra holding out his hand Thanks for a very jolly evening Come along Dahlia But I say old chap protested Simpson I m sorry Simpson but the fact that you re moving from the Temple to Cricklewood or wherever it is and that somebody else is paying the thirty pounds a year is jolly interesting but it wasn t good enough to drag us up from the country to tell us about it You could have written However thank you for the cigar My dear fellow it isn t Cricklewood It s the Riviera Archie sat down again Samuel cried Myra How she must love you I should never lend Simpson a villa of mine I said He d only lose it They re some very old friends who live there and they re going away for a month and the servants are staying on and they suggested that if I was going abroad again this year How did the servants know you d been abroad last year asked Archie Don t interrupt dear said Dahlia I see what he means How very jolly for you Samuel For all of us Dahlia You aren t suggesting we shall all crowd in growled Thomas Of course my dear old chap I told them and they re delighted We can share housekeeping expenses and it will be as cheap as anything But to go into a stranger s house said Dahlia anxiously It s my house Dahlia for the time I invite you He threw out his hands in a large gesture of welcome and knocked his coffee cup on to the carpet begged Myra s pardon several times and then sat down again and wiped his spectacles vigorously Archie looked doubtfully at Thomas Duty Thomas duty he said thumping his chest You can t desert the Navy at this moment of crisis Might said Thomas puffing at his pipe Archie looked at me I looked hopefully at Myra Oh h h said Myra entranced Archie looked at Dahlia Dahlia frowned It isn t till February said Simpson eagerly It s very kind of you Samuel said Dahlia but I don t think Archie nodded to Simpson You leave this to me he said confidentially We re going II ON THE WAY Toulon announced Archie as the train came to a stop and gave out its plaintive dying whistle Naval port of our dear allies the French This would interest Thomas If he weren t asleep I said He ll be here directly said Simpson from the little table for two on the other side of the gangway I m afraid he had a bad night Here garcon er donnez moi du cafe et er But the waiter had slipped past him again the fifth time Have some of ours said Myra kindly holding out the pot Thanks very much Myra but I may as well wait for Thomas and garcon du cafe pour I don t think he ll be deux cafes garcon s il vous it s going to be a lovely day Thomas came in quietly sat down opposite Simpson and ordered breakfast Samuel wants some too said Myra Thomas looked surprised grunted and ordered another breakfast You see how easy it is said Archie Thomas we re at Toulon where the ententes cordiales come from You ought to have been up long ago taking notes for the Admiralty I had a rotten night said Thomas Simpson fell out of bed in the middle of it Oh poor Samuel You don t mean to say you gave him the top berth I asked in surprise You must have known he d fall out But Thomas dear surely Samuel s just falling out of bed noise wouldn t wake you up said Myra I always thought you slept so well He tried to get back into my bed I was a little dazed explained Simpson hastily and I hadn t got my spectacles Still you ought to have been able to see Thomas there Of course I did see him as soon as I got in and then I remembered I was up above So I climbed up It must be rather difficult climbing up at night thought Dahlia Not if you get a good take off Dahlia said Simpson earnestly Simpson got a good one off my face explained Thomas My dear old chap I was frightfully sorry I did come down at once and tell you how sorry I was didn t I You stepped back on to it said Thomas shortly and he turned his attention to the coffee Our table had finished breakfast Dahlia and Myra got up slowly and Archie and I filled our pipes and followed them out Well we ll leave you to it said Archie to the other table Personally I think it s Thomas s turn to step on Simpson But don t be long because there s a good view coming The good view came and then another and another and they merged together and became one long moving panorama of beauty We stood in the corridor and drank it in and at intervals we said Oh h and Oh I say and Oh I say really And there was one particular spot I wish I could remember where so that it might be marked by a suitable tablet at the sight of which Simpson was overheard to say Mon Dieu for probably the first time in his life You know all these are olive trees you chaps he said every five minutes I wonder if there are any olives growing on them Too early said Archie It s the sardine season now It was at Cannes that we saw the first oranges That does it I said to Myra We re really here And look there s a lemon tree Give me the oranges and lemons and you can have all the palms and the cactuses and the olives Like polar bears in the arctic regions said Myra I thought for a moment Superficially there is very little resemblance between an orange and a polar bear Like polar bears I said hopefully I mean luckily she went on polar bears do it for you in the polar regions You really know you re there then Give me the polar bears I always say and you can keep the seals and the walruses and the penguins It s the hallmark Right I knew you meant something In London I went on it is raining Looking out of my window I see a lamp post not in flower beneath a low grey sky Here we see oranges against a blue sky a million miles deep What a blend Myra let s go to a fancy dress ball when we get back You go as an orange and I ll go as a very blue blue sky and you shall lean against me And we ll dance the tangerine said Myra But now observe us approaching Monte Carlo For an hour past Simpson has been collecting his belongings Two bags two coats a camera a rug Thomas golf clubs books his compartment is full of things which have to be kept under his eye lest they should evade him at the last moment As the train leaves Monaco his excitement is intense I think old chap he says to Thomas I ll wear the coats after all And the bags says Thomas and then you ll have a suit Simpson puts on the two coats and appears very big and hot I d better have my hands free he says and straps the camera and the golf clubs on to himself Then if you nip out and get a porter I can hand the bags out to him through the window All right says Thomas He is deep in his book and looks as if he were settled in his corner of the carriage for the day The train stops There is bustle noise confusion Thomas in some magical way has disappeared A porter appears at the open window and speaks voluble French to Simpson Simpson looks round wildly for Thomas Thomas he cries Un moment he says to the porter Thomas Mon ami it n est pas I say Thomas old chap where are you Attendez un moment Mon ami er reviendra He is very hot He is wearing in addition to what one doesn t mention an ordinary waistcoat a woolly waistcoat for steamer use a tweed coat an aquascutum an ulster a camera and a bag of golfclubs The porter with many gesticulations is still hurling French at him It is too much for Simpson He puts his head out of the window and observing in the distance a figure of such immense dignity that it can only belong to the station master utters to him across the hurly burly a wild call for help Ou est Cooks s homme he cries III SETTLING DOWN The villa was high up on the hill having as Simpson was to point out several times later Mentone on its left hand and Monte Carlo on its right A long winding path led up through its garden of olives to the front door and through the mimosa trees which flanked this door we could see already a flutter of white aprons The staff was on the loggia waiting to greet us We halted a moment out of sight of the ladies above and considered ourselves It came to us with a sudden shock that we were a very large party I suppose said Archie to Simpson they do expect all of us and not only you You told them that about half London was coming We re only six said Myra because I ve just counted again but we seem about twenty It s quite all right said Simpson cheerfully I said we d be six But six in a letter is much smaller than six of us like this and when they see our luggage Let s go back I suggested suddenly nervous To be five guests of the guest of a man you have never met is delicate work At this critical moment Archie assumed command He is a Captain in the Yeomanry and has tackled bigger jobs than this in his time We must get ourselves into proper order he said Simpson the villa has been lent to you you must go first Dahlia and I come next When we arrive you will introduce us as your friends mister and missus Mannering Then turning to Myra you say mister Mannering s sister and this you add is her husband Then er Thomas It will be difficult to account for Thomas I said Thomas comes at the end He hangs back a little at first and then if he sees that there is going to be any awkwardness about him he can pretend he s come on the wrong night and apologize and go home again If Thomas goes I go said Myra dramatically I have another idea I said Thomas hides here for a bit We introduce ourselves and settle in and have lunch and after lunch we take a stroll in the garden and to our great surprise discover Thomas Thomas we say you here Dear old chap we thought you were in England How splendid Where are you staying Oh but you must stop with us we can easily have a bed put up for you in the garage And then Not after lunch said Thomas before lunch Don t all be so silly smiled Dahlia They ll wonder what has happened to us if we wait any longer Besides the men will be here with the luggage directly Come along Samuel said Archie forward In our new formation we marched up Simpson excited and rehearsing to himself the words of introduction we others outwardly calm At a range of ten yards he opened fire How do you do he beamed Here we all are Isn t it a lovely The cook housekeeper majestic but kindly came forward with outstretched hand and welcomed him volubly in French The other three ladies added their French to hers There was only one English body on the loggia It belonged to a bull dog The bull dog barked loudly at Simpson in English There was no Cook s homme to save Simpson this time But he rose to the occasion nobly The scent of the mimosa inspired him Merci he said merci Oui n est ce pas Delightful Er these are ces sont mes amis Er Dahlia come along er Monsieur et Madame Mannering er Myra la soeur de Monsieur er where are you old chap le mari de la soeur de Monsieur Er Thomas er he was carried away by memories of his schoolboy French le frere du jardinier er He wheeled round and saw me introduced me again introduced Myra as my wife Archie as her brother and Dahlia as Archie s wife and then with a sudden inspiration presented Thomas grandly as le beau pere du petit fils de mes amis Monsieur et Madame Mannering Thomas seemed more assured of his place as Peter s godfather than as the brother of the gardener There were four ladies we shook hands with all of them It took us a long time and I doubt if we got it all in even so for twice I found myself shaking hands with Simpson But these may have been additional ones thrown in It was over at last and we followed the staff indoors And then we had another surprise It was broken to us by Dahlia who at Simpson s urgent request took up the position of lady of the house and forthwith received the flowing confidences of the housekeeper Two of us have to sleep outside she said Where we all asked blankly We went on to the loggia again and she pointed to a little house almost hidden by olive trees in a corner of the garden below us Oh well that s all right said Archie It s on the estate Thomas you and Simpson won t mind that a bit will you We can t turn Samuel out of his own house said Myra indignantly We aren t turning him he wants to go But of course if you and your young man would like to live there instead Myra looked at me eagerly It would be rather fun she said We d have another little honeymoon all to ourselves It wouldn t really be a honeymoon I objected We should always be knocking up against trippers in the garden Archies and Samuels and Thomases and what not They d be all over the place Dahlia explained the domestic arrangements The honeymooners had their little breakfast in their own little house and then joined the others for the day at about ten Or eleven said Thomas It would be rather lovely said Myra thoughtfully Yes I agreed but have you considered that Come over this way a moment where Thomas and Simpson can t hear while I tell you some of the disadvantages I led her into a quiet corner and suggested a few things to her which I hoped would not occur to the other two Item That if it was raining hard at night it would be beastly Item That if you suddenly found you d left your pipe behind it would be rotten Item That if as was probable there wasn t a proper bathroom in the little house it would be sickening Item That if she had to walk on muddy paths in her evening shoes it would be At this point Myra suddenly caught the thread of the argument We went back to the others We think said Myra it would be perfectly heavenly in the little house but She hesitated But at the same time I said we think it s up to Simpson and Thomas to be English gentlemen Samuel it s your honour There was a moment s silence Come along said Thomas to Simpson let s go and look at it After lunch clean and well fed and happy we lay in deck chairs on the loggia and looked lazily down at the Mediterranean Thank you Samuel for bringing us said Dahlia gently Your friends must be very fond of you to have lent you this lovely place Not fonder than we are said Myra smiling at him IV BEFORE LUNCH I found Myra in the hammock at the end of the loggia Hallo I said Hallo She looked up from her book and waved her hand Mentone on the left Monte Carlo on the right she said and returned to her book again Simpson had mentioned the situation so many times that it had become a catch phrase with us Fancy reading on a lovely morning like this I complained But that s why It s a very gloomy play by Ibsen and whenever it s simply more than I can bear I look up and see Mentone on the left Monte Carlo on the right I mean I see all the loveliness round me and then I know the world isn t so bad after all She put her book down Are you alone I gripped her wrist suddenly and put the paper knife to her throat We are alone I hissed or whatever you do to a sentence without any s s in it to make it dramatic Your friends cannot save you now Prepare to er come a walk up the hill with me Help Help Whispered Myra She hesitated a moment then swung herself out of the hammock and went in for her hat We climbed up a steep path which led to the rock village above us Simpson had told us that we must see the village still more earnestly he had begged us to see Corsica The view of Corsica was to be obtained from a point some miles up too far to go before lunch However we can always say we saw it I reassured Myra From this distance you can t be certain of recognizing an island you don t know Any small cloud on the horizon will do I know it on the map Yes but it looks quite different in real life The great thing is to be able to assure Simpson at lunch that the Corsican question is now closed When we re a little higher up I shall say Surely that s Corsica and you ll say Not Corsica as though you d rather expected the Isle of Wight and then it ll be all over Hallo We had just passed the narrow archway leading into the courtyard of the village and were following the path up the hill But in that moment of passing we had been observed Behind us a dozen village children now trailed eagerly Oh the dears cried Myra But I think we made a mistake to bring them I said severely No one is fonder of our one two three I make it eleven our eleven children than I am but there are times when Father and Mother want to be alone I m sorry dear I thought you d be so proud to have them all with you I am proud of them To reflect that all the one two I make it thirteen all these thirteen are ours is very inspiring But I don t like people to think that we cannot afford our youngest our little Philomene shoes and stockings And Giuseppe should have washed his face since last Friday These are small matters but they are very trying to a father Have you any coppers asked Myra suddenly You forget their pocket money last week One two three I cannot possibly afford one two three four Myra I do wish you d count them definitely and tell me how many we have One likes to know I cannot afford pocket money for more than a dozen Ten She took a franc from me and gave it to the biggest girl Anne Marie our first and getting on so nicely with her French Rapidly she explained what was to be done with it Anne Marie s look of intense rapture slowly straightening itself to one of ordinary gratitude as the financial standing of the other nine in the business became clear Then we waved farewell to our family and went on High above the village a thousand feet above the sea we rested and looked down upon the silvery olives stretching into the blue and more particularly upon one red roof which stood up amid the grey green trees That s the Cardews villa I said Myra was silent When Myra married me she promised to love honour and write all my thank you very much letters for me for we agreed before the ceremony that the word obey should mean nothing more than that There are two sorts of T Y V M letters the Thank you very much for asking us we shall be delighted to come and the Thank you very much for having us we enjoyed it immensely With these off my mind I could really concentrate on my work or my short mashie shots or whatever was of importance But there was now a new kind of letter to write and one rather outside the terms of our original understanding A friend of mine had told his friends the Cardews that we were going out to the Riviera and would let them know when we arrived and we had arrived a week ago It isn t at all an easy letter to write said Myra It s practically asking a stranger for hospitality Let us say indicating our readiness to accept it It sounds better Myra smiled slowly to herself Dear missus Cardew she said we are ready for lunch when you are Yours sincerely Well that s the idea And then what about the others If the Cardews are going to be nice we don t want to leave Dahlia and all of them out of it I thought it over carefully for a little What you want to do I said at last is to write a really long letter to missus Cardew acquainting her with all the facts Keep nothing back from her I should begin by dwelling on the personnel of our little company My husband and I you should say are not alone We have also with us mister and missus Archibald Mannering a delightful couple mister A Mannering is something in the Territorials when he is not looking after his estate His wife is a great favourite in the county Next I have to introduce to you mister Thomas Todd an agreeable young bachelor mister Thomas Todd is in the Sucking a ruler and looking out of the window Department of the Admiralty by whose exertions so long as we preserve the two Todds to one formula or excluding Canadian Todds sixteen to ten Britannia rules the waves Lastly there is mister Samuel Simpson Short of sight but warm of heart and with on a bad pitch a nasty break from the off mister S Simpson is a litterateur of some eminence but little circulation combining on the cornet intense wind power with no execution and on the golf course an endless enthusiasm with only an occasional contact This dear missus Cardew is our little party I say nothing of my husband Go on smiled Myra You have still to explain how we invite ourselves to lunch We don t we leave that to her All we do is to give a list of the meals in which in the ordinary course we are wont to indulge together with a few notes on our relative capacities at each Perhaps you wind up it is at luncheon time that as a party we show to the best advantage Some day my dear missus Cardew we must all meet at lunch You will then see that I have exaggerated neither my husband s appetite nor the light conversation of my brother nor the power of apology should any little contretemps occur of mister Samuel Simpson Let us I say meet at lunch Let us I took out my watch suddenly Come on I said getting up and giving a hand to Myra we shall only just be in time for it V THE GAMESTERS It s about time said Simpson one evening that we went to the tables and er he adjusted his spectacles had a little flutter We all looked at him in silent admiration Oh Samuel sighed Myra and I promised your aunt that you shouldn t gamble while you were away But my dear Myra it s the first thing the fellows at the club ask you when you ve been to the Riviera if you ve had any luck Well you ve had a lot of luck said Archie Several times when you ve been standing on the heights and calling attention to the beautiful view below I ve said to myself One push and he s a deader but something some mysterious agency within has kept me back All the fellows at the club Simpson is popularly supposed to belong to a Fleet Street Toilet and Hairdressing Club where for three guineas a year he gets shaved every day and has his hair cut whenever Myra insists On the many occasions when he authorizes a startling story of some well known statesman with the words My dear old chap I know it for a fact I heard it at the club to day from a friend of his then we know that once again the barber s assistant has been gossiping over the lather Do think Samuel I interrupted how much more splendid if you could be the only man who had seen Monte Carlo without going inside the rooms And then when the hairdresser when your friends at the club ask if you ve had any luck at the tables you just say coldly What tables Preferably in Latin said Archie Quae mensae But it was obviously no good arguing with him Besides we were all keen enough to go We needn t lose said Myra We might win Good idea said Thomas He lit his pipe and added Simpson was telling me about his system last night At least he was just beginning when I went to sleep He applied another match to his pipe and went on as if the idea had suddenly struck him Perhaps it was only his internal system he meant I didn t wait Samuel you are quite well inside aren t you Quite Myra But I have invented a sort of system for roulette which we might There s only one system which is any good pronounced Archie It s the system by which when you ve lost all your own money you turn to the man next to you and say Lend me a louis dear old chap till Christmas I ve forgotten my purse No systems said Dahlia Let s make a collection and put it all on one number and hope it will win Dahlia had obviously been reading novels about people who break the bank It s as good a way of losing as any other said Archie Let s do it for our first gamble anyway Simpson as our host shall put the money on I as his oldest friend shall watch him to see that he does it What s the number to be We all thought hard for several moments Samuel what s your age asked Myra at last Right off the board said Thomas You re not really more than thirty six Myra whispered to him Tell me as a secret Peter s nearly two said Dahlia Do you think you could nearly put our money on two asked Archie I once made seventeen I said On that never to be forgotten day when I went in first with Archie That settles it Here s to the highest score of The Rabbits wicket keeper To morrow afternoon we put our money on seventeen Simpson you have between now and three point thirty to morrow to perfect your French delivery of the magic word dix sept I went to bed a proud but anxious man that night It was my famous score which had decided the figure that was to bring us fortune and yet and yet Suppose eighteen turned up The remorse the bitterness If only I should tell myself if only we had run three instead of two for that cut to square leg Suppose it were sixteen Why oh why I should groan did I make the scorer put that bye down as a hit Suppose it were thirty four But there my responsibility ended If it were going to be thirty four they should have used one of Archie s scores and made a good job of it At three point thirty next day we were in the fatal building I should like to pause here and describe my costume to you which was a quiet grey in the best of taste but Myra says that if I do this I must describe hers too a feat beyond me Sufficient that she looked dazzling that as a party we were remarkably well dressed and that Simpson murmuring dix sept to himself at intervals led the way through the rooms till he found a table to his liking Aren t you excited whispered Myra to me Frightfully I said and left my mouth well open I don t quite know what picture of the event Myra and I had conjured up in our minds but I fancy it was one something like this At the entrance into the rooms of such a large and obviously distinguished party there would be a slight sensation among the crowd and way would be made for us at the most important table It would then leak out that Chevalier Simpson the tall poetical looking gentleman in the middle my dear had brought with him no less a sum than thirty francs with which to break the bank and that he proposed to do this in one daring coup At this news the players at the other tables would hastily leave their winnings or losings and crowd round us Chevalier Simpson pale but controlled would then place his money on seventeen dix sept he would say to the croupier to make it quite clear and the ball would be spun As it slowed down the tension in the crowd would increase Mon Dieu a woman would cry in a shrill voice there would be guttural exclamations from Germans at the edge of the crowd strong men would swoon At last a sudden shriek and the croupier s voice trembling for the first time for thirty years Dix sept Then gold and notes would be pushed at the Chevalier He would stuff his pockets with them he would fill his hat with them we others we would stuff our pockets too The bank would send out for more money There would be loud cheers from all the company with the exception of one man who had put five francs on sixteen and had shot himself and we should be carried that is to say we four men shoulder high to the door while by the deserted table Myra and Dahlia clung to each other weeping tears of happiness Something like that What happened was different As far as I could follow it was this Over the heads of an enormous badly dressed and utterly indifferent crowd Simpson handed his thirty francs to the croupier Dix sept he said The croupier with his rake pushed the money on to seventeen Another croupier with his rake pulled it off again and stuck to it The day s fun was over What did win asked Myra some minutes later when the fact that we should never see our money again had been brought home to her Zero said Archie I sighed heavily My usual score I said not my highest VI THE RECORD OF IT I shall be glad to see Peter again said Dahlia as she folded up her letter from home Peter s previous letter dictated to his nurse secretary had according to Archie been full of good things Cross examination of the proud father however had failed to reveal anything more stirring than I love mummy and er so on We were sitting in the loggia after what I don t call breakfast all of us except Simpson who was busy with a mysterious package We had not many days left and I was beginning to feel that personally I should not be sorry to see things like porridge again Each to his taste The time has passed absurdly quickly said Myra We don t seem to have done anything except enjoy ourselves I mean anything specially Rivierish But it s been heavenly We ve done lots of Rivierish things I protested If you ll be quiet a moment I ll tell you some These were some of the things one We had been to the Riviera Nothing could take away from that We had the labels on our luggage two We had lost heavily thirty francs at the Tables This alone justified the journey three Myra had sat next to a Prince at lunch Of course she might have done this in London but so far there has been no great rush of Princes to our little flat Dukes Mayors Companions of saint Michael and saint George certainly but somehow not Princes four Simpson had done the short third hole at Mt Agel in three His first had cleverly dislodged the ball from the piled up tee his second a sudden nick had set it rolling down the hill to the green and the third an accidental putt had sunk it five Myra and I had seen Corsica Question six And finally and best of all we had sat in the sun under a blue sky above a blue sea and watched the oranges and lemons grow So though we had been to but few of the famous beauty spots around we had had a delightfully lazy time and as proof that we had not really been at Brighton there were as I have said the luggage labels But we were to be able to show further proof At this moment Simpson came out of the house his face beaming with excitement his hands carefully concealing something behind his back Guess what I ve got he said eagerly The sack said Thomas Your new bests said Archie Something that will interest us all helped Simpson I withdraw my suggestion said Archie Something we ought to have brought with us all along More money said Myra The tension was extreme It was obvious that our consuming anxiety would have to be relieved very speedily To avoid a riot Thomas went behind Simpson s back and took his surprise away from him A camera he said Good idea Simpson was all over himself with bon hommy I suddenly thought of it the other night he said smiling round at all of us in his happiness and I was just going to wake Thomas up to tell him when I thought I d keep it a secret So I wrote to a friend of mine and asked him to send me out one and some films and things just as a surprise for you Samuel you are a dear said Myra looking at him lovingly You see I thought Myra you d like to have some records of the place because they re so jolly to look back on and er I m not quite sure how you work it but I expect some of you know and er Come on said Myra I ll show you She retired with Simpson to a secluded part of the loggia and helped him put the films in Nothing can save us said Archie We are going to be taken together in a group Simpson will send it to one of the picture papers and we shall appear as Another Merry Little Party of Well known Sun seekers Names from left to right Blank blank mister Archibald Mannering blank blank I d better go and brush my hair Simpson returned to us nervous and fully charged with advice Right Myra I see That ll be all right Oh look here do you oh yes I see Right Now then wait a bit oh yes I ve got it Now then what shall we have first A group Take the house and the garden and the village said Thomas You ll see plenty of us afterwards The first one is bound to be a failure I pointed out Rather let him fail at us who are known to be beautiful than at the garden which has its reputation yet to make Afterwards when he has got the knack he will be able to do justice to the scenery Archie joined us again followed by the bull dog We grouped ourselves picturesquely That looks ripping said Simpson Oh look here Myra do you No don t come you ll spoil the picture I suppose you have to oh it s all right I think I ve got it I shan t try to look handsome this time said Archie it s not worth it I shall just put an ordinary blurred expression on Now are you ready Don t move Quite still please quite It s instantaneous you know said Myra gently This so unnerved Simpson that he let the thing off without any further warning before we had time to get our expressions natural That was all right Myra wasn t it he said proudly I m I m afraid you had your hand over the lens Samuel dear Our new photographic series Palms of the Great No one mister S Simpson s murmured Archie It wouldn t have been a very good one anyhow I said encouragingly It wasn t typical Dahlia should have had an orange in her hand and Myra might have been resting her cheek against a cactus Try it again Simpson and get a little more colour into it He tried again and got a lot more colour into it Strictly speaking said Myra sadly you ought to have got it on to a new film Simpson looked in horror at the back of his camera found that he had forgotten to turn the handle apologized profusely and wound up very gingerly till the number two approached Now then he said looking up and found himself alone As I write this in London I have Simpson s album in front of me Should you ever do us the honour of dining with us as I hope you will and which seems impossible should there ever come a moment when the conversation runs low and you are revolving in your mind whether it is worth while asking us if we have been to any theatres lately then I shall produce the album and you will be left in no doubt that we are just back from the Riviera You will see oranges and lemons and olives and cactuses and palms blue sky if you have enough imagination and still bluer sea picturesque villas curious effects of rocks distant backgrounds of mountain and on the last page the clever kindly face of Simpson The whole affair will probably bore you to tears But with Myra and me the case of course is different We find these things as Simpson said very jolly to look back on II MEN OF LETTERS MEN OF LETTERS JOHN PENQUARTO A TALE OF LITERARY LIFE IN LONDON Modelled on the hundred best Authors I John Penquarto looked round his diminutive bed sitting room with a feeling of excitement not unmixed with awe So this was London The new life had begun With a beating heart he unpacked his bag and set out his simple belongings First his books his treasured books where should he put them It was comforting to think that wherever they stood they would be within reach of his hand as he lay in bed He placed them on the window sill and read their titles again reverently Half Hours with our Water Beetles The Fretworker s Companion and Strenuous Days in Simla He owed everything to them And what an air they gave the room But not such an air as was given by his other treasure the photograph of Mary Mary He had only met her once and that was twenty years ago at his native Polwollop He had gone to the big house with a message for mister Trevena her ladyship s butler Mother s respects and she has found the other shirt front and will send it up as soon as it is dry He had often taken a similar message for missus Penquarto did the washing for the upper servants at the Hall but somehow he had known that to day was going to be different There just inside the gates was Mary He was only six but even then he knew that never would he see again anything so beautiful She was five but there was something in her manner of holding herself and the imperious tilt of her head which made her seem almost five and a half I m Mary she said He wanted to say that he was John but could not He stood there tongue tied I love you she went on His heart beat tumultuously He felt suffocated He longed to say So do I but was afraid that it was not good English Even then he knew that he must be a writer when he grew up She leant forward and kissed him He realized suddenly that he was in love The need for self expression was strong upon him Shyly he brought out his last acid drop and shared it with her He had never seen her since but even now twenty years after he could not eat an acid drop without emotion and a whole bag of them brought the scene back so visibly as to be almost a pain Yes he was to be a writer there could be no doubt about that Everybody had noticed it The Vicar had said Johnny will never do any good at Polwollop I fear and the farmer for whom John scared rooks had said Thiccy la ad seems daft like and one after another of missus Penquarto s friends had given similar testimony And now here he was at twenty six in the little bed sitting room in Bloomsbury ready to write the great novel which should take London by storm Polwollop seemed a hundred years away Feverishly he seized pen and paper and began to wonder what to write II It was near the Albert Memorial that the great inspiration came to him some weeks later Those had been weeks of mingled hope and despair of hope as he had fondled again his treasured books and read their titles or gazed at the photograph of Mary of despair as he had taken off his belt and counted out his rapidly decreasing stock of money or reflected that he was as far from completing his novel as ever Sometimes in the search for an idea he had frequented the restaurants where the great Samuel Johnson himself had eaten and sometimes he had frequented other restaurants where even the great Samuel Johnson himself had been unable to eat Often he had gone into the British Museum and leant against a mummy case or taken a bus to Chelsea and pressed his forehead against the brass plate which marked Carlyle s house but no inspiration had come And then suddenly quite close to the Albert Memorial he knew He would write a novel about a boy called William who had lived in Cornwall and who came to London and wrote a novel a novel of which The Westminster Gazette said This novel undoubtedly places the author in the front rank of living novelists William s novel would be a realistic account of yes that was it of a boy called Henry who had lived in Cornwall and who came to London and wrote a novel a novel of which The Morning Post said By this novel the author has indubitably established his claim to be reckoned among the few living novelists who count But stay What should this novel of Henry s be about It would be necessary to describe it For an hour he wrestled with the problem and then he had another inspiration Henry s novel would be about a boy called Thomas who had lived in Cornwall and who came to London and wrote a novel about a boy called Stephen who had lived in Cornwall and who came to London and wrote a novel about a boy called Michael who had lived in Cornwall and who came to London and wrote a novel about a boy called Peter who had lived in Cornwall and And so on And every one of the novels would establish the author s right to be reckoned et cetera and place him undoubtedly in the very front rank It was a stupendous idea For a moment John was almost paralysed at contemplation of it There seemed to be no end to his novel as he had planned it Was it too much for his powers There was only one way to find out He hurried back to his bed sitting room seized a pen and began to write III It was two years later For the last fortnight John Penquarto had stopped counting the money in his belt There was none left For a fortnight now he had been living on the belt itself But a great hope had always sustained him One day he would hear from the publisher to whom he had sent his novel a year ago And now at last the letter had come and he was seated in the office of the great mister Pump himself His heart beat rapidly He felt suffocated Well mister Penquarto said the smiling publisher I may say at once that we like your novel We should have written before but we have only just finished reading it It is a little long about two million eight hundred thousand words I reckon it but I have a suggestion to make which will meet that difficulty I suggest that we publish it in half a dozen volumes stopping for the first volume at the Press notices of say Peter s novel We find that the public likes these continuous books About terms We will send an agreement along to morrow Naturally as this is a first book we can only pay a nominal sum on account of royalties Say ten thousand pounds How will that suit you With a heart still beating John left the office five minutes later and bought a new belt Then he went to a restaurant where Goldsmith had never been and ordered a joint and two veg Success had come IV I should like to dwell upon the weeks which followed I should like to tell of John s emotion when he saw his first proofs and of the printer s emotion when he saw what a mess John had made of them I should like to describe how my hero s heart beat during the anxious days of waiting to picture to you his pride at the arrival of his six free copies and his landlady s surprise when he presented her with one Above all I should like to bring home to you the eagerness with which he bought and opened The Times Literary Supplement and read his first review William Trewulliam The First Phase By John Penquarto seven one two by five one four eight hundred ninety six pp Albert Pump nines n I have no time to go into these matters nor have I time in which to give at length his later Press cuttings in which there was displayed a unanimity of opinion that John Penquarto was now in the front rank of living novelists one of the limited number whose work really counted I must hurry on It was a week after the publication of William Trewulliam the novel which had taken all London by storm In all the drawing rooms of Mayfair in all the clubs of Pall Mall people were asking each other Who is John Penquarto Nobody knew save one Lady Mary knew It was not the name Penquarto which had told her it was yes you have guessed the scene at the beginning of the book when William Trewulliam meets the little Anne and shares his last raspberry drop with her Even under this disguise she recognized that early meeting She pierced beneath the imagination of the novelist to the recollection of the man John Penquarto of course Now she remembered the name It had always been a mystery to her friends why Lady Mary had never married No girl in Society had been more eagerly courted It was whispered that already she had refused more than one Archbishop three Newspaper Proprietors and a couple of Dukes Something she scarcely knew what told her that this was not love She must wait As she dressed to go to the Duchess of Bilberry s At Home she wondered if she would ever meet John Penquarto again and if he had altered Mary It was John speaking He had seen her the moment she came in at the door Something was it the Duchess s champagne at dinner had reminded him of the acid drop they had eaten together and this had brought back his memories in a flood To night he would meet her again He knew it instinctively Besides it was like this that William Trewulliam had met Anne again and Henry Polhenery had met Sarah and Thomas Pentummas had met Alice and well anyhow he knew John It was Mary speaking Perhaps you had guessed You knew me This is John It was his turn I knew you Said Mary Do you remember Mary blushed and John did not deviate from the healthy red colour which he had maintained throughout the conversation In spite of his success he was never quite at ease in society at this period of his life Nor were Henry Polhenery and Thomas Pentummas They remained handsome but awkward which was why women loved them so I love you John speaking I think I must have always loved you Mary going it He took her hand in his Nobody noticed them They were as much alone as if they had been at the National Gallery together Many of the guests were going through similar scenes of recognition and love making others were asking each other if they had read William Trewulliam yet and lying about it others again were making for the buffet John and Mary had the world to themselves V They were married a month later John who did not look his best in a frock coat had pleaded for a quiet wedding and only the Duchess of Bilberry and mister Pump were present at the simple ceremony which took place at the Bloomsbury registry office Then the happy couple drove away And where are they spending the honeymoon Ah do you need to ask At Greenwich No fathead not at Greenwich At Clacton on Sea Look here I don t believe you re trying Have another shot Yes dear reader you are right They are going back to Polwollop It might be a good plan to leave them there THE COMPLETE DRAMATIST I take it that every able bodied man and woman in this country wants to write a play Since the news first got about that Orlando What s his name made Lfifty thousand out of The Crimson Sponge there has been a feeling that only through the medium of the stage can literary art find its true expression The successful playwright is indeed a man to be envied Leaving aside for the moment the question of super tax the prizes which fall to his lot are worth something of an effort He sees his name correctly spelt on buses which go to such different spots as Hammersmith and West Norwood and his name spelt incorrectly beneath the photograph of somebody else in The Illustrated Butler He is a welcome figure at the garden parties of the elect who are always ready to encourage him by accepting free seats for his play actor managers nod to him editors allow him to contribute without charge to a symposium on the price of golf balls In short he becomes a prominent figure in London Society and if he is not careful somebody will say so But even the unsuccessful dramatist has his moments I knew a young man who married somebody else s mother and was allowed by her fourteen gardeners to amuse himself sometimes by rolling the tennis court It was an unsatisfying life and when rash acquaintances asked him what he did he used to say that he was for the Bar Now he says he is writing a play and we look round the spacious lawns and terraces and marvel at the run his last one must have had However I assume that you who read this are actually in need of the dibs Your play must be not merely a good play but a successful one How shall this success be achieved Frankly I cannot always say If you came to me and said I am on the Stock Exchange and bulls are going down or up or sideways or whatever it might be there s no money to be made in the City nowadays and I want to write a play instead How shall I do it well I couldn t help you But suppose you said I m fond of writing my people always say my letters home are good enough for Punch I ve got a little idea for a play about a man and a woman and another woman and but perhaps I d better keep the plot a secret for the moment Anyhow it s jolly exciting and I can do the dialogue all right The only thing is I don t know anything about technique and stagecraft and the three unities and that sort of rot Can you give me a few hints suppose you spoke to me like this then I could do something for you My dear Sir I should reply or Madam you have come to the right shop Lend me your ear for ten minutes and you shall learn just what stagecraft is And I should begin with a short homily on SOLILOQUY If you ever read your Shakespeare and no dramatist should despise the works of another dramatist he may always pick up something in them which may be useful for his next play if you ever read your Shakespeare it is possible that you have come across this passage Enter Hamlet Ham To be or not to be And so on in the same vein for some thirty lines These few remarks are called a soliloquy being addressed rather to the world in general than to any particular person on the stage Now the object of this soliloquy is plain The dramatist wished us to know the thoughts which were passing through Hamlet s mind and it was the only way he could think of in which to do it Of course a really good actor can often give a clue to the feelings of a character simply by facial expression There are ways of shifting the eyebrows distending the nostrils and exploring the lower molars with the tongue by which it is possible to denote respectively Surprise Defiance and Doubt Indeed irresolution being the keynote of Hamlet s soliloquy a clever player could to some extent indicate the whole thirty lines by a silent working of the jaw But at the same time it would be idle to deny that he would miss the finer shades of the dramatist s meaning The insolence of office and the spurns to take only one line would tax the most elastic face So the soliloquy came into being We moderns however see the absurdity of it In real life no one thinks aloud or in an empty room The up to date dramatist must certainly avoid this hallmark of the old fashioned play What then is to be done If it be granted first that the thoughts of a certain character should be known to the audience and secondly that soliloquy or the habit of thinking aloud is in opposition to modern stage technique how shall a soliloquy be avoided without damage to the play Well there are more ways than one and now we come to what is meant by stagecraft Stagecraft is the art of getting over these and other difficulties and if possible getting over them in a showy manner so that people will say How remarkable his stagecraft is for so young a writer when otherwise they mightn t have noticed it at all Thus in this play we have been talking about an easy way of avoiding Hamlet s soliloquy would be for Ophelia to speak first Oph What are you thinking about my lord Ham I am wondering whether to be or not to be whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer And so on till you get to the end when Ophelia might say Ah yes or something non committal of that sort This would be an easy way of doing it but it would not be the best way for the reason that it is too easy to call attention to itself What you want is to make it clear that you are conveying Hamlet s thoughts to the audience in rather a clever manner That this can now be done we have to thank the well known inventor of the telephone I forget his name The telephone has revolutionized the stage with its aid you can convey anything you like across the footlights In the old badly made play it was frequently necessary for one of the characters to take the audience into his confidence Having disposed of my uncle s body he would say to the stout lady in the third row of the stalls I now have leisure in which to search for the will But first to lock the door lest I should be interrupted by Harold Wotnott In the modern well constructed play he simply rings up an imaginary confederate and tells him what he is going to do Could anything be more natural Let us to give an example of how this method works go back again to the play we have been discussing Enter Hamlet He walks quickly across the room to the telephone and takes up the receiver impatiently Ham Hallo Hallo I want double nine hal lo I want double nine two hal lo Double nine two three Elsinore Double nine yes Hallo is that you Horatio Hamlet speaking I say I ve been wondering about this business To be or not to be that is the question whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows What No Hamlet speaking What Aren t you Horatio I want double nine two three sorry Is that you Exchange You gave me double five I want double nine Hallo is that you Horatio Hamlet speaking I ve been wondering about this business To be or not to be that is the What No I said To be or not to be No be b e Yes that s right To be or not to be that is the question whether tis nobler And so on You see how effective it is But there is still another way of avoiding the soliloquy which is sometimes used with good results It is to let Hamlet if that happen to be the name of your character enter with a small dog pet falcon mongoose tame bear or whatever animal is most in keeping with the part and confide in this animal such sorrows hopes or secret history as the audience has got to know This has the additional advantage of putting the audience immediately in sympathy with your hero How sweet of him all the ladies say to tell his little bantam about it If you are not yet tired as I am of the Prince of Denmark I will explain for the last time how a modern author might re write his speech Enter Hamlet with his favourite boar hound Ham to B H To be or not to be ah Fido Fido That is the question eh old Fido boy Whether tis nobler in how now a rat Rats Fido fetch em in the mind to suffer the slings and down Sir arrows put it down Arrows of drop it Fido good old dog And so on Which strikes me as rather sweet and natural Let us now pass on to the very important question of EXITS AND ENTRANCES To the young playwright the difficulty of getting his characters on to the stage would seem much less than the difficulty of finding them something to say when they are there He writes gaily and without hesitation Enter Lord Arthur Fluffinose and only then begins to bite the end of his penholder and gaze round his library for inspiration Yet it is on that one word Enter that his reputation for dramatic technique will hang Why did Lord Arthur Fluffinose enter The obvious answer that the firm which is mentioned in the programme as supplying his trousers would be annoyed if he didn t is not enough nor is it enough to say that the whole plot of the piece hinges on him and that without him the drama would languish What the critic wants to know is why Lord Arthur chose that very moment to come in the very moment when Lady Larkspur was left alone in the oak beamed hall of Larkspur Towers Was it only a coincidence And if the young dramatist answers callously Yes it simply shows that he has no feeling for the stage whatever In that case I needn t go on with this article However it will be more convenient to assume dear reader that in your play Lord Arthur had a good reason for coming in If that be so he must explain it It won t do to write like this Enter Lord Arthur Lady Larkspur starts suddenly and turns towards him Lady Larkspur Arthur You here He gives a nod of confirmation She pauses a moment and then with a sudden passionate movement flings herself into his arms Take me away Arthur I can t bear this life any longer Larkspur bit me again this morning for the third time I want to get away from it all Swoons The subsequent scene may be so pathetic that on the hundredth night it is still bringing tears to the eyes of the fireman but you must not expect to be treated as a serious dramatist You will see this for yourself if you consider the passage as it should properly have been written Enter Lord Arthur Fluffinose Lady Larkspur looks at him with amazement Lady Larkspur Arthur what are you doing here Lord Arthur I caught the two point three from town It gets in at three point thirty seven and I walked over from the station It s only a mile At this point he looks at the grandfather clock in the corner and the audience following his eyes sees that it is seven minutes to four which appears delightfully natural I came to tell Larkspur to sell Bungoes They are going down Lady Larkspur folding her hands over her chest and gazing broodingly at the footlights Larkspur Lord Arthur anxiously What is it Suddenly Has he been ill treating you again Lady Larkspur flinging herself into his arms Oh Arthur Arthur take me away And so on But it may well be that Lord Larkspur has an intrigue of his own with his secretary Miss Devereux and if their big scene is to take place on the stage too the hall has got to be cleared for them in some way Your natural instinct will be to say Exeunt Fluffinose and Lady Larkspur R Enter Lord Larkspur and Miss Devereux L This is very immature even if you are quite clear as to which side of the stage is L and which is R You must make the evolutions seem natural Thus Enter from the left Miss Devereux She stops in surprise at seeing Lord Arthur and holds out her hand Miss D Why Lord Arthur Whatever Lord A How d you do I ve just run down to tell Lord Larkspur to Miss D He s in the library At least he Lord A taking out his watch Ah then perhaps I d better Exit by door on left Miss D to Lady L Have you seen The Times about here There is a set of verses in the Financial Supplement which Lord Larkspur wanted to She wanders vaguely round the room Enter Lord Larkspur by door at back Why here you are I ve just sent Lord Arthur into the library to Lord L I went out to speak to the gardener about Lady L Ah then I ll go and tell Arthur Exit to library leaving Miss Devereux and Lord Larkspur alone And there you are You will of course appreciate that the unfinished sentences not only save time but also make the manoeuvring very much more natural So far I have been writing as if you were already in the thick of your play but it may well be that the enormous difficulty of getting the first character on has been too much for you How you may be wondering are you to begin your masterpiece The answer to this will depend upon the length of the play for upon the length depends the hour at which the curtain rises If yours is an eight point fifteen play you may be sure that the stalls will not fill up till eight point thirty and you should therefore let loose the lesser paid members of the cast on the opening scene keeping your fifty pounders in reserve In an eight point forty five play the audience may be plunged into the drama at once But this is much the more difficult thing to do and for the beginner I should certainly recommend the eight point fifteen play for which the recipe is simple As soon as the lights go down and while the bald stout gentleman is kicking our top hat out of his way treading heavily on our toes and wheezing Sorry sorry as he struggles to his seat a buzz begins behind the curtain What the players are saying is not distinguishable but a merry girlish laugh rings out now and then followed by the short sardonic chuckle of an obvious man of the world Then the curtain rises and it is apparent that we are assisting at an At Home of considerable splendour Most of the characters seem to be on the stage and for once we do not ask how they got there We presume they have all been invited Thus you have had no difficulty with your entrances As the chatter dies down a chord is struck on the piano The Bishop of Sploshington Charming Quite one of my favourites Do play it again Relapses into silence for the rest of the evening The Duchess of Southbridge to Lord Reggie Oh Reggie what did you say Lord Reggie putting up his eyeglass Said I d bally well top hole what don cherknow Lady Evangeline to Lady Violet as they walk across the stage Oh I must tell you what that funny mister Danby said Doesn t Lady Violet none the less trills with happy laughter Prince von Ichdien the well known Ambassador loudly to an unnamed gentleman What your country ought to do He finishes his remarks in the lip language which the unnamed gentleman seems to understand At any rate he nods several times There is more girlish laughter more buzz and more deaf and dumb language Then Lord Tuppeny Well what about auction Amid murmurs of You ll play Field Marshal and Auction Archbishop the crowd drifts off leaving the hero and heroine alone in the middle of the stage And then you can begin But now I must give you a warning You will never be a dramatist until you have learnt the technique of MEALS In spite of all you can do in the way of avoiding soililoquies and getting your characters on and off the stage in a dramatic manner a time will come when you realize sadly that your play is not a bit like life after all Then is the time to introduce a meal on the stage A stage meal is popular because it proves to the audience that the actors even when called Charles Hawtrey or Owen Nares are real people just like you and me Look at mister Bourchier eating we say excitedly to each other in the pit having had a vague idea up till then that an actor lived like a god on praise and greasepaint and his photograph in the papers Another cup won t you says Miss Gladys Cooper No thank you says mister Dennis Eadie dash it it s exactly what we do at home ourselves And when to clinch matters the dramatist makes mister Gerald du Maurier light a real cigarette in the Third Act then he can flatter himself that he has indeed achieved the ambition of every stage writer and brought the actual scent of the hay across the footlights But there is a technique to be acquired in this matter as in everything else within the theatre The great art of the stage craftsman as I have already shown is to seem natural rather than to be natural Let your actors have tea by all means but see that it is a properly histrionic tea This is how it should go Hostess How do you do You ll have some tea won t you Rings bell Guest Thank you Enter Butler Hostess Tea please Matthews Butler impassively Yes m lady This is all he says during the play so he must try and get a little character into it in order that The Era may remark mister Thompson was excellent as Matthews However his part is not over yet for he returns immediately followed by three footmen just as it happened when you last called on the Duchess and sets out the tea Hostess holding up the property lump of sugar in the tongs Sugar Guest luckily No thanks Hostess replaces lump and inclines empty teapot over tray for a moment then hands him a cup painted brown inside thus deceiving the gentleman with the telescope in the upper circle Guest touching his lips with the cup and then returning it to its saucer Well I must be going Re enter Butler and three Footmen who remove the tea things Hostess to Guest Good bye so glad you could come Exit Guest His visit has been short but it has been very thrilling while it lasted Tea is the most usual meal on the stage for the reason that it is the least expensive the property lump of sugar being dusted and used again on the next night For a stage dinner a certain amount of genuine sponge cake has to be made up to look like fish chicken or cutlet In novels the hero has often pushed his meals away untasted but no stage hero would do anything so unnatural as this The etiquette is to have two bites before the butler and the three footmen whisk away the plate Two bites are made and the bread is crumbled with an air of great eagerness indeed one feels that in real life the guest would clutch hold of the footman and say Half a mo old chap I haven t nearly finished but the actor is better schooled than this Besides the thing is coming back again as chicken directly But it is the cigarette which chiefly has brought the modern drama to its present state of perfection Without the stage cigarette many an epigram would pass unnoticed many an actor s hands would be much more noticeable and the man who works the fireproof safety curtain would lose even the small amount of excitement which at present attaches to his job Now although it is possible in the case of a few men at the top of the profession to leave the conduct of the cigarette entirely to the actor you will find it much more satisfactory to insert in the stage directions the particular movements with match and so forth that you wish carried out Let us assume that Lord Arthur asks Lord John what a cynic is the question of what a cynic is having arisen quite naturally in the course of the plot Let us assume further that you wish Lord John to reply A cynic is a man who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing It has been said before but you may feel that it is quite time it was said again besides for all the audience knows Lord John may simply be quoting Now this answer even if it comes quite fresh to the stalls will lose much of its effect if it is said without the assistance of a cigarette Try it for yourself Lord John A cynic is a man who et cetera Rotten Now try again Lord John A cynic is a man who et cetera Lights cigarette No even that is not good Once more Lord John lighting cigarette A cynic is a man who et cetera Better but leaves too much to the actor Well I see I must tell you Lord John taking out gold cigarette case from his left hand upper waistcoat pocket A cynic my dear Arthur he opens case deliberately puts cigarette in mouth and extracts gold match box from right hand trouser is a man who strikes match knows the price of lights cigarette everything and standing with match in one hand and cigarette in the other the value of pff blows out match of inhales deeply from cigarette and blows out a cloud of smoke nothing It makes a different thing of it altogether Of course on the actual night the match may refuse to strike and Lord John may have to go on saying a man who a man who a man who until the ignition occurs but even so it will still seem delightfully natural to the audience as if he were making up the epigram as he went along while as for blowing the match out he can hardly fail to do that in one The cigarette of course will be smoked at other moments than epigrammatic ones but on these other occasions you will not need to deal so fully with it in the stage directions Duke lighting cigarette I trust Perkins that is enough You do not want to say Duke dropping ash on trousers It seems to me my love or Duke removing stray piece of tobacco from tongue What Ireland needs is still less Duke throwing away end of cigarette Show him in For this must remain one of the mysteries of the stage What happens to the stage cigarette when it has been puffed four times The stage tea of which a second cup is always refused the stage cutlet which is removed with the connivance of the guest after two mouthfuls the stage cigarette which nobody ever seems to want to smoke to the end thinking of these as they make their appearances in the houses of the titled one would say that the hospitality of the peerage was not a thing to make any great rush for But that would be to forget the butler and the three footmen Even a Duke cannot have everything And what his chef may lack in skill his butler more than makes up for in impassivity A POETRY RECITAL It has always been the privilege of Art to be patronized by Wealth and Rank Indeed if we literary and artistic strugglers were not asked out to afternoon tea sometimes by our millionaire acquaintances it is doubtful if we should be able to continue the struggle Recently a new and less expensive method of entertaining Genius has become fashionable in the best circles and the aspiring poet is now invited to the house of the Great not for the purpose of partaking of bodily refreshment himself but in order that he may afford spiritual refreshment to others In short he is given an opportunity of reciting his own works in front of the Fair the Rich and the Highly Born and making what he can out of it in the way of advertisement Let us imagine that we have been lucky enough to secure an invitation to one of Lady Poldoodle s Poetry At Homes at her charming little house in Berkeley Square The guests are all waiting their eyes fixed in eager anticipation on the black covered throne at the farther end of the room whereon each poet will sit to declaim his masterpiece when suddenly Lord Poldoodle is observed to be making his way cautiously towards a side door Fortunately he is stopped in time and dragged back to his seat next to the throne from which he rises a moment later to open the proceeding Ladies and gentlemen he says we are met here this afternoon in order to listen to some of our younger poets who will recite from their own works So far I have always managed to avoid so far I have been unavoidably prevented from attending on these occasions but I understand that the procedure is as follows Each poet will recite a short sample of his poetry after which no doubt you will go home and order from your bookseller a complete set of his works Lady Poldoodle goes quickly over to him and whispers vigorously I find I am wrong says our host Full sets of the author s works can be obtained on the way out There is however no compulsion in the matter and if you take my advice well well let us get on Our first poet here he puts on his glasses and reads from a paper on the table in front of him is mister Sydney Worple of whom you er have er doubtless all heard At any rate you will hear him now mister Sydney Worple tall and thin wearing the sort of tie which makes you think you must have seen him before steps forward amidst applause He falls back into the throne as if deep in thought and passes a hand across his hair mister Worple very suddenly Dawn at Surbiton Where says a frightened voice at the back H sh says Lady Poldoodle in a whisper Surbiton Surbiton is passed round the back seats Not that it is going to matter in the least mister Worple repeats the title and then recites in an intense voice these lines Out of the nethermost bonds of night Out of the gloom where the bats wings brush me Free from the crepitous doubts which crush me Forth I fare to the cool sunlight Forth to a world where the wind sweeps clean Where the smooth limbed ash to the blue stands bare And the gossamer spreads her opalled ware And Jones is catching the eight point fifteen After several more verses like this he bows and retires Lady Poldoodle still mechanically clapping says to her neighbour How beautiful Dawn at Surbiton Such a beautiful idea I think Wasn t it sublime answers the neighbour The wonderful contrast between the great pageant of nature and poor mister Jones catching always catching the eight point fifteen But Lord Poldoodle is rising again Our next poet he says is Miss Miranda Herrick whose work is so distinguished for its er its er distinction Miss Herrick dressed in pale green and wearing pincenez flutters in girlishly She gives a nervous little giggle pushes out her foot withdraws it and begins When I take my bath in the morning The audience wakes up with a start When you take your what says Lord Poldoodle Miss Herrick begins again starting this time with the title LIFE When I take my bath in the morning When I strip for the cool delight And the housemaid brings Me towels and things Do I reck of the coming night A materially minded man whispers to his neighbour that he always wonders what s for breakfast H sh she says for there is another verse to come When my hair comes down in the evening And my tired clothes swoon to the ground Do I bother my head As I leap in bed Of the truth which the dawn brings round In the uncomfortable pause which follows a voice is heard saying Does she and Lady Poldoodle asks kindly Is that all dear What more could there be says Miss Herrick with a sigh What more is there to say It is Life Life How true says the hostess But won t you give us something else That one ended so very suddenly After much inward and outward wrestling Miss Herrick announces A THOUGHT The music falls across the vale From nightingale to nightingale The owl within the ivied tree Makes love to me makes love to me But all the tadpoles in the pond Are dumb however fond I begin to think that there is something in a tadpole after all murmurs Lord Poldoodle to himself as the author wriggles her way out After all says one guest to another why shouldn t a tadpole make love as much as anybody else I think says her neighbour that the idea is of youth trying vainly to express itself or am I thinking of caterpillars Lord Poldoodle what is a tadpole exactly A tadpole he answers decisively is an extremely immature wriggling creature which is quite rightly dumb Now steps forward mister Horatio Bullfinch full of simple enthusiasm one of the London school He gives us his famous poem Berkeley Square The men who come from the north country Are tall and very fair The men who come from the south country Have hardly any hair But the only men in the world for me Are the men of Berkeley Square The sun may shine at Colchester The rain may rain at Penge From low hung skies the dawn may rise Broodingly on Stonehenge Knee deep in clover the lambs at Dover Nibble awhile and stare But there s only one place in the world for me Berkeley Berkeley Square And so on down to that magnificent last verse The skylark triumphs from the blue Above the barley fields at Loo The blackbird whistles loud and clear Upon the hills at Windermere But oh I simply LOVE the way Our organ grinder plays all day Lord Poldoodle rises to introduce mister Montagu Mott mister Mott he says is I am told our leading exponent of what is called vers libre which means well you will see what it means directly mister Mott a very ugly little man who tries to give you the impression that he is being ugly on purpose and could easily be beautiful if he were not above all that sort of thing announces the title of his masterpiece It is called Why Is the Fat Woman s Face So Red Well what else could you call it Why is the fat woman s face so red Is it because her stays are too tight Or because she wants to sneeze and has lost her pocket handkerchief Or only because her second son The engineer Is dying of cancer I cannot be certain Yet I sit here and ask myself Wonderingly Why is the fat woman s face so red It is generally recognized that in mister Mott we have a real poet There are loud cries of Encore mister Mott shakes his head I have written no more he says in a deep voice I have given you the result of three years work Perhaps in another three years He shrugs his shoulders and walks gloomingly out Such a sweet idea says Lady Poldoodle I sit here and ask myself wonderingly How true How very true I couldn t quite follow it dear says her neighbour frankly Did he marry her after all Lord Poldoodle looking slightly more cheerful gets once more on to his legs You will all be very glad to hear ah you will all be sorry to hear that we have only one more poet on our list this afternoon mister Cecil Willow the well known er poet mister Willow a well dressed young man fair and rather stout and a credit to any drawing room announces the subject of his poem Liberty Liberty what crimes have been committed in thy name murmurs Lord Poldoodle to himself LIBERTY There were two thrushes in a tree The one was tamed the other free Because his wings were clipped so small The tame one did not fly at all But sang to Heaven all the day The other shortly after flew away There were two women in a town The one was blonde the other brown The brown one pleased a Viscount s son Not Richard but the other one He gave her a delightful flat The blonde one loved a man called Alfred Spratt There were two Kings on thrones of gold The one was young the other old The young one s laws were wisely made Till someone took a hand grenade And threw it shouting Down with Kings The old one laid foundation stones and things How delightful says everybody How very delightful Thank you Lady Poldoodle for such a delightful afternoon THE PERILS OF REVIEWING A most unfortunate thing has happened to a friend of mine called to a friend of to a Well I suppose the truth will have to come out It happened to me Only don t tell anybody I reviewed a book the other day It is not often I do this because before one can review a book one has to or is supposed to read it which wastes a good deal of time Even that isn t an end of the trouble The article which follows is not really one s own for the wretched fellow who wrote the book is always trying to push his way in with his views on matrimony or the Sussex downs or whatever his ridiculous subject is He expects one to say mister Blank s treatment of Hilda s relations with her husband is masterly whereas what one wants to say is Putting mister Blank s book on one side we may consider the larger question whether and so consider it alone to the end of the column Well I reviewed mister Blank s book Rotundity As I expected the first draft had to be re headed A Corner of old London and used elsewhere mister Blank didn t get into it at all I kept promising myself a sentence Take Rotundity for instance the new novel by William Blank which et cetera but before I was ready for it the article was finished In my second draft realizing the dangers of delay I began at once This remarkable novel and continued so for a couple of sentences But on reading it through afterwards I saw at once that the first two sentences were out of place in an article that obviously ought to be called The Last Swallow so I cut them out sent The Last Swallow A Reverie to another Editor and began again The third time I was successful Of course in my review I said all the usual things I said that mister Blank s attitude to life was subjective rather than objective and a little lower down that it was objective rather than subjective I pointed out that in his treatment of the major theme he was a neo romanticist but I suggested that on the other hand he had nothing to learn from the Russians or the Russians had nothing to learn from him I forget which And finally I said and this is the cause of the whole trouble that Antoine Vaurelle s world famous classic and I looked it up in the encyclopedia world renowned classic Je Comprends Tout had been not without its influence on mister Blank It was a good review and the editor was pleased about it A few days later mister Blank wrote to say that curiously enough he had never read Je Comprends Tout It didn t seem to me very curious because I had never read it either but I thought it rather odd of him to confess as much to a stranger The only book of Vaurelle s which I had read was Consolatrice in an English translation However one doesn t say these things in a review Now I have a French friend Henri one of those annoying Frenchmen who talk English much better than I do and Henri for some extraordinary reason had seen my review He has to live in London now but his heart is in Paris and I imagine that every word of his beloved language which appears however casually in an English paper mysteriously catches his eye and brings the scent and sounds of the boulevards to him across the coffee cups So the next time I met him he shook me warmly by the hand and told me how glad he was that I was an admirer of Antoine Vaurelle s novels Who isn t I said with a shrug and to get the conversation on to safer ground I added hastily that in some ways I almost liked Consolatrice best He shook my hand again So did he A great book But of course he said one must read it in the original French It is the book of all others which loses by translation Of course I agreed Really I don t see what else I could have done Do you remember that wonderful phrase and he rattled it off Magnificent is it not Magnificent I said remembering an appointment instead Well I must be getting on Good bye And as I walked off I patted my forehead with my handkerchief and wondered why the day had grown so warm suddenly However the next day was even warmer Henri came to see me with a book under his arm We all have one special book of our own which we recommend to our acquaintances regarding the love of it as perhaps the best passport to our friendship This was Henri s He was about to test me I had read and admired his favourite Vaurelle in the original French Would I love his darling Laforgue My reputation as a man as a writer as a critic depended on it He handed me the book in French It is all there he said reverently as he gave it to me All your English masters they all come from him Perhaps most of all your But you shall tell me when you have read it You shall tell me whom most you seem to see there Your Meredith Your Shaw Your But you shall tell me I will tell you I said faintly And I ve got to tell him Don t think that I shall have any difficulty in reading the book Glancing through it just now I came across this Kate avez vous soupe avant le spectacle Non je n avais guere le coeur a manger Well that s easy enough But I doubt if it is one of the most characteristic passages It doesn t give you a clue to Laforgue s manner any more than Must I sit here mother Yes without a doubt you must tells you all that you want to know about Meredith There s more in it than that And I ve got to tell him But fancy holding forth on an author s style after reading him laboriously with a dictionary However I must do my best and in my more hopeful moments I see the conversation going like this Well Oh wonderful With emotion Really wonderful You see them all there Yes yes It s really wonderful Meredith I mean well it s simply after a pause wonderful You see Meredith there most Y yes Sometimes And then with truth sometimes I I don t It s difficult to say Sometimes I er Shaw er well it s with a gesture somewhat Gallic How can I put it Not Thackeray at all he says watching me eagerly I decide to risk it Oh but of course I mean Thackeray When I said Meredith I was thinking of the others But Thackeray I mean Thackeray is er I ve forgotten the author s name for the moment and go on hastily I mean er Thackeray obviously He shakes me by the hand I am his friend But this conversation only takes place in my more hopeful moments In my less hopeful ones I see myself going into the country for quite a long time III SUMMER DAYS A SONG FOR THE SUMMER Is it raining Never mind Think how much the birdies love it See them in their dozens drawn Dancing to the croquet lawn Could our little friends have dined If there d been no worms above it Is it murky What of that If the Owls are fairly perky Just imagine you were one Wouldn t you detest the sun I m pretending I m a Bat And I know I like it murky Is it chilly After all We must not forget the Poodle If the days were really hot Could he wear one woolly spot Could he even keep his shawl No he d shave the whole caboodle 
7338-92139-0000	train-other-500	THE SEASON S PROSPECTS The great question in the Mallory family just now is whether Dick will get into the eleven this year Confident as he is himself he is taking no risks We re going to put the net up to morrow he said to me
7338-92139-0001	train-other-500	as soon as I arrived and then you ll be able to bowl to me How long are you staying Till to night I said quickly Rot You re fixed up here till Tuesday any how My dear Dick I ve come down for a few days rest
none	none	 If the weather permits I may have the croquet things out one afternoon and try a round or possibly 
7338-92139-0002	train-other-500	I don t believe you can bowl said Bobby rudely Bobby is twelve five years younger than Dick It is not my place to smack Bobby s head but somebody might do it for him
7338-92139-0003	train-other-500	Then that just shows how little you know about it I retorted In a match last September I went on to bowl Why I knew the captain I explained
7338-92139-0004	train-other-500	Well as I say he asked me to go on to bowl and I took four wickets for thirteen runs There Good man said Dick Was it against a girls school said Bobby You know Bobby is simply asking for it
7338-92139-0005	train-other-500	It was not Nor were children of twelve allowed in without their perambulators
none	none	 Well anyhow 
7338-92139-0006	train-other-500	said Bobby I bet Phyllis can bowl better than you Is this true I said to Phyllis
none	none	 I asked her because in a general way my bowling is held to be superior to that of girls of fifteen 
7338-92139-0007	train-other-500	Of course she might be something special I can bowl Bobby out she said modestly I looked at Bobby in surprise and then shook my head sadly
7338-92139-0008	train-other-500	You jolly well shut up he said turning indignantly to his sister Just because you did it once when the sun was in my eyes Bobby Bobby I said this is painful hearing
7338-92139-0009	train-other-500	Let us be thankful that we don t have to play against girls schools Let us But Bobby was gone Goaded to anger he had put his hands in his pockets and made the general observation Rice pudding an observation inoffensive enough to a stranger
7338-92139-0010	train-other-500	but evidently of such deep private significance to Phyllis that it was necessary for him to head a pursuit into the shrubbery without further delay The children are gone I said to Dick Now we can discuss the prospects for the season in peace
7338-92139-0011	train-other-500	I took up The Sportsman again I see that Kent is going to The prospects are all right said Dick if only I can get into form soon enough Last year I didn t get going till the end of June By the way
7338-92139-0012	train-other-500	what sort of stuff do you bowl Ordinary sort of stuff I said with one or two bounces in it
none	none	 Do you see that Surrey Fast or slow 
7338-92139-0013	train-other-500	Slow that is you know when I do bowl at all I m not quite sure this season whether I hadn t better Slow said Dick thoughtfully that s really what I want
7338-92139-0014	train-other-500	I want lots of that You must get Phyllis to bowl to you I said with detachment You know I shouldn t be surprised if Lancashire My dear man girls can t bowl She fields jolly well though
7338-92139-0015	train-other-500	What about your father His bowling days are rather over He was in the eleven you know thirty years ago So there s really nobody but One s bowling days soon get over I hastened to agree
7338-92139-0016	train-other-500	But I know now exactly what the prospects of the season or at any rate of the first week of it are
none	none	 mister MALLORY 
7338-92139-0017	train-other-500	The prospects here are on the whole encouraging To dwell upon the bright side first there will be half an hour s casual bowling and an hour and a half s miscellaneous coaching every day
7338-92139-0018	train-other-500	On the other hand some of his best plants will be disturbed while there is more than a chance that he may lose the services of a library window missus MALLORY The prospects here are much as last year
7338-92139-0019	train-other-500	except that her youngest born Joan is now five and consequently rather more likely to wander in the way of a cricket ball or fall down in front of the roller than she was twelve months ago
7338-92139-0020	train-other-500	Otherwise missus Mallory faces the approaching season with calm if not with complete appreciation DICK
none	none	 Of Dick s prospects there is no need to speak at length He will have two hours batting every day against from a batsman s point of view 
7338-92139-0021	train-other-500	ideal bowling and in addition the whole hearted admiration of all of us In short the outlook here is distinctly hopeful PHYLLIS The prospects of this player are from her own point of view bright
7338-92139-0022	train-other-500	as she will be allowed to field for two hours a day to the beloved Dick She is also fully qualified now to help with the heavy roller
7338-92139-0023	train-other-500	A new experiment is to be tried this season and she will be allowed to bowl for an odd five minutes at the end of Dick s innings to me BOBBY enters upon the coming season with confidence
7338-92139-0024	train-other-500	as he thinks there is a chance of my bowling to him too but he is mistaken As before he will be in charge of the heavy roller and he will also be required to slacken the ropes of the net at the end of the day
7338-92139-0025	train-other-500	His prospects however are certainly improved this season as he will be qualified to bowl for the whole two hours but only on the distinct understanding with Phyllis that he does his own fielding for himself
7338-92139-0026	train-other-500	Of the prospects of JOAN I have already spoken above There remain only the prospects of MYSELF which are frankly rotten They consist chiefly of two hours bowling to the batting of Dick
7338-92139-0027	train-other-500	who hits them back very hard and ten minutes batting to the bowling of Phyllis slow mild and Bobby fast wides for Dick having been ordered by the captain not to strain himself by trying to bowl is not going to try
7338-92139-0028	train-other-500	It is extremely doubtful whether Bobby will approve of my action while if he or Phyllis should by an unlucky accident get me out I should never hear the last of it In this case however there must be added to Bobby s prospects
7338-92139-0029	train-other-500	the possibility of getting his head definitely smacked Fortunately it is my only consolation the season will be a short one
none	none	 It ends on Tuesday THE FIRST GAME There comes a Day I can hear it coming One of those glorious deep blue days When larks are singing and bees are humming And Earth gives voice in a thousand ways Then I my friends I too shall sing And hum a foolish little thing And whistle like but not too like a blackbird in the Spring There looms a Day I can feel it looming Yes it will be in a month or less When all the flowers in the world are blooming And Nature flutters her fairest dress Then I my friends I too shall wear A blazer that will make them stare And brush this is official I shall also brush my hair It is the day that I watch for yearly Never before has it come so late But now I ve only a month no merely A couple of fortnights left to wait And then to make the matter plain I hold at last a bat again Dear Hobbs the weeks this summer think the weeks I ve lived in vain I see already the first ball twisting Over the green as I take my stand I hear already long on insisting It wasn t a chance that came to hand Or no I see it miss the bat And strike me on the knee whereat Some fool some silly fool at point says blandly How was that Then scouting later I hold a hot un At deep square leg from the local Fry And at short mid on to the village Scotton I snap a skimmer some six foot high Or else perhaps I get the ball Upon the thumb or not at all Or right into the hands and then lorblessme let it fall But what care I It s the game that calls me Simply to be on the field of play How can it matter what fate befalls me With ten good fellows and one good day But still I rather hope spectators will Observing any lack or skill Remark This is his first appearance Yes I hope they will THE COMPETITION SPIRIT About six weeks ago a Canadian gentleman named Smith arrived in the Old Country England He knew a man who knew a man who knew a man and so on for a bit who knew a man who knew a man who knew me Letters passed negotiations ensued and about a week after he had first set foot in the Mother City London Smith and I met at my Club for lunch I may confess now that I was nervous I think I expected a man in a brown shirt and leggings who would ask me to put it right there and tell me I was some Englishman However he turned out to be exactly like anybody else in London Whether he found me exactly like anybody else in Canada I don t know Anyway we had a very pleasant lunch and arranged to play golf together on the next day Whatever else is true of Canada there can be no doubt that it turns out delightful golfers Smith proved to be just the best golfer I had ever met being when at the top of his form almost exactly as good as I was Hole after hole we halved in a mechanical eight If by means of a raking drive and four perfect brassies at the sixth he managed to get one up for a moment then at the short seventh a screaming iron and three consummate approaches would make me square again Occasionally he would by superhuman play do a hole in bogey but only to crack at the next and leave me at the edge of the green to play one off eleven It was in fact a ding dong struggle all the way and for his one hole victory in the morning I had my revenge with a one hole victory in the afternoon By the end of a month we must have played a dozen rounds of this nature I always had a feeling that I was really a better golfer than he and this made me friendly towards his game I would concede him short putts which I should have had no difficulty in missing myself if he lost his ball I would beg him to drop another and go on with the hole if he got into a bad place in a bunker I would assure him it was ground under repair He was just as friendly in refusing to take these advantages just as pleasant in offering similar indulgences to me I thought at first it was part of his sporting way but it turned out that absurdly enough he also was convinced that he was really the better golfer of the two and could afford these amenities One day he announced that he was going back to Canada We must have a last game he said and this one must be decisive For the championship of the Empire I agreed Let s buy a little cup and play for it I ve never won anything at golf yet and I should love to see a little cup on the dinner table every night You can t come to dinner in Canada every night he pointed out It would be so expensive for you Well the cup was bought engraved The Empire Challenge Cup and played for last Monday This said Smith is a serious game and we must play all out No giving away anything no waiving the rules The Empire is at stake The effeteness of the Mother Country is about to be put to the proof Proceed It wasn t the most pleasant of our games The spirit of the cup hung over it and depressed us At the third hole I had an eighteen inch putt for a half That s all right said Smith forgetfully and then added Perhaps you d better put it in though Of course I missed On the fifth green he was about to brush away a leaf That s illegal I said sharply you must pick it up you mayn t brush it away and after a fierce argument on the point he putted hastily and badly At the eighteenth tee we were all square and hardly on speaking terms The fate of the Mother Country depended upon the result of this hole I drove a long one the longest of the day slightly hooked Good shot said Smith with an effort He pressed and foozled badly I tried not to look pleased We found his ball in a thick clump of heather With a grim look on his face he took out his niblick I stayed by him and helped him count up to eight Where s your ball he growled A long way on I said reproachfully I wish you d hurry up The poor thing will be getting cold He got to work again We had another count together up to fifteen Sometimes there would be a gleam of white at the top of the heather for a moment and then it would fade away How many I asked some minutes later About thirty But I don t care I m going to get the little beast into the hole if it takes me all night He went on hacking I had lost interest in the performance for the cup was mine but I did admire his Colonial grit Got it he cried suddenly and the ball sailed out on to the pretty Another shot put him level with me Thirty two I asked About he said coldly I began to look for my ball It had got tired of waiting and had hidden itself Smith joined gloomily in the search This is absurd I said after three or four minutes By jove said Smith suddenly brightening up If your ball s lost I win after all Nonsense you ve given the hole up I protested You don t know how many you ve played According to the rules if I ask you how many and you give wrong information It s thirty five he said promptly I don t believe you counted Call it forty five then There s nothing to prevent my calling it more than it really is If it was really only forty then I m counting five occasions when the ball rolled over as I was addressing it That s very generous of me Actually I m doubtful if the ball did roll over five times but I say it did in order to be on the safe side He looked at his watch And if you don t find your ball in thirty seconds you lose the hole It was ingenious but the Mother Country can be ingenious too How many have you played exactly I asked Be careful Forty five he said Exactly Right I took my niblick and swung at the heather Bother I said Missed it Two Hallo Have you found it I have It s somewhere in this field There s no rule which insists that you shall hit the ball or even that you shall hit near the ball or even that you shall see the ball when you hit at it Lots of old gentlemen shut their eyes and miss the sphere I ve missed In five minutes I shall miss again But what s the point The point dear friend I smiled is that after each stroke one is allowed five minutes in which to find the ball I have forty three strokes in hand that gives me three hours and thirty five minutes in which to look for it At regular intervals of five minutes I shall swing my club and probably miss It s four thirty now at eight o clock unless I find my ball before I shall be playing the like And if you are a sportsman I added you will bring me out some tea in half an hour At six thirty I was still looking and swinging Smith then came to terms and agreed to share the cup with me for the first year He goes back to Canada to morrow and will spread the good news there that the Old Country can still hold its own in resource determination and staying power But next year we are going to play friendly golf again THE FIRST TEE MULLION It is the place it is the

JOLLY WELL GOT TO Caddie my driver please THE ENCHANTED CASTLE There are warm days in London when even a window box fails to charm and one longs for the more open spaces of the country Besides one wants to see how the other flowers are getting on It is on these days that we travel to our Castle of Stopes as the crow flies fifteen miles away Indeed that is the way we get to it for it is a castle in the air And when we are come to it Celia is always in a pink sunbonnet gathering roses lovingly and I not very far off am speaking strongly to somebody or other about something I want done By and by I shall go into the library and work with an occasional glance through the open window at Celia To think that a month ago we were quite happy with a few pink geraniums Sunday a month ago was hot Let s take train somewhere said Celia and have lunch under a hedge I know a lovely place for hedges I said I know a lovely tin of potted grouse said Celia and she went off to cut some sandwiches By twelve o clock we were getting out of the train The first thing we came to was a golf course and Celia had to drag me past it Then we came to a wood and I had to drag her through it Another mile along a lane and then we both stopped together Oh we said It was a cottage the cottage of a dream And by a cottage I mean not four plain rooms and a kitchen but one surprising room opening into another rooms all on different levels and of different shapes with delightful places to bump your head on open fireplaces a large square hall oak beamed where your guests can hang about after breakfast while deciding whether to play golf or sit in the garden Yet all so cunningly disposed that from outside it looks only a cottage or at most two cottages persuaded into one And of course we only saw it from outside The little drive determined to get there as soon as possible pushed its way straight through an old barn and arrived at the door simultaneously with the flagged lavender walk for the humble who came on foot The rhododendrons were ablaze beneath the south windows a little orchard was running wild on the west there was a hint at the back of a clean cut lawn Also you remember there was a golf course less than two miles away Oh said Celia with a deep sigh but we must live here An Irish terrier ran out to inspect us I bent down and patted it With a dog I added Isn t it all lovely I wonder who it belongs to and if If he d like to give it to us Perhaps he would if he saw us and admired us very much said Celia hopefully I don t think mister Barlow is that sort of man I said An excellent fellow but not one to take these sudden fancies mister Barlow How do you know his name I have these surprising intuitions I said modestly The way the chimneys stand up I know cried Celia The dog s collar Right Watson And the name of the house is Stopes She repeated it to herself with a frown What a disappointing name she said Just Stopes Stopes I said Stopes Stopes If you keep on saying it a certain old world charm seems to gather round it Stopes Stopes said Celia It is rather jolly We said it ten more times each and it seemed the only possible name for it Stopes of course Well I asked We must write to mister Barlow said Celia decisively Dear mister Barlow er Dear mister Barlow we Yes it will be rather difficult What do we want to say exactly Dear mister Barlow May we have your house Yes smiled Celia but I m afraid we can hardly ask for it But we might rent it when when he doesn t want it any more Dear mister Barlow I amended have you any idea when you re going to die No that wouldn t do either And there s another thing we don t know his initials or even if he s a mister Perhaps he s a knight or a a duke Think how offended Duke Barlow would be if we put Barlow esquire on the envelope We could telegraph Barlow After you with Stopes Perhaps there s a young Barlow a Barlowette or two with expectations It may have been in the family for years Then we Oh let s have lunch She sat down and began to undo the sandwiches Dear o Stopes she said with her mouth full We lunched outside Stopes Surely if Earl Barlow had seen us he would have asked us in But no doubt his dining room looked the other way towards the east and north as I pointed out to Celia thus being pleasantly cool at lunch time Ha Barlow I said dramatically a time will come when we shall be lunching in there and you bah And I tossed a potted grouse sandwich to his dog However that didn t get us any nearer Will you promise said Celia that we shall have lunch in there one day I promise I said readily That gave me about sixty years to do something in I m like who was it who saw something of another man s and wouldn t be happy till he got it The baby in the soap advertisement No no some king in history I believe you are thinking of Ahab but you aren t a bit like him really Besides we re not coveting Stopes All we want to know is does Barlow ever let it in the summer That s it said Celia eagerly And if so I went on will he lend us the money to pay the rent with Er yes said Celia That s it So for a month we have lived in our Castle of Stopes I see Celia there in her pink sun bonnet gathering the flowers lovingly bringing an armful of them into the hall disturbing me sometimes in the library with Aren t they beauties No I only just looked in good luck to you And she sees me ordering a man about importantly or waving my hand to her as I ride through the old barn on my road to the golf course But this morning she had an idea Suppose she said timidly you wrote about Stopes and mister Barlow happened to see it and knew how much we wanted it and Well Then said Celia firmly if he were a gentleman he would give it to us Very well Now we shall see if mister Barlow is a gentleman THE SANDS OF PLEASURE Ladies first so we will start with Jenny Jenny is only nine but she has been to the seaside before and knows all about it She wears the fashionable costume de plage which consists of a white linen hat a jersey and an overcrowded pair of bathing drawers into which not only Jenny but the rest of her wardrobe has had to fit itself Two slim brown legs emerge to bear the burden and one feels that if she fell over she would have to stay there until somebody picked her up She is holding Richard Henry by the hand Richard Henry is four and this is the first time he has seen the sea Jenny is showing it to him Privately he thinks that it has been over rated There was a good deal of talk about it in his suburb particularly from Jenny who had been there before and naturally one expected something rather well rather more like what they had been saying it was like However perhaps it would be as well to keep in with Jenny and not to let her see that he is disappointed so every time she says Isn t the sea lovely he echoes Lovely and now and then he adds just to humour her Is at the sea and then she has the chance to say again Yes that s the sea darling Isn t it lovely It is obvious that she is proud of it Apparently she put it there Anyway it seems to be hers now Jenny has brought Father and Mother as well as Richard Henry There they are over there When she came before she had to leave them behind much to their disappointment Father was saying Form fours left before going off to France again and Mother was buying wool to make him some more socks It was a great relief to them to know that they were being taken this time and that they would have Jenny to tell them all about it Father is lying in a deck chair smoking his pipe There has been an interesting discussion this afternoon as to whether he is a coward or not Father thought he wasn t but Mother wasn t quite so sure Jenny said that of course he couldn t really be because the King gave him a medal for not being one but Mother explained that it was only a medal he had over and Father happened to be passing by the window I don t see what this has to do with it said Father I simply prefer bathing in the morning Oo you said this morning you preferred bathing in the afternoon says Jenny like a flash I know but since then I ve had time to think it over and I see that I was hasty The morning is the best time I m afraid he is a coward said Mother sadly wondering why she had married him The whole point is why did Jenny bring me here To enjoy yourself said Jenny promptly Well I am said Father closing his eyes But we do not feel so sure that Mother is enjoying herself She has just read in the paper about a mine that floated ashore and exploded Nobody was near at the time but supposing one of the children had been playing with it Which one said Father lazily Jenny Then we should have lost Jenny This being so Jenny promises solemnly not to play with any mine that comes ashore nor to let Richard Henry play with it nor to allow it to play with Richard Henry nor I suppose I may just point it out to him and say Look that s a mine says Jenny wistfully If she can t do this it doesn t seem to be much use coming to the seaside at all I don t think there would be any harm in that says Father But don t engage it in conversation Thank you very much says Jenny and she and Richard Henry go off together Mother watches them anxiously Father closes his eyes Now says Jenny eagerly I m going to show you a darling little crab Won t that be lovely Richard Henry having been deceived as he feels about the sea is not too hopeful about that crab However he asks politely What s a crab You ll see directly darling says Jenny and he has to be content with that Crab he murmurs to himself Suddenly an idea occurs to him He lets go of Jenny s hand and trots up to an old gentleman with white whiskers Going to see a crab he announces Going to see a crab are you my little man says the old gentleman kindly Going to see a crab says Richard Henry determined to keep up his end of the conversation Well I never So you re going to see a crab says the old gentleman doing his best with it Richard Henry nods two or three times Going to see a crab he says firmly Luckily Jenny comes up and rescues him otherwise they would still be at it Come along darling and see the crab she says picking up his hand and Richard Henry looks triumphantly at the old gentleman There you are Perhaps he will believe a fellow another time Jenny has evidently made an arrangement with a particular crab for this afternoon It is to be hoped that the appointment will be kept for she has hurried Richard Henry past all sorts of wonderful things which he wanted to stop with for a little But the thought of this lovely crab which Jenny thinks so much of forbids protest Quite right not to keep it waiting What will it be like Will it be bigger than the sea We have reached the rendezvous We see now that we need not have been in such a hurry There says Jenny excitedly Isn t he a darling little crab He s asleep That s why we need not have hurried Richard Henry says nothing He can t think of the words for what he is feeling What he wants to say is that Jenny has let him down again They passed a lot of these funny little things on their way here but Jenny wouldn t stop because she was going to show him a Crab a great big enormous darling little Crab which might have been anything and now it s only just this No wonder the old gentleman didn t believe him Swindled that s the word he wants However he can t think of it for the moment so he tries something else Darling little crab he says They leave the dead crab there and hurry back What shall I show you now says Jenny GOLDEN MEMORIES When Memory with its scorn of ages Its predilection for the past Turns back about a billion pages And lands us by the Cam at last Is it the thought of Granta once our daughter The Freshers Match the Second in our Mays That makes our mouth our very soul to water Ah no Ah no It is the Salmon Mayonnaise The work we did was rarely reckoned Worthy a tutor s kindly word For when I said we got a Second I really meant we got a Third The games we played were often tinged with bitter Amidst the damns no faintest hint of praise Greeted us when we missed the authentic sitter But thou wert always kind O Salmon Mayonnaise Even our nights with Granta even The style that week by blessed week Mixed Calverley and J K Stephen With much that was I hold unique Even our parodies of the Rubaiyat Were disappointing yes in certain ways What genius loves I mean the people shy at Yet no one ever shied at Salmon Mayonnaise Alas no restaurant in London Can make us feel that thrill again Though what they do or what leave undone I often ask and ask in vain Is it the sauce which puts the brand of Cam on Each maddening dish The egg The yellow glaze The cucumber The special breed of salmon I only know we loved we loved that Mayonnaise Did Beauty some may ask severely Visit him in no other guise It cannot be that salmon merely Should bring the mist before his eyes What of the river there where Byron s Pool lay The warm blue morning shimmering in the haze Not this I say Yet something else Creme Brulee Ye gods to think of that and Salmon Mayonnaise THE PROBLEM OF LIFE The noise of the retreating sea came pleasantly to us from a distance Celia was lying on her I never know how to put this nicely well she was lying face downwards on a rock and gazing into a little pool which the tide had forgotten about and left behind I sat beside her and annoyed a limpet Three minutes ago I had taken it suddenly by surprise and with an Herculean effort moved it an eighteenth of a millimetre westwards My silence since then was lulling it into a false security and in another two minutes I hoped to get a move on it again Do you know said Celia with a puzzled look on her face sometimes I think I m quite an ordinary person after all You aren t a little bit I said lazily you re just like nobody else in the world Well of course you had to say that No I hadn t Lots of husbands would merely have yawned I felt one coming and stopped it just in time Waiting for limpets to go to sleep is drowsy work But why are you so morbid about yourself suddenly I don t know she said Only every now and then I find myself thinking the most obvious thoughts We all do I answered as I stroked my limpet gently The noise of our conversation had roused it but a gentle stroking motion I am told by those to whom it has confided will frequently cause its muscles to relax The great thing is not to speak them Still you d better tell me now What is it Well she said her cheeks perhaps a little pinker than usual I was just thinking that life was very wonderful But it s a silly thing to say It s holiday time I reminded her The need for sprinkling our remarks with thoughtful words like economic and sporadic is over for a bit Let us be silly I scratched in the rock the goal to which I was urging my limpet and took out my watch Three thirty five I shall get him there by four Celia was gazing at two baby fishes who played in and out a bunch of sea weed Above the seaweed an anemone sat fatly I suppose they re all just as much alive as we are she said thoughtfully They marry I looked at my limpet with a new interest and bring up families and go about their business and it all means just as much to them as it does to us My limpet s business affairs mean nothing to me I said firmly I am only wrapped up in him as a sprinter Aren t you going to try to move him again He s not quite ready yet He still has his suspicions Celia dropped into silence Her next question showed that she had left the pool for a moment Are there any people in Mars she asked People down here say that there aren t A man told me the other day that he knew this for a fact On the other hand people in Mars know for a fact that there isn t anybody on the Earth Probably they are both wrong I should like to know a lot about things sighed Celia Do you know anything about limpets Only that they stick like billy o I suppose more about them is known than that I suppose so By people who have made a specialty of them For one who has preferred to amass general knowledge rather than to specialize it is considered enough to know that they stick like billy o You haven t specialized in anything have you Only in wives Celia smiled and went on How do you make a specialty of limpets Well I suppose you er study them You sit down and and watch them Probably after dark they get up and do something And of course in any case you can always dissect one and see what he s had for breakfast One way and another you get to know things about them They must have a lot of time for thinking said Celia regarding my limpet with her head on one side Tell me how do they know that there are no men in Mars I sat up with a sigh Celia you do dodge about so I have barely brought together and classified my array of facts about things in this world when you ve dashed up to another one What is the connexion between Mars and limpets If there are any limpets in Mars they are freshwater ones In the canals Oh I just wondered she said I mean she wrinkled her forehead in the effort to find words for her thoughts I m wondering what everything means and why we re all here and what limpets are for and supposing there are people in Mars if we re the real people whom the world was made for or if they are She stopped and added One evening after dinner when we get home you must tell me all about everything Celia has a beautiful idea that I can explain everything to her I suppose I must have explained a stymie or a no ball very cleverly once Well I said I can tell you what limpets are for now They re like sheep and cows and horses and pheasants and and any other animal They re just for us At least so the wise people say But we don t eat limpets No but they can amuse us This one and with a sudden leap I was behind him as he dozed and I had dashed him forward another eighteenth of a millimetre this one has amused me Perhaps said Celia thoughtfully and I don t think it was quite a nice thing for a young woman to say perhaps we re only meant to amuse the people in Mars Then I said lazily let s hope that they are amused Ten days later the Great War began Celia said no more on the subject but she used to look at me curiously sometimes and I fear that the problem of life left her more puzzled than ever At the risk of betraying myself to her as quite an ordinary person after all I confess that there are times when it leaves me puzzled too IV WAR TIME O B E I know a Captain of Industry Who made big bombs for the R F C And collared a lot of L s d And he thank God has the O B E I know a Lady of Pedigree Who asked some soldiers out to tea And said Dear me and Yes I see And she thank God has the O B E I know a fellow of twenty three Who got a job with a fat M P Not caring much for the Infantry And he thank God has the O B E I had a friend a friend and he Just held the line for you and me And kept the Germans from the sea And died without the O B E Thank God He died without the O B E ARMAGEDDON The conversation had turned as it always does in the smoking rooms of golf clubs to the state of poor old England and Porkins had summed the matter up He had marched round in ninety seven that morning followed by a small child with an umbrella and an arsenal of weapons and he felt in form with himself What England wants he said leaning back and puffing at his cigar what England wants is a war Another whisky and soda waiter We re getting flabby All this pampering of the poor is playing the very deuce with the country A bit of a scrap with a foreign power would do us all the good in the world He disposed of his whisky at a draught We re flabby he repeated The lower classes seem to have no sense of discipline nowadays We want a war to brace us up It is well understood in Olympus that Porkins must not be disappointed What will happen to him in the next world I do not know but it will be something extremely humorous in this world however he is to have all that he wants Accordingly the gods got to work In the little village of Ospovat which is in the southeastern corner of Ruritania there lived a maiden called Maria Strultz who was engaged to marry Captain Tomsk I fancy said one of the gods that it might be rather funny if Maria jilted the Captain I have an idea that it would please Porkins Whatever has Maria began a very young god but he was immediately suppressed Really said the other I should have thought it was sufficiently obvious You know what these mortals are He looked round to them all Is it agreed then It was agreed So Maria Strultz jilted the Captain Now this as you may imagine annoyed Captain Tomsk He commanded a frontier fort on the boundary between Ruritania and Essenland and his chief amusement in a dull life was to play cards with the Essenland captain who commanded the fort on the other side of the river When Maria s letter came he felt that the only thing to do was to drown himself on second thoughts he decided to drown his sorrows first He did this so successfully that at the end of the evening he was convinced that it was not Maria who had jilted him but the Essenland captain who had jilted Maria whereupon he rowed across the river and poured his revolver into the Essenland flag which was flying over the fort Maria thus revenged he went home to bed and woke next morning with a bad headache Now we re off said the gods in Olympus In Diedeldorf the capital of Essenland the leader writers proceeded to remove their coats The blood of every true Essenlander said the leader writer of the Diedeldorf Patriot after sending out for another pot of beer will boil when it hears of this fresh insult to our beloved flag an insult which can only be wiped out with blood Then seeing that he had two bloods in one sentence he crossed the second One out substituted the sword and lit a fresh cigarette For years Essenland has writhed under the provocations of Ruritania but has preserved a dignified silence this last insult is more than flesh and blood can stand Another blood had got in but it was a new sentence and he thought it might be allowed to remain We shall not be accused of exaggeration if we say that Essenland would lose and rightly lose her prestige in the eyes of Europe if she let this affront pass unnoticed In a day she would sink from a first rate to a fifth rate power But he didn t say how The Chancellor of Essenland in a speech gravely applauded by both sides of the House announced the steps he had taken An ultimatum had been sent to Ruritania demanding an apology an indemnity of a hundred thousand marks and the public degradation of Captain Tomsk whose epaulettes were to be torn off by the Commander in Chief of the Essenland Army in the presence of a full corps of cinematograph artists Failing this war would be declared Ruritania offered the apology the indemnity and the public degradation of Captain Tomsk but urged that this last ceremony would be better performed by the Commander in Chief of the Ruritanian Army otherwise Ruritania might as well cease to be a sovereign state for she would lose her prestige in the eyes of Europe and sink to the level of a fifth rate power There was only one possible reply to this and Essenland made it She invaded Ruritania Aren t they wonderful said the gods in Olympus to each other But haven t you made a mistake asked the very young god Porkins lives in England not Essenland Wait a moment said the others In the capital of Borovia the leader writer of the Borovian Patriot got to work How does Borovia stand he asked If Essenland occupies Ruritania can any thinking man in Borovia feel safe with the enemy at his gates The Borovian peasant earning five marks a week would have felt no less safe than usual but then he could hardly be described as a thinking man It is vital to the prestige of Borovia that the integrity of Ruritania should be preserved Otherwise we may resign ourselves at once to the prospect of becoming a fifth rate power in the eyes of Europe And in a speech gravely applauded by all parties the Borovian Chancellor said the same thing So the Imperial Army was mobilized and amidst a wonderful display of patriotic enthusiasm by those who were remaining behind the Borovian troops marched to the front And there you are said the gods in Olympus But even now began the very young god doubtfully Silly isn t Felicia the ally of Essenland isn t Marksland the ally of Borovia isn t England the ally of the ally of the ally of the Country which holds the balance of power between Marksland and Felicia But if any of them thought the whole thing stupid or unjust or Their prestige said the gods gravely trying not to laugh Oh I see said the very young god And when a year later the hundred thousandth English mother woke up to read that her boy had been shot I am afraid she shed foolish tears and thought that the world had come to an end Poor short sighted creature She didn t realize that Porkins who had marched round in ninety six the day before was now thoroughly braced up What babies they all are said the very young

TOBY It will save trouble if I say at once that I know nothing about horses This will be quite apparent to you of course before I have finished 
4697-92150-0000	train-other-500	but I don t want you to suppose that it is not also quite apparent to me I have no illusions on the subject neither I imagine has Toby To me there are only two kinds of horse
4697-92150-0001	train-other-500	Chestnuts roans bay rums I know nothing of all these I can only describe a horse simply as a nice horse or a nasty horse Toby is a nice horse
4697-92150-0002	train-other-500	Toby of course knows much more about men than I do about horses and no doubt he describes me professionally to his colleagues as a flea bitten fellow standing about eighteen hoofs
none	none	 but when he is not being technical 
4697-92150-0003	train-other-500	I like to think that he sums me up to himself as a nice man At any rate I am not allowed to wear spurs and that must weigh with a horse a good deal I have no real right to Toby
4697-92150-0004	train-other-500	The Signalling Officer s official mount is a bicycle but a bicycle in this weather
none	none	 And there is Toby and somebody must ride him and as I point out to the other subalterns 
4697-92150-0005	train-other-500	it would only cause jealousy if one of them rode him and Why would it create more jealousy than if you do asked one of them Well I said you re the officer commanding platoon number
4697-92150-0006	train-other-500	Fifteen Fifteen Now why should the officer commanding the fifteenth platoon ride a horse when the officer commanding the nineteenth He reminded me that there were only sixteen platoons in a battalion
4697-92150-0007	train-other-500	It s such a long time since I had anything to do with platoons that I forget All right we ll say the sixteenth Why shouldn t he have a horse Of all the unjust Well
4697-92150-0008	train-other-500	you see what recriminations it would lead to Now I don t say I m more valuable than a platoon commander or more effective on a horse but at any rate there aren t sixteen of me There s only one Signalling Officer
4697-92150-0009	train-other-500	and if there is a spare horse over What about the Bombing Officer said O C Platoon fifteen carelessly I had quite forgotten the Bombing Officer Of course he is a specialist too
none	none	 Yes quite so but if you would only think a little 
4697-92150-0010	train-other-500	I said thinking hard all the time you would well put it this way The range of a Mills bomb is about fifty yards the range of a field telephone is several miles
4697-92150-0011	train-other-500	Which of us is more likely to require a horse And the Sniping officer he went on dreamily This annoyed me You don t shoot snipe from horseback
4697-92150-0012	train-other-500	I said sharply You re mixing up shooting and hunting my lad And in any case there are reasons special reasons why I ride Toby reasons of which you know nothing Here are the reasons
4697-92150-0013	train-other-500	one I think I have more claim to a horse called Toby than has a contributor to Our Feathered Friends or whatever paper the Sniping Officer writes for two
4697-92150-0014	train-other-500	When I joined the Army Celia was inconsolable I begged her to keep a stiff upper lip to which she replied that she could do it better if I promised not to keep a bristly one
4697-92150-0015	train-other-500	I pointed out that the country wanted bristles and though between ourselves we might regard it as a promising face spoilt for a tradition still discipline was discipline
4697-92150-0016	train-other-500	And so the bristles came and remained until the happy day when the War Office at the risk of losing the war made them optional Immediately they were uprooted
4697-92150-0017	train-other-500	Now the Colonel has only one fault I have been definitely promised my second star in nineteen twenty seven so he won t think I am flattering him with a purpose
4697-92150-0018	train-other-500	he likes moustaches His own is admirable and I have no wish for him to remove it but I think he should be equally broad minded about mine You aren t really more beautiful without it
4697-92150-0019	train-other-500	he said A moustache suits you My wife doesn t think so I said firmly I had the War Office on my side so I could afford to be firm The Colonel looked at me
4697-92150-0020	train-other-500	and then he looked out of the window and made the following remarkable statement Toby he said gently to himself doesn t like clean shaven officers
4697-92150-0021	train-other-500	This hadn t occurred to me I let it sink in Of course I said at last one must consider one s horse I quite see that With a bicycle
4697-92150-0022	train-other-500	he said it s different And so there you have the second reason If the Bombing Officer rode Toby I should shave again to morrow and then where would the Battalion be Ruined
4697-92150-0023	train-other-500	So Toby and I go off together Up till now he has been good to me He has bitten one Company Commander removed another and led the Colonel a three mile chase across country after him
4697-92150-0024	train-other-500	so if any misunderstanding occurs between us there will be good precedent for it So far my only real trouble has been once when billeting
4697-92150-0025	train-other-500	Billeting is delightful fun
none	none	 You start three hours in advance of the battalion which means that if the battalion leaves at eight in the morning you are up in the fresh of the day when the birds are singing You arrive at the village and get from the Mayor or the Town Major a list of possible hostesses Entering the first house labeled Officers five you say Vous avez un lit pour un Officier ici n est ce pas Vive la France She answers Pas un lit and you go to the next house Vous avez place pour cent hommes oui Non says she and so on By and by the battalion arrives and everybody surrounds you Where are my men going Where is my billet Where s C Company s mess Have you found anything for the Pioneers And so one knows what it is to be popular Well the other day the Major thought he d come with me just to give me an idea how it ought to be done 
4697-92150-0026	train-other-500	I say nothing of the result but for reasons connected with Toby I hope he won t come again For in the middle of a narrow street crowded with lorries he jumped off his horse flung I think that s the expression
4697-92150-0027	train-other-500	flung me the reins and said
none	none	 Just wait here while I see the Mayor a moment 
4697-92150-0028	train-other-500	The Major s horse I can describe quite shortly a nasty big black horse Toby
none	none	 I have already described as a nice horse 
4697-92150-0029	train-other-500	but he had been knee deep in mud inspecting huts for nearly half an hour and was sick of billeting I need not describe two hundred lorries on a dark evening to you And so seeing that you know the constituents
4697-92150-0030	train-other-500	I must let you imagine how they all mixed This is a beastly war But it has its times
none	none	 and when our own particular bit of the battle is over and what is left of the battalion is marching back to rest 
4697-92150-0031	train-other-500	I doubt if even in England which seems very far off you will find two people more contented with the morning than Toby and I
none	none	 as we jog along together COMMON Seated in your comfortable club my very dear sir or in your delightful drawing room madam you may smile pityingly at the idea of a mascot saving anybody s life What will be will be you say to yourself or in Italian to your friends and to suppose that a charm round the neck of a soldier will divert a German shell is ridiculous But out there through the crumps things look otherwise Common had sat on the mantelpiece at home An ugly little ginger dog with a bit of red tape for his tongue and two black beads for his eyes he viewed his limited world with an air of innocent impertinence very attractive to visitors Common he looked and Common he was called with a Christian name of Howard for registration For six months he sat there and no doubt he thought that he had seen all that there was to see of the world when the summons came which was to give him so different an outlook on life For that summons meant the breaking up of his home Master was going wandering from trench to trench Mistress from one person s house to another person s house She no doubt would take Common with her or perhaps she couldn t be bothered with an ugly little ginger dog and he would be stored in some repository boarded out in some Olympic kennel Or do you possibly think Master might He looked very wistful that last morning so wistful that Mistress couldn t bear it and she slipped him in hastily between the revolver and the boracic powder Just to look after you she said So Common came with me to France His first view of the country was at Rouen when he sat at the entrance to my tent and hooshed the early morning flies away His next at a village behind the lines where he met stout fellows of D Company and took the centre of the table at mess in the apple orchard and moreover was introduced to a French maiden of two with whom at the instigation of the seconds in the business her mother and myself a prolonged but monotonous conversation in the French tongue ensued Common under suitable pressure barking idiomatically and the maiden carefully prompted replying with the native for Bow wow A pretty greenwood scene beneath the apple trees and in any decent civilization the great adventure would have ended there But Common knew that it was not only for this that he had been brought out and that there was more arduous work to come Once more he retired to the valise for we were making now for a vill for a heap of bricks near the river you may guess the river It was about this time that I made a little rhyme for him There was a young puppy called Howard Who at fighting was rather a coward He never quite ran When the battle began But he started at once to bow wow hard A good poet is supposed to be superior to the exigencies of rhyme but I am afraid that in any case Common s reputation had to be sacrificed to them To be lyrical over anybody called Howard Common without hinting that he well try for yourself Anyhow it was a lie as so much good poetry is There came a time when valises were left behind and life for a fortnight had to be sustained on a pack One seems to want very many things but there was no hesitation about Common s right to a place So he came to see his first German dug out and to get a proper understanding of this dead bleached land and the great work which awaited him there It was to blow away shells and bullets when they came too near the master in whose pocket he sat In this he was successful but I think that the feat in which he takes most pride was performed one very early summer morning A telephone line had to be laid and for reasons obvious to Common rather rapidly It was laid safely a mere nothing to him by this time But when it was joined up to the telephone in the front line then he realized that he was called upon to be not only a personal mascot but a mascot to the battalion and he sat himself upon the telephone and called down a blessing on that cable so that it remained whole for two days and a night when by all the rules it should have been in a thousand pieces And even if I didn t really do it all myself he said anyhow I did make some of the men in the trench smile a little that morning and there wasn t so very much smiling going on just then you know After that morning he lived in my pocket sometimes sniffing at an empty pipe sometimes trying to read letters from Mistress which joined him every day We had gone North to a more gentlemanly part of the line and his duties took but little of his time so that anything novel like a pair of pliers or an order from the Director of Army Signals was always welcome To begin with he took up rather more than his fair share of the pocket but he rapidly thinned down Alas in the rigours of the campaign he also lost his voice and his little black collar his only kit disappeared Then just when we seemed settled for the winter we were ordered South again Common knew what that meant a busy time for him We moved down slowly and he sampled billet after billet but we arrived at last and sat down to wait for the day And then he began to get nervous Always he was present when the operations were discussed he had seen all the maps he knew exactly what was expected of us And he didn t like it It s more than a fellow can do he said at least to be certain of I can blow away the shells in front and the shells from the right but if Master s map is correct we re going to get enfiladed from the left as well and one can t be everywhere This wants thinking about So he dived head downwards into the deepest recesses of my pocket and abandoned himself to thought A little later he came up with a smile Next morning I stayed in bed and the doctor came Common looked over his shoulder as he read the thermometer A hundred and four said Common Golly I hope I haven t over done it He came with me to the clearing station I only just blowed a germ at him he said wistfully one I found in his pocket I only just blowed it at him We went down to the base hospital together we went back to England And in the hospital in England Common suddenly saw his mistress again I ve brought him back Missis he said Here he is Have I done well He sits now in a little basket lined with flannel a hero returned from the War Round his neck he wears the regimental colours and on his chest will be sewn whatever medal is given to those who have served faithfully on the Western Front Seated in your comfortable club my very dear sir or in your delightful drawing room madam you smile pityingly Or perhaps you don t GEORGE S V C THE LAST OF THE WAR STORIES I The Colonel of the Nth Blankshires was seated in his office It was not an imposing room to look at Furnished simply but tastefully with a table officers for use of one and a chair ditto one it gave little evidence of the distressing scenes which had been enacted in it and still less evidence of the terrible scene which was to come Within these walls the Colonel was accustomed to deal out stern justice to offenders and many a hardened criminal had been carried out fainting upon hearing the terrible verdict One day s C B But the Colonel was not holding the scales of justice now for it was late afternoon With an expression of the utmost anxiety upon his face he read and re read the official looking document which he held in his hand Even the photograph of the Sergeant Major signed Yours ever Henry which stood upon his desk brought him no comfort The door opened and Major Murgatroyd second in command of the famous Blankshires came in Come in said Colonel Blowhard The Major saluted impressively and the Colonel rose and returned his salute with the politeness typical of the British Army You wished to see me Colonel I did Major They saluted each other again A secret document of enormous importance went on the Colonel has just reached me from the War Office It concerns the Regiment the dear old Regiment Both men saluted and the Colonel went on hoarsely Were the news in this document to become public property before its time nothing could avert the defeat of England in the present world wide cataclysm Is it as important as that Colonel said the Major even more hoarsely if anything It is Major The Major s voice sank to a whisper What would not Hindenburg give to see it he muttered Ay said the Colonel I say that to myself day and night What not what what would what Well I say it to myself day and night For this reason Major I have decided to entrust the news to no one but yourself Our Officers are good lads and a credit to the dear old Regiment they saluted as before but in a matter of this sort one cannot be too discreet You are right Colonel The Colonel looked round the room apprehensively and brought his chair a little closer to the Major The secret contained in this document Are we alone Except for each other Colonel The secret went on the Colonel is this that on and after the twenty third of the month men in category Xthree are to be included in category Xtwo My God gasped the Major if Hindenburg knew He must not know Major said the Colonel simply I can trust you not to disclose this until the time is ripe You can trust me Colonel They grasped hands and saluted At this moment the door opened and an orderly came in You re wanted by the Sergeant Major sir he told the Colonel Ah excuse me a moment said the latter to his second in command knowing how much it annoys a sergeant major to be kept waiting He saluted and hurried out Just a moment orderly said the Major The orderly came back Yes sir he said Did you give that message to Miss Blowhard Yes sir She says she cannot play golf with you to morrow because she is playing with Second Lieutenant Lord Smith He saluted and withdrew Left alone the Major gave vent to his rage Lord Smith he stormed Curse him What can she see in that puppy Thrice have I used my influence to send him away on a musketry course and thrice has he returned Could I but turn him out of the Regiment for good I might win the love of the fair Miss Blowhard the Colonel s daughter In a sudden passion he picked up the Manual of Military Law and flung it to the ground All at once an idea struck him and a crafty look came into his eyes By jove he cried the secret document The very thing To put the document into an envelope was the work of a moment Taking up a pen he printed on the outside in large capitals these words FOR HINDENBURG GERMANY With a diabolical smile he sealed the envelope up rang the bell and ordered Second Lieutenant Lord Smith to be brought before him You wanted me sir said Lord Smith on his arrival Of all the distinguished officers in the Nth Battalion Lord Smith was perhaps the most brilliant Although he had held his commission for three years he had only been arrested twice by the Provost Marshal the first time for wearing a soft cap when as an officer and gentleman he should have worn a hard one and the second time three months later for wearing a hard cap when as an officer and gentleman he should have worn a soft one Nobody can deny that these were serious blots on his career but it was felt in the trenches that his skill with the rifle partially atoned for them Ah Smith my boy said the Major genially I just wanted to know the address of your tailor Wonderfully well cut tunic this of yours He went over to him and under pretence of examining the cut of his tunic dropped the envelope cautiously into one of the pockets Somewhat surprised at the compliment paid to his tailor but entirely unsuspicious Lord Smith gave him the required address Thanks said the Major By the way I ve got to go out now would you mind waiting here till the Colonel comes back He has left an extremely important document on his table and I do not like to leave the room unoccupied Certainly sir said Lord Smith Left alone our hero gave himself up to thought For some reason he distrusted the Major he felt that they were rivals for the hand of Rosamund Blowhard On ten Sundays in succession he had been forced to attend Church Parade what time the Major and Rosamund were disporting themselves on the golf links It was only on Saturday afternoons that he had a chance of seeing her alone and yet he felt somehow that she loved him Ah Smith my boy said the Colonel as he bustled in Always glad to see you My favourite subaltern he went on with his hand on the young man s shoulder the best officer who ever formed a four at bridge I mean who ever formed fours and a holder of no fewer than three musketry certificates Lord Smith smiled modestly There I must get on with my work went on the Colonel sitting down at his table and turning over his papers You find me very you find me you find good Heavens What is it sir I don t find it I ve lost it the secret document Was it very important sir Important cried the Colonel If Hindenburg but we must get to work Summon the guard blow the fire alarm send for the Orderly Sergeant In less than a minute the room was full of armed men including the Major Men of the Nth Blankshires said the Colonel addressing them a document of enormous importance has been stolen from this room Unless that document is recovered the fair name of the Regiment will be irretrievably tarnished Never cried a Corporal of the Signalling Section and there was a deep murmur of applause May I suggest sir said the Major that the pockets of all should be searched I myself am quite ready to set the example and as he spoke he drew out three receipted bills and a price list of tomatoes and placed them before the Colonel One by one they followed his example Suddenly all eyes were fixed on Second Lieutenant Lord Smith as with horror and amazement upon his face he drew from his pocket the official looking envelope I swear I never put it there sir he gasped Perhaps I ought to tell you sir said the Major that I asked Lord Smith to keep an eye upon the document during my absence No doubt he placed it in his pocket for safety Several men applauded this suggestion for Lord Smith was a general favourite The Colonel gave one glance at the envelope and then with fire flashing from his eyes held it up for all to see How do you account for this he cried in a voice of thunder and with a gasp of horror they read the fatal words FOR HINDENBURG GERMANY The Colonel and the other officers drew their swords the rank and file fixed bayonets they hacked the buttons off Lord Smith s tunic they dug the stars out of his sleeves they tore the regimental badge from his cap they tore his collar they tore his tie they took his gold cigarette case and still he stood there saying proudly I am innocent Go said the Colonel pointing with his sword to the door Suddenly there was a commotion outside and a breathless figure pushed its way into the room Father cried Rosamund Blowhard spare him He is innocent Rosamund said George for so we must call him now I am innocent Some day the truth will be known Then he took a tender farewell of her and casting a glance of mingled suspicion and hatred at the Major he strode from the room II The patient in the Xth bed at the Yth Base Hospital stirred restlessly Water he murmured water A soft footed nurse rose and poured some over him Rosamund he breathed and with a smile of content dropped peacefully asleep again Who was he this mysterious patient in Number X bed Obviously a gentleman from the colour of his pyjamas his identity disc proclaimed him to be Private Smithlord of the Qth Blankshires There was something strange about him Only that morning he had received the V C from Sir Douglas Haig the R S V P from General Petain the Order of the Golden Elephant from our Japanese Allies the Order of the Split Haddock from the President of Nicaragua and the Order of the Neutral Nut from Brazil Yet he cared for none of these things he only murmured Rosamund Who was Private Smithlord Though so little was known of him the story of his prowess was on every lip An officer from his regiment who had gone out alone to an observation post had been surrounded and cut off by the enemy Threatened on all sides by guns and bombs of every calibre he had prepared to sell his life dearly To attempt a rescue would have been madness even the most reckless Town Major would have blenched at the idea and the Regiment in the comparative safety of their trench could only look on helplessly All but Private Smithlord Hastily borrowing the Colonel s horse he urged the gallant animal up the trench and away over the top And then began a race such as had never been seen at Epsom or Melton Mowbray Gad said a sporting subaltern who in peace days had frequently entered for a Derby sweepstake at the National Liberal Club the beggar can ride what An answering cheer rang out from all ranks Over wire entanglements and across shell holes dashed Private Smithlord firing rapidly with his revolver all the while Nearer to the ill fated officer he drew and then suddenly he was in the midst of the enemy Lashing out right and left he fought his way to the man he had come to rescue pulled him up behind him and amidst a hurricane of bullets charged back to the British lines Nor did he pause till he arrived at the Colonel s dug out I have brought him back sir he said and fainted When he awoke it was to find himself in the Xth bed of the Yth Base Hospital And who is it in the next bed It is the officer whom he rescued Do we recognize him Alas no Although unwounded by the enemy the exposure of that terrible day had brought on a severe attack of mumps We cannot recognize him But the nurse assures us that it is our old friend Major Murgatroyd A visitor to see you said the nurse coming in and waking Private Smithlord up Can t you say I m out said Smithlord expecting it was another foreign decoration and wondering what language he would have to speak this time It s an English Colonel said the nurse Smithlord saluted and begged the nurse to show him up at once In another minute Colonel Blowhard had entered I want to thank you said the Colonel for so gallantly rescuing an old friend of mine Major Murgatroyd belonging to the Nth Battalion Blankshires but now attached to the Qth Smithlord could hardly repress a start In the excitement of the moment he had not recognized the features of the man he had saved It was his old rival It is curious went on the Colonel that in features you resemble another old friend of mine Lord Smith My name is Smithlord sir Ah Any relation None said Smithlord crossing his thumbs under the bedclothes Do you mind ringing the bell he went on feeling that at all costs he must turn the conversation I think it is time for my medicine In answer to the Colonel s ring a nurse appeared Nurse Brown has just gone out she said Can I do anything for you Good Heavens Rosamund cried the Colonel Yes father it is I she replied simply I have come to France to find the man I love Murgatroyd said the Colonel But this gallant fellow was the man who By the way let me introduce you Private Smithlord my daughter Rosamund The two looked at each other face to face The intuition and ready wit of the woman pierced the disguise which had baffled the soldier Father she cried it s not Smithlord it s Lord Smith George Rosamund cried George We cannot keep the secret any longer from our readers it was Lord Smith Tut tut sir what is this said the Colonel I turned you out of the Regiment three weeks ago What the deuce he said for like all military men he was addicted to strong language what the deuce does this mean I was innocent sir Father he was innocent He was innocent said a hollow voice from the next bed In amazement they all looked at the officer lying there Rosamund he cried am I so greatly changed The Colonel handed him his pocket mirror Yes sighed the Major I understand But I am Major Murgatroyd Major Murgatroyd they all cried This gallant fellow here whom I now know to be Lord Smith saved my life I cannot let him suffer any longer It was I who hid the secret document in his pocket I did it for love of you Rosamund He held out his hand Say you forgive me my dear Lord Smith Lord Smith shook his hand warmly But little more remains to tell A month later our hero was back in England Fortunately the Quartermaster had kept his buttons and in a very short time he was back in the dear old uniform and the wedding of Second Lieutenant Lord Smith to Rosamund Blowhard was one of the events of the season And what of Major Murgatroyd He has learnt his lesson and as commandant of a rest camp on the French coast he is the soul of geniality to all who meet him THE BALLAD OF PRIVATE CHADD I sing of George Augustus Chadd Who d always from a baby had A deep affection for his Dad In other words his Father Contrariwise the father s one And only treasure was his son Yes even when he d gone and done Things which annoyed him rather For instance if at Christmas say Or on his parent s natal day The thoughtless lad forgot to pay The customary greeting His father s visage only took That dignified reproachful look Which dying beetles give the cook Above the clouds of Keating As years went on such looks were rare The younger Chadd was always there To greet his father and to share His father s birthday party The pink For auld acquaintance sake Engraved in sugar on the cake Was his The speech he used to make Was reverent but hearty The younger Chadd was twentyish When War broke out but did not wish To get an A S C commish Or be a rag time sailor Just Private Chadd he was and went To join his Dad s old regiment While Dad the dear old dug out sent For red tabs from the tailor To those inured to war s alarms I need not dwell upon the charms Of raw recruits when sloping arms Nor tell why Chadd was hoping That if his sloping powers increased They d give him two days leave at least To join his Father s birthday feast And so resumed his sloping One morning on the training ground When fixing bayonets he found The fatal day already round And even as he fixed he Decided then and there to state To Sergeant Brown at any rate His longing to congratulate His sire on being sixty Sergeant he said we re on the eve Of Father s birthday grant me leave And here his bosom gave a heave To offer him my blessing And if a Private s tender thanks Nay do not blank my blanky blanks I could not help but leave the ranks Birthdays are more than dressing The Sergeant was a kindly soul He loved his men upon the whole He d also had a father s role Pressed on him fairly lately Brave Chadd he said thou speakest sooth O happy day O pious youth Great he extemporized is Truth And it shall flourish greatly The Sergeant took him by the hand And led him to the Captain and The Captain tried to understand And more or less succeeded Correct me if you don t agree But one of you wants what said he And George Augustus Chadd said Me Meaning of course that he did The Captain took him by the ear And gradually brought him near The Colonel who was far from clear But heard it all politely And asked him twice You want a what The Captain said that he did not And Chadd saluted quite a lot And put the matter rightly The Colonel took him by the hair And furtively conveyed him where The General inhaled the air Immaculately booted Then said Unless I greatly err This Private wishes to prefer A small petition to you Sir And so again saluted The General inclined his head Towards the two of them and said Speak slowly please or shout instead I m hard of hearing rather So Chadd that promising recruit Stood to attention clicked his boot And bellowed with his best salute A happy birthday Father THE VISITORS BOOK

none	none	 I said FROM A FULL HEART In days of peace my fellow men Rightly regarded me as more like A Bishop than a Major general And nothing since has made me warlike But when this age long struggle ends And I have seen the Allies dish up The goose of Hindenburg oh friends I shall out bish the mildest Bishop When the War is over and the Kaiser s out of print I m going to buy some tortoises and watch the beggars sprint When the War is over and the sword at last we sheathe I m going to keep a jelly fish and listen to it breathe I never really longed for gore And any taste for red corpuscles That lingered with me left before The German troops had entered Brussels In early days the Colonel s Shun Froze me and as the War grew older The noise of someone else s gun Left me considerably colder When the War is over and the battle has been won I m going to buy a barnacle and take it for a run When the War is over and the German Fleet we sink I m going to keep a silk worm s egg and listen to it think The Captains and the Kings depart It may be so but not lieutenants Dawn after weary dawn I start The never ending round of penance One rock amid the welter stands On which my gaze is fixed intently An after life in quiet lands Lived very lazily and gently When the War is over and we ve done the Belgians proud I m going to keep a chrysalis and read to it aloud When the War is over and we ve finished up the show I m going to plant a lemon pip and listen to it grow Oh I m tired of the noise and the turmoil of battle And I m even upset by the lowing of cattle And the clang of the bluebells is death to my liver And the roar of the dandelion gives me a shiver And a glacier in movement is much too exciting And I m nervous when standing on one of alighting Give me Peace that is all that is all that I seek Say starting on Saturday week ONE STAR Occasionally I receive letters from friends whom I have not seen lately addressed to Lieutenant M and apologizing prettily inside in case I am by now a colonel in drawing rooms I am sometimes called Captain er and up at the Fort the other day a sentry of the Royal Defence Corps wearing the Crecy medal mistook me for a Major and presented crossbows to me This is all wrong As mister Garvin well points out it is important that we should not have a false perspective of the War Let me then make it perfectly plain I am a Second Lieutenant When I first became a Second Lieutenant I was rather proud I was a Second Lieutenant on probation On my right sleeve I wore a single star So on probation of course On my left sleeve I wore another star So also on probation They were good stars none better in the service and as we didn t like the sound of on probation Celia put a few stitches in them to make them more permanent This proved effective Six months later I had a very pleasant note from the King telling me that the days of probation were now over and making it clear that he and I were friends I was now a real Second Lieutenant On my right sleeve I had a single star Thus not on probation On my left sleeve I also had a single star In this manner This star also was now a fixed one From that time forward my thoughts dwelt naturally on promotion There were exalted persons in the regiment called Lieutenants They had two stars on each sleeve So I decided to become a Lieutenant Promotion in our regiment was difficult After giving the matter every consideration I came to the conclusion that the only way to win my second star was to save the Colonel s life I used to follow him about affectionately in the hope that he would fall into the sea He was a big strong man and a powerful swimmer but once in the water it would not be difficult to cling round his neck and give an impression that I was rescuing him However he refused to fall in I fancy that he wore somebody s Military Soles which prevent slipping Years rolled on I used to look at my stars sometimes one on each sleeve they seemed very lonely At times they came close together but at other times as for instance when I was semaphoring they were very far apart To prevent these occasional separations Celia took them off my sleeves and put them on my shoulders One on each shoulder So And so There they stayed And more years rolled on One day Celia came to me in great excitement Have you seen this in the paper about promotion she said eagerly No what is it I asked Are they making more generals I don t know about generals it s Second Lieutenants being Lieutenants You re joking on a very grave subject I said seriously You can t expect to win the War if you go on like that Well you read it she said handing me the paper I took the paper with a trembling hand and read She was right If the paper was to be believed all Second Lieutenants were to become Lieutenants after eighteen years service At last my chance had come My dear this is wonderful I said In another fifteen years we shall be there You might buy two more stars this afternoon and practise sewing them on in order to be ready You mustn t be taken by surprise when the actual moment comes But you re a Lieutenant now she said if that s true It says that after eighteen months I snatched up the paper again Good Heavens it was eighteen months not years Then I am a Lieutenant I said We had a bottle of champagne for dinner that night and Celia got the paper and read it aloud to my tunic And just for practice she took the two stars off my other tunic and sewed them on this one thus And we had a very happy evening I suppose it will be a few days before it s officially announced I said Bother I suppose it will said Celia and very reluctantly she took one star off each shoulder leaving the matter so And the years rolled on And I am still a Second Lieutenant I do not complain indeed I am even rather proud of it If I am not gaining on my original one star at least I am keeping pace with it I might so easily have been a corporal by now But I should like to have seen a little more notice taken of me in the Gazette I scan it every day hoping for some such announcement as this Second Lieutenant M to remain a Second Lieutenant Or this Second Lieutenant M to be seconded and to retain his present rank of Second Lieutenant Or even this Second Lieutenant M relinquishes the rank of Acting Second Lieutenant on ceasing to command a Battalion and reverts to the rank of Second Lieutenant Failing this I have thought sometimes of making an announcement in the Personal Column of The Times Second Lieutenant M regrets that his duties as a Second Lieutenant prevent him from replying personally to the many kind inquiries he has received and begs to take this opportunity of announcing that he still retains a star on each shoulder Both doing well But perhaps that is unnecessary now I think that by this time I have made it clear just how many stars I possess One on the right shoulder So And one on the left shoulder So That is all THE JOKE A TRAGEDY CHAPTER I The Joke was born one October day in the trench called Mechanics not so far from Loos We had just come back into the line after six days in reserve and the afternoon being quiet I was writing my daily letter to Celia I was telling her about our cat imported into our dug out in the hope that it would keep the rats down when suddenly the Joke came I was so surprised by it that I added in brackets This is quite my own I ve only just thought of it Later on the Post Corporal came and the Joke started on its way to England CHAPTER II Chapter II finds me some months later at home again Do you remember that joke about the rats in one of your letters said Celia one evening Yes You never told me if you liked it I simply loved it You aren t going to waste it are you If you simply loved it it wasn t wasted But I want everybody else Couldn t you use it in the Revue I was supposed to be writing a Revue at this time for a certain impresario I wasn t getting on very fast because whenever I suggested a scene to him he either said Oh that s been done which killed it or else he said Oh but that s never been done which killed it even more completely Good idea I said to Celia We ll have a Trench Scene I suggested it to the impresario when next I saw him Oh that s been done he said Mine will be quite different from anybody else s I said firmly He brightened up a little All right try it he said I seemed to have discovered the secret of successful revue writing The Trench Scene was written It was written round the Joke whose bright beams like a perfect jewel in a perfect setting However I said all that to Celia at the time She was just going to have said it herself she told me So far so good But a month later the Revue collapsed The impresario and I agreed upon many things as for instance that the War would be a long one and that Hindenburg was no fool but there were two points upon which we could never quite agree one What was funny and two which of us was writing the Revue So with mutual expressions of goodwill and hopes that one day we might write a tragedy together we parted That ended the Revue it ended the Trench Scene and for the moment it ended the Joke CHAPTER III Chapter III finds the war over and Celia still at it You haven t got that Joke in yet She had just read an article of mine called Autumn in a Country Vicarage It wouldn t go in there very well I said It would go in anywhere where there were rats There might easily be rats in a vicarage Not in this one You talk about poor as a church mouse I am an artist I said thumping my heart and forehead and other seats of the emotions I don t happen to see rats there and if I don t see them I can t write about them Anyhow they wouldn t be secular rats like the ones I made my joke about I don t mind whether the rats are secular or circular said Celia but do get them in soon Well I tried I really did try but for months I couldn t get those rats in It was a near thing sometimes and I would think that I had them but at the last moment they would whisk off and back into their holes again I even wrote an article about Cooking in the Great War feeling that that would surely tempt them but they were not to be drawn CHAPTER IV But at last the perfect opportunity came I received a letter from a botanical paper asking for an article on the Flora of Trench Life Horray said Celia There you are I sat down and wrote the article Working up gradually to the subject of rats and even more gradually intertwining it so to speak with the subject of cats I brought off in one perfect climax the great Joke Lovely said Celia excitedly There is one small point which has occurred to me Rats are fauna not flora I ve just remembered Oh does it matter For a botanical paper yes And then Celia had a brilliant inspiration Send it to another paper she said I did Two days later it appeared Considering that I hadn t had a proof it came out extraordinarily well There was only one misprint It was at the critical word of the Joke CHAPTER V That s torn it I said to Celia I suppose it has she said sadly The world will never hear the Joke now It s had it wrong but still it s had it and I can t repeat it Celia began to smile It s sickening she said but it s really rather funny you know And then she had another brilliant inspiration In fact you might write an article about it And as you see I have EPILOGUE Having read thus far Celia says But you still haven t got the Joke in Oh well here goes Extract from letter We came back to the line to day to find that the cat had kittened However as all the rats seem to have rottened we are much as we were Rottened was misprinted rattened which seems to me to spoil the Joke Yet I must confess that there are times now when I feel that perhaps after all I may have overrated it But it was a pleasant joke in its day THE LAST POT Let others hymn the weariness and pain Or if they will the glory and the glamour Of holding fast from Flanders to Lorraine The thin brown line at which the Germans hammer My Muse a more domesticated maid Aspires to sing a song of Marmalade O Marmalade I do not mean the sort Sweet marrow pulp for babes and maidens fitter But that wherein the golden fishes sport On oranges seas with just a dash of bitter Not falsely coy but eager to parade Their Southern birth in short O Marmalade Much have I sacrificed my happy home My faith in experts figures half my money The fortnight that I meant to spend in Rome My weekly effort to be fairly funny But these are trifles light as air when weighed Against this other Breakfast Marmalade Fair was the porridge in the days of peace And still more fair the cream and sugar taken Plump were the twin poached eggs yet not obese Upon their thrones of toast and crisp the bacon I face their loss undaunted unafraid If only I may keep my Marmalade An evening press without Callisthenes A tables Staff an immobile spaghetti A Shaw with whom the Common Man agrees A Zambra searching vainly for Negretti When spades are trumps a hand without a spade So is my breakfast lacking Marmalade O Northcliffe Lord O Keiller O Dundee O Crosse and Blackwell Limited O Seville O orange groves along the Middle Sea O Jaffa for example O the devil Let Beef and Butter Rolls and Rabbits fade But give me back my love my Marmalade THE STORY THAT WENT WEST Why don t you write a war story said Celia one autumn day when that sort of story was popular Because everybody else does I said I forget how many bayonets we have on the Western Front but there must be at least twice as many fountain pens It needn t be about the Western Front Unfortunately that s the only front I know anything about I thought writers used their imagination sometimes said Celia to anybody who might happen to be listening Oh well if you put it like that I said I suppose I must So I settled down to a story about the Salonica Front The scene of my story was laid in an old clay hut amid the wattles What are wattles asked Celia when I told her the good news Local colour I explained They grow in Bulgaria Are you sure I m sure that these ones did I don t know about any others Of course more local colour was wanted than a mere wattle or two It was necessary therefore for my Bulgarians always to go about in comitadjis Celia thought that these were a kind of native trouser laced at the knee She may be right My own impression is that they are a species of platoon Anyhow the Bulgars always went about in them There was a fierce fight which raged round the old clay hut in the wattles The Greeks shouted Greek Tupto tuptomai The Serbs for reasons into which I need not enter were inarticulate with rage With the French and British I had of course no difficulty and the Bulgars fortunately were content with hoarse guttural noises It was a fierce fight while it lasted and I was sorry when it was over because for the first time I began to feel at home with my story I need not say that many a Bulgar had licked the wattles before I had finished Unfortunately something else happened before I had finished What do you think cried Celia bursting into my room one evening just when I was wondering whether my readers would expect to know more of the heroine s native costume than that it was simple yet becoming Wait a moment I said It s too good to wait said Celia excitedly Bulgaria has surrendered Celia may be a good patriot but she lacks the artistic temperament Oh has she I said bitterly Then she s jolly well spoilt my story The one about the wattles Yes Tut tuttles said Celia frivolously Well I wasn t going to waste my wattles With great presence of mind I decided to transfer my story to the Palestine Front Under a hard blue sky of intense brilliance the old clay hut stood among the wattles A wadi ran by the side of it not a small Turkish dog as Celia thought but well everybody knows what a wadi is The battle went on much as before except that the Turks were naturally more outspoken than the Bulgars calling freely upon Allah at the beginning of the fight and reconciling themselves to the end of it with Kismet I also turned some of the horses into camels and for the sake of the Indian troops several pairs of puttees into chupaties It was a good story while it lasted However nobody seems to care about art nowadays What do you think cried Celia bursting into my room I held up a delaying hand I had suddenly thought of the word adobe My story seemed to need it somewhere If possible among the wattles But listen She read out the headline Turkey Surrenders at Discretion Discretion I said indignantly I have never heard of anything so tactless And it isn t as though I could even move on to Mesopotamia Couldn t there be a little local rising in Persia suggested Celia I doubt it I doubt it I said thoughtfully You can t do much with just wattles and a little sherbet I mean you can t expect the public to be interested in Persia at such a moment as this No we shall have to step westward We must see what we can do with the Italian Front But I had very little hope A curious foreboding of evil came over me as I placed those wattles tenderly along the west bank of the Piave The old clay hut still stood proudly amid them the Bersaglieri advanced impetuously with cries of En avant no that s wrong with cries of well anyhow they advanced They advanced And as I shut my eyes I seemed to see no not that old clay hut amid the wattles nor yet the adobe edifice on the heights of Asiago but Celia coming into the library with another paper announcing that yet another country was deaf to the call of art If anybody wants a really good story about the Peninsular War and will drop me a line I shall be glad to enter into negotiations with him The scene is laid in the neighbourhood of Badajoz and the chief interest centres round an old yes you have guessed it an old clay hut in the wattles THE TWO VISITS eighteen eighty eight nineteen nineteen Dispersal Areas tena tenb tenc Crystal Palace It was I think in eighty eight That Luck or Providence or Fate Assumed the more material state Of Aunt or Great Aunt Alice And took the weather being fine And Bill the eldest only nine Three of us by the Brighton line To see the Crystal Palace Observe us then an eager four Advancing on the Western Door Or possibly the Northern or Well anyhow advancing Aunt Alice bending from the hips And Bill in little runs and trips And John with frequent hops and skips While I was fairly dancing Aunt Alice pays the turnstile clicks And with the happy crowds we mix To gaze upon well I was six Say getting on for seven And looking back on it to day The memories have passed away I find that I can only say Roughly to gaze on heaven Heaven it was which came to pass Within those magic walls of glass Though William like a silly ass Had lost my bag of bull s eyes The wonders of that wonder hall The all the things I can t recall And dominating over all The statues more than full size Adam and Niobe were there Disraeli much the worse for wear Samson before he d cut his hair Lord Byron and Apollo A female group surrounded by A camel though I don t know why And all of them were ten feet high And all I think were hollow These gods looked down on us and smiled To see how utterly a child By simple things may be beguiled To happiness and laughter It warmed their kindly hearts to see The joy of Bill and John and me From ten to lunch from lunch to tea From tea to six or after That evening when the day was dead They tucked a babe of six in bed Arranged the pillows for his head And saw the lights were shaded Too sleepy for the Good night kiss His only conscious thought was this No man shall ever taste the bliss That I this blessed day did When one is six one cannot tell And John who at the Palace fell A victim to the Blondin Belle Is wedded to another And I my intimates allow Have lost the taste for bull s eyes now And baldness decorates the brow Of Bill our elder brother Well more than thirty years have passed But all the same on Thursday last My heart was beating just as fast Within that Hall of Wonder My bliss was every bit as great As what it was in eighty eight Impossible to look sedate Or keep my feelings under The gods of old still gazed upon The scene where thirty years agone The lines of Bill and me and John Were cast in pleasant places And Friends I murmured what s the odds If you are rather battered gods This is no time for Ichabods And eheu er fugaces Ah no I did not mourn the years Fell work upon those poor old dears Nor Pitt nor Venus drew my tears And set me slowly sobbing I hailed them with a happy laugh And slapped old Samson on the calf And asked a member of the staff For Officers Demobbing That evening being then dispersed I swore as I had sworn it first When three of us went on the burst With Aunt or Great Aunt Alice Although one finds as man or boy A thousand pleasures to enjoy For happiness without alloy Give me the Crystal Palace V HOME NOTES THE WAY DOWN Sydney Smith or Napoleon or Marcus Aurelius somebody about that time said that after ten days any letter would answer itself You see what he meant Left to itself your invitation from the Duchess to lunch next Tuesday is no longer a matter to worry about by Wednesday morning You were either there or not there it is unnecessary to write now and say that a previous invitation from the Prime Minister and so on It was Napoleon s idea or doctor Johnson s or Mark Antony s one of that circle that all correspondence can be treated in this manner I have followed these early Masters or whichever one it was to the best of my ability At any given moment in the last few years there have been ten letters that I absolutely must write thirty which I ought to write and fifty which any other person in my position would have written Probably I have written two After all when your profession is writing you have some excuse for demanding a change of occupation in your leisure hours No doubt if I were a coal heaver by day my wife would see to the fire after dinner while I wrote letters As it is she does the correspondence while I gaze into the fire and think about things You will say no doubt that this was all very well before the War but that in the Army a little writing would be a pleasant change after the day s duties Allow me to disillusion you If years ago I had ever conceived a glorious future in which my autograph might be of value to the more promiscuous collectors that conception has now been shattered Four years in the Army has absolutely spoilt the market Even were I revered in the year two thousand A D as Shakespeare is revered now my half million autographs scattered so lavishly on charge sheets passes chits requisitions indents and applications would keep the price at a dead level of about ten a penny No I have had enough of writing in the Army and I never want to sign my own name again Yours sincerely Herbert Asquith Faithfully yours J Jellicoe these by all means but not my own However I wrote a letter in the third year of the war it was to the bank It informed the Manager that I had arrived in London from France and should be troubling them again shortly London being to all appearances an expensive place It also called attention to my new address a small furnished flat in which Celia and I could just turn round if we did it separately When it was written then came the question of posting it I was all for waiting till the next morning but Celia explained that there was actually a letterbox on our own floor twenty yards down the passage I took the letter along and dropped it into the slit Then a wonderful thing happened It went Flipperty flipperty flipperty flipperty flipperty flipperty flipperty flipperty flipperty flipperty FLOP I listened intently hoping for more but that was all Deeply disappointed that it was over but absolutely thrilled with my discovery I hurried back to Celia Any letters you want posted I said in an off hand way No thank you she said Have you written any while we ve been here I don t think I ve had anything to write I think I said reproachfully it s quite time you wrote to your your bank or your mother or somebody She looked at me and seemed to be struggling for words I know exactly what you re going to say I said but don t say it write a little letter instead Well as a matter of fact I must just write a note to the laundress To the laundress I said Of course just a note When it was written I insisted on her coming with me to post it With great generosity I allowed her to place it in the slit A delightful thing happened It went Flipperty flipperty flipperty flipperty flipperty flipperty flipperty flipperty flipperty flipperty FLOP Right down to the letter box in the hall Two flipperties a floor A simple calculation shows that we are perched on the fifth floor I am glad now that we live so high It must be very dull to be on the fourth floor with only eight flipperties unbearable to be on the first with only two O oh How fas cinating said Celia Now don t you think you ought to write to your mother Oh I must She wrote We posted it It went Flipperty flipperty However you know all about that now Since this great discovery of mine life has been a more pleasurable business We feel now that there are romantic possibilities about Letters setting forth on their journey from our floor To start life with so many flipperties might lead to anything Each time that we send a letter off we listen in a tremble of excitement for the final FLOP and when it comes I think we both feel vaguely that we are still waiting for something We are waiting to hear some magic letter go flipperty flipperty flipperty flipperty and behold there is no FLOP and still it goes on flipperty flipperty flipperty flipperty growing fainter in the distance until it arrives at some wonderland of its own One day it must happen so For we cannot listen always for that FLOP and hear it always nothing in this world is as inevitable as that One day we shall look at each other with awe in our faces and say But it s still flipperting and from that time forward the Hill of Campden will be a place holy and enchanted Perhaps on Midsummer Eve At any rate I am sure that it is the only way in which to post a letter to Father Christmas Well what I want to say is this if I have been a bad correspondent in the past I am a good one now and Celia who was always a good one is a better one It takes at least ten letters a day to satisfy us and we prefer to catch ten different posts With the ten in your hand together there is always a temptation to waste them in one wild rush of flipperties all catching each other up It would be a great moment but I do not think we can afford it yet we must wait until we get more practised at letter writing And even then I am doubtful for it might be that lost in the confusion of that one wild rush the magic letter would start on its way flipperty flipperty to the never land and we should forever have missed it So friends acquaintances yes and even strangers I beg you now to give me another chance I will answer your letters how gladly I still think that Napoleon or Canute or the younger Pliny one of the pre Raphaelites took a perfectly correct view of his correspondence but then he never had a letter box which went Flipperty flipperty flipperty flipperty flipperty flipperty flipperty flipperty flipperty flipperty FLOP HEAVY WORK Every now and then doctors slap me about and ask me if I was always as thin as this As thin as what I say with as much dignity as is possible to a man who has had his shirt taken away from him As thin as this says the doctor hooking his stethoscope on to one of my ribs and then going round to the other side to see how I am getting on there I am slightly better on the other side but he runs his pencil up and down me and produces that pleasing noise which small boys get by dragging a stick along railings I explain that I was always delicately slender but that latterly my ribs have been overdoing it You must put on more flesh he says sternly running his pencil up and down them again He must have been a great nuisance as a small boy I will I say fervently I will Satisfied by my promise he gives me back my shirt But it is not only the doctor who complains Celia is even more upset by it She says tearfully that I remind her of a herring Unfortunately she does not like herrings It is my hope some day to remind her of a turbot and make her happy She too has my promise that I will put on flesh We had a fortnight s leave a little while ago which seemed to give me a good opportunity of putting some on So we retired to a house in the country where there is a weighing machine in the bathroom We felt that the mere sight of this weighing machine twice daily would stimulate the gaps between my ribs They would realize that they had been brought down there on business The first morning I weighed myself just before stepping into the water When I got down to breakfast I told Celia the result You are a herring she said sadly But think what an opportunity it gives me If I started the right weight the rest of the fortnight would be practically wasted By the way the doctor talks about putting on flesh but he didn t say how much he wanted What do you think would be a nice amount About another stone said Celia You were just a nice size before the War All right Perhaps I had better tell the weighing machine This is a company operative job I can t do it all myself The next morning I was the same as before and the next and the next and the next Really said Celia pathetically we might just as well have gone to a house where there wasn t a weighing machine at all I don t believe it s trying Are you sure you stand on it long enough Long enough for me It s a bit cold you know Well make quite sure to morrow I must have you not quite so herringy I made quite sure the next morning I had eight stone and a half on the weight part and the little thing you move up and down was on the four notch and the bar balanced midway between the top and the bottom To have had a crowd in to see would have been quite unnecessary the whole machine was shouting eight stone eleven as loudly as it could I expect it s got used to you said Celia when I told her the sad state of affairs It likes eight stone eleven people We will give it I said one more chance Next morning the weights were as I had left them and I stepped on without much hope expecting that the bar would come slowly up to its midway position of rest To my immense delight however it never hesitated but went straight up to the top At last I had put on flesh Very delicately I moved the thing you move up and down to its next notch Still the bar stayed at the top I had put on at least another ounce of flesh I continued to put on more ounces Still the bar remained up I was eight stone thirteen Good heavens I was eight stone fourteen I pushed the thing you move up and down back to the zero position and exchanged the half stone weight for a stone one Excited but a trifle cold for it was a fresh morning and the upper part of the window was wide open I went up from nine stone ounce by ounce At nine stone twelve I jumped off for a moment and shut the window At eleven stone eight I had to get off again in order to attend to the bath which was in danger of overflowing At fifteen stone eleven the breakfast gong went At nineteen stone nine I realized that I had overdone it However I decided to know the worst The worst that the machine could tell me was twenty stone seven At twenty stone seven I left it Celia who had nearly finished breakfast looked up eagerly as I came in Well she said I am sorry I am late I apologized but I have been putting on flesh Have you really gone up she asked excitedly Yes I began mechanically to help myself to porridge and then stopped No perhaps not I said thoughtfully Have you gone up much Much I said Quite much How much Quick Celia I said sadly I am twenty stone seven I may be more the weighing machine gave out then Oh but darling that s much too much Still it s what we came here for I pointed out No no bacon thanks a small piece of dry toast I suppose the machine couldn t have made a mistake It seemed very decided about it It didn t hesitate at all Just try again after breakfast to make sure Perhaps I d better try now I said getting up because if I turned out to be only twenty stone six I might venture on a little porridge after all I shan t be long I went upstairs I didn t dare face that weighing machine in my clothes after the way in which I had already strained it without them I took them off hurriedly and stepped on To my joy the bar stayed in its downward position I took off an ounce then another ounce The bar remained down At eighteen stone two I jumped off for a moment in order to shut the window which some careless housemaid had opened again At twelve stone seven I shouted through the door to Celia that I shouldn t be long and that I should want the porridge after all At four stone six I said that I had better have an egg or two as well At three ounces I stepped off feeling rather shaken I have not used the weighing machine since partly because I do not believe it is trustworthy partly because I spent the rest of my leave in bed with a severe cold We are now in London again where I am putting on flesh At least the doctor who slapped me about yesterday said that I must and I promised him that I would THE PATRIOT This is a true story Unless you promise to believe me it is not much good my going on You promise Very well Years ago I bought a pianola I went into the shop to buy a gramophone record and I came out with a pianola so golden tongued was the manager You would think that one could then retire into private life for a little but it is only the beginning There is the music stool to be purchased the library subscription the tuner s fee four visits a year if you please the cabinet for the rolls the man to oil the pedals the However one gets out of the shop at last Nor do I regret my venture It is common talk that my pianola was the chief thing about me which attracted Celia I must marry a man with a pianola she said and there was I and here in fact we are My blessings then on the golden tongue of the manager Now there is something very charming in a proper modesty about one s attainments but it is necessary that the attainments should be generally recognized first It was admirable in Stephenson to have said as I am sure he did when they congratulated him on his first steam engine Tut tut it s nothing but he could only say this so long as the others were in a position to offer the congratulations In order to place you in that position I must let you know how extraordinarily well I played the pianola I brought to my interpretation of different Ops an elan a verve a je ne sais quoi and several other French words which were the astonishment of all who listened to me But chiefly I was famous for my playing of one piece The Charge of the Uhlans by Karl Bohm Others may have seen Venice by moonlight or heard the Vicar s daughter recite Little Jim but the favoured few who have been present when Bohm and I were collaborating are the ones who have really lived Indeed even the coldest professional critic would have spoken of it as a noteworthy rendition The Charge of the Uhlans If you came to see me you had to hear it As arranged for the pianola it was marked to be played throughout at a lightning pace and with the loudest pedal on So one would play it if one wished to annoy the man in the flat below but a true musician has I take it a higher aim I disregarded the FF s and the other sign posts on the way and gave it my own interpretation As played by me The Charge of the Uhlans became a whole battle scene Indeed it was necessary before I began that I should turn to my audience and describe the scene to them in the manner but not in the words of a Queen s Hall programme Er first of all you hear the cavalry galloping past and then there s a short hymn before action while they form up and then comes the charge and then there s a slow bit while they er pick up the wounded and then they trot slowly back again And if you listen carefully to the last bit you ll actually hear the horses limping Something like that I would say and it might happen that an insufferable guest who never got asked again would object that the hymn part was unusual in real warfare They sang it in this piece anyhow I would say stiffly and turn my back on him and begin But the war put a stop to music as to many other things For years the pianola was not played by either of us We had other things to do And in our case curiously enough absence from the pianola did not make the heart grow fonder On the contrary we seemed to lose our taste for music and when at last we were restored to our pianola we found that we had grown out of it It s very ugly announced Celia We can t help our looks I said in my grandmother s voice A book case would be much prettier there But not so tuneful A pianola isn t tuneful if you never play it True I said Celia then became very alluring and suggested that I might find somebody who would like to be lent a delightful pianola by somebody whose delightful wife had her eye on a delightful bookcase I might I said Somebody said Celia who isn t supplied with music from below I found John He was quite pleased with the idea and promised to return the pianola when he got sick of it So on Wednesday it went I was not sorry because in its silence it was far from beautiful and we wanted another book case badly But on Tuesday evening its last hours with us I had to confess to a certain melancholy It is sad to part with an old and well tried friend particularly when that friend is almost entirely responsible for your marriage I looked at the pianola and then I said to Celia I must play it once again Please said Celia The old masterpiece I suppose I said as I got it out Do you think you ought to now I don t think I want to hear a charge of the Uhlans beasts I want a charge of our own men Art I said grandly knows no frontiers I suppose this has been said by several people several times already but for the moment both Celia and I thought it was rather clever So I placed the roll in the pianola sat down and began to play Ah the dear old tune Dash it all What s happened said Celia breaking a silence which had become alarming I must have put it in wrong I said I wound the roll off put it in again and tried a second time pedalling vigorously Dead silence Hush A note another silence and then another note I pedalled through to the end About five notes sounded Celia I said this is wonderful It really was wonderful For the first time in its life my pianola refused to play The Charge of the Uhlans It had played it a hundred times before the War but now no We had to have a farewell piece I put in a waltz and it played it perfectly Then we said good bye to our pianola feeling a reverence for it which we had never felt before You don t believe this Yet you promised you would and I still assure you that it is true But I admit that the truth is sometimes hard to believe and the first six persons to whom I told the story assured me frankly that I was a liar If one is to be called a liar one may as well make an effort to deserve the name I made an effort therefore with the seventh person I put in The Charge of the Uhlans I said and it played God Save the King Unfortunately he was a very patriotic man and he believed it So that is how the story is now going about But you who read this know the real truth of the matter A QUESTION OF LIGHT As soon as Celia had got a cheque book of her own and I had explained the mysteries of company to her she looked round for a safe investment of her balance which amounted to several pounds My offers first of an old stocking and afterwards of mines mortgages and aerated breads were rejected at once I ll leave a little in the bank in case of accidents she said and the rest must go somewhere absolutely safe and earn me five per cent Otherwise they shan t have it We did what we could for her we offered the money to archdeacons and other men of pronounced probity and finally we invested it in the Blanktown Electric Light Company Blanktown is not its real name of course but I do not like to let out any information which may be of value to Celia s enemies the wicked ones who are trying to snatch her little fortune from her The world we feel is a dangerous place for a young woman with money Can t I possibly lose it now she asked Only in two ways I said Blanktown might disappear in the night or the inhabitants might give up using electric light It seemed safe enough At the same time we watched the newspapers anxiously for details of the latest inventions and anybody who happened to mention when dining with us that he was experimenting with a new and powerful illuminant was handed his hat at once You have Blanktown then as the depository of Celia s fortune Now it comes on the scene in another guise I made the announcement with some pride at breakfast yesterday My dear I said I have been asked to deliver a lecture Whatever on asked Celia Anything I like The last person lectured on The Minor Satellites of Jupiter and the one who comes after me is doing The Architecture of the Byzantine Period so I can take something in between Like Frostbites said Celia helpfully But I don t quite understand Where is it and why The Blanktown Literary and Philosophical Society ask me to lecture to them at Blanktown The man who was coming is ill But why you particularly One comes down to me in the end I said modestly I expect it s because of my electric lights Do they give you any money for it They ask me to name my fee Then say a thousand pounds and lecture on the need for more electric light Fancy if I got six per cent This is a very sordid conversation I said If I agree to lecture at all it will be simply because I feel that I have a message to deliver I will now retire into the library and consider what that message is to be I placed the encyclopaedia handy and sat down at my desk I had already grasped the fact that the title of my discourse was the important thing In the list of the Society s lectures sent to me there was hardly one whose title did not impress the imagination in advance I must be equally impressive After a little thought I began to write WASPS AND THEIR YOUNG Lecture delivered before the Blanktown Literary and Philosophical Society Tuesday December eighth Ladies and Gentlemen Well said Celia drifting in how s it going I showed her how far I had got I thought you always began My Lord Mayor Ladies and Gentlemen she said Only if the Lord Mayor s there But how will you know Yes that s rather awkward I shall have to ask the Secretary beforehand I began again WASPS AND THEIR YOUNG Lecture delivered etc My Lord Mayor my Lords Ladies and Gentlemen It looked much better What about Baronets said Celia There s sure to be lots Yes this is going to be difficult I shall have to have a long talk with the Secretary How s this My Lord Mayor Lords Baronets Ladies and Gentlemen and Sundries That s got in everybody That s all right And I wanted to ask you Have you got any lantern slides They re not necessary But they re much more fun Perhaps they ll have some old ones of Vesuvius you can work in Well good bye And she drifted out I went on thinking No I said to myself I m on the wrong tack So I began again SOME YORKSHIRE POT HOLES Lecture delivered before the Blanktown Literary and Philosophical Society Tuesday December eighth My Lord Mayor my Lords I don t want to interrupt said Celia coming in suddenly but oh what s a pot hole A curious underground cavern sometimes found in the North Aren t caverns always underground But you re busy Will you be in for lunch I shall be writing my lecture all day I said busily At lunch I decided to have a little financial talk with Celia What I feel is this I said At most I can ask ten guineas for my lecture Now my expense all the way to the North with a night at an hotel will be at least five pounds Five pounds ten profit said Celia Not bad Ah but wait I have never spoken in public before In an immense hall whose acoustics Who are they Well never mind What I mean is that I shall want some elocution lessons Say five at a guinea each That still leaves five shillings If only it left that it might be worth it But there s a new white waistcoat An audience soon gets tired of a lecture and then there s nothing for the wakeful ones to concentrate on but the white waistcoat of the lecturer It must be of a virgin whiteness Say thirty five shillings So I lose thirty shillings by it Can I afford so much But you gain the acoustics and the waistcoat True Of course if you insist Oh you must said Celia So I returned to the library By tea time I had got as far as this ADVENTURES WITH A CAMERA IN SOMALILAND Lecture delivered before the Blanktown Literary and Philo And then I had an idea This time a brilliant one Celia I said at tea I have been wondering whether I ought to take advantage of your generosity What generosity In letting me deliver this lecture It isn t generosity it s swank I want to be able to tell everybody Ah but the sacrifices you are making Am I said Celia with interest Of course you are Consider I ask a fee of ten guineas They cannot possibly charge more than a shilling a head to listen to me It would be robbery So that if there is to be a profit at all as presumably they anticipate I shall have a gate of at least two hundred and fifty I should hope so Two hundred and fifty And what does that mean It means that at seven thirty o clock on the night of December the eighth two hundred and fifty residents of Blanktown will turn out the electric lights in their drawing rooms PERHAPS EVEN IN THEIR HALLS and proceed to the lecture room True the lecture room will be lit up a small compensation but not for long When the slides of Vesuvius are thrown upon the screen Celia was going pale But if it s not you she faltered it will be somebody else No if I refuse it will be too late then to get a substitute Besides they must have tried everybody else before they got down to me Celia it is noble of you to sacrifice Don t go she cried in anguish I gave a deep sigh For your sake I said I won t So that settles it If my lecture on First Principles in Homoeopathy is ever to be delivered it must be delivered elsewhere ENTER BINGO Before I introduce Bingo I must say a word for Humphrey his sparring partner Humphrey found himself on the top of my stocking last December put there I fancy by Celia though she says it was Father Christmas He is a small yellow dog with glass optics and the label round his neck said His eyes move When I had finished the oranges and sweets and nuts when Celia and I had pulled the crackers Humphrey remained over to sit on the music stool with the air of one playing the pianola In this position he found his uses There are times when a husband may legitimately be annoyed at these times it was pleasant to kick Humphrey off his stool on to the divan to stand on the divan and kick him on to the sofa to stand on the sofa and kick him on to the bookcase and then feeling another man to replace him on the music stool and apologize to Celia It was thus that he lost his tail Here we say good bye to Humphrey for the present Bingo claims our attention Bingo arrived as an absurd little black tub of puppiness warranted by a pedigree as long as your arm to grow into a Pekinese It was Celia s idea to call him Bingo because a ridiculous reason as a child she had had a poodle called Bingo The less said about poodles the better why rake up the past If there is the slightest chance of Bingo of this animal growing up into a poodle I said he leaves my house at once My poodle said Celia was a lovely dog Of course she was only a child then She wouldn t know The point is this I said firmly our puppy is meant for a Pekinese the pedigree says so From the look of him it will be touch and go whether he pulls it off To call him by the name of a late poodle may just be the deciding factor Now I hate poodles I hate pet dogs A Pekinese is not a pet dog he is an undersized lion Our puppy may grow into a small lion or a mastiff or anything like that but I will not have him a poodle If we call him Bingo will you promise never to mention in his presence that you once had a a you know what I mean called Bingo She promised I have forgiven her for having once loved a poodle I beg you to forget about it There is now only one Bingo and he is a Pekinese puppy However after we had decided to call him Bingo a difficulty arose Bingo s pedigree is full of names like Li Hung Chang and Sun Yat Sen had we chosen a sufficiently Chinese name for him Apart from what was due to his ancestors were we encouraging him enough to grow into a Pekinese What was there Oriental about Bingo In itself apparently little And Bingo himself must have felt this for his tail continued to be nothing but a rat s tail and his body to be nothing but a fat tub and his head to be almost the head of any little puppy in the world He felt it deeply When I ragged him about it he tried to eat my ankles I had only to go into the room in which he was and murmur Rat s tail to myself or more offensive still Chewed string for him to rush at me Where O Bingo is that delicate feather curling gracefully over the back which was the pride and glory of thy great grandfather Is the caudal affix of the rodent thy apology for it And Bingo would whimper with shame Then we began to look him up in the map I found a Chinese town called Ning po which strikes me as very much like Bing go and Celia found another one called Yung Ping which might just as well be Yung Bing the obvious name of Bingo s heir when he has one These facts being communicated to Bingo his nose immediately began to go back a little and his tub to develop something of a waist But what finally decided him was a discovery of mine made only yesterday There is a Japanese province called Bingo Japanese not Chinese it is true but at least it is Oriental In any case conceive one s pride in realizing suddenly that one has been called after a province and not after a poodle It has determined Bingo unalterably to grow up in the right way You have Bingo now definitely a Pekinese That being so I may refer to his ancestors always an object of veneration among these Easterns I speak of hats off please Ch Goodwood Lo Of course you know I didn t myself till last week that Ch stands for Champion On the male side Champion Goodwood Lo is Bingo s great great grandfather On the female side the same animal is Bingo s great grandfather One couldn t be a poodle after that A fortnight after Bingo came to us we found in a Pekinese book a photograph of Goodwood Lo How proud we all were Then we saw above it Celebrities of the Past The Late Champion Goodwood Lo was no more In one moment Bingo had lost both his great grandfather and his great great grandfather We broke it to him as gently as possible but the double shock was too much and he passed the evening in acute depression Annoyed with my tactlessness in letting him know anything about it I kicked Humphrey off his stool Humphrey I forgot to say has a squeak if kicked in the right place He squeaked Bingo at that time still uncertain of his destiny had at least the courage of the lion Just for a moment he hesitated Then with a pounce he was upon Humphrey Till then I had regarded Humphrey save for his power of rolling the eyes and his habit of taking long jumps from the music stool to the book case as rather a sedentary character But in the fight which followed he put up an amazingly good resistance At one time he was underneath Bingo the next moment he had Bingo down first one then the other seemed to gain the advantage But blood will tell Humphrey s ancestry is unknown I blush to say that it may possibly be German Bingo had Goodwood Lo to support him in two places Gradually he got the upper hand and at last taking the reluctant Humphrey by the ear he dragged him laboriously beneath the sofa He emerged alone with tail wagging and was taken on to his mistress s lap There he slept his grief forgotten So Humphrey was found a job Whenever Bingo wants exercise Humphrey plants himself in the middle of the room his eyes cast upwards in an affectation of innocence I m just sitting here says Humphrey I believe there s a fly on the ceiling It is a challenge which no great grandson of Goodwood Lo could resist With a rush Bingo is at him I ll learn you to stand in my way he splutters And the great dust up begins Brave little Bingo I don t wonder that so warlike a race as the Japanese has called a province after him A WARM HALF HOUR 
7301-92166-0000	train-other-500	Whatever the papers say it was the hottest afternoon of the year At six thirty I had just finished dressing after my third cold bath since lunch when Celia tapped on the door I want you to do something for me she said
none	none	 It s a shame to ask you on a day like this 
7301-92166-0001	train-other-500	It is rather a shame I agreed but I can always refuse Oh but you mustn t We haven t got any ice and the Thompsons are coming to dinner
none	none	 Do you think you could go and buy threepennyworth 
7301-92166-0002	train-other-500	Jane s busy and I m busy and And I m busy I said opening and shutting a drawer with great rapidity Just threepennyworth she pleaded Nice cool ice Think of sliding home on it
7301-92166-0003	train-other-500	Well of course it had to be done I took my hat and staggered out On an ordinary cool day it is about half a mile to the fishmonger to day it was about two miles and a quarter
7301-92166-0004	train-other-500	I arrived exhausted and with only just strength enough to kneel down and press my forehead against the large block of ice in the middle of the shop round which the lobsters nestled Here you mustn t do that said the fishmonger waving me away
7301-92166-0005	train-other-500	I got up slightly refreshed I want I said some and then a thought occurred to me After all did fishmongers sell ice Probably the large block in front of me was just a trade sign
7301-92166-0006	train-other-500	like the coloured bottles at the chemist s Suppose I said to a fellow of the Pharmaceutical Society I want some of that green stuff in the window he would only laugh The tactful thing to do
7301-92166-0007	train-other-500	would be to buy a pint or two of laudanum first and then having established pleasant relations
none	none	 ask him as a friend to lend me his green bottle for a bit 
7301-92166-0008	train-other-500	So I said to the fishmonger I want some some nice lobsters How many would you like One I said
none	none	 We selected a nice one between us and he wrapped a piece of Daily Mail round it 
7301-92166-0009	train-other-500	leaving only the whiskers visible and gave it to me The ice being now broken I mean the ice being now well you see what I mean I was now in a position to ask for some of his ice
7301-92166-0010	train-other-500	I wonder if you could let me have a little piece of your ice I ventured
none	none	 How much ice do you want he said promptly 
7301-92166-0011	train-other-500	Sixpennyworth I said feeling suddenly that Celia s threepennyworth sounded rather paltry
none	none	 Six of ice Bill he shouted to an inferior at the back and Bill tottered up with a block about the size of one of the lions in Trafalgar Square 
7301-92166-0012	train-other-500	He wrapped a piece of Daily News round it and gave it to me
none	none	 Is that all asked the fishmonger 
7301-92166-0013	train-other-500	That is all I said faintly and with Algernon the overwhiskered crustacean firmly clutched in the right hand and Stonehenge supported on the palm of the left hand I retired The flat seemed a very long way away
none	none	 but having bought twice as much ice as I wanted 
7301-92166-0014	train-other-500	and an entirely unnecessary lobster I was not going to waste still more money in taxis Hot though it was I would walk For some miles all went well Then the ice began to drip through the paper and in a little while
7301-92166-0015	train-other-500	the underneath part of The Daily News had disappeared altogether Tucking the lobster under my arm I turned the block over so that it rested on another part of the paper Soon that had dissolved too
none	none	 By the time I had got half way 
7301-92166-0016	train-other-500	our Radical contemporary had been entirely eaten Fortunately The Daily Mail remained But to get it I had to disentangle Algernon first
none	none	 and I had no hand available There was only one thing to do 
7301-92166-0017	train-other-500	I put the block of ice down on the pavement unwrapped the lobster put the lobster next to the ice spread its Daily Mail out
none	none	 lifted the ice on to the paper 
7301-92166-0018	train-other-500	and looked up and saw missus Thompson approaching
none	none	 She was the last person I wanted at that moment 
7301-92166-0019	train-other-500	In an hour and a half she would be dining with us Algernon would not be dining with us If Algernon and missus Thompson were to meet now
7301-92166-0020	train-other-500	would she not be expecting him to turn up at every course Think of the long drawn out disappointment for her not even lobster sauce There was no time to lose I decided to abandon the ice
7301-92166-0021	train-other-500	Leaving it on the pavement I clutched the lobster and walked hastily back the way I had come By the time I had shaken off missus Thompson I was almost at the fishmonger s That decided me I would begin all over again
7301-92166-0022	train-other-500	and would do it properly this time I want three of ice I said with an air
none	none	 Three of ice Bill 
7301-92166-0023	train-other-500	said the fishmonger and Bill gave me quite a respectable segment in The Morning Post And I want a taxi I said and I waved my lobster at one
none	none	 We drove quickly home But as we neared the flat 
7301-92166-0024	train-other-500	I suddenly became nervous about Algernon I could not take him red and undraped past the hall porter past all the other residents who might spring out at me on the stairs Accordingly I placed the block of ice on the seat
7301-92166-0025	train-other-500	took off some of its Morning Post and wrapped Algernon up decently Then I sprang out gave the man a coin and hastened into the building Bless you said Celia have you got it How sweet of you
7301-92166-0026	train-other-500	And she took my parcel from me Now we shall be able Why what s this I looked at it closely It s it s a lobster I said Didn t you say lobster
7301-92166-0027	train-other-500	I said ice Oh I said oh I didn t understand I thought you said lobster You can t put lobster in cider cup said Celia severely Of course
7301-92166-0028	train-other-500	I quite see that It was foolish of me However
none	none	 it s pleasant to think that the taxi must have been nice and cool for the next man WRONGLY ATTRIBUTED You ve heard of Willy Ferrero the Boy Conductor A musical prodigy seven years old who will order the fifth oboe out of the Albert Hall as soon as look at him Well he has a rival Willy as perhaps you know does not play any instrument himself he only conducts His rival Johnny as I think of him does not conduct as yet at least not audibly His line is the actual manipulation of the pianoforte the Paderewski touch Johnny lives in the flat below and I hear him touching On certain mornings in the week no need to specify them I enter my library and give myself up to literary composition On the same mornings little Johnny enters his music room underneath and gives himself up to musical composition Thus we are at work together The worst of literary composition is this that when you have got hold of what you feel is a really powerful idea you find suddenly that you have been forestalled by some earlier writer Sophocles or Shakespeare or George R Sims Then you have to think again This frequently happens to me upstairs and downstairs poor Johnny will find to his horror one day that his great work has already been given to the world by another a certain doctor John Bull Johnny in fact is discovering God Save the King with one finger As I dip my pen in the ink and begin to write Johnny strikes up On the first day when this happened some three months ago I rose from my chair and stood stiffly through the performance an affair of some minutes owing to a little difficulty with Send him victorious a line which always bothers Johnny However he got right through it at last after harking back no more than twice and I sat down to my work again Generally speaking God Save the King ends a show it would be disloyal to play any other tune after that Johnny quite saw this and so began to play God Save the King again I hope that His Majesty the Lord Chamberlain the late doctor Bull or whoever is most concerned will sympathize with me when I say that this time I remained seated I have my living to earn From that day Johnny has interpreted doctor John Bull s favourite composition nine times every morning As this has been going on for three months and as the line I mentioned has two special rehearsals to itself before coming out right you can easily work out how many send him victoriouses Johnny and I have collaborated in About two thousand Very well Now you ask yourself why did I not send a polite note to Johnny s father asking him to restrain his little boy from over composition begging him not to force the child s musical genius too quickly imploring him in short to lock up the piano and lose the key What kept me from this course The answer is Patriotism Those deep feelings for his country which one man will express glibly by rising nine times during the morning at the sound of the National Anthem another will direct to more solid uses It was my duty I felt not to discourage Johnny He was showing qualities which could not fail when he grew up to be of value to the nation Loyalty musical genius determination patience industry never before have these qualities been so finely united in a child of six Was I to say a single word to disturb the delicate balance of such a boy s mind At six one is extraordinarily susceptible to outside influence A word from his father to the effect that the gentleman above was getting sick of it and Johnny s whole life might be altered No I would bear it grimly And then yesterday who should write to me but Johnny s father himself This was the letter Dear Sir I do not wish to interfere unduly in the affairs of the other occupants of these flats but I feel bound to call your attention to the fact that for many weeks now there has been a flow of water from your bathroom which has penetrated through the ceiling of my bathroom particularly after you have been using the room in the mornings May I therefore beg you to be more careful in future not to splash or spill water on your floor seeing that it causes inconvenience to the tenants beneath you Yours faithfully Jno McAndrew You can understand how I felt about this For months I had been suffering Johnny in silence yet at the first little drop of water from above Johnny s father must break out into violent abuse of me A fine reward Well Johnny s future could look after itself now anyhow he was doomed with a selfish father like that Dear Sir I answered defiantly Now that we are writing to each other I wish to call your attention to the fact that for many months past there has been a constant flow of one fingered music from your little boy which penetrates through the floor of my library and makes all work impossible May I beg you therefore to see that your child is taught a new tune immediately seeing that the National Anthem has lost its first freshness for the tenants above him His reply to this came to day Dear Sir I have no child Yours faithfully Jno McAndrew I was so staggered that I could only think of one adequate retort DEAR SIR I wrote I never have a bath So that s the end of Johnny my boy prodigy for whom I have suffered so long It is not Johnny but Jno who struggles with the National Anthem He will give up music now for he knows I have the bulge on him I can flood his bathroom whenever I like Probably he will learn something quieter like painting Anyway doctor John Bull s masterpiece will rise no more through the ceiling of the flat below On referring to my encyclopedia I see that according to some authorities God Save the King is wrongly attributed to doctor Bull Well I wrongly attributed it to Johnny It is easy to make these mistakes A HANGING GARDEN IN BABYLON Are you taking me to the Flower Show this afternoon asked Celia at breakfast No I said thoughtfully no Well that s that What other breakfast conversation have I Have you been to any theatres lately Do you really want to go to the Flower Show I asked Because I don t believe I could bear it I ve saved up two shillings It isn t that not only that But there ll be thousands of people there all with gardens of their own all pointing to things and saying We ve got one of those in the east bed or Wouldn t that look nice in the south orchid house and you and I will be quite quite out of it I sighed and helped myself from the west toast rack It is very delightful to have a flat in London but there are times in the summer when I long for a garden of my own I show people round our little place and I point out hopefully the Hot Tap Doultonii in the scullery and the Dorothy Perkins doormat but it isn t the same thing as taking your guest round your garden and telling him that what you really want is rain Until I can do that the Chelsea Flower Show is no place for us Then I haven t told you the good news said Celia We are gardeners She paused a moment for effect I have ordered a window box I dropped the marmalade and jumped up eagerly But this is glorious news I haven t been so excited since I recognized a calceolaria last year and told my host it was a calceolaria just before he told me A window box What s in it Pink geraniums and and pink geraniums and er Pink geraniums I suggested Yes They re very pretty you know I know But I could have wished for something more difficult If we had something like well I don t want to seem to harp on it but say calceolarias then quite a lot of people mightn t recognize them and I should be able to tell them what they were I should be able to show them the calceolarias you can t show people the geraniums You can say What do you think of that for a geranium said Celia Anyhow she added you ve got to take me to the Flower Show now Of course I will It is not only a pleasure but a duty As gardeners we must keep up with floricultural progress Even though we start with pink geraniums now we may have er calceolarias next year Rotation of crops and what not Accordingly we made our way in the afternoon to the Show I think we re a little over dressed I said as we paid our shillings We ought to look as if we d just run up from our little window box in the country and were going back by the last train I should be in gaiters really Our little window box is not in the country objected Celia It s what you might call a pied de terre in town French joke she added kindly Much more difficult than the ordinary sort Don t forget it we can always use it again on visitors Now what shall we look at first The flowers first then the tea I had bought a catalogue and was scanning it rapidly We don t want flowers I said Our window box our garden is already full It may be that James the head boxer has overdone the pink geraniums this year but there it is We can sack him and promote Thomas but the mischief is done Luckily there are other things we want What about a dove cot I should like to see doves cooing round our geraniums Aren t dove cots very big for a window box We could get a small one for small doves Do you have to buy the doves too or do they just come I never know Or there I broke off suddenly my dear that s just the thing And I pointed with my stick We have seven clocks already said Celia But a sun dial How romantic Particularly as only two of the clocks go Celia if you d let me have a sun dial in my window box I would meet you by it alone sometimes It sounds lovely she said doubtfully You do want to make this window box a success don t you I asked as we wandered on Well then help me to buy something for it I don t suggest one of those and I pointed to a summer house or even a weather cock but we must do something now we re here For instance what about one of these patent extension ladders in case the geraniums grow very tall and you want to climb up and smell them Or would you rather have some mushroom spawn I would get up early and pick the mushrooms for breakfast What do you think I think it s too hot for anything and I must sit down Is this seat an exhibit or is it meant for sitting on It s an exhibit but we might easily want to buy one some day when our window box gets bigger Let s try it It was so hot that I think if the man in charge of the Rustic Bench Section had tried to move us on we should have bought the seat at once But nobody bothered us Indeed it was quite obvious that the news that we owned a large window box had not yet got about I shall leave you here I said after I had smoked a cigarette and dipped into the catalogue again and make my purchase It will be quite inexpensive indeed it is marked in the catalogue at one and six pence which means that they will probably offer me the nine shilling size first But I shall be firm Good bye I went and bought one and returned to her with it No not now I said as she held out her hand eagerly Wait till we get home It was cooler now and we wandered through the tents chatting patronizingly to the stall keeper whenever we came to pink geraniums At the orchids we were contemptuously sniffy Of course I said for those who like orchids and led the way back to the geraniums again It was an interesting afternoon And to our great joy the window box was in position when we got home again Now I said dramatically and I unwrapped my purchase and placed it in the middle of our new made garden Whatever A slug trap I explained proudly But how could slugs get up here asked Celia in surprise How do slugs get anywhere They climb up the walls or they come up in the lift or they get blown about by the wind I don t know They can fly up if they like but however it be when they do come I mean to be ready for them Still though our slug trap will no doubt come in usefully it is not what we really want What we gardeners really want is rain SISTERLY ASSISTANCE I was talking to a very stupid man the other day He was the stupidest man I have come across for many years It is a hard thing to say of any man but he appeared to me to be entirely lacking in intellect It was Celia who introduced me to him She had rung up her brother at the flat where he was staying and finding that he was out she gave a message for him to the porter It was simply that he was to ring her up as soon as he came in Ring up who said the porter At least I suppose he did for Celia repeated her name and mine very slowly and distinctly missus who said the porter What or I can t hear or something equally foolish Celia then repeated our name again There followed a long conversation between the two of them the audible part of it that is Celia s consisting of my name given forth in a variety of intonations in the manner of one who sings an anthem hopefully pathetically dramatically despairingly Up to this moment I had been rather attached to my name True it wants a little explaining to shopkeepers There are certain consonants in it which require to be elided or swallowed or swivelled round the glottis in order to give the name its proper due But after five or six applications the shopkeeper grasps one s meaning Well as I say I was attached to my name But after listening to Celia for five minutes I realized that there had been some horrible mistake People weren t called that Just wait a moment I said to her rather anxiously and picked up the telephone book To my great relief I found that Celia was right There was a person of that name living at my address You re quite right I said Go on I wish I had married somebody called Jones said Celia looking up at me rather reproachfully No no not Jones she added hastily down the telephone and once more she repeated the unhappy name It isn t my fault I protested You did have a choice I had none Try spelling it It spells all right Celia tried spelling it I m going to spell it she announced very distinctly down the telephone Are you ready M No M M for mother That gave me an idea Come away I said seizing the telephone leave it to me Now then I called to the porter Never mind about the name Just tell him to ring up his sister And I looked at Celia triumphantly Ask him to ring up his mother said the porter Very well sir No not the mother That was something else Forget all about that mother He s to ring up his sister sister SISTER You ll have to spell it said Celia I m going to spell it I shouted Are you ready S for for sister Now you re going to muddle him murmured Celia S for sister have you got that No sister idiot I for idiot I added quickly S for sister this is another sister of course T for two Got that No two Two anything two more sisters if you like E for E for I turned helplessly to Celia quick a word to begin with E I ve got him moving now E for quick before his tympanum runs down Er er Desperately she tried to think E for er I shouted That ll be another sister I expect Celia I believe we ought to spell it with an H Can t you think of a better word Enny said Celia having quite lost her nerve by this time E for enny I shouted Any anything Any of the sisters I ve been telling you about R for quick Celia Rose she said hastily R for Rose I shouted Rose the flower or the sister if you like There you are that s the whole word Now then I ll just spell it to you over again Celia I want another word for E That last was a bad one Edith Good I took a deep breath and began S for sister I for Isabel Isabel is the name of the sister S for another sister I ll tell you her name directly T for two sisters these two that we re talking about E for Edith that s the second sister whose name I was going to tell you R for Rose Perhaps I ought to explain Rose She was the sister whom these two sisters were sisters of Got that I turned to Celia I m going to get the sister idea into his head if I die for it Just a moment sir said the dazed voice of the porter What s the matter Didn t I make it clear about Rose She was the sister whom the Just hold the line a moment sir implored the porter Here s the gentleman himself coming in I handed the telephone to Celia Here he is I said But I was quite sorry to go for I was getting interested in those sisters Rose I think will always be my favourite Her life though short was full of incident and there were many things about her which I could have told that porter But perhaps he would not have appreciated them It is a hard thing to say of any man but he appeared to me to be entirely lacking in intellect 
7073-92170-0000	train-other-500	THE OBVIOUS Celia had been calling on a newly married friend of hers They had been schoolgirls together they had looked over the same algebra book
none	none	 or whatever it was that Celia learnt at school 
7073-92170-0001	train-other-500	I have never been quite certain they had done their calisthenics side by side they had compared picture post cards of Lewis Waller
none	none	 Ah me the fairy princes they had imagined together in those days and here am I and somewhere in the City 
7073-92170-0002	train-other-500	I believe he is a stockbroker is Ermyntrude s husband and we play our golf on Saturday afternoons and go to sleep after dinner and Well
none	none	 anyhow they were both married 
7073-92170-0003	train-other-500	and Celia had been calling on Ermyntrude I hope you did all the right things I said Asked to see the wedding ring and admired the charming little house
7073-92170-0004	train-other-500	and gave a few hints on the proper way to manage a husband Rather said Celia But it did seem funny because she used to be older than me at school Isn t she still Oh no
7073-92170-0005	train-other-500	I m ever so much older now Talking about wedding rings she went on as she twisted her own round and round she s got all sorts of things written inside hers the date and their initials and I don t know what else
7073-92170-0006	train-other-500	There can t be much else unless perhaps she has a very large finger Well I haven t got anything in mine said Celia mournfully She took off the offending ring and gave it to me
7073-92170-0007	train-other-500	On the day when I first put the ring on her finger Celia swore an oath that nothing but death extreme poverty or brigands should ever remove it I swore too Unfortunately
none	none	 it fell off in the course of the afternoon 
7073-92170-0008	train-other-500	which seemed to break the spell somehow
none	none	 So now it goes off and on just like any other ring 
7073-92170-0009	train-other-500	I took it from her and looked inside There are all sorts of things here too I said Really you don t seem to have read your wedding ring at all Or anyhow you ve been skipping
7073-92170-0010	train-other-500	There s nothing said Celia in the same mournful voice I do think you might have put something I went and sat on the arm of her chair and held the ring up You re an ungrateful wife I said
7073-92170-0011	train-other-500	after all the trouble I took Now look there and I pointed with a pencil what s the first thing you see Twenty two That s only the That was your age when you married me
7073-92170-0012	train-other-500	I had it put in at enormous expense If you had been eighteen the man said or or nine it would have come much cheaper But no I would have your exact age You were twenty two
7073-92170-0013	train-other-500	and that s what I had engraved on it Very well Now what do you see next to it A crown Yes And what does that mean In the language of er crowns it means You are my queen
7073-92170-0014	train-other-500	I insisted on a crown It would have been cheaper to have had a lion which means er lions but I was determined not to spare myself For I thought I went on pathetically I quite thought you would like a crown
none	none	 Oh I do cried Celia quickly 
7073-92170-0015	train-other-500	if it really means that She took the ring in her hands and looked at it lovingly And what s that there Sort of a man s head I gazed at her sadly You don t recognize it
7073-92170-0016	train-other-500	Has a year of marriage so greatly changed me Celia it is your Ronald I sat for that hour after hour day after day
none	none	 for your sake Celia It is not a perfect likeness 
7073-92170-0017	train-other-500	in the small space allotted to him the sculptor has hardly done me justice And there I added is his initial r Oh woman the amount of thought I spent on that ring
7073-92170-0018	train-other-500	She came a little closer and slipped the ring on my finger Spend a little more she pleaded There s plenty of room Just have something nice written in it something about you and me Like Pisgah
7073-92170-0019	train-other-500	What does that mean I don t know Perhaps it s Mizpah or Ichabod or Habakkuk I m sure there s a word you put on rings I expect they d know at the shop But I don t want what they know at shops
none	none	 It must be something quite private and special 
7073-92170-0020	train-other-500	But the shop has got to know about it when I tell them And I don t like telling strange men in shops private and special things about ourselves I love you Celia but
7073-92170-0021	train-other-500	That would be a lovely thing she said clasping her hands eagerly What I love you Celia I looked at her aghast Do you want me to order that in cold blood
7073-92170-0022	train-other-500	from the shopman He wouldn t mind Besides if he saw us together he d probably know You aren t afraid of a goldsmith are you
none	none	 I m not afraid of any goldsmith living or goldfish either if it come to that 
7073-92170-0023	train-other-500	But I should prefer to be sentimental in some other language than plain English I could order Cars sposa
none	none	 or or Spaghetti 
7073-92170-0024	train-other-500	or anything like that without a tremor But of course you shall put just whatever you like Only only let it be original Not Mizpahs Right I said
none	none	 For three days I wandered past gold and silversmiths with the ring in my pocket 
7073-92170-0025	train-other-500	and for three days Celia went about without a wedding ring and for all I know without even her marriage lines in her muff And on the fourth day I walked boldly in I want I said
7073-92170-0026	train-other-500	a wedding ring engraved and I felt in my pockets Not initials I said and I felt in some more pockets but but I tried the trousers pockets again Well look here I ll be quite frank with you
none	none	 I er want 
7073-92170-0027	train-other-500	I fumbled in my ticket pocket I want I love you on it and I went through the waistcoat pockets a third time I er love you Me said the shopman surprised
7073-92170-0028	train-other-500	I love you I repeated mechanically I love you I love you I Well look here perhaps I d better go back and get the ring On the next day I was there again but there was a different man behind the counter
7073-92170-0029	train-other-500	I want this ring engraved I said Certainly What shall we put I had felt the question coming
none	none	 I had a sort of instinct that he would ask me that But I couldn t get the words out again Well 
7073-92170-0030	train-other-500	I hesitated I er well Ladies often like the date put in When is it to be
none	none	 When is what to be 
7073-92170-0031	train-other-500	The wedding he smiled It has been I said It s all over You re too late for it I gave myself up to thought At all costs I must be original There must be something on Celia s wedding ring
none	none	 that had never been in any other s 
7073-92170-0032	train-other-500	There was only one thing I could think of The engraved ring arrived as we were at tea a few days later and I had a sudden overwhelming fear that Celia would not be pleased
7073-92170-0033	train-other-500	I saw that I must explain it to her After all there was a distinguished precedent Come into the bath room a moment I said and I led the way She followed wondering
none	none	 What is that I asked pointing to a blue thing on the floor 
7073-92170-0034	train-other-500	The bath mat she said surprised And what is written on it
none	none	 Why bath mat of course Of course I said and I handed her the wedding ring VI A FEW GUESTS BAD LORD BLIGHT A Moral Story for the Middle aged I Seated in the well appointed library of Blight Hall John Blighter Seventeenth Earl of Blight bowed his head in his hands and gave himself up to despair The day of reckoning had come Were appearances not so deceptive one would have said that Lord Blight Blight as he was known familiarly to his friends was a man to be envied In a revolving book case in the middle of the spacious library were countless treasured volumes including a complete edition of Thackeray outside in the well kept grounds of the estate was a new lawn mower a bottle of sherry freshly uncorked stood upon the sideboard in the dining room But worldly possessions are not everything An untroubled mind as Shakespeare knew even if he didn t actually say it is more to be valued than riches The seventeenth Earl of Blight s mind was not untroubled His conscience was gnawing him Some people would say no doubt that his conscience was too sensitive True there were episodes in his past life of which in later years he could not wholly approve but is not this the case with every one of us Far better as must often have occurred to Milton to strive for the future than to regret the past Ten years ago Lord Blight had been plain John Blighter with no prospects in front of him Realizing that he could expect little help from others he decided to push for himself He began by pushing three cousins over the cliffs at Scarborough thus becoming second heir to the earldom A week later he pushed an elder brother over the same cliff and was openly referred to in the Press as the next bearer of the title Barely a fortnight had elapsed before a final push diverted the last member of the family a valued uncle into the ever changing sea the venue in this case being Whitby presumably in order to avoid suspicion But all this had happened ten years ago The past is the past as Wordsworth probably said to Coleridge more than once It was time for Lord Blight to forget these incidents of his eager and impetuous youth Yet somehow he could not Within the last few days his conscience had begun to gnaw him and in his despair he told himself that at last the day of reckoning had come Poor Blight It is difficult to withhold our sympathy from him The door opened and his wife the Countess of Blight came into the library Blight she whispered My poor Blight What has happened He looked up haggardly Gertie he said for that was her name it is all over My sins have found me out Not sins she said gently Mistakes Mistakes yes you are right He stretched out a hand took a letter from the desk in front of him and gave it to her Read that With a groan he buried his head in his hands again She took it and read slowly and wonderingly these words To lawn mower as delivered Lfive seventeens sixd Lord Blight looked up with an impatient ejaculation Give it to me he said in some annoyance snatching it away from her and throwing it into the waste paper basket Here this is the one Read it read it quickly for we must decide what to do She read it with starting eyes DEAR SIR I am prepared to lend you anything from Lten to Lten thousand on your note of hand alone Should you wish D n said the seventeenth Earl of Blight Here where is the blessed thing He felt in his pockets I must have I only had it a Ah here it is Perhaps I had better read it to you this time He put on his spectacles a present from an aunt and read as follows MY LORD We regret to inform you that a claimant to the title has arisen It seems that soon after the death of his first wife the sixteenth Earl of Blight contracted a second and secret marriage to Ellen Podby by whom he had eleven sons the eldest of whom is now asserting his right to the earldom and estates Trusting to be favoured with your instructions in the matter We are my lord Yours faithfully BILLINGS BILLINGS BILLINGS Gertie Countess of Blight looked at her husband in horror Eleven she cried Eleven said the Earl gloomily Then a look of grim determination came into his eyes With the air of one who might have been quoting Keats but possibly wasn t he said firmly What man has done man can do That evening the Countess of Blight gave orders for eleven spare bedrooms to be got ready II On the morning after the arrival of the eleven Podbys as they had been taught to call themselves John seventeenth Earl of Blight spoke quite frankly to Algernon the eldest After all my dear Algernon he said we are cousins There is no need for harsh words between us All I ask is that you should forbear to make your claim until I have delivered my speech in the House of Lords on the Coast Erosion Bill upon which I feel deeply Once the Bill is through I shall be prepared to retire in your favour Meanwhile let us all enjoy together the simple pleasures of Blight Hall Algernon a fair young man with a meaningless expression replied suitably So for some days the eleven Podbys gave themselves up to pleasure Percy the youngest though hardly of an age to appreciate the mechanism of it was allowed to push the lawn mower Lancelot and Herbert who had inherited the Podby intellect were encouraged to browse around the revolving bookcase from which they frequently extracted one of the works of Thackeray replacing it again after a glance at the title page while on one notable occasion the Earl of Blight took Algernon into the dining room at about eleven point thirty one in the morning and helped him to a glass of sherry and a slice of sultana cake In this way the days passed happily and confidence between the eleven Podbys and their cousin was established It was on a fair spring morning just a week after their arrival that the Countess of Blight came into the music room where Algernon was humming a tune and said Ah Algernon my husband was looking for you I think he has some little excursion to propose What a charming day is it not You will find him in the library As Algernon entered the library Lord Blight looked up from the map he was studying and nodded I thought he said coming to the point at once that it might amuse you to drive over with me to Flamborough Head The view from the top of the cliff is considered well worth a visit I don t know if your tastes lie in that direction at all Algernon was delighted at the idea and replied that nothing would give him greater pleasure than to accompany Lord Blight Excellent Perhaps we had better take some sandwiches and make a day of it Greatly elated at the thought of a day by the sea Lord Blight went out and gave instructions to the Countess for sandwiches to be cut In two packets my love he added in case Algernon and I get separated Half an hour later they started off together in high spirits It was dark before the seventeenth Earl of Blight returned to the house and joined the others at the dinner table His face wore a slightly worried expression The fact is my dear he said in answer to a question from the Countess I am a little upset about Algernon I fear we have lost him Algernon said the Countess in surprise Yes We were standing at the top of Flamborough Head looking down into the sea when He paused and tapped his glass Sherry Jenkins he said catching the butler s eye I beg your pardon my lord When poor Algernon stumbled and Do any of you boys know if your brother can swim Everard the ninth said that Algernon had floated once in the Paddington Baths but couldn t swim Ah I was hoping But in any case coming into the water from that height Well well we must face our troubles bravely Another glass of sherry Jenkins As they passed through the hall on their way to the drawing room Lord Blight stopped a moment at the aneroid barometer and gave it an encouraging tap It looks like another fine day to morrow he said to Cuthbert the second Podby The panorama from the Scalby cliffs is unrivalled We might drive over and have a look at it III Fortunately the weather held up A week later the Podby family had been thinned down to five and the seventeenth Earl of Blight was beginning to regain his usual equanimity His health too was benefiting by the constant sea air and change for in order that no melancholy associations should cast a gloom over their little outings he took care to visit a different health resort each time feeling that no expense or trouble should be spared in a matter of this kind It was wonderful with what vigour and alertness of mind he sat down in the evenings to the preparation of his speech on the Coast Erosion Bill One night after dinner when all the Podby family Basil and Percy had retired to bed Gertie Countess of Blight came into her husband s library and twirling the revolving bookcase with restless fingers asked if she could interrupt him for a moment Yes he said looking up at her I am anxious Blight she answered Anxious about Percy So am I my love he responded gravely I fear that to morrow he consulted a leather pocket book no the day after to morrow something may happen to him I have an uneasy feeling It may be that I am superstitious Yet something tells me that in the Book of Fate the names of Percy and Bridlington he consulted his diary again yes Bridlington the names as I was saying of She interrupted him with an impatient gesture You misunderstand me she said That is not why I am anxious I am anxious because of something I have just learnt about Percy I am afraid he is going to be Troublesome suggested Lord Blight She nodded I have learnt to day she explained that he has a horror of high places You mean that on the cliffs of as it might be Bridlington some sudden unbridled terror may cause him to hurl himself You will never get him to the cliffs of Bridlington He can t even look out of a first floor window He won t walk up the gentlest slope That is why he is always playing with the lawn mower The Earl frowned and tapped on his desk with a penholder This is very grave news Gertie he said How is it that the boy comes to have this unmanly weakness It seems he has always had it He should have been taken in hand Even now perhaps it is not too late It is our duty to wean him from these womanish apprehensions Too late Unless you carried him up there in a sack No no protested the Earl vigorously My dear the seventeenth Earl of Blight carrying a sack Impossible For a little while there was silence while they brooded over the tragic news Perhaps said the Countess at last there are other ways It may be that Percy is fond of fishing Lord Blight shifted uncomfortably in his seat When he spoke it was with a curiously apologetic air I am afraid my dear he said that you will think me foolish No doubt I am You must put it down to the artistic temperament But I tell you quite candidly that it is as impossible for me to lose Percy in a boating accident as it would be for shall I say Sargent to appear as Hamlet or a violinist to wish to exhibit at the Royal Academy One has one s art one s medium of expression It is at the top of the high cliff with an open view of the sea that I express myself best Also he added with some heat I feel strongly that what was good enough for Percy s father ten brothers three half brothers not to mention his cousin should be good enough for Percy The Countess of Blight moved sadly from the room Well she said as she stopped for a moment at the door we must hope for the best Perhaps Percy will overcome this aversion in time You might talk seriously to him to morrow about it To morrow said the Earl referring once more to his diary Basil and I are visiting the romantic scarps of Filey IV On the day following the unfortunate accident at Filey the Earl and Countess of Blight reclined together upon the cliffs of Bridlington If we only had had Percy here sighed the Earl It was something to have got him as far as the beach said the Countess hopefully Perhaps in time a little higher every day The Earl sighed again The need for self expression comes strongly upon the artist at a time like this he said It is not for me to say that I have genius It is for me to say it dear said his wife Well well perhaps in my own line And at the full height of one s powers to be baulked by the morbidity for I can call it nothing else of a Percy Podby Gertie he went on dreamily I wish I could make you understand something of the fascination which an artist finds in his medium To be lying here at the top of the world with the lazy sea crawling beneath us so many feet below Look said the Countess suddenly She pointed to the beach The Earl rose stretched his head over the edge and gazed down Percy he said Yes Almost exactly beneath us If anything fell upon him from here said the Earl thoughtfully it is quite possible that Suddenly the fascination whereof he had spoken to her came irresistibly home to the Countess Yes she said as if in a trance if anything fell upon him from here and she gave her husband a thoughtful push it is quite possible that At the word that the Earl reached Percy and simultaneously the title expired Poor Blight or perhaps since the title was never really his we should say Poor Blighter It is difficult to withhold our sympathy from him HIGH JINKS AT HAPPY THOUGHT HALL An inevitable article in any decent magazine at Christmas time Read it carefully and then have an uproarious time in your own little house It was a merry party assembled at Happy Thought Hall for Christmas The Squire liked company and the friends whom he had asked down for the festive season had all stayed at Happy Thought Hall before and were therefore well acquainted with each other No wonder then that the wit flowed fast and furious and that the guests all agreed afterwards that they had never spent such a jolly Christmas and that the best of all possible hosts was Squire Tregarthen First we must introduce some of the Squire s guests to our readers The Reverend Arthur Manley a clever young clergyman with a taste for gardening was talking in one corner to Miss Phipps a pretty girl of some twenty summers Captain Bolsover a smart cavalry officer together with Professor and missus Smith Smythe from Oxford formed a small party in another corner Handsome Jack Ellison was as usual in deep conversation with the beautiful Miss Holden who it was agreed among the ladies of the party was not altogether indifferent to his fine figure and remarkable prospects There were other guests but as they chiefly played the part of audience in the events which followed their names will not be of any special interest to our readers Suffice it to say that they were all intelligent well dressed and ready for any sort of fun Now thank heaven we can begin A burst of laughter from Captain Bolsover attracted general attention and everybody turned in his direction By Jove Professor that s good he said as he slapped his knee you must tell the others that It was just a little incident that happened to me to day as I was coming down here said the Professor as he beamed round on the company I happened to be rather late for my train and as I bought my ticket I asked the clerk what time it was He replied If it takes six seconds for a clock to strike six how long will it take to strike twelve I said twelve seconds but it seems I was wrong The others all said twelve seconds too but they were all wrong Can you guess the right answer When the laughter had died down the Reverend Arthur Manley said That reminds me of an amusing experience which occurred to my housekeeper last Friday She was ordering a little fish for my lunch and the fishmonger when asked the price of herrings replied Three ha pence for one and a half to which my housekeeper said Then I will have twelve How much did she pay He smiled happily at the company One and sixpence of course said Miss Phipps No no ninepence cried the Squire with a hearty laugh Captain Bolsover made it come to Ll threes two one twod and the Professor thought fourpence But once again they were all wrong What do you make it come to It was now Captain Bolsover s turn for an amusing puzzle and the others turned eagerly towards him What was that one about a door said the Squire You were telling me when we were out shooting yesterday Bolsover Captain Bolsover looked surprised Ah no it was young Reggie Worlock said the Squire with a hearty laugh Oh do tell us Squire said everybody It was just a little riddle my dear said the Squire to Miss Phipps always a favourite of his When is a door not a door Miss Phipps said when it was a cucumber but she was wrong So were the others See if you can be more successful Yes that s very good said Captain Bolsover it reminds me of something which occurred during the Boer War Everybody listened eagerly We were just going into action and I happened to turn round to my men and say Now then boys give em beans To my amusement one of them replied smartly How many blue beans make five We were all so interested in working it out that we never got into action at all But that s easy said the Professor Five Four said Miss Phipps She would Silly kid Six said the Squire Which was right Jack Ellison had been silent during the laughter and jollity always such a feature of Happy Thought Hall at Christmas time but now he contributed an ingenious puzzle to the amusement of the company I met a man in a motor bus he said in a quiet voice who told me that he had four sons The eldest son Abraham had a dog who used to go and visit the three brothers occasionally The dog my informant told me was very unwilling to go over the same ground twice and yet being in a hurry wished to take the shortest journey possible How did he manage it For a little while the company was puzzled Then after deep thought the Professor said It depends on where they lived Yes said Ellison I forgot to say that my acquaintance drew me a map He produced a paper from his pocket Here it is The others immediately began to puzzle over the answer Miss Phipps being unusually foolish even for her It was some time before they discovered the correct route What do you think it is Well said the Squire with a hearty laugh it s time for bed One by one they filed off saying what a delightful evening they had had Jack Ellison was particularly emphatic for the beautiful Miss Holden had promised to be his wife He for one will never forget Christmas at Happy Thought Hall THE ARRIVAL OF BLACKMAN S WARBLER I am become an Authority on Birds It happened in this way The other day we heard the Cuckoo in Hampshire The next morning the papers announced that the Cuckoo had been heard in Devonshire possibly a different one but in no way superior to ours except in the matter of its Press agent Well everybody in the house said Did you hear the Cuckoo to everybody else until I began to get rather tired of it and having told everybody several times that I had heard it I tried to make the conversation more interesting So after my tenth Yes I added quite casually But I haven t heard the Tufted Pipit yet It s funny why it should be so late this year Is that the same as the Tree Pipit said my hostess who seemed to know more about birds than I had hoped Oh no I said quickly What s the difference exactly Well one is tufted I said doing my best and the other er climbs trees Oh I see And of course the eggs are more speckled I added gradually acquiring confidence I often wish I knew more about birds she said regretfully You must tell us something about them now we ve got you here And all this because of one miserable Cuckoo By all means I said wondering how long it would take to get a book about birds down from London However it was easier than I thought We had tea in the garden that afternoon and a bird of some kind struck up in the plane tree There now said my hostess what s that I listened with my head on one side The bird said it again That s the Lesser Bunting I said hopefully The Lesser Bunting said an earnest looking girl I shall always remember that I hoped she wouldn t but I could hardly say so Fortunately the bird lesser bunted again and I seized the opportunity of playing for safety Or is it the Sardinian White throat I wondered They have very much the same note during the breeding season But of course the eggs are more speckled I added casually And so on for the rest of the evening You see how easy it is However the next afternoon a more unfortunate occurrence occurred A real Bird Authority came to tea As soon as the information leaked out I sent up a hasty prayer for bird silence until we had got him safely out of the place but it was not granted Our feathered songster in the plane tree broke into his little piece There said my hostess there s that bird again She turned to me What did you say it was I hoped that the Authority would speak first and that the others would then accept my assurance that they had misunderstood me the day before but he was entangled at that moment in a watercress sandwich the loose ends of which were still waiting to be tucked away I looked anxiously at the girl who had promised to remember in case she wanted to say something but she also was silent Everybody was silent except that miserable bird Well I had to have another go at it Blackman s Warbler I said firmly Oh yes said my hostess Blackman s Warbler I shall always remember that lied the earnest looking girl The Authority who was free by this time looked at me indignantly Nonsense he said it s the Chiff chaff Everybody else looked at me reproachfully I was about to say that Blackman s Warbler was the local name for the Chiff chaff in our part of Somerset when the Authority spoke again The Chiff chaff he said to our hostess with an insufferable air of knowledge I wasn t going to stand that So I thought when I heard it first I said giving him a gentle smile It was now the Authority s turn to get the reproachful looks Are they very much alike my hostess asked me much impressed Very much Blackmail s Warbler is often mistaken for the Chiff chaff even by so called experts and I turned to the Authority and added Have another sandwich won t you particularly so of course during the breeding season It is true that the eggs are more speckled but Bless my soul said the Authority but it was easy to see that he was shaken I should think I know a Chiff chaff when I hear one Ah but do you know a Blackman s Warbler One doesn t often hear them in this country Now in Algiers The bird said Chiff chaff again with an almost indecent plainness of speech There you are I said triumphantly Listen and I held up a finger You notice the difference Obviously a Blackman s Warbler Everybody looked at the Authority He was wondering how long it would take to get a book about birds down from London and deciding that it couldn t be done that afternoon Meanwhile he did not dare to repudiate me For all he had caught of our mumbled introduction I might have been Blackman myself Possibly you re right he said reluctantly Another bird said Chiff chaff from another tree and I thought it wise to be generous There I said now that was a Chiff chaff The earnest looking girl remarked silly creature that it sounded just like the other one but nobody took any notice of her They were all busy admiring me Of course I mustn t meet the Authority again because you may be pretty sure that when he got back to his books he looked up Blackman s Warbler and found that there was no such animal But if you mix in the right society and only see the wrong people once it is really quite easy to be an authority on birds or I imagine on anything else THE LAST STRAW 
7338-92174-0000	train-other-500	It was one of those summer evenings with the chill on so after dinner we lit the smoking room fire and wondered what to do There were eight of us just the right number for two bridge tables or four picquet pairs
7338-92174-0001	train-other-500	or eight patience singles
none	none	 Oh no not cards said Celia quickly They re so dull 
7338-92174-0002	train-other-500	Not when you get a grand slam said our host thinking of an accident which had happened to him the night before Even then I don t suppose anybody laughed Peter and I who were partners on that occasion admitted that we hadn t laughed
7338-92174-0003	train-other-500	Well there you are said Celia triumphantly Let s play proverbs I don t think I know it said Herbert He wouldn t Oh it s quite easy First you think of a proverb Like
7338-92174-0004	train-other-500	A burnt camel spoils the moss I explained You mean A burnt child dreads the fire corrected Herbert Celia caught my eye and went on hurriedly Well then somebody goes outside
7338-92174-0005	train-other-500	and then he asks questions From outside asked missus Herbert From inside I assured her Generally from very near the fire because he has got so cold waiting in the hall Oh yes
7338-92174-0006	train-other-500	I see And then he asks questions and we each have to get one of the words of the proverb into our answer without letting him know what the proverb is It s rather fun
7338-92174-0007	train-other-500	Peter and his wife who knew the game agreed missus Herbert seemed resigned to the worst but Herbert though faint was still pursuing But doesn t he guess what the proverb is he asked
7338-92174-0008	train-other-500	Sometimes I admitted But sometimes if we are very very clever he doesn t That in fact is the game Our host got up and went to the door I think I see he said
7338-92174-0009	train-other-500	and I want my pipe anyhow So I ll go out first Now then said Celia when the door was safely closed what shall we have
7338-92174-0010	train-other-500	Of course you know this game and you know the difficulty of thinking of a proverb which has no moss or stable doors or glasshouses in it all of them words which it is impossible to include naturally in an answer to an ordinary question
7338-92174-0011	train-other-500	The proverbs which missus Herbert suggested were full of moss What about It s never too late to mend said missus Peter The only difficult word is mend
7338-92174-0012	train-other-500	We mustn t have less than seven words one for each of us Can t we get something from Solomon for a change said Peter A roaring lion is a calamity to its father but the cautious man cometh not again That sort of thing
7338-92174-0013	train-other-500	We might try it said Celia doubtfully not feeling quite sure if it were a real proverb but cometh would be difficult I don t see why said Herbert One could always work it in somehow
7338-92174-0014	train-other-500	Well of course if he asked you By what train cometh thou up in the mornings you could answer I cometh up by the ten fifteen Only you don t get that sort of question as a rule Oh I see said Herbert
7338-92174-0015	train-other-500	I didn t quite understand After all its really much more fun having camels and things said Celia It s the last straw that breaks the camel s back
7338-92174-0016	train-other-500	Who ll do camels You d better she added kindly to me Everybody but myself seemed to think that this was much more fun I ll do straw said Peter generously whereupon Celia volunteered for breaks
7338-92174-0017	train-other-500	There were seven of us for nine words We gave missus Herbert the second the fearing to trust her with anything more alarming and in order to keep it in the family we gave the other the to Herbert who was also responsible for back
7338-92174-0018	train-other-500	Our hostess had last and missus Peter had that All this being settled our host was admitted into his smoking room again You begin with me I said and I was promptly asked
7338-92174-0019	train-other-500	How many blue beans make five When I had made a suitable answer into which it s came without much difficulty our host turned to Herbert Herbert s face had already assumed a look of strained expectancy
7338-92174-0020	train-other-500	Well Herbert what do you think of Lloyd George
none	none	 Yes said Herbert Yes er yes 
7338-92174-0021	train-other-500	He wiped the perspiration from his brow He er that is to say er Lloyd George yes Is that the answer said our host rather surprised Herbert explained hastily that he hadn t really begun yet
none	none	 and with the aid of an anecdote about a cousin of his who had met Winston Churchill at Dieppe once 
7338-92174-0022	train-other-500	he managed to get the in several times before blowing his nose vigorously and announcing that he had finished I believe he s playing a different game murmured Celia to missus Peter
7338-92174-0023	train-other-500	The next three words were disposed of easily enough a lucky question to Peter about the weather giving him an opportunity to refer to his straw hat It was now Celia s turn for breaks Nervous I asked her
7338-92174-0024	train-other-500	All of a twitter she said Well Celia said our host how long are you going to stay with us Oh a long time yet said Celia confidently
7338-92174-0025	train-other-500	Till Wednesday anyhow I interrupted thinking it a good opportunity to clinch the matter We generally stay explained Celia until our host breaks it to us that he can t stick us any longer
7338-92174-0026	train-other-500	Not that that often happens I added Look here
none	none	 which of you is answering the question 
7338-92174-0027	train-other-500	I am said Celia firmly Well have you answered it yet To tell the truth I ve quite forgotten the word that Oh I remember now Yes she went on very distinctly and slowly
7338-92174-0028	train-other-500	I hope to remain under your roof
none	none	 until next Wednesday morn Whew and she fanned herself with her handkerchief 
7338-92174-0029	train-other-500	missus Herbert repeated her husband s triumph with the and then it was my turn again for these horrible camels My only hope was that our host would ask me if I had been to the Zoo lately but I didn t see why he should
7338-92174-0030	train-other-500	He didn t Would it surprise you to hear he asked that the President of Czecho Slovakia
none	none	 has a very long beard If it had only been goats I murmured to myself Aloud I said What

none	none	 It was the last straw which broke the camel s back and it was Herbert who stepped forward blithely with the last straw Our host as he admitted afterwards was still quite in the dark and with his last question he presented Herbert with an absolute gift When do you go back to Devonshire he asked We er return next month answered Herbert I should say he added hastily we go back next month My own private opinion was that the sooner he returned to Devonshire the better DISILLUSIONED The card was just an ordinary card The letter just an ordinary letter The letter simply said Dear mister Brown I m asked by missus Phipp to send you this The card said missus Philby Phipp At Home And in a corner Dancing ten p m No more except a date a hint in French That a reply would not be deemed offensive And most important missus Phipp s address Destiny as the poets have observed Or will do shortly is a mighty thing It takes us by the ear and lugs us firmly Down different paths towards one common goal Paths pre appointed not of our own choosing Or sometimes throws two travellers together Marches them side by side for half a mile Then snatches them apart and hauls them onward Thus happened it that missus Phipp and I Had never met to any great extent Had never met as far as I remembered At all And yet there must have been a time When she and I were very near together When some one told her That is mister Brown Or introduced us This is mister Brown Or asked her if she d heard of mister Brown I know not what I only know that now She stood At Home in need of mister Brown And I had pledged myself to her assistance Behold me on the night the latest word In all that separates the gentleman And waiters from the evening dress less mob And graced moreover by the latest word In waistcoats such as mark one from the waiters My shirt I must not speak about my shirt My tie I cannot dwell upon my tie Enough that all was neat harmonious And suitable to missus Philby Phipp Behold me then complete A hasty search To find the card and reassure myself That this is certainly the day It is And ten p m the hour p m not a m Not after breakfast good and then outside To jump into a cab and take the winds The cold east winds of March with beauty So Let us get on more quickly Looms ahead Tragedy Let us on and have it over I hung with men and women on the stairs And watched the tall white footman take the names And heard him shout them out and there I shaped My own name ready for him mister Brown And missus Philby Phipp hearing the name Would I imagined brighten suddenly And smile and say How are you mister Brown And in an instant I d remember her And where we met and who was mister Phipp And all the jolly time at Grindelwald If that was where it was and she and I Would talk of Art and Politics and things As we had talked these many years ago So mister Brown I murmured to the man And he the fool he took a mighty breath And shouted mister BROWNIE Brownie Yes He shouted mister BROWNIE to the roof And missus Philby Phipp hearing the name Brightened up suddenly and smiled and said How are you mister Brownie Brownie Lord And while my mouth was open to protest How do you do to some one at the back So I was passed along into the crowd As Brownie Who on earth is mister Brownie Did he I wonder he and missus Phipp Talk Art and Politics at Grindelwald Or did one simply point him out to her With That is mister Brownie Were they friends Dear friends or casual acquaintances She brightened at his name some memory Came back to her that brought a happy smile Why surely they were friends But I am Brown A stranger all unknown to missus Phipp As she to me a common interloper I see it now an uninvited guest Whose card was clearly meant for mister Brownie Soft music fell and the kaleidoscope Of lovely woman glided swayed and turned Beneath the shaded lights but mister Brownie Ne Brown not Brownie stood upon one side And brooded silently Some spoke to him Whether to Brown or Brownie mattered not He did not answer did not notice them Just stood and brooded Then went home to bed A FEW TRICKS FOR CHRISTMAS In the manner of many contemporaries Now that the festive season copyright is approaching it behoves us all to prepare ourselves in some way to contribute to the gaiety of the Christmas house party A clever conjurer is welcome anywhere and those of us whose powers of entertainment are limited to the setting of booby traps or the arranging of apple pie beds must view with envy the much greater tribute of laughter and applause which is the lot of the prestidigitator with some natural gift for legerdemain Fortunately there are a few simple conjuring tricks which are within the reach of us all With practice even the clumsiest of us can obtain sufficient dexterity in the art of illusion to puzzle the most observant of our fellow guests The few simple tricks which I am about to explain if studied diligently for a few days before Christmas will make a genuine addition to the gaiety of any gathering and the amateur prestidigitator if I may use that word again will find that he is amply repaying the hospitality of his host and hostess by his contribution to the general festivity So much by way of introduction It is a difficult style of writing to keep up particularly when the number of synonyms for conjuring is so strictly limited Let me now get to the tricks I call the first HOLDING THE LEMON For this trick you want a lemon and a pack of ordinary playing cards Cutting the lemon in two you hand half to one member of your audience and half to another asking them to hold the halves up in full view of the company Then taking the pack of cards in your own hands you offer it to a third member of the party requesting him to select a card and examine it carefully When he has done this he puts it back in the pack and you seize this opportunity to look hurriedly at the face of it discovering let us say that it is the five of spades Once more you shuffle the pack and then going through the cards one by one you will have no difficulty in locating the five of spades which you will hold up to the company with the words I think this is your card sir whereupon the audience will testify by its surprise and appreciation that you have guessed correctly It will be noticed that strictly speaking the lemon is not a necessary adjunct of this trick but the employment of it certainly adds an air of mystery to the initial stages of the illusion and this air of mystery is after all the chief stock in trade of the successful conjurer For my next trick which I call THE ILLUSORY EGG and which is most complicated you require a sponge two tablecloths a handful of nuts a rabbit five yards of coloured ribbon a top hat with a hole in it a hard boiled egg two florins and a gentleman s watch Having obtained all these things which may take some time you put the two tablecloths aside and separate the other articles into two heaps the rabbit the top hat the hard boiled egg and the handful of nuts being in one heap and the ribbon the sponge the gentleman s watch and the two florins in the other This being done you cover each heap with a tablecloth so that none of the objects beneath is in any way visible Then you invite any gentleman in the audience to think of a number Let us suppose he thinks of thirty eight In that case you ask any lady in the audience to think of an odd number and she suggests shall we say twenty nine Then asking the company to watch you carefully you you To tell the truth I have forgotten just what it is you do do but I know that it is a very good trick and never fails to create laughter and bewilderment It is distinctly an illusion worth trying and if you begin it in the manner I have described quite possibly some way of finishing it up will occur to you on the spur of the moment By multiplying the two numbers together and passing the hard boiled egg through the sponge and then taking the or is it the Anyway I m certain you have to have a piece of elastic up the sleeve and I know one of the florins has to No it s no good I can t remember it But mention of the two numbers reminds me of a trick which I haven t forgotten It is a thought reading illusion and always creates the maximum of wonderment amongst the audience It is called THE THREE QUESTIONS As before you ask a gentleman in the company to write down a number on a piece of paper and a lady to write down another number These numbers they show to the other guests You then inform the company that you will ask any one of them three questions and by the way they are answered you will guess what the product of the two numbers is For instance if the numbers were thirteen and seventeen then thirteen multiplied by seventeen is let s see thirteen sevens are thirteen sevens seven threes are twenty one seven times one is well look here let s suppose the numbers are ten and seventeen Then the product is one hundred seventy and one hundred seventy is the number you have got to guess Well the company selects a lady to answer your questions and the first thing you ask her is When was Magna Charta signed Probably she says that she doesn t know Then you say What is the capital of Persia She answers Timbuctoo or Omar Khayyam according to how well informed she is Then comes your last question What makes lightning She is practically certain to say Oh the thunder Then you tell her that the two numbers multiplied together come to one hundred seventy How is this remarkable trick performed It is quite simple The two people whom you asked to think of the numbers are confederates and you arranged with them beforehand that they should write down ten and seventeen Of course it would be a much better trick if they weren t confederates but in that case I don t quite know how you would do it I shall end up this interesting and instructive article with a rather more difficult illusion For the tricks I have already explained it was sufficient that the amateur prestidigitator I shall only say this once more should know how it was done for my last trick he will also require a certain aptitude for legerdemain in order to do it But a week s quiet practice at home will give him all the skill that is necessary THE MYSTERIOUS PUDDING is one of the oldest and most popular illusions You begin by borrowing a gold watch from one of your audience Having removed the works you wrap the empty case up in a handkerchief and hand it back to him asking him to put it in his waistcoat pocket The works you place in an ordinary pudding basin and proceed to pound up with a hammer Having reduced them to powder you cover the basin with another handkerchief which you borrow from a member of the company and announce that you are about to make a plum pudding Cutting a small hole in the top of the handkerchief you drop a lighted match through the aperture whereupon the handkerchief flares up When the flames have died down you exhibit the basin wherein to the surprise of all is to be seen an excellent Christmas pudding which you may ask your audience to sample At the same time you tell the owner of the watch that if he feels in his pockets he will find his property restored to him intact and to his amazement he discovers that the works in some mysterious way have got back into his watch and that the handkerchief in which it was wrapped up has gone Now for the explanation of this ingenious illusion The secret of it is that you have a second basin with a pudding in it concealed in the palm of your right hand At the critical moment when the handkerchief flares up you take advantage of the excitement produced to substitute the one basin for the other The watch from which you extract the works is not the borrowed one but one which you have had concealed between the third and fourth fingers of the left hand You show the empty case of this watch to the company before wrapping the watch in the handkerchief and handing it back to its owner Meanwhile with the aid of a little wax you have attached an invisible hair to the handkerchief the other end of it being fastened to the palm of your left hand With a little practice it is not difficult to withdraw the handkerchief by a series of trifling jerks from the pocket of your fellow guest to its resting place between the first and second finger of your left hand One word more I am afraid that the borrowed handkerchief to which you applied the match really did get burnt and you will probably have to offer the owner one of your own instead That is the only weak spot in one of the most baffling tricks ever practised by the amateur prestidigitator to use the word for the last time It will make a fitting climax to your evening s entertainment an entertainment which will ensure you another warm invitation next year when the festive season copyright comes upon us once again VII AND OTHERS MY FILM SCENARIO Specially written for Economic Pictures Limited whose Manager has had the good fortune to pick up for a mere song or to be more accurate for a few notes several thousand miles of discarded cinema films from a bankrupt company The films comprise the well known Baresark Basil the Pride of the Ranch two miles long The Foiler Foiled one mile three furlongs two rods poles or perches The Blood stained Vest fragment eighteen inches A Maniac s Revenge five thousand feet The Life of the Common Mosquito six legs and so forth Twenty five years before our film opens Andrew Bellingham a young man just about to enter his father s business was spending a holiday in a little fishing village in Cornwall The daughter of the sheep farmer with whom he lodged was a girl of singular beauty and Andrew s youthful blood was quickly stirred to admiration Carried away by his passion for her he MANAGER Just a reminder that mister T P O Connor has to pass this before it can be produced he married her MANAGER Oh I beg pardon and for some weeks they lived happily together One day he informed Jessie that he would have to go back to his work in London and that it might be a year or more before he could acknowledge her openly as his wife to his rich and proud parents Jessie was prostrated with grief and late that afternoon her hat and fringe net were discovered by the edge of the waters Realizing at once that she must have drowned herself in her distress Andrew took an affecting farewell of her father and the sheep and returned to London A year later he married a distant cousin and soon rose to a condition of prosperity At the time our film begins to unwind he was respected by everybody in the City a widower and the father of a beautiful girl of eighteen called Hyacinth MANAGER Now we re off What do we start with I On the sunny side of Fenchurch Street MANAGER Ah then I suppose we d better keep back the Rescue from the Alligator and the Plunge down Niagara in a Barrel Andrew Bellingham was dozing in his office Suddenly he awoke to find a strange man standing over him Who are you asked mister Bellingham What do you want My name is Jasper was the answer and I have some information to give you He bent down and hissed Your first wife is still alive Andrew started up in obvious horror My daughter he gasped my little Hyacinth She must never know Listen Your wife is in Spain MANAGER Don t waste her Make it somewhere where there are sharks AUTHOR It s all right she s dead really and she will not trouble you Give me a thousand pounds and you shall have these and he held out a packet containing the marriage certificate a photograph of Jessie s father dipping a sheep a receipted bill for a pair of white gloves size nine one two two letters signed Your own loving little Andy Pandy and a peppermint with Jess on it in pink Once these are locked up in your safe no one need ever know that you were married in Cornwall twenty five years ago Without a moment s hesitation mister Bellingham took a handful of bank notes from his pocketbook and the exchange was made At all costs he must preserve his little Hyacinth from shame Now she need never know With a forced smile he bowed Jasper out placed the packet in his safe and returned to his desk But his mysterious visitor was not done with yet As soon as the door had closed behind him Jasper re entered softly drugged Andrew hastily and took possession again of the compromising documents By the time mister Bellingham had regained his senses the thief was away A hue and cry was raised police whistles were blown and Richard Harrington mister Bellingham s private secretary was smartly arrested At the trial things looked black against Richard He was poor and he was in love with Hyacinth the chain of evidence was complete In spite of his impassioned protest from the dock in spite of Hyacinth s dramatic swoon in front of the solicitor s table the judge with great solemnity passed sentence of twenty years penal servitude A loud Hear hear from the gallery rang through the court and looking up mister Bellingham caught the sardonic eye of the mysterious Jasper II Richard had been in prison a month before the opportunity for his escape occurred For a month he had been hewing stone in Portland black despair at his heart Then like lightning he saw his chance and took it The warders were off guard for a moment Hastily lifting his pickaxe MANAGER Sorry but it s a spade in the only prison film we ve got Hastily borrowing a spade from a comrade who was digging potatoes he struck several of his gaolers down and dodging the shots of others who hurried to the scene he climbed the prison wall and dashed for freedom Reaching Weymouth at nightfall he made his way to the house which Hyacinth had taken in order to be near him and suitably disguised travelled up to London with her in the powerful motor which she had kept ready At last my love we are together he murmured as they neared Wimbledon But he had spoken a moment too soon An aeroplane swooped down upon them and Hyacinth was snatched from his arms and disappeared with her captors into the clouds III Richard s first act on arriving in London was to go to mister Bellingham s house Andrew was out but a note lying on his study carpet Meet me at the Old Windmill to night gave him a clue On receipt of this note Andrew had gone to the rendezvous and it was no surprise to him when Jasper stepped out and offered to sell him a packet containing a marriage certificate a photograph of an old gentleman dipping a sheep a peppermint lozenge with Jess on it and various other documents for a thousand pounds You villain cried Andrew even at the trial I suspected you and he rushed at him fiercely A desperate struggle ensued Breaking free for a moment from the vice like grip of the other Jasper leapt with the spring of a panther at one of the sails of the windmill as it came round and was whirled upwards with the spring of another panther Andrew leapt on to the next sail and was whirled after him At that moment the wind dropped and the combatants were suspended in mid air It was upon this terrible scene that Richard arrived Already a crowd was collecting and though at present it did not seem greatly alarmed feeling convinced that it was only assisting at another cinematograph rehearsal its suspicions might at any moment be aroused With a shout he dashed into the mill Seeing him coming Jasper dropped his revolver and slid down the sail into the window In a moment he reappeared at the door of the mill with Hyacinth under his arm Stop him cried Richard from underneath a sack of flour It was no good Jasper had leapt with his fair burden upon the back of his mustang and was gone The usual pursuit followed IV It was the gala night at the Royal Circus Ricardo Harringtoni the wonderful new acrobat of whom everybody was talking stood high above the crowd on his platform His marvellous performance on the swinging horizontal bar was about to begin Richard Harrington for it was he was troubled Since he had entered on his new profession as a disguise from the police who were still searching for him he had had a vague suspicion that the lion tamer was dogging him Who was the lion tamer Could it be Jasper At that moment the band struck up and Richard leapt lightly on to the swinging bar With a movement full of grace he let go of the bar and swung on to the opposite platform And then even as he was in mid air he realized what was happening Jasper had let the lion loose It was waiting for him With a gasping cry Ricardo Harringtoni fainted V When he recovered consciousness Richard found himself on the S S Boracic which was forging her way through the MANAGER Somewhere where there are sharks the Indian Ocean mister Bellingham was bathing his forehead with cooling drinks Forgive me my boy said mister Bellingham for the wrong I did you It was Jasper who stole the compromising documents He refuses to give them back unless I let him marry Hyacinth What can I do Where is she asked Richard Hidden away no one knows where Find her get back the documents for me and she is yours At that moment a terrible cry rang through the ship Man overboard Pushing over mister Bellingham and running on deck Richard saw that a woman and her baby were battling for life in the shark infested waters In an instant he had plunged in and rescued them As they were dragged together up the ship s side he heard her murmur Is little Jasper safe Jasper cried Richard Yes called after his daddy Where is daddy now asked Richard hoarsely In America Can t you see the likeness whispered Richard to mister Bellingham It must be The villain is married to another But now I will pursue him and get back the papers And he left the boat at the next port and boarded one for America The search through North and South America for Jasper was protracted Accompanied sometimes by a band of cowboys sometimes by a tribe of Indians Richard scoured the continent for his enemy There were hours when he would rest awhile and amuse himself by watching the antics of the common mosquito Manager Good or he would lie at full length and gaze at a bud bursting into flower Manager Excellent Then he would leap on to his steed and pursue the trail relentlessly once more One night he was dozing by his camp fire when he was awakened roughly by strong arms around his neck and Jasper s hot breath in his ear At last cried Jasper and knocking Richard heavily on the head with a boot he picked up his unconscious enemy and carried him to a tributary of the Amazon noted for its alligators Once there he tied him to a post in mid stream and rode hastily off to the nearest town where he spent the evening witnessing the first half of The Merchant of Venice Manager Splendid But in the morning a surprise awaited him As he was proceeding along the top of a lonely cliff he was confronted suddenly by the enemy whom he had thought to kill Richard he cried escaped again Now Jasper I have you With a triumphant cry they rushed at each other a terrible contest ensued and then Jasper with one blow of his palm hurled his adversary over the precipice VI How many times the two made an end of each other after this the pictures will show Sometimes Jasper sealed Richard in a barrel and pushed him over Niagara sometimes Richard tied Jasper to a stake and set light to him sometimes they would both fall out of a balloon together But the day of reckoning was at hand Manager We ve only got the Burning House and the nineteen thirteen Derby left Author Right It is the evening of the third of June A cry rends the air suddenly whistles are blowing there is a rattling of horses hoofs Fire Fire Richard who was passing Soho Square at the time heard the cry and dashed into the burning house In a room full of smoke he perceived a cowering woman Hyacinth To pick her up was the work of a moment but how shall he save her Stay The telegraph wire His training at the Royal Circus stood him in good stead Treading lightly on the swaying wire he carried Hyacinth across to the house opposite At last my love he breathed But the papers she cried You must get them or father will not let you marry me Once more he treads the rocking wire once more he re crosses with the papers on his back Then the house behind him crumbles to the ground with the wicked Jasper in its ruins Excellent said mister Bellingham at dinner that evening Not only are the papers here but a full confession by Jasper My first wife was drowned all the time he stole the documents from her father Richard my boy when the Home Secretary knows everything he will give you a free pardon And then you can marry my daughter At these words Hyacinth and Richard were locked in a close embrace On the next day they all went to the Derby together THE FATAL GIFT People say to me sometimes Oh you know Woolman don t you I acknowledge that I do and after the silence that always ensues I add If you want to say anything against him please go on You can almost hear the sigh of relief that goes up I thought he was a friend of yours they say cheerfully But of course if and then they begin I think it is time I explained my supposed friendship for Ernest Merrowby Woolman confound him The affair began in a taxicab two years ago Andrew had been dining with me that night we walked out to the cab rank together I told the driver where to go and Andrew stepped in waved good bye to me from the window and sat down suddenly upon something hard He drew it from beneath him and found it was an extremely massive and quite new silver cigar case He put it in his pocket with the intention of giving it to the driver when he got out but quite naturally forgot Next morning he found it on his dressing table So he put it in his pocket again meaning to leave it at Scotland Yard on his way to the City Next morning it was on his dressing table again This went on for some days After a week or so Andrew saw that it was hopeless to try to get a cigar case back to Scotland Yard in this casual sort of way it must be taken there deliberately by somebody who had a morning to spare and was willing to devote it to this special purpose He placed the case therefore prominently on a small table in the dining room to await the occasion calling also the attention of his family to it as an excuse for an outing when they were not otherwise engaged At times he used to say I must really take that cigar case to Scotland Yard to morrow At other times he would say Somebody must really take that cigar case to Scotland Yard to day And so the weeks rolled on It was about a year later that I first got mixed up with the thing I must have dined with the Andrews several times without noticing the cigar case but on this occasion it caught my eye as we wandered out to join the ladies and I picked it up carelessly Well not exactly carelessly it was too heavy for that Why didn t you tell me I said that you had stood for Parliament and that your supporters had consoled you with a large piece of plate Hallo they ve put the wrong initials on it How unbusiness like Oh that said Andrew Is it still there Why not It s quite a solid little table But you haven t explained why your constituents who must have seen your name on hundreds of posters thought your initials were E M W Andrew explained Then it isn t yours at all I said in amazement Of course not But my dear man this is theft Stealing by finding they call it You could get I looked at him almost with admiration you could get two years for this and I weighed the cigar case in my hand I believe you re the only one of my friends who could be certain of two years I went on musingly Let s see there s Nonsense said Andrew uneasily But still perhaps I d better take it back to Scotland Yard to morrow And tell them you ve kept it for a year They d run you in at once No what you want to do is to get rid of it without their knowledge But how that s the question You can t give it away because of the initials It s easy enough I can leave it in another cab or drop it in the river Andrew Andrew I cried you re determined to go to prison Don t you know from all the humorous articles you ve ever read that if you try to lose anything then you never can It s one of the stock remarks one makes to women in the endeavour to keep them amused No you must think of some more subtle way of disposing of it I ll pretend it s yours said Andrew more subtly and he placed it in my pocket No you don t I said But I tell you what I will do I ll take it for a week and see if I can get rid of it If I can t I shall give it you back and wash my hands of the whole business except of course for the monthly letter or whatever it is they allow you at the Scrubbs You may still count on me for that And then the extraordinary thing happened The next morning I received a letter from a stranger asking for some simple information which I could have given him on a post card And so I should have done or possibly I am afraid have forgotten to answer at all but for the way that the letter ended up Yours very truly ERNEST M WOOLMAN The magic initials It was a chance not to be missed I wrote enthusiastically back and asked him to lunch He came I gave him all the information he wanted and more Whether he was a pleasant sort of person or not I hardly noticed I was so very pleasant myself He returned my enthusiasm He asked me to dine with him the following week A little party at the Savoy his birthday you know I accepted gladly I rolled up at the party with my little present a massive silver cigar case suitably engraved So there you are He clings to me He seems to have formed the absurd idea that I am fond of him A few months after that evening at the Savoy he was married I was invited to the wedding confound him Of course I had to live up to my birthday present the least I could do was an enormous silver cigar box not engraved which bound me to him still more strongly By that time I realized that I hated him He was pushing familiar everything that I disliked All my friends wondered how I had become so intimate with him Well now they know And the original E M W if he has the sense to read this also knows If he cares to prosecute Ernest Merrowby Woolman for being in possession of stolen goods I shall be glad to give him any information Woolman is generally to be found leaving my rooms at about six point thirty in the evening and a smart detective could easily nab him as he steps out A MIDSUMMER MADNESS The girl who shared Herbert s meringue at dinner 
4697-92179-0000	train-other-500	a brittle one which exploded just as he was getting into it
none	none	 was kind and tactful It doesn t matter a 
4697-92179-0001	train-other-500	bit she said removing fragments of shell from her lap
none	none	 and to put him at his ease again went on Are you interested in little problems at all Herbert who would have been interested even in a photograph album just then 
4697-92179-0002	train-other-500	emerged from his apologies and swore that he was
none	none	 We re all worrying about one which Father saw in a paper 
4697-92179-0003	train-other-500	I do wish you could solve it for us It goes like this And she proceeded to explain it Herbert decided that the small piece of meringue still in her hair was not worth mentioning
4697-92179-0004	train-other-500	and he listened to her with interest On the next morning I happened to drop in at Herbert s office And that in short is how I was entangled in the business
4697-92179-0005	train-other-500	Look here said Herbert you used to be mathematical here s something for you Let the dead past bury its dead I implored I am now quite respectable
4697-92179-0006	train-other-500	It goes like this he said ignoring my appeal He then gave me the problem which I hand on to you A subaltern riding at the rear of a column of soldiers trotted up to the captain in front
4697-92179-0007	train-other-500	and challenged him to a game of billiards for half a crown a side the loser to pay for the table Having lost he played another hundred double or quits and then rode back the column by this time having travelled twice its own length
4697-92179-0008	train-other-500	and a distance equal to the distance it would have travelled if it had been going in the other direction What was the captain s name Perhaps I have not got it quite right for I have had an eventful week since then
4697-92179-0009	train-other-500	or perhaps Herbert didn t get it quite right or perhaps the girl with the meringue in her hair didn t get it quite right but anyhow that was the idea of it And the answer said Herbert ought to be four cows
4697-92179-0010	train-other-500	but I keep on making it eight and tuppence Just have a shot at it there s a good fellow I promised the girl you know I sat down worked it out hastily on the back of an envelope and made it a yard and a half
none	none	 No said Herbert 
4697-92179-0011	train-other-500	I know it s four cows but I can t get it Sorry I said how stupid of me I left out the table money I did it hastily again and made it three minutes twenty five seconds
4697-92179-0012	train-other-500	It is difficult isn t it said Herbert I thought as you used to be mathematical and as I d promised the girl Wait a moment I said still busy with my envelope I forgot the subaltern
4697-92179-0013	train-other-500	Ah that s right The answer is a hundred and twenty five men No that s wrong I never doubled the half crown Er oh look here Herbert I m rather busy this morning I ll send it to you
4697-92179-0014	train-other-500	Right said Herbert I know I can depend on you because you re mathematical And he opened the door for me I had meant to do a very important piece of work that day
4697-92179-0015	train-other-500	but I couldn t get my mind off Herbert s wretched problem Happening to see Carey at teatime I mentioned it to him Ah said Carey profoundly
none	none	 H m 
4697-92179-0016	train-other-500	Have you tried it with an x Of course Yes it looks as though it wants a bit of an x somewhere
none	none	 You stick to it with an x and you ought to do it 
4697-92179-0017	train-other-500	Let x be the subaltern that s the way I say I didn t know you were interested in problems Well Because I ve got rather a tricky chess problem here I can t do He produced his pocket chess board
4697-92179-0018	train-other-500	White mates in four moves I looked at it carelessly Black had only left himself with a Pawn and a King
4697-92179-0019	train-other-500	while White had a Queen and a couple of Knights about Now I know very little about chess but I do understand the theory of chess problems
4697-92179-0020	train-other-500	Have you tried letting the Queen be taken by Black s pawn then sacrificing the Knights and finally mating him with the King alone Yes said Carey Then I was baffled
4697-92179-0021	train-other-500	If one can t solve a chess problem by starting off with the most unlikely looking thing on the board one can t solve it at all However I copied down the position and said I d glance at it
4697-92179-0022	train-other-500	At eleven that night I rose from my glance decided that Herbert s problem was the more immediately pressing and took it to bed with me
4697-92179-0023	train-other-500	I was lunching with William next day and I told him about the subaltern He dashed at it lightheartedly and made the answer seventeen Seventeen what I said
4697-92179-0024	train-other-500	Well whatever we re talking about I think you ll find it s seventeen all right But look here my son here s a golf problem for you A is playing B At the fifth hole A falls off the tee into a pond
4697-92179-0025	train-other-500	I forget how it went on When I got home to dinner after a hard day with the subaltern I found a letter from Norah waiting for me I hear from mister Carey she wrote
none	none	 that you re keen on problems Here s one I have cut out of our local paper 
4697-92179-0026	train-other-500	Do have a shot at it The answer ought to be eight miles an hour Luckily however she forgot to enclose the problem For by this time what with Herbert s subaltern Carey s pawn
4697-92179-0027	train-other-500	and a cistern left me by an uncle who was dining with us that night I had more than enough to distract me And so the business has gone on
4697-92179-0028	train-other-500	The news that I am preparing a collection of interesting and tricky problems for a new Encyclopaedia has got about among my friends Everybody who writes to me tells me of a relation of his who has been shearing sheep or rowing against the stream
4697-92179-0029	train-other-500	or dealing himself four aces People who come to tea borrow a box of wooden matches and beg me to remove one match and leave a perfect square I am asked to do absurd things with pennies
4697-92179-0030	train-other-500	Meanwhile Herbert has forgotten both the problem and the girl Three evenings later he shared his Hollandaise sauce with somebody in yellow as luck would have it and she changed the subject
none	none	 by wondering if he read Dickens 
4697-92179-0031	train-other-500	He is now going manfully through Bleak House a chapter a night
none	none	 and when he came to visit me to day he asked me if I had ever heard of the man 
4697-92179-0032	train-other-500	However I was not angry with him for I had just made it come to three cows It is a cow short but it is nearer than I have ever been before
4697-92179-0033	train-other-500	and I think I shall leave it at that Indeed
none	none	 both the doctor and the nurse say that I had better leave it at that TO THE DEATH In the Twentieth Century manner Cauliflower shrieked Gaspard Volauvent across the little table in the estaminet His face bristled with rage Serpent replied Jacques Rissole bristling with equal dexterity The two stout little men glared ferociously at each other Then Jacques picked up his glass and poured the wine of the country over his friend s head Drown serpent he said magnificently He beckoned to the waiter Another bottle he said My friend has drunk all this Gaspard removed the wine from his whiskers with the local paper and leant over the table towards Jacques This must be wiped out in blood he said slowly You understand Perfectly replied the other The only question is whose Name your weapons said Gaspard Volauvent grandly Aeroplanes replied Jacques Rissole after a moment s thought Bah I cannot fly Then I win said Jacques simply The other looked at him in astonishment What You fly No but I can learn Then I will learn too said Gaspard with dignity We meet in six months Good Jacques pointed to the ceiling Say three thousand feet up Three thousand four hundred said Gaspard for the sake of disagreeing After all that is for our seconds to arrange My friend Epinard of the Roullens Aerodrome will act for me He will also instruct me how to bring serpents to the ground With the idea of cleansing the sky of cauliflowers said Gaspard I shall proceed to the flying ground at Dormancourt Blanchaille the instructor there will receive your friend He bowed and walked out Details were soon settled On a date six months ahead the two combatants would meet three thousand two hundred feet above the little town in which they lived and fight to the death In the event of both crashing the one who crashed last would be deemed the victor It was Gaspard s second who insisted on this clause Gaspard himself felt that it did not matter greatly The first month of instruction went by At the end of it Jacques Rissole had only one hope It was that when he crashed he should crash on some of Gaspard s family Gaspard had no hope but one consolation It was that no crash could involve his stomach which he invariably left behind him as soon as the aeroplane rose At the end of the second month Gaspard wrote to Jacques My friend he wrote the hatred of you which I nurse in my bosom and which fills me with the desire to purge you from the sky is in danger of being transferred to my instructor Let us therefore meet and renew our enmity Jacques Rissole wrote back to Gaspard My enemy he wrote there is nobody in the whole of the Roullens Aerodrome whom I do not detest with a detestation beside which my hatred for you seems as maudlin adoration This is notwithstanding the fact that I make the most marvellous progress in the art of flying It is merely something in their faces which annoys me Let me therefore see yours again in the hope that it will make me think more kindly of theirs They met poured wine over each other and parted After another month the need of a further stimulant was felt They met again and agreed to insult each other weekly On the last day of his training Gaspard spoke seriously to his instructor You see that I make nothing of it he said My thoughts are ever with the stomach that I leave behind Not once have I been in a position to take control How then can I fight My friend I arrange it all You shall take my place Is that quite fair to Rissole asked Blanchaille doubtfully Do not think that I want you to hurt him That is not necessary He will hurt himself Keep out of his way until he has finished with himself and then fly back here It is easy It seemed the best way indeed the only way Gaspard Volauvent could never get to the rendezvous alone and it would be fatal to his honour if Jacques arrived there and found nobody to meet him Reluctantly Blanchaille agreed At the appointed hour Gaspard put his head cautiously out of his bedroom window and gazed up into the heavens He saw two aeroplanes straight above him At the thought that he might have been in one of them he shuddered violently Indeed he felt so unwell that the need for some slight restorative became pressing He tripped off to the estaminet It was empty save for one table Gaspard walked towards it hoping for a little conversation The occupant lowered the newspaper from in front of his face and looked up It was too much for Gaspard Coward he shrieked Jacques who had been going to say the same thing hastily substituted Serpent I know you cried Gaspard You send your instructor up in your place Poltroon Jacques picked up his glass and poured the wine of the country over his friend s head Drown serpent he said magnificently He beckoned to the waiter Another bottle he said My friend has drunk all this Gaspard removed the wine from his whiskers with Jacques paper and leant over him This must be wiped out in blood he said slowly Name your weapons Submarines said Jacques after a moment s thought THE HANDICAP OF SEX I found myself in the same drawing room with Anne the other day so I offered her one of my favourite sandwiches I hadn t seen her for some time and there were plenty in the plate If you are coming to talk to me she said I think I had better warn you that I am a Bolshevist Then you won t want a sandwich I said gladly and I withdrew the plate I suppose said Anne that what I really want is a vote Haven t you got one Sorry I mean of course you haven t got one But it isn t only that I want to see the whole position of women altered I want to see I looked round for her mother Tell me I said gently when did this come over you In the last few weeks said Anne And I don t wonder I settled down with the sandwiches to listen Anne first noted symptoms of it at a luncheon party at the beginning of the month She had asked the young man on her right if she could have some of his salt and as he passed it to her he covered up any embarrassment she might be feeling by saying genially Well and how long is this coal strike going to last I don t know said Anne truthfully I suppose you re ready for the Revolution The billiard room and all the spare bedrooms well stocked Anne saw that this was meant humorously and she laughed I expect we shall be all right she said You ll have to give a coal party and invite all your friends Fire nine twelve What a lovely idea said Anne smiling from sheer habit Mind you come She got her face straight again with a jerk and turned to the solemn old gentleman on her other side He was ready for her This is a terrible disaster for the country this coal strike he said Isn t it said Anne and feeling that that was inadequate added Terrible I don t know what s happening to the country Anne crumbled her bread and having reviewed a succession of possible replies each more fatuous than the last decided to remain silent Everything will be at a standstill directly her companion went on Already trade is leaving the country America I suppose so said Anne gloomily Once stop the supplies of coal you see and you drain the life blood of the country Of course said Anne and looked very serious After lunch an extremely brisk little man took her in hand Have you been studying this coal strike question at all he began I read the papers said Anne Ah but you don t get it there They don t tell you they don t tell you Now I know a man who is actually in it and he says and he knows this for a fact that from the moment when the first man downed tools from the very moment when he downed tools Anne edged away from him nervously Her face had assumed an expression of wild interest which she was certain couldn t last much longer Now take coal at the pit s mouth he went on at the pit s mouth he shook a forefinger at her at the pit s mouth and I know this for a fact the royalties the royalties are It s awful said Anne I know She went home feeling a little disturbed There was something in her mind a dim sense of foreboding which kept casting its shadow across her pleasanter thoughts Just as you feel she said when you know you ve got to go to the dentist But they had a big dinner party that evening and Anne full of the joy of life was not going to let anything stand in the way of her enjoyment of it Her man began on the stairs Well he said what about the coal strike When are you going to start your coal parties Fire ten two They say that that s going to be the new rage He smiled reassuringly at her He was giving the impression that he could have been very very serious over this terrible business but that for her sake he was wearing the mask In the presence of women a man must make light of danger Anne understood then what was troubling her and as half way through dinner the man on her other side turned to talk to her she shot an urgent question at him At any cost she must know the worst How long will the strike last she said earnestly That s just what I was going to ask you he said I fear it may be months Anne sighed deeply I took the last sandwich and put down the plate And that said Anne was three weeks ago It has been the same ever since I asked beginning on a new plate Every day I m tired of it I shrink from every new man I meet I wait nervously for the word coal feeling that I shall scream when it comes Oh I want a vote or something I don t know what I want but I hate men Why should they think that everything they say to us is funny or clever or important Why should they talk to us as if we were children Why should they take it for granted that it s our duty to listen always I rose with dignity Dash it all who had been doing the listening for the last half hour You are run down I said What you want is a tonic Quite between ourselves though I really think But no We men must stick together THE LEGEND OF HI YOU I In the days of Good King Carraway dead now poor fellow but he had a pleasant time while he lasted there lived a certain swineherd commonly called Hi You It was the duty of Hi You to bring up one hundred and forty one pigs for his master and this he did with as much enthusiasm as the work permitted But there were times when his profession failed him In the blue days of summer Princes and Princesses Lords and Ladies Chamberlains and Enchanters would ride past him and leave him vaguely dissatisfied with his company so that he would remove the straw from his mouth and gaze after them wondering what it would be like to have as little regard for a swineherd as they But when they were out of sight he would replace the straw in his mouth and fall with great diligence to the counting of his herd and such other duties as are required of the expert pigtender assuring himself that if a man could not be lively with one hundred and forty one companions he must indeed be a poor spirited sort of fellow Now there was one little black pig for whom Hi You had a special tenderness Just so he often used to think would he have felt towards a brother if this had been granted to him It was not the colour of the little pig nor the curliness of his tail endearing though this was nor even the melting expression in his eyes which warmed the swineherd s heart but the feeling that intellectually this pig was as solitary among the hundred and forty others as Hi You himself Frederick for this was the name which he had given to it shared their food their sleeping apartments much indeed as did Hi You but he lived or so it seemed to the other an inner life of his own In short Frederick was a soulful pig There could be only one reason for this Frederick was a Prince in disguise Some enchanter it was a common enough happening in those days annoyed by Frederick s father or his uncle or even by Frederick himself had turned him into a small black pig until such time as the feeling between them had passed away There was a Prince Frederick of Milvania who had disappeared suddenly probably this was he His complexion was darker now his tail more curly but the royal bearing was unmistakable It was natural then that having little in common with his other hundred and forty charges Hi You should find himself drawn into ever closer companionship with Frederick They would talk together in the intervals of acorn hunting Frederick s share of the conversation limited to Humphs unintelligible at first but as the days went on seeming more and more charged with an inner meaning to Hi You until at last he could interpret every variation of grunt with which his small black friend responded And indeed it was a pretty sight to see them sitting together on the top of a hill the world at their feet discussing at one time the political situation of Milvania at another the latest ballad of the countryside or even in their more hopeful moments planning what they should do when Frederick at last was restored to public life II Now it chanced that one morning when Frederick and Hi You were arguing together in a friendly manner over the new uniforms of the Town Guard to the colours of which Frederick took exception King Carraway himself passed that way and being in a good humour stood for a moment listening to them Well well he said at last well well well In great surprise Hi You looked up and then seeing that it was the King jumped to his feet and bowed several times Pardon Your Majesty he stammered I did not see Your Majesty I was I was talking To a pig laughed the King To His Royal Highness Prince Frederick of Milvania said Hi You proudly I beg your pardon said the King could I trouble you to say that again His Royal Highness Prince Frederick of Milvania Yes that was what it sounded like last time Frederick murmured Hi You in his friend s ear this is His Majesty King Carraway He lets me call him Frederick he added to the King You don t mean to tell me said His Majesty pointing to the pig that this is Prince Frederick It is indeed Sire Such distressing incidents must often have occurred within Your Majesty s recollection They have yes Dear me dear me Humph remarked Frederick feeling it was time he said something His Royal Highness says that he is very proud to meet so distinguished a monarch as Your Majesty Did he say that asked the King surprised Undoubtedly Your Majesty Very good of him I m sure Humph said Frederick again He adds explained Hi You that Your Majesty s great valour is only excelled by the distinction of Your Majesty s appearance Dear me said the King I thought he was merely repeating himself It seems to me very clever of you to understand so exactly what he is saying Humph said Frederick feeling that it was about acorn time again His Royal Highness is kind enough to say that we are very old friends Yes of course that must make a difference One soon picks it up no doubt But we must not be inhospitable to so distinguished a visitor Certainly he must stay with us at the Palace And you had better come along too my man for it may well be that without your aid some of His Royal Highness s conversation would escape us Prince Frederick of Milvania dear me dear me This will be news for Her Royal Highness So leaving the rest of the herd to look after itself as it was quite capable of doing Frederick and Hi You went to the Palace Now Her Royal Highness Princess Amaril was of an age to be married Many Princes had sought her hand but in vain for she was as proud as she was beautiful Indeed her beauty was so great that those who looked upon it were blinded as if they had gazed upon the sun at noonday or so the Court Poet said and he would not be likely to exaggerate Wherefore Hi You was filled with a great apprehension as he walked to the Palace and Frederick to whom the matter had been explained was it may be presumed equally stirred within although outwardly impassive And as they went Hi You murmured to his companion that it was quite all right for that in any event she could not eat them the which assurance Frederick no doubt was peculiarly glad to receive Ah said the King as they were shown into the Royal Library that s right He turned to the Princess My dear prepare for a surprise Yes Father said Amaril dutifully This said His Majesty dramatically throwing out a hand is a Prince in disguise Which one Father said Amaril The small black one of course said the King crossly the other is merely his attendant Hi you what s your name The swineherd hastened to explain that His Majesty with His Majesty s unfailing memory for names had graciously mentioned it You don t say anything said the King to his daughter Princess Amaril sighed He is very handsome Father she said looking at Hi You Y yes said the King regarding Frederick who was combing himself thoughtfully behind the left ear with considerable doubt But the real beauty of Prince Frederick s character does not lie upon the surface or anyhow er not at the moment No Father sighed Amaril and she looked at Hi You again Now the swineherd who with instinctive good breeding had taken the straw from his mouth on entering the Palace was a well set up young fellow such as might please even a Princess For a little while there was silence in the Royal Library until Frederick realized that it was his turn to speak Humph said Frederick There said the King in great good humour Now my dear let me tell you what that means That means that His Royal Highness is delighted to meet so beautiful and distinguished a Princess He turned to Hi You Isn t that right my man Perfectly correct Your Majesty You see my dear said the King complacently one soon picks it up Now in a few days Humph said Frederick again What did that one mean Father asked Amaril That meant er that meant well it s a little hard to put it colloquially but roughly it means he made a gesture with his hand that we have er been having very charming weather lately He frowned vigorously at the swineherd Exactly Your Majesty said Hi You Charming weather for the time of year For the time of year of course said the King hastily One naturally assumes that Well my dear he went on to his daughter I m sure you will be glad to know that Prince Frederick has consented to stay with us for a little You will give orders that suitable apartments are to be prepared Yes Father What are suitable apartments The King pulled at his beard and regarded Frederick doubtfully Perhaps it would be better the Princess went on looking at Hi You if this gentleman Of course my dear of course Naturally His Royal Highness would wish to retain his suite Humph said Frederick meaning I imagine that things were looking up III Of all the Princes who from time to time had visited the Court none endeared himself so rapidly to the people as did Frederick of Milvania His complete lack of vanity his thoughtfulness the intense reserve which so obviously indicated a strong character his power of listening placidly to even the most tedious of local dignitaries all these were virtues of which previous royal visitors had given no sign Moreover on set occasions Prince Frederick could make a very pretty speech True this was read for him owing to a slight affection of the throat from which as the Chancellor pointed out His Royal Highness was temporarily suffering but it would be couched in the most perfect taste and seasoned at suitable functions such for instance as the opening of the first Public Baths with a pleasantly restrained humour Nor was there any doubt that the words were indeed the Prince s own as dictated to Hi You and by him put on paper for the Chancellor But Hi You himself never left the Palace My dear said the King to his daughter one day have you ever thought of marriage Often Father said Amaril I understand from the Chancellor that the people are expecting an announcement on the subject shortly We haven t got anything to announce have we It s a pity that you were so hasty with your other suitors said the King thoughtfully There is hardly a Prince left who is in any way eligible Except Prince Frederick said Amaril gently The King looked at her suspiciously and then looked away again pulling at his beard Of course went on Amaril I don t know what your loving subjects would say about it My loving subjects said the King grimly have been properly brought up They believe they have my authority for believing that they are suffering from a disability of the eyesight laid upon them by a wicked enchanter under which they see Princes as er pigs That if you remember was this fellow Hi You s suggestion And a very sensible one But do you want Frederick as a son in law Well that s the question In his present shape he is perhaps not quite not quite well how shall I put it Not quite suggested Amaril Exactly At the same time I think that there could be no harm in the announcement of a betrothal The marriage of course would not be announced until Until the enchanter had removed his spell from the eyes of the people Quite so You have no objection to that my dear I am His Majesty s subject said Amaril dutifully That s a good girl He patted the top of her head and dismissed her So the betrothal of His Royal Highness Frederick of Milvania to the Princess Amaril was announced to the great joy of the people And in the depths of the Palace Hi You the swineherd was hard at work compounding a potion which he assured the King would restore Frederick to his own princely form And sometimes the Princess Amaril would help him at his work IV A month went by and then Hi You came to the King with news He had compounded the magic potion A few drops sprinkled discriminately on Frederick would restore him to his earlier shape and the wedding could then be announced Well my man said His Majesty genially this is indeed pleasant hearing We will sprinkle Frederick to morrow Really I am very much in your debt remind me after the ceremony to speak to the Lord Treasurer about the matter Say no more begged Hi You All I ask is to be allowed to depart in peace Let me have a few hours alone with His Royal Highness in the form in which I have known him so long and then when he is himself again let me go For it is not meet that I should remain here as a perpetual reminder to His Royal Highness of what he would fain forget Well that s very handsome of you very handsome indeed I see your point Yes it is better that you should go But before you go there is just one thing The people are under the impression that er an enchanter has er well you remember what you yourself suggested I have thought of that said Hi You who seemed to have thought of everything And I venture to propose that Your Majesty should announce that a great alchemist has been compounding a potion to relieve their blindness A few drops of this will be introduced into the water of the Public Baths and all those bathing therein will be healed A striking notion said the King Indeed it was just about to occur to me I will proclaim to morrow a public holiday and give orders that it be celebrated in the baths Then in the evening when they are all clean I should say cured we will present their Prince to them So it happened even as Hi You had said and in the evening the Prince a model now of manly beauty was presented to them and they acclaimed him with cheers And all noticed how lovingly the Princess regarded him and how he smiled upon her But the King gazed upon the Prince as one fascinated Seven times he cleared his throat and seven times he failed to speak And the eighth time he said Your face is strangely familiar to me Perchance we met in Milvania said the Prince pleasantly Now the King had never been in Milvania Wherefore he still gazed at the Prince and at length he said What has happened to that Hi You fellow You will never hear of him again said the Prince pleasantly Oh said the King And after that they feasted And some say that they feasted upon roast pig but I say not And some say that Hi You had planned it all from the beginning but I say not And some say that it was the Princess Amaril who planned it from the day when first she saw Hi You and with them I agree For indeed I am very sure that when Hi You was a swineherd upon the hills he believed truly that the little black pig with the curly tail was a Prince And though events in the end were too much for him I like to think that Hi You remained loyal to his friend and that in his plush lined sty in a quiet corner of the Palace grounds Frederick passed a gentle old age cheered from time to time by the visits of Amaril s children End of the
