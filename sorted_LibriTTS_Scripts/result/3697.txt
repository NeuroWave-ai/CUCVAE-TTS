Envoi DEDICATION TO CHRISTINA G ROSSETTI Songs light as these may sound though deep and strong The heart spake through them scarce should hope to please Ears tuned to strains of loftier thoughts than throng Songs light as these Yet grace may set their sometime doubt at ease Nor need their too rash reverence fear to wrong The shrine it serves at and the hope it sees For childlike loves and laughters thence prolong Notes that bid enter fearless as the breeze Even to the shrine of holiest hearted song Songs light as these IN HARBOUR I Goodnight and goodbye to the life whose signs denote us As mourners clothed with regret for the life gone by To the waters of gloom whence winds of the dayspring float us Goodnight and goodbye A time is for mourning a season for grief to sigh But were we not fools and blind by day to devote us As thralls to the darkness unseen of the sundawn s eye We have drunken of Lethe at length we have eaten of lotus What hurts it us here that sorrows are born and die We have said to the dream that caressed and the dread that smote us Goodnight and goodbye II Outside of the port ye are moored in lying Close from the wind and at ease from the tide What sounds come swelling what notes fall dying Outside They will not cease they will not abide Voices of presage in darkness crying Pass and return and relapse aside Ye see not but hear ye not wild wings flying To the future that wakes from the past that died Is grief still sleeping is joy not sighing Outside THE WAY OF THE WIND The wind s way in the deep sky s hollow None may measure as none can say How the heart in her shows the swallow The wind s way Hope nor fear can avail to stay Waves that whiten on wrecks that wallow Times and seasons that wane and slay Life and love till the strong night swallow Thought and hope and the red last ray Swim the waters of years that follow The wind s way HAD I WIST Had I wist when life was like a warm wind playing Light and loud through sundawn and the dew s bright trust How the time should come for hearts to sigh in saying Had I wist Surely not the roses laughing as they kissed Not the lovelier laugh of seas in sunshine swaying Should have lured my soul to look thereon and list Now the wind is like a soul cast out and praying Vainly prayers that pierce not ears when hearts resist Now mine own soul sighs adrift as wind and straying Had I wist RECOLLECTIONS I Years upon years as a course of clouds that thicken Thronging the ways of the wind that shifts and veers Pass and the flames of remembered fires requicken Years upon years Surely the thought in a man s heart hopes or fears Now that forgetfulness needs must here have stricken Anguish and sweetened the sealed up springs of tears Ah but the strength of regrets that strain and sicken Yearning for love that the veil of death endears Slackens not wing for the wings of years that quicken Years upon years II Years upon years and the flame of love s high altar Trembles and sinks and the sense of listening ears Heeds not the sound that it heard of love s blithe psalter Years upon years Only the sense of a heart that hearkens hears Louder than dreams that assail and doubts that palter Sorrow that slept and that wakes ere sundawn peers Wakes that the heart may behold and yet not falter Faces of children as stars unknown of spheres Seen but of love that endures though all things alter Years upon years III Years upon years as a watch by night that passes Pass and the light of their eyes is fire that sears Slowly the hopes of the fruit that life amasses Years upon years Pale as the glimmer of stars on moorland meres Lighten the shadows reverberate from the glasses Held in their hands as they pass among their peers Lights that are shadows as ghosts on graveyard grasses Moving on paths that the moon of memory cheers Shew but as mists over cloudy mountain passes Years upon years TIME AND LIFE I Time thy name is sorrow says the stricken Heart of life laid waste with wasting flame Ere the change of things and thoughts requicken Time thy name Girt about with shadow blind and lame Ghosts of things that smite and thoughts that sicken Hunt and hound thee down to death and shame Eyes of hours whose paces halt or quicken Read in bloodred lines of loss and blame Writ where cloud and darkness round it thicken Time thy name II Nay but rest is born of me for healing So might haply time with voice represt Speak is grief the last gift of my dealing Nay but rest All the world is wearied east and west Tired with toil to watch the slow sun wheeling Twelve loud hours of life s laborious quest Eyes forspent with vigil faint and reeling Find at last my comfort and are blest Not with rapturous light of life s revealing Nay but rest A DIALOGUE I Death if thou wilt fain would I plead with thee Canst thou not spare of all our hopes have built One shelter where our spirits fain would be Death if thou wilt No dome with suns and dews impearled and gilt Imperial but some roof of wildwood tree Too mean for sceptre s heft or swordblade s hilt Some low sweet roof where love might live set free From change and fear and dreams of grief or guilt Canst thou not leave life even thus much to see Death if thou wilt II Man what art thou to speak and plead with me What knowest thou of my workings where and how What things I fashion Nay behold and see Man what art thou Thy fruits of life and blossoms of thy bough What are they but my seedlings Earth and sea Bear nought but when I breathe on it must bow Bow thou too down before me though thou be Great all the pride shall fade from off thy brow When Time and strong Oblivion ask of thee Man what art thou III Death if thou be or be not as was said Immortal if thou make us nought or we Survive thy power is made but of our dread Death if thou be Thy might is made out of our fear of thee Who fears thee not hath plucked from off thine head The crown of cloud that darkens earth and sea Earth sea and sky as rain or vapour shed Shall vanish all the shows of them shall flee Then shall we know full surely quick or dead Death if thou be PLUS ULTRA Far beyond the sunrise and the sunset rises Heaven with worlds on worlds that lighten and respond Thought can see not thence the goal of hope s surmises Far beyond Night and day have made an everlasting bond Each with each to hide in yet more deep disguises Truth till souls of men that thirst for truth despond All that man in pride of spirit slights or prizes All the dreams that make him fearful fain or fond Fade at forethought s touch of life s unknown surprises Far beyond A DEAD FRIEND I Gone O gentle heart and true Friend of hopes foregone Hopes and hopeful days with you Gone Days of old that shone Saw what none shall see anew When we gazed thereon Soul as clear as sunlit dew Why so soon pass on Forth from all we loved and knew Gone II Friend of many a season fled What may sorrow send Toward thee now from lips that said Friend Sighs and songs to blend Praise with pain uncomforted Though the praise ascend Darkness hides no dearer head Why should darkness end Day so soon O dear and dead Friend III Dear in death thou hast thy part Yet in life to cheer Hearts that held thy gentle heart Dear Time and chance may sear Hope with grief and death may part Hand from hand s clasp here Memory blind with tears that start Sees through every tear All that made thee as thou art Dear IV True and tender single souled What should memory do Weeping o er the trust we hold True Known and loved of few But of these though small their fold Loved how well were you Change that makes of new things old Leaves one old thing new Love which promised truth and told True V Kind as heaven while earth s control Still had leave to bind Thee thy heart was toward man s whole Kind Thee no shadows blind Now the change of hours that roll Leaves thy sleep behind Love that hears thy death bell toll Yet may call to mind Scarce a soul as thy sweet soul Kind VI How should life O friend forget Death whose guest art thou Faith responds to love s regret How Still for us that bow Sorrowing still though life be set Shines thy bright mild brow Yea though death and thou be met Love may find thee now Still albeit we know not yet How VII Past as music fades that shone While its life might last As a song bird s shadow flown Past Death s reverberate blast Now for music s lord has blown Whom thy love held fast Dead thy king and void his throne Yet for grief at last Love makes music of his own Past PAST DAYS I Dead and gone the days we had together Shadow stricken all the lights that shone Round them flown as flies the blown foam s feather Dead and gone Where we went we twain in time foregone Forth by land and sea and cared not whether If I go again I go alone Bound am I with time as with a tether Thee perchance death leads enfranchised on Far from deathlike life and changeful weather Dead and gone II Above the sea and sea washed town we dwelt We twain together two brief summers free From heed of hours as light as clouds that melt Above the sea Free from all heed of aught at all were we Save chance of change that clouds or sunbeams dealt And gleam of heaven to windward or to lee The Norman downs with bright grey waves for belt Were more for us than inland ways might be A clearer sense of nearer heaven was felt Above the sea III Cliffs and downs and headlands which the forward hasting Flight of dawn and eve empurples and embrowns Wings of wild sea winds and stormy seasons wasting Cliffs and downs These or ever man was were the same sky frowns Laughs and lightens as before his soul forecasting Times to be conceived such hopes as time discrowns These we loved of old but now for me the blasting Breath of death makes dull the bright small seaward towns Clothes with human change these all but everlasting Cliffs and downs AUTUMN AND WINTER I Three months bade wane and wax the wintering moon Between two dates of death while men were fain Yet of the living light that all too soon Three months bade wane Cold autumn wan with wrath of wind and rain Saw pass a soul sweet as the sovereign tune That death smote silent when he smote again First went my friend in life s mid light of noon Who loved the lord of music then the strain Whence earth was kindled like as heaven in June Three months bade wane II A herald soul before its master s flying Touched by some few moons first the darkling goal Where shades rose up to greet the shade espying A herald soul Shades of dead lords of music who control Men living by the might of men undying With strength of strains that make delight of dole The deep dense dust on death s dim threshold lying Trembled with sense of kindling sound that stole Through darkness and the night gave ear descrying A herald soul III One went before one after but so fast They seem gone hence together from the shore Whence we now gaze yet ere the mightier passed One went before One whose whole heart of love being set of yore On that high joy which music lends us cast Light round him forth of music s radiant store Then went while earth on winter glared aghast The mortal god he worshipped through the door Wherethrough so late his lover to the last One went before IV A star had set an hour before the sun Sank from the skies wherethrough his heart s pulse yet Thrills audibly but few took heed or none A star had set All heaven rings back sonorous with regret The deep dirge of the sunset how should one Soft star be missed in all the concourse met But O sweet single heart whose work is done Whose songs are silent how should I forget That ere the sunset s fiery goal was won A star had set THE DEATH OF RICHARD WAGNER I Mourning on earth as when dark hours descend Wide winged with plagues from heaven when hope and mirth Wane and no lips rebuke or reprehend Mourning on earth The soul wherein her songs of death and birth Darkness and light were wont to sound and blend Now silent leaves the whole world less in worth Winds that make moan and triumph skies that bend Thunders and sound of tides in gulf and firth Spake through his spirit of speech whose death should send Mourning on earth II The world s great heart whence all things strange and rare Take form and sound that each inseparate part May bear its burden in all tuned thoughts that share The world s great heart The fountain forces whence like steeds that start Leap forth the powers of earth and fire and air Seas that revolve and rivers that depart Spake and were turned to song yea all they were With all their works found in his mastering art Speech as of powers whose uttered word laid bare The world s great heart III From the depths of the sea from the wellsprings of earth from the wastes of the midmost night From the fountains of darkness and tempest and thunder from heights where the soul would be The spell of the mage of music evoked their sense as an unknown light From the depths of the sea As a vision of heaven from the hollows of ocean that none but a god might see Rose out of the silence of things unknown of a presence a form a might And we heard as a prophet that hears God s message against him and may not flee Eye might not endure it but ear and heart with a rapture of dark delight With a terror and wonder whose core was joy and a passion of thought set free Felt inly the rising of doom divine as a sundawn risen to sight From the depths of the sea TWO PRELUDES I LOHENGRIN Love out of the depth of things As a dewfall felt from above From the heaven whence only springs Love Love heard from the heights thereof The clouds and the watersprings Draws close as the clouds remove And the soul in it speaks and sings A swan sweet souled as a dove An echo that only rings Love II TRISTAN UND ISOLDE Fate out of the deep sea s gloom When a man s heart s pride grows great And nought seems now to foredoom Fate Fate laden with fears in wait Draws close through the clouds that loom Till the soul see all too late More dark than a dead world s tomb More high than the sheer dawn s gate More deep than the wide sea s womb Fate THE LUTE AND THE LYRE Deep desire that pierces heart and spirit to the root Finds reluctant voice in verse that yearns like soaring fire Takes exultant voice when music holds in high pursuit Deep desire Keen as burns the passion of the rose whose buds respire Strong as grows the yearning of the blossom toward the fruit Sounds the secret half unspoken ere the deep tones tire Slow subsides the rapture that possessed love s flower soft lute Slow the palpitation of the triumph of the lyre Still the soul feels burn a flame unslaked though these be mute Deep desire PLUS INTRA I Soul within sense immeasurable obscure Insepulchred and deathless through the dense Deep elements may scarce be felt as pure Soul within sense From depth and height by measurers left immense Through sound and shape and colour comes the unsure Vague utterance fitful with supreme suspense All that may pass and all that must endure Song speaks not painting shews not more intense And keen than these art wakes with music s lure Soul within sense CHANGE But now life s face beholden Seemed bright as heaven s bare brow With hope of gifts withholden But now From time s full flowering bough Each bud spake bloom to embolden Love s heart and seal his vow Joy s eyes grew deep with olden Dreams born he wist not how Thought s meanest garb was golden But now A BABY S DEATH I A little soul scarce fledged for earth Takes wing with heaven again for goal Even while we hailed as fresh from birth A little soul Our thoughts ring sad as bells that toll Not knowing beyond this blind world s girth What things are writ in heaven s full scroll Our fruitfulness is there but dearth And all things held in time s control Seem there perchance ill dreams not worth A little soul II The little feet that never trod Earth never strayed in field or street What hand leads upward back to God The little feet A rose in June s most honied heat When life makes keen the kindling sod Was not so soft and warm and sweet Their pilgrimage s period A few swift moons have seen complete Since mother s hands first clasped and shod The little feet III The little hands that never sought Earth s prizes worthless all as sands What gift has death God s servant brought The little hands We ask but love s self silent stands Love that lends eyes and wings to thought To search where death s dim heaven expands Ere this perchance though love know nought Flowers fill them grown in lovelier lands Where hands of guiding angels caught The little hands IV The little eyes that never knew Light other than of dawning skies What new life now lights up anew The little eyes Who knows but on their sleep may rise Such light as never heaven let through To lighten earth from Paradise No storm we know may change the blue Soft heaven that haply death descries No tears like these in ours bedew The little eyes V Was life so strange so sad the sky So strait the wide world s range He would not stay to wonder why Was life so strange Was earth s fair house a joyless grange Beside that house on high Whence Time that bore him failed to estrange That here at once his soul put by All gifts of time and change And left us heavier hearts to sigh Was life so strange VI Angel by name love called him seeing so fair The sweet small frame Meet to be called if ever man s child were Angel by name Rose bright and warm from heaven s own heart he came And might not bear The cloud that covers earth s wan face with shame His little light of life was all too rare And soft a flame Heaven yearned for him till angels hailed him there Angel by name VII The song that smiled upon his birthday here Weeps on the grave that holds him undefiled Whose loss makes bitterer than a soundless tear The song that smiled His name crowned once the mightiest ever styled Sovereign of arts and angel fate and fear Knew then their master and were reconciled But we saw born beneath some tenderer sphere Michael an angel and a little child Whose loss bows down to weep upon his bier The song that smiled ONE OF TWAIN I One of twain twin born with flowers that waken Now hath passed from sense of sun and rain Wind from off the flower crowned branch hath shaken One of twain One twin flower must pass and one remain One the word said soothly shall be taken And another left can death refrain Two years since was love s light song mistaken Blessing then both blossoms half in vain Night outspeeding light hath overtaken One of twain II Night and light O thou of heart unwary Love what knowest thou here at all aright Lured abused misled as men by fairy Night and light Haply where thine eyes behold but night Soft as o er her babe the smile of Mary Light breaks flowerwise into new born sight What though night of light to thee be chary What though stars of hope like flowers take flight Seest thou all things here where all see vary Night and light DEATH AND BIRTH Death and birth should dwell not near together Wealth keeps house not even for shame with dearth Fate doth ill to link in one brief tether Death and birth Harsh the yoke that binds them strange the girth Seems that girds them each with each yet whether Death be best who knows or life on earth Ill the rose red and the sable feather Blend in one crown s plume as grief with mirth Ill met still are warm and wintry weather Death and birth BIRTH AND DEATH Birth and death twin sister and twin brother Night and day on all things that draw breath Reign while time keeps friends with one another Birth and death Each brow bound with flowers diverse of wreath Heaven they hail as father earth as mother Faithful found above them and beneath Smiles may lighten tears and tears may smother Smiles for all that joy or sorrow saith Joy nor sorrow knows not from each other Birth and death BENEDICTION Blest in death and life beyond man s guessing Little children live and die possest Still of grace that keeps them past expressing Blest Each least chirp that rings from every nest Each least touch of flower soft fingers pressing Aught that yearns and trembles to be prest Each least glance gives gifts of grace redressing Grief s worst wrongs each mother s nurturing breast Feeds a flower of bliss beyond all blessing Blest ETUDE REALISTE I A Baby s feet like sea shells pink Might tempt should heaven see meet An angel s lips to kiss we think A baby s feet Like rose hued sea flowers toward the heat They stretch and spread and wink Their ten soft buds that part and meet No flower bells that expand and shrink Gleam half so heavenly sweet As shine on life s untrodden brink A baby s feet II A baby s hands like rosebuds furled Whence yet no leaf expands Ope if you touch though close upcurled A baby s hands Then fast as warriors grip their brands When battle s bolt is hurled They close clenched hard like tightening bands No rosebuds yet by dawn impearled Match even in loveliest lands The sweetest flowers in all the world A baby s hands III A baby s eyes ere speech begin Ere lips learn words or sighs Bless all things bright enough to win A baby s eyes Love while the sweet thing laughs and lies And sleep flows out and in Sees perfect in them Paradise Their glance might cast out pain and sin Their speech make dumb the wise By mute glad godhead felt within A baby s eyes BABYHOOD I A baby shines as bright If winter or if May be On eyes that keep in sight A baby Though dark the skies or grey be It fills our eyes with light If midnight or midday be Love hails it day and night The sweetest thing that may be Yet cannot praise aright A baby II All heaven in every baby born All absolute of earthly leaven Reveals itself though man may scorn All heaven Yet man might feel all sin forgiven All grief appeased all pain outworn By this one revelation given Soul now forget thy burdens borne Heart be thy joys now seven times seven Love shows in light more bright than morn All heaven III What likeness may define and stray not From truth s exactest way A baby s beauty Love can say not What likeness may The Mayflower loveliest held in May Of all that shine and stay not Laughs not in rosier disarray Sleek satin swansdown buds that play not As yet with winds that play Would fain be matched with this and may not What likeness may IV Rose round whose bed Dawn s cloudlets close Earth s brightest bred Rose No song love knows May praise the head Your curtain shows Ere sleep has fled The whole child glows One sweet live red Rose FIRST FOOTSTEPS A little way more soft and sweet Than fields aflower with May A babe s feet venturing scarce complete A little way Eyes full of dawning day Look up for mother s eyes to meet Too blithe for song to say Glad as the golden spring to greet Its first live leaflet s play Love laughing leads the little feet A little way A NINTH BIRTHDAY FEBRUARY four eighteen eighty three I Three times thrice hath winter s rough white wing Crossed and curdled wells and streams with ice Since his birth whose praises love would sing Three times thrice Earth nor sea bears flower nor pearl of price Fit to crown the forehead of my king Honey meet to please him balm nor spice Love can think of nought but love to bring Fit to serve or do him sacrifice Ere his eyes have looked upon the spring Three times thrice II Three times thrice the world has fallen on slumber Shone and waned and withered in a trice Frost has fettered Thames and Tyne and Humber Three times thrice Fogs have swoln too thick for steel to slice Cloud and mud have soiled with grime and umber Earth and heaven defaced as souls with vice Winds have risen to wreck snows fallen to cumber Ships and chariots trapped like rats or mice Since my king first smiled whose years now number Three times thrice III Three times thrice in wine of song full flowing Pledge my heart the child whose eyes suffice Once beheld to set thy joy bells going Three times thrice Not the lands of palm and date and rice Glow more bright when summer leaves them glowing Laugh more light when suns and winds entice Noon and eve and midnight and cock crowing Child whose love makes life as paradise Love should sound your praise with clarions blowing Three times thrice NOT A CHILD I Not a child I call myself a boy Says my king with accent stern yet mild Now nine years have brought him change of joy Not a child How could reason be so far beguiled Err so far from sense s safe employ Stray so wide of truth or run so wild Seeing his face bent over book or toy Child I called him smiling but he smiled Back as one too high for vain annoy Not a child II Not a child alack the year What should ail an undefiled Heart that he would fain appear Not a child Men with years and memories piled Each on other far and near Fain again would so be styled Fain would cast off hope and fear Rest forget be reconciled Why would you so fain be dear Not a child III Child or boy my darling which you will Still your praise finds heart and song employ Heart and song both yearning toward you still Child or boy All joys else might sooner pall or cloy Love than this which inly takes its fill Dear of sight of your more perfect joy Nay be aught you please let all fulfil All your pleasure be your world your toy Mild or wild we love you loud or still Child or boy TO DORA DORIAN Child of two strong nations heir Born of high souled hope that smiled Seeing for each brought forth a fair Child By thy gracious brows and wild Golden clouded heaven of hair By thine eyes elate and mild Hope would fain take heart to swear Men should yet be reconciled Seeing the sign she bids thee bear Child THE ROUNDEL A roundel is wrought as a ring or a starbright sphere With craft of delight and with cunning of sound unsought That the heart of the hearer may smile if to pleasure his ear A roundel is wrought Its jewel of music is carven of all or of aught Love laughter or mourning remembrance of rapture or fear That fancy may fashion to hang in the ear of thought As a bird s quick song runs round and the hearts in us hear Pause answer to pause and again the same strain caught So moves the device whence round as a pearl or tear A roundel is wrought AT SEA Farewell and adieu was the burden prevailing Long since in the chant of a home faring crew And the heart in us echoes with laughing or wailing Farewell and adieu Each year that we live shall we sing it anew With a water untravelled before us for sailing And a water behind us that wrecks may bestrew The stars of the past and the beacons are paling The heavens and the waters are hoarier of hue But the heart in us chants not an all unavailing Farewell and adieu WASTED LOVE What shall be done for sorrow With love whose race is run Where help is none to borrow What shall be done In vain his hands have spun The web or drawn the furrow No rest their toil hath won His task is all gone thorough And fruit thereof is none And who dare say to morrow What shall be done BEFORE SUNSET Love s twilight wanes in heaven above On earth ere twilight reigns Ere fear may feel the chill thereof Love s twilight wanes Ere yet the insatiate heart complains Too much and scarce enough The lip so late athirst refrains Soft on the neck of either dove Love s hands let slip the reins And while we look for light of love Love s twilight wanes A SINGING LESSON Far fetched and dear bought as the proverb rehearses Is good or was held so for ladies but nought In a song can be good if the turn of the verse is Far fetched and dear bought As the turn of a wave should it sound and the thought Ring smooth and as light as the spray that disperses Be the gleam of the words for the garb thereof wrought Let the soul in it shine through the sound as it pierces Men s hearts with possession of music unsought For the bounties of song are no jealous god s mercies Far fetched and dear bought FLOWER PIECES I LOVE LIES BLEEDING Love lies bleeding in the bed whereover Roses lean with smiling mouths or pleading Earth lies laughing where the sun s dart clove her Love lies bleeding Stately shine his purple plumes exceeding Pride of princes nor shall maid or lover Find on earth a fairer sign worth heeding Yet may love sore wounded scarce recover Strength and spirit again with life receding Hope and joy wind winged about him hover Love lies bleeding II LOVE IN A MIST Light love in a mist by the midsummer moon misguided Scarce seen in the twilight garden if gloom insist Seems vainly to seek for a star whose gleam has derided Light love in a mist All day in the sun when the breezes do all they list His soft blue raiment of cloudlike blossom abided Unrent and unwithered of winds and of rays that kissed Blithe hearted or sad as the cloud or the sun subsided Love smiled in the flower with a meaning whereof none wist Save two that beheld as a gleam that before them glided Light love in a mist THREE FACES I VENTIMIGLIA The sky and sea glared hard and bright and blank Down the one steep street with slow steps firm and free A tall girl paced with eyes too proud to thank The sky and sea One dead flat sapphire void of wrath or glee Through bay on bay shone blind from bank to bank The weary Mediterranean drear to see More deep more living shone her eyes that drank The breathless light and shed again on me Till pale before their splendour waned and shrank The sky and sea II GENOA Again the same strange might of eyes that saw In heaven and earth nought fairer overcame My sight with rapture of reiterate awe Again the same The self same pulse of wonder shook like flame The spirit of sense within me what strange law Had bid this be for blessing or for blame To what veiled end that fate or chance foresaw Came forth this second sister face that came Absolute perfect fair without a flaw Again the same III VENICE Out of the dark pure twilight where the stream Flows glimmering streaked by many a birdlike bark That skims the gloom whence towers and bridges gleam Out of the dark Once more a face no glance might choose but mark Shone pale and bright with eyes whose deep slow beam Made quick the twilight lifeless else and stark The same it seemed or mystery made it seem As those before beholden but saint Mark Ruled here the ways that showed it like a dream Out of the dark EROS I Eros from rest in isles far famed With rising Anthesterion rose And all Hellenic heights acclaimed Eros The sea one pearl the shore one rose All round him all the flower month flamed And lightened laughing off repose Earth s heart sublime and unashamed Knew even perchance as man s heart knows The thirst of all men s nature named Eros II Eros a fire of heart untamed A light of spirit in sense that glows Flamed heavenward still ere earth defamed Eros Nor fear nor shame durst curb or close His golden godhead marred and maimed Fast round with bonds that burnt and froze Ere evil faith struck blind and lamed Love pure as fire or flowers or snows Earth hailed as blameless and unblamed Eros III Eros with shafts by thousands aimed At laughing lovers round in rows Fades from their sight whose tongues proclaimed Eros But higher than transient shapes or shows The light of love in life inflamed Springs toward no goal that these disclose Above those heavens which passion claimed Shines veiled by change that ebbs and flows The soul in all things born or framed Eros SORROW Sorrow on wing through the world for ever Here and there for awhile would borrow Rest if rest might haply deliver Sorrow One thought lies close in her heart gnawn thorough With pain a weed in a dried up river A rust red share in an empty furrow Hearts that strain at her chain would sever The link where yesterday frets to morrow All things pass in the world but never Sorrow SLEEP Sleep when a soul that her own clouds cover Wails that sorrow should always keep Watch nor see in the gloom above her Sleep Down through darkness naked and steep Sinks and the gifts of his grace recover Soon the soul though her wound be deep God beloved of us all men s lover All most weary that smile or weep Feel thee afar or anear them hover Sleep ON AN OLD ROUNDEL TRANSLATED BY D C ROSSETTI FROM THE FRENCH OF VILLON I Death from thy rigour a voice appealed And men still hear what the sweet cry saith Crying aloud in thine ears fast sealed Death As a voice in a vision that vanisheth Through the grave s gate barred and the portal steeled The sound of the wail of it travelleth Wailing aloud from a heart unhealed It woke response of melodious breath From lips now too by thy kiss congealed Death II Ages ago from the lips of a sad glad poet Whose soul was a wild dove lost in the whirling snow The soft keen plaint of his pain took voice to show it Ages ago So clear so deep the divine drear accents flow No soul that listens may choose but thrill to know it Pierced and wrung by the passionate music s throe For us there murmurs a nearer voice below it Known once of ears that never again shall know Now mute as the mouth which felt death s wave o erflow it Ages ago A LANDSCAPE BY COURBET Low lies the mere beneath the moorside still And glad of silence down the wood sweeps clear To the utmost verge where fed with many a rill Low lies the mere The wind speaks only summer eye nor ear Sees aught at all of dark hears aught of shrill From sound or shadow felt or fancied here Strange as we praise the dead man s might and skill Strange that harsh thoughts should make such heavy cheer While clothed with peace by heaven s most gentle will Low lies the mere A FLOWER PIECE BY FANTIN Heart s ease or pansy pleasure or thought Which would the picture give us of these Surely the heart that conceived it sought Heart s ease Surely by glad and divine degrees The heart impelling the hand that wrought Wrought comfort here for a soul s disease Deep flowers with lustre and darkness fraught From glass that gleams as the chill still seas Lean and lend for a heart distraught Heart s ease A NIGHT PIECE BY MILLET Wind and sea and cloud and cloud forsaking Mirth of moonlight where the storm leaves free Heaven awhile for all the wrath of waking Wind and sea Bright with glad mad rapture fierce with glee Laughs the moon borne on past cloud s o ertaking Fast it seems as wind or sail can flee One blown sail beneath her hardly making Forth wild winged for harbourage yet to be Strives and leaps and pants beneath the breaking Wind and sea MARZO PAZZO Mad March with the wind in his wings wide spread Leaps from heaven and the deep dawn s arch Hails re risen again from the dead Mad March Soft small flames on rowan and larch Break forth as laughter on lips that said Nought till the pulse in them beat love s march But the heartbeat now in the lips rose red Speaks life to the world and the winds that parch Bring April forth as a bride to wed Mad March DEAD LOVE Dead love by treason slain lies stark White as a dead stark stricken dove None that pass by him pause to mark Dead love His heart that strained and yearned and strove As toward the sundawn strives the lark Is cold as all the old joy thereof Dead men re risen from dust may hark When rings the trumpet blown above It will not raise from out the dark Dead love DISCORD Unreconciled by life s fleet years that fled With changeful clang of pinions wide and wild Though two great spirits had lived and hence had sped Unreconciled Though time and change harsh time s imperious child That wed strange hands together might not wed High hearts by hope s misprision once beguiled Faith by the light from either s memory shed Sees radiant as their ends were undefiled One goal for each not twain among the dead Unreconciled CONCORD Reconciled by death s mild hand that giving Peace gives wisdom not more strong than mild Love beholds them each without misgiving Reconciled Each on earth alike of earth reviled Hated feared derided and forgiving Each alike had heaven at heart and smiled Both bright names clothed round with man s thanksgiving Shine twin stars above the storm drifts piled Dead and deathless whom we saw not living Reconciled MOURNING Alas my brother the cry of the mourners of old That cried on each other All crying aloud on the dead as the death note rolled Alas my brother As flashes of dawn that mists from an east wind smother With fold upon fold The past years gleam that linked us one with another Time sunders hearts as of brethren whose eyes behold No more their mother But a cry sounds yet from the shrine whose fires wax cold Alas my brother APEROTOS EROS Strong as death and cruel as the grave Clothed with cloud and tempest s blackening breath Known of death s dread self whom none outbrave Strong as death Love brow bound with anguish for a wreath Fierce with pain a tyrant hearted slave Burns above a world that groans beneath Hath not pity power on thee to save Love hath power no pity Nought he saith Answering blind he walks as wind or wave Strong as death TO CATULLUS My brother my Valerius dearest head Of all whose crowning bay leaves crown their mother Rome in the notes first heard of thine I read My brother No dust that death or time can strew may smother Love and the sense of kinship inly bred From loves and hates at one with one another To thee was Caesar s self nor dear nor dread Song and the sea were sweeter each than other How should I living fear to call thee dead My brother INSULARUM OCELLE Sark fairer than aught in the world that the lit skies cover Laughs inly behind her cliffs and the seafarers mark As a shrine where the sunlight serves though the blown clouds hover Sark We mourn for love of a song that outsang the lark That nought so lovely beholden of Sirmio s lover Made glad in Propontis the flight of his Pontic bark Here earth lies lordly triumphal as heaven is above her And splendid and strange as the sea that upbears as an ark As a sign for the rapture of storm spent eyes to discover Sark IN SARK Abreast and ahead of the sea is a crag s front cloven asunder With strong sea breach and with wasting of winds whence terror is shed As a shadow of death from the wings of the darkness on waters that thunder Abreast and ahead At its edge is a sepulchre hollowed and hewn for a lone man s bed Propped open with rock and agape on the sky and the sea thereunder But roofed and walled in well from the wrath of them slept its dead Here might not a man drink rapture of rest or delight above wonder Beholding a soul disembodied the days and the nights that fled With splendour and sound of the tempest around and above him and under Abreast and ahead
