DARWIN S Journal p five hundred three PREFACE This volume is one result of a scientific expedition to the equatorial Andes and the river Amazon The expedition was made under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution and consisted of the following gentlemen besides the writer Colonel Staunton of Ingham University Leroy N Y F S Williams esquire of Albany N Y and Messrs P V Myers and A Bushnell of Williams College We sailed from New York July one eighteen sixty seven and after crossing the Isthmus of Panama and touching at Paita Peru our general route was from Guayaquil to Quito over the Eastern Cordillera thence over the Western Cordillera and through the forest on foot to Napo down the Rio Napo by canoe to Pebas on the Maranon and thence by steamer to Para one Footnote one Another division consisting of Messrs H M Myers R H Forbes and W Gilbert of Williams College proceeded to Venezuela and after exploring the vicinity of Lake Valencia the two former traversed the Ilanos to Pao descended the Apure and ascended the Orinoco to Yavita crossed the portage of Pimichin a low level tract nine miles wide separating the waters of the Orinoco from those of the Amazon and descended the Negro to Manaos making a voyage by canoe of over two thousand miles through a little known but deeply interesting region A narrative of this expedition will soon be given to the public Nearly the entire region traversed by the expedition is strangely misrepresented by the most recent geographical works On the Andes of Ecuador we have little besides the travels of Humboldt on the Napo nothing while the Maranon is less known to North Americans than the Nile Many of the following pages first appeared in the New York Evening Post The author has also published Physical Observations on the Andes and the Amazon and Geological Notes on the Ecuadorian Andes in the American Journal of Science an article on the great earthquake of eighteen sixty eight in the Rochester Democrat and a paper On the Valley of the Amazon read before the American Association at Salem These papers have been revised and extended though the popular form has been retained It has been the effort of the writer to present a condensed but faithful picture of the physical aspect the resources and the inhabitants of this vast country which is destined to become an important field for commercial enterprise For detailed descriptions of the collections in natural history the scientific reader is referred to the various reports of the following gentlemen to whom the specimens were committed by the Smithsonian Institution Volcanic Rocks doctor T Sterry Hunt F R S Montreal Plants doctor Asa Gray Cambridge Land and Fresh water Shells M Crosse Paris and Thomas Bland esquire New York Marine Shells reverend doctor E R Beadle Philadelphia Fossil Shells W M Gabb esquire Philadelphia Hemiptera Prof P R Uhler Baltimore Orthoptera S H Scudder esquire Boston Hymenoptera and

Philadelphia Fishes doctor Theodore Gill Washington Reptiles Prof E D Cope Philadelphia Birds John Cassin esquire two Philadelphia Bats doctor H Allen Philadelphia Mammalian Fossils doctor Joseph Leidy Philadelphia Footnote two This eminent ornithologist died in the midst of his examination mister George N Lawrence of New York has identified the remainder including all the hummers Many of the type specimens are deposited in the museums of the Smithsonian Institution the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Science the Boston Society of Natural History the Peabody Academy of Science and Vassar College but the bulk of the collection was purchased by Ingham University Leroy New York The Map of Equatorial America was drawn with great care after original observations and the surveys of Humboldt and Wisse on the Andes and of Azevedo Castlenau and Bates on the Amazon three The names of Indian tribes are in small capitals Most of the illustrations are after photographs or drawings made on the ground and can be relied upon The portrait of Humboldt which is for the first time presented to the public was photographed from the original painting in the possession of Sr Aguirre Quito Unlike the usual portrait an old man in Berlin this presents him as a young man in Prussian uniform traveling on the Andes Footnote three We have retained the common orthography of this word though Amazons used by Bates is doubtless more correct as more akin to the Brazilian name Amazonas We desire to express our grateful acknowledgments to the Smithsonian Institution honorable William H Seward and honorable James A Garfield of Washington to Cyrus W Field esquire and William Pitt Palmer esquire of New York to C P Williams esquire of Albany to reverend J C Fletcher now United States Consul at Oporto to Chaplain Jones of Philadelphia to doctor William Jameson of the University of Quito to J F Reeve esquire and Captain Lee of Guayaquil to the Pacific Mail Steamship Panama Railroad and South Pacific Steam Navigation companies to the officers of the Peruvian and Brazilian steamers on the Amazon and to the eminent naturalists who have examined the results of the expedition NOTE Osculati has alone preceded us so far as we can learn in obtaining a vocabulary of Zaparo words but as his work is not to be found in this country we have not had the pleasure of making a comparison INTRODUCTION BY reverend J C FLETCHER AUTHOR OF BRAZIL AND BRAZILIANS In this day of many voyages in the Old World and the New it is refreshing to find an untrodden path Central Africa has been more fully explored than that region of Equatorial America which lies in the midst of the Western Andes and upon the slopes of these mountain monarchs which look toward the Atlantic In this century one can almost count upon his hand the travelers who have written of their journeys in this unknown region Our own Herndon and Gibbon descended the one the Peruvian and the other the Bolivian waters the affluents of the Amazon beginning their voyage where the streams were mere channels for canoes and finishing it where the great river appears a fresh water ocean mister Church the artist made the sketches for his famous Heart of the Andes where the headwaters of the Amazon are rivulets But no one whose language is the English has journeyed down and described the voyage from the plateaux of Ecuador to the Atlantic Ocean until Professor Orton and his party accomplished this feat in eighteen sixty eight Yet it was over this very route that the King of Waters as the Amazon is called by the aborigines was originally discovered The auri sacra fames which in fifteen forty one urged the adventurous Gonzalo Pizarro to hunt for the fabled city of El Dorado in the depths of the South American forests led to the descent of the great river by Orellana a knight of Truxillo The fabled women warriors were said to have been seen in this notable voyage and hence the name of the river Amazon a name which in Spanish and Portuguese is in the plural It was not until nearly one hundred years after Orellana was in his grave that a voyage of discovery ascended the river In sixteen thirty seven Pedro Teixeira started from Para with an expedition of nearly two thousand all but seventy of whom were natives and with varied experiences by water and by land the explorer in eight months reached the city of Quito where he was received with distinguished honor Two hundred years ago the result of this expedition was published The Amazon was from that time at rare intervals the highway of Spanish and Portuguese priests and friars who thus went to their distant charges among the Indians In seventeen forty five the French academician De la Condamine descended from Quito to Para and gave the most accurate idea of the great valley which we had until the first quarter of this century The narrow policy of Spain and Portugal was most unfruitful in its results to South America A jealous eye guarded that great region of which it can be so well said there are Realms unknown and blooming wilds And fruitful deserts worlds of solitude Where the sun smiles and seasons teem in vain Now the making known to the world of any portion of these fruitful deserts is performing a service for the world This Professor Orton has done His interesting and valuable volume hardly needs any introduction or commendation for its intrinsic merit will exact the approbation of every reader Scientific men and tourists who seek for new routes of travel will appreciate it at once and I trust that the time is near at hand when our mercantile men by the perusal of such a work will see how wide a field lies before them for future commercial enterprise This portion of the tropics abounds in natural resources which only need the stimulus of capital to draw them forth to the light to create among the natives a desire for articles of civilization in exchange for the crude productions of the forest and to stimulate emigration to a healthy region of perpetual summer It seems as if Providence were opening the way for a great change in the Valley of the Amazon That immense region drained by the great river is as large as all the United States east of the States of California and Oregon and the Territory of Washington and yet it has been so secluded mainly by the old monopolistic policy of Portugal that that vast space has not a population equal to the single city of Rio de Janeiro or of Brooklyn Two million five hundred thousand square miles are drained by the Amazon Three fourths of Brazil one half of Bolivia two thirds of Peru three fourths of Ecuador and a portion of Venezuela are watered by this river Riches mineral and vegetable of inexhaustible supply have been here locked up for centuries Brazil held the key but it was not until under the rule of their present constitutional monarch Don Pedro II that the Brazilians awoke to the necessity of opening this glorious region Steamers were introduced in eighteen fifty three subsidized by the government But it is to a young Brazilian statesman Sr A C Tavares Bastos that belongs the credit of having agitated in the press and in the national parliament the opening of the Amazon until public opinion thus acted upon produced the desired result On another occasion in May eighteen sixty eight I gave several indices of a more enlightened policy in Brazil and stated that the opening of the Amazon which occurred on the seventh of September eighteen sixty seven and by which the great river is free to the flags of all nations from the Atlantic to Peru and the abrogation of the monopoly of the coast trade from the Amazon to the Rio Grande do Sul whereby four thousand miles of Brazilian sea coast are open to the vessels of every country can not fail not only to develop the resources of Brazil but will prove of great benefit to the bordering Hispano American republics and to the maritime nations of the earth The opening of the Amazon is the most significant indication that the leaven of the narrow monopolistic Portuguese conservatism has at last worked out Portugal would not allow Humboldt to enter the Amazon Valley in Brazil The result of the new policy is beyond the most sanguine expectation The exports and imports for Para for October and November eighteen sixty seven were double those of eighteen sixty six This is but the beginning Soon it will be found that it is cheaper for Bolivia Peru Ecuador and New Granada east of the Andes to receive their goods from and to export their India rubber cinchona et cetera to the United States and Europe via the great water highway which discharges into the Atlantic than by the long circuitous route of Cape Horn or the trans Isthmian route of Panama CONTENTS

Colonel Staunton To face page three hundred thirty four Map of Equatorial America End THE ANDES AND THE AMAZON CHAPTER I Guayaquil First and Last Impressions Climate Commerce The Malecon Glimpse of the Andes Scenes on the Guayas Bodegas Mounted for Quito La Mona A Tropical Forest Late in the evening of the nineteenth of July eighteen sixty seven the steamer Favorita dropped anchor in front of the city of Guayaquil The first view awakened visions of Oriental splendor Before us was the Malecon stretching along the river two miles in length at once the most beautiful and the most busy street in the emporium of Ecuador In the centre rose the Government House with its quaint old tower bearing aloft the city clock On either hand were long rows of massive apparently marble three storied buildings each occupying an entire square and as elegant as they were massive Each story was blessed with a balcony the upper one hung with canvas curtains now rolled up the other protruding over the sidewalk to form a lengthened arcade like that of the Rue de Rivoli in imperial Paris In this lower story were the gay shops of Guayaquil filled with the prints and silks and fancy articles of England and France As this is the promenade street as well as the Broadway of commerce crowds of Ecuadorians who never do business in the evening leisurely paced the magnificent arcade hatless ladies sparkling with fire flies four instead of diamonds and far more brilliant than koh i noors swept the pavement with their long trains martial music floated on the gentle breeze from the barracks or some festive hall and a thousand gas lights along the levee and in the city doubling their number by reflection from the river betokened wealth and civilization Footnote four The Pyrophorus noctilucus or cucujo found also in Mexico and the West Indies It resembles our large spring beetle The light proceeds from two eye like spots on the thorax and from the segments underneath It feeds on the sugar cane On the Upper Amazon we found the P clarus P pellucens and P tuberculatus At Bahia on the opposite coast Darwin found P luminosus the most common luminous insect We landed in the morning to find our vision a dissolving view in the light of the rising sun The princely mansions turned out to be hollow squares of wood work plastered within and without and roofed with red tiles Even the squares were only distant approximations not a right angle could we find in our hotel All the edifices are built very properly in this climate to admit air instead of excluding it and the architects have wonderfully succeeded but with the air is wafted many an odor not so pleasing as the spicy breezes from Ceylon s isle The cathedral is of elegant design Its photograph is more imposing than Notre Dame and a Latin inscription tells us that it is the Gate of Heaven But a near approach reveals a shabby structure and the pewless interior is made hideous by paintings and images which certainly must be caricatures A few genuine works of art imported from Italy alone relieve the mind of the visitor Excepting a few houses on the Malecon and not excepting the cathedral the majority of the buildings have a tumble down appearance which is not altogether due to the frequent earthquakes which have troubled this city while the habitations in the outskirts are exceedingly primitive floored and walled with split cane and thatched with leaves the first story occupied by domestic animals and the second by their owners The city is quite regularly laid out the main streets running parallel to the river A few streets are rudely paved many are shockingly filthy and all of them yield grass to the delight of stray donkeys and goats A number of mule carts half a dozen carriages one omnibus and a hand car on the Malecon sum up the wheeled vehicles of Guayaquil The population is twenty two thousand the same for thirty years past Of these about twenty are from the United States and perhaps twenty five can command one hundred thousand dollars No foreigner has had reason to complain that Guayaquilians lacked the virtues of politeness and hospitality The ladies dress in excellent taste and are proverbial for their beauty Spanish Indian and Negro blood mingle in the lower classes The city supports two small papers Los Andes and La Patria but they are usually issued about ten days behind date The hourly cry of the night watchman is quite as musical as that of the muezzin in Constantinople At eleven o clock for example they sing Ave Maria purissima los once han dedo noche clara y serena Viva la Patria Illustration Cathedral of Guayaquil The full name of the city is Santiago de Guayaquil five It is so called first because the conquest of the province was finished on the twenty fifth of July the day of saint James fifteen thirty three and secondly after Guayas a feudatory cacique of Atahuallpa It was created a city by Charles V October six fifteen thirty five It has suffered much in its subsequent history by fires and earthquakes pirates and pestilence It is situated on the right bank of the River Guayas sixty miles from the ocean and but a few feet above its level Though the most western city in South America it is only two degrees west of the longitude of Washington and it is the same distance below the equator Orion sailing directly overhead and the Southern Cross taking the place of the Great Dipper The mean annual temperature according to our observations is eighty three deg There are two seasons the wet or invierno and the dry or verano The verano is called the summer although astronomically it is winter it begins in June and terminates in November six The heavy rains come on about Christmas March is the rainiest month in the year and July the coldest It is at the close of the invierno May that fevers most abound The climate of Guayaquil during the dry season is nearly perfect At daybreak there is a cool easterly breeze at sunrise a brief lull and then a gentle variable wind at three P M a southwest wind at first in gusts then in a sustained current at sunset the same softened down to a gentle breeze increasing about seven P M and dying away about three A M Notwithstanding heaps of filth and green mantled pools sufficient to start a pestilence if transported to New York the city is usually healthy due in great part no doubt to countless flocks of buzzards which greedily wait upon decay These carrion hawks enjoy the protection of law a heavy fine being imposed for wantonly killing one seven It is during the rainy season that this port earns the reputation of being one of the most pestiferous spots on the globe The air is then hot and oppressive reminding the geologist of the steaming atmosphere in the carboniferous period the surrounding plains are flooded with water and the roads even some of the streets of the city become impassable intolerable musquitoes huge cockroaches disgusting centipedes venomous scorpions and still more deadly serpents keep the human species circumspect and fevers and dysenteries do the work of death Footnote five The ancient name was Culenta Footnote six The continuity of the dry season is broken by a rainy fit commencing a few days after the autumnal equinox and called el Cordonazo de San Francisco Throughout South America observes mister Spruce the periodical alternations of dry and rainy weather are laid to the account of those saints whose days coincide nearly with the epochs of change But if the weather be rainy when it ought to be fair or if the rains of winter be heavier than ordinary the blame is invariably laid on the moon Footnote seven The turkey buzzard the John Crow of the West Indies is not a social bird though a score are often seen together each comes and goes by himself The Guayas is the largest river on the Pacific coast and Guayaquil monopolizes the commerce of Ecuador for it is the only port Esmeraldas and Peylon are not to be mentioned Through its custom house passes nearly every import and export The green banks of the Guayas covered with an exuberant growth are in strong contrast with the sterile coast of Peru and the possession of Guayaquil has been a coveted prize since the days of Pizarro Few spots between the tropics can vie with this lowland in richness and vigor of vegetation Immense quantities of cacao second only to that of Caracas are produced though but a fraction is gathered owing to the scarcity of laborers so many Ecuadorians have been exiled or killed in senseless revolutions Twenty million pounds are annually exported chiefly to Spain and two million pounds of excellent coffee which often finds its way into New York under the name of pure Java There are three or four kinds of indigenous cacao on this coast all richly deserving the generic title Theobroma or food for the gods The best grows in Esmeraldas as it contains the largest amount of oil and has the most pleasant flavor But very little of it is exported because it rots in about six months The cacao de arriba from up the River Guayas is the best to export as it keeps two years without damage Next in order is the cacao de abajo from down the river as Machala Santa Rosa Balao and Manabi below Guayaquil A still richer nut is the mountain cacao but it is never cultivated It is small and white and almost pure oil This oil called cacao butter is used by the natives for burns sores and many cutaneous diseases Cacao contributes more to the commerce of the republic than any other production of its soil The flowers and fruit grow directly out of the trunk and branches A more striking example says Humboldt of the expansive powers of life could hardly be met with in organic nature The fruit is yellowish red and of oblong shape and the seeds from which chocolate is prepared are enveloped in a mass of white pulp The tree resembles our lilac in size and shape and yields three crops a year in March June and September Spain is the largest consumer of cacao The Mexican chocolalt is the origin of our word chocolate Tucker gives the following comparative analysis of unshelled beans from Guayaquil and Caracas Guayaquil Caracas Theobromine

an average two pounds annually The other chief articles of exportation are hides cotton Panama hats manufactured at Indian villages on the coast cinchona bark caucho tobacco orchilla weed sarsaparilla and tamarinds eight The hats are usually made of the Toquilla Carludovica palmata an arborescent plant about five feet high resembling the palm The leaf which is a yard long is plaited like a fan and is borne on a three cornered stalk It is cut while young the stiff parallel veins removed then slit into shreds by whipping it and immersed in boiling water and finally bleached in the sun The same straw is used in the interior The Mocora which grows like a cocoa nut tree with a very smooth hard thorny bark is rarely used as it is difficult to work The leaves are from eight to twelve feet in length so that the straws will finish a hat without splicing Such hats require two or three months and bring sometimes one hundred fifty dollars but they will last a lifetime They can be packed away in a vest pocket and they can be turned inside out and worn the inside surface being as smooth and well finished as the outside Toquilla hats are whiter than the mocora Footnote eight In eighteen sixty seven there were exported to Europe of cacao one hundred ninety seven thousand two hundred sixty quintals cotton ten thousand two hundred forty seven do caucho eight thousand nine hundred eleven do sarsaparilla one hundred forty nine do orchilla ten thousand two hundred forty seven packages quinine five thousand do tobacco two thousand do coffee sixteen eleven do tamarinds sixty five bbls sides of leather twenty two thousand five hundred fourteen hats eight thousand three hundred ninety seven The exports from Guayaquil bear no proportion to the capabilities of the country Ecuador has no excuse for being bankrupt Most of the imports are of English origin lard comes from the United States and flour from Chile The Malecon and river present a lively scene all the year round the rest of the city appears deserted in comparison The British steamers from Panama and Payta arrive weekly Yankee steam boats make regular trips up and down the Guayas and its tributaries half a dozen sailing vessels principally French are usually lying in the stream which is here six fathoms deep and hundreds of canoes are gliding to and fro But the balsas are the most original and therefore the most attractive sight These are rafts made of light balsa wood so buoyant as to be used in coasting voyages They were invented by the old Peruvians and are the homes of a literally floating population By these and the smaller craft are brought to the mole of the Malecon besides articles for exportation a boundless variety of fruits pine apples whose quality has made Guayaquil famous oranges lemons limes plantains bananas cocoa nuts alligator pears papayas mangos guavas melons et cetera many an undescribed species of fish known only to the epicure and barrels or jars of water from a distant point up the river out of the reach of the tide and the city sewers Ice is frequently brought from Chimborazo and sold for one dollar per pound A flag hoisted at a favorite cafe announces that snow has arrived from the mountains and that ice cream can be had The market held every morning by the river side is an animated scene The strife of the half naked fishmongers the cry of the swarthy fruit dealers Pinas Naranjas et cetera and the song of the itinerant dulce peddler Tamales mingled with the bray of the water bearing donkeys as they trot through the town never fail to arrest the attention of every traveler But there is another sight more attractive still one worth a long voyage for Nature nowhere else repeats the picture From the balconies of Guayaquil can be seen on a clear day the long towering range of the Andes We may forget all the incidents in our subsequent journey but the impression produced by that glorious view is unfading The sun had nearly touched the Pacific when the clouds which for days had wrapped the Cordilleras nine in misty robes suddenly rose like a curtain There stood in inconceivable grandeur one of the stupendous products of the last great revolution of the earth s crust as a geologist would say but in the language of history the lofty home of the Incas made illustrious by the sword of Pizarro and the pen of Prescott On the right a sea of hills rose higher and higher till they culminated in the purple mountains of Assuay Far to the left one hundred miles northeasterly the peerless Chimborazo lifted its untrodden and unapproachable summit above its fellows an imposing background to lesser mountains and stately forests The great dome reflected dazzlingly the last blushes of the west its crown of snow fringed with black lines which were the steep and sharp edges of precipitous rocks It was interesting to watch the mellowing tints on the summit as the shadows crept upward gold vermilion violet purple were followed by a momentary glory then darkness covered the earth and a host of stars trembling with excess of light burst suddenly into view over the peaks of the Andes Footnote nine Cordillera pronounced Cor de yer ra literally a long ridge is usually applied to a longitudinal subdivision of the Andes as the east and west cordilleras inclosing the valley of Quito Sierra from the Spanish for saw or Arabic sehrah an uncultivated tract is a jagged spur of the Andes Cerro a hog backed hill Paramo a desert is the treeless uninhabited uncultivated rolling steppes just below the snow limit Bidding adios to our Guayaquilian friends we took passage in one of Captain Lee s little steamers to Bodegas seventy miles up the river The Ecuadorian government strange to say does not patronize these steamers but carries the Quito mail in a canoe The Guayas is a sluggish stream its turbid waters starting from the slope of the Andes and flowing through a low level tract covered with varied forms of vegetable life Forests of the broad leaved plantain and banana line the banks The fruit is the most common article of food in equatorial America and is eaten raw roasted baked boiled and fried It grows on a succulent stem formed of sheath like leaf stalks rolled over one another and terminating in enormous light green glossy blades nearly ten feet long by two feet wide so delicate that the slightest wind will tear them transversely Each tree vulgarly called the tree of paradise produces fruit but once and then dies A single bunch often weighs sixty or seventy pounds and Humboldt calculated that thirty three pounds of wheat and ninety nine pounds of potatoes require the same space of ground as will produce four thousand pounds of bananas They really save more labor than steam giving the greatest amount of food from a given piece of ground with the least labor They are always found where the palm is but their original home is the foot of the Himalayas The banana by some botanists considered a different species from the plantain is about four inches long and cylindrical and is eaten raw The plantain is twice as large and prismatic and uncooked is unhealthy There is another variety platanos de Otaheite which resembles the banana in size and quality but is prismatic A belt of jungle and impenetrable brushwood intervenes and then cacao and coffee plantations vast in extent arrest the eye Passing these the steamer brings you alongside of broad fields covered with the low prickly pine apple plant the air is fragrant with a rich perfume wafted from a neighboring grove of oranges and lemons the mango spreads its dense splendid foliage and bears a golden fruit which though praised by many tastes to us like a mixture of tow and turpentine the exotic bread tree waves its fig like leaves and pendent fruit while high over all the beautiful cocoa palm lifts its crown of glory ten Animal life does not compare with this luxuriant growth The steamer bound traveler may see a few monkeys a group of gallinazos and many brilliant though songless birds but the chief representative is the lazy ugly alligator Large numbers of these monsters may be seen on the mud bank basking in the hot sun or asleep with their mouths wide open Footnote ten The mango of Asia is superior in size and flavor to that of America It is eaten largely in Brazil by negroes and cattle The cocoa palm is also of Asiatic origin and is most abundant in Ceylon It has a swollen stem when young but becomes straight and tall when mature The flowers burst into a long plume of soft cream colored blossoms It is worthy of remembrance that the most beautiful forms of vegetation in the tropics are at the same time most useful to man Eight hours after leaving the Malecon we arrived at Bodegas a little village of two thousand souls rejoicing in the synonym of Babahoyo This has been a place of deposit for the interior from the earliest times In the rainy season the whole site is flooded and only the upper stories are habitable Cock fighting seems to be the chief amusement We breakfasted with the governor a portly gentleman who kept a little dry goods store His excellency without waiting for a formal introduction and with a cordiality and courtesy almost confined to the Latin nations received us into his own house and honored us with a seat at his private table spread with the choicest viands of his kingdom serving them himself with a grace to which we can not do justice Much as we find to condemn in tropical society we can not forget the kindness of these simple hearted people Though we may portray in the coming pages many faults and failings according to a New York standard we wish it to be understood that there is another side to the picture that there are virtues on the Andes to which the North is well nigh a stranger How many times says an American resident of ten years I have arrived at a miserable hut in the heart of the mountains tired and hungry after traveling all day without any other companion than the arriero to receive a warm hearted welcome the best perhaps the only chair or hammock offered to me the fattest chicken in the yard killed on my account and more than once they have compelled me by force to take the only good bed because I must be tired and should have a good night s rest A man may travel from one end of the Andes to the other depending altogether on the good people he meets At Bodegas travelers take to mules or horses for the mountains hiring one set for Guaranda and another at that village for Quito muleteers seldom allow their animals to pass from one altitude to the other These arrieros or muleteers form a very important class in Ecuador Their little caravans are the only baggage and express trains in the republic there is not a single regularly established public conveyance in the land The arrieros and their servants peons are Indians or half breeds They wear a straw or felt hat a poncho striped like an Arab s blanket and cotton breeches ending at the knees For food they carry a bag of parched corn another bag of roasted barley meal mashka and a few red peppers The beasts are thin decrepit jades which threaten to give out the first day yet they must carry you halfway up the Andes The distance to the capital is nearly two hundred miles The time required is usually eight or nine days but officials often travel it in four Illustration Equipped for the Andes We left Bodegas at noon It was impossible to start the muleteer a moment earlier though he had promised to be ready at seven Patience is a necessary qualification in a South American traveler In our company were a Jesuit priest with three attendants going to Riobamba and a young Quito merchant with his mother the mother of only twenty five children This merchant had traveled in the United States and could not help contrasting the thrift and enterprise of our country with the beggary and laziness of his own adding with a show of sincerity I am sorry I have Spanish blood in my veins The suburbs of Bodegas reminded us of the outskirts of Cairo but the road soon entered a broad savannah instead of a sandy desert At three P M we passed through La Mona a village of twenty five bamboo huts all on stilts for in the rainy season the whole town is under water Signs of indolence and neglect were every where visible Idle men with an uncertain mixture of European Negro and Indian blood sad looking Quichua women carrying a naked infant or a red water jar on the back black hogs and lean poultry wandering at will into the houses such is the picture of the motley life in the inland villages Strange was the contrast between human poverty and natural wealth We were on the borders of a virgin forest and the overpowering beauty of the vegetation soon erased all memory of the squalor and lifelessness of La Mona Our road a mere path suddenly entered this seemingly impenetrable forest where the branches crossed overhead producing a delightful shade The curious forms of tropical life were all attractive to one who had recently rambled over the comparatively bleak hills of New England Delight is a weak term to express the feelings of a naturalist who for the first time wanders in a South American forest The superb banana the great charm of equatorial vegetation tossed out luxuriantly its glossy green leaves eight feet in length the slender but graceful bamboo shot heavenward straight as an arrow and many species of palm bore aloft their feathery heads inexpressibly light and elegant On the branches of the independent trees sat tufts of parasites many of them orchids which are here epiphytal and countless creeping plants whose long flexible stems entwined snake like around the trunks or formed gigantic loops and coils among the limbs Beneath this world of foliage above thick beds of mimosae covered the ground and a boundless variety of ferns attracted the eye by their beautiful patterns eleven It is easy to specify the individual objects of admiration in these grand scenes but it is not possible to give an adequate idea of the higher feelings of wonder astonishment and devotion which fill and elevate the mind This road to the Andes is a paradise to the contemplative man There is something in a tropical forest says Bates akin to the ocean in its effects on the mind Man feels so completely his insignificance and the vastness of nature The German traveler Burmeister observes that the contemplation of a Brazilian forest produced on him a painful impression on account of the vegetation displaying a spirit of restless selfishness eager emulation and craftiness He thought the softness earnestness and repose of European woodland scenery were far more pleasing and that these formed one of the causes of the superior moral character of European nations Live and let live is certainly not the maxim taught in these tropical forests and it is equally clear that selfishness is not wanting among the people Here in view of so much competition among organized beings is the spot to study Darwin s Origin of Species We have thought that the vegetation under the equator was a fitter emblem of the human world than the forests of our temperate zone There is here no set time for decay and death but we stand amid the living and the dead flowers and leaves are falling while fresh ones are budding into life Then too the numerous parasitic plants making use of their neighbors as instruments for their own advancement not inaptly represent a certain human class Footnote eleven Ferns constitute one sixth of the flora of South America Spruce counted one hundred forty species within the space of three square miles Their limits of growth are five hundred and seven thousand feet above the sea CHAPTER II Our Tambo Ascending the Andes Camino Real Magnificent Views Guaranda Cinchona The Summit Chimborazo Over the Andes Chuquipoyo the Wretched Ambato A Stupid City Cotopaxi The Vale of Machachi Arrival at Quito We reached Savaneta at five P M This little village of hardly twenty houses becomes the Bodegas or place of deposit for the mountains six months in the year for in the invierno the roads are flooded and canoes take the place of mules from Savaneta to Babahoyo Even in the dry season the dampness of this wilderness is so great that the traveler s sugar and chocolate are melted into one and envelopes seal themselves We put up at a tambo or wayside inn a simple two storied bamboo hovel thatched with plantain leaves without and plastered with cobwebs within yet a palace compared with what sheltered us afterward The only habitable part was the second story which was reached by a couple of notched bamboo sticks A hammock two earthen kettles two plates and a few calabashes constituted the household furniture The dormitory was well ventilated for two sides were open Our lodging however cost us nothing travelers only pay for yerba for their beasts Though this has been the royal road to Quito for three centuries there is but one posada between Guayaquil and Ambato a distance of one hundred and fifty miles travelers must carry their own bedding and provisions Illustration Ascending the Andes Leaving Savaneta at dawn and breakfasting at a wayside hut owned by an old negro we struck about noon the Rio Charriguajaco dashing down the mountains in hot haste for the Guayas It was refreshing to look upon living waters for the first time since leaving the hills of our native country Fording this stream we know not how many times and winding through the dense forest in narrow paths often blockaded by laden donkeys that doggedly disputed the passage we soon found ourselves slowly creeping up the Andes We frequently met mountaineers on their way to Bodegas with loads of potatoes peas barley fowls eggs et cetera They are generally accompanied by their wives or daughters who ride like the men but with the knees tucked up higher On the slippery tracks which traverse this western slope bulls are often used as beasts of burden the cloven hoofs enabling them to descend with great security But mules are better than horses or asses That a hybrid muses Darwin should possess more reason memory obstinacy social affection powers of muscular endurance and length of life than either of its parents seems to indicate that art has here outdone nature Toward evening the ascent became rapid and the road horrible beyond conception growing narrower and rougher as we advanced Indeed our way had long since ceased to be a road In the dense forest where sunshine never comes rocks mud and fallen trees in rapid alternation macadamize the path save where it turns up the bed of a babbling brook In the comparatively level tracts the equable step of the beasts has worn the soil into deep transverse ridges called camellones from their resemblance to the humps on a camel s back In the precipitous parts the road is only a gully worn by the transit of men and beasts for ages aided by torrents of water in the rainy season As we ascend this changes to a rocky staircase so strait that one must throw up his legs to save them from being crushed and so steep that horse and rider run the risk of turning a somersault It is fearful to meet in a narrow defile or where the road winds around the edge of a precipice a drove of reckless donkeys and mules descending the mountain urged on by the cries and lashes of the muleteers behind Yet this has been the highway of Ecuadorian commerce for three hundred years In vain we tried to reach the little village of Camino Real on the crest of the ridge but the night was advancing rapidly and crawling up such a road by starlight was not a little dangerous So we put up at a miserable tambo Pogyos by name It was a mud hut of the rudest kind windowless and unfloored very clean if it had been left to nature but man and beast had rendered it intolerably filthy Our hostess a Quichua woman with tattered garments and hair disheveled and standing up as if electrified set a kettle on three stones and making a fire under it prepared for us a calabash of chicken and locro Locro the national dish in the mountains is in plain English simply potato soup Sitting on the ground we partook of this refreshment by the aid of fingers and wooden spoons enticing our appetites by the reflection that potato soup would support life The unkempt Indian by our side grinning in conscious pride over her successful cookery did not aid us in this matter Fire is used in Ecuador solely for culinary purposes not for warmth It is made at no particular spot on the mud floor and there is no particular orifice for the exit of the smoke save the chinks in the wall There is not a chimney in the whole republic As the spare room in the establishment belonged to the women we gentlemen slept on the ground outside or on beds made of round poles The night was piercingly cold The wished for morning came at last and long before the sun looked over the mountains we were on our march It was the same terrible road running zigzag or quingo fashion up to Camino Real where it was suddenly converted into a royal highway We were now fairly out of the swamps of the lowlands and though under the equator out of the tropics too The fresh mountain breeze and the chilly mists announced a change of climate twelve Fevers and dysenteries snakes and musquitoes the plantain and the palm we had left behind Camino Real is a huddle of eight or ten dwellings perched on the summit of a sierra a thousand feet higher than the top of Mount Washington The views from this stand point compensate for all past troubles The wild chaos of mountains on every side broken by profound ravines the heaps of ruins piled up during the lapse of geologic ages the intense azure of the sky and the kingly condor majestically wheeling around the still higher pinnacles make up a picture rarely to be seen Westward the mountains tumble down into hills and spread out into plains which in the far distant horizon dip into the great Pacific The setting sun turns the ocean into a sheet of liquid fire Long columns of purple light shoot up to the zenith and as the last point of the sun sinks beneath the horizon the stars rush out in full splendor for at the equator day gives place to night with only an hour and twenty minutes of twilight The mountains are Alpine yet grander than the Alps not so ragged as the granite peaks of Switzerland but with rounder heads The prospect down this occidental slope is diversified by deep valleys lands lides and flowering trees Magnificent are the views eastward Where Andes giant of the western star Looks from his throne of clouds o er half the world Footnote twelve The altitude of seven thousand feet is the usual limit of the rain line on the west slope of the Andes The condensation which produces rain takes place at the equator two or three times higher than in our latitude The majestic dome of Chimborazo was entirely uncovered of clouds and presented a most splendid spectacle There it stood its snow white summit unsullied by the foot of man towering up twice as high as Etna For many years it received the homage of the world as the highest point in America but now the Aconcagua of Chile claims the palm Still what a panorama from the top of Chimborazo could one reach it for the eye would command ten thousand square miles Our road gently winds down the sierra giving us at every turn sublime ideas of what nature can do in tossing up the thin crust of our globe But sublimity is at a discount here there is too much of it Suddenly we are looking down into the enchanting valley of Chimbo This romantic and secluded spot is one of those forgotten corners of the earth which barricaded against the march of civilization by almost impassable mountains and inhabited by a thriftless race has been left far behind in the progress of mankind Distance lends enchantment to the view We are reminded of the pastoral vales of New England Wheat takes the place of the sugar cane barley of cacao potatoes of plantains and turnips of oranges Bamboo sheds have given way to neatly whitewashed villages and the fields are fenced with rows of aloe But drawing nearer we find the habitations are in reality miserable mud hovels without windows and tenanted by vermin and ragged poverty There are herds of cattle and fields of grain yet we shall not find a quart of milk or a loaf of bread for sale The descent into the valley is very precipitous and after a rain alarmingly slippery Mules drawing their legs together slide down with startling velocity and follow the windings with marvelous dexterity We arrived at Guaranda at five P M on the third day after leaving Bodegas This is a desolate town of two thousand souls dwelling in low dilapidated huts made of the most common building material in the Andes adobe or sun dried blocks of mud mingled with straw thirteen Footnote thirteen From adoub an Egyptian word still used by the Copts carried by the Moors to Spain thence to America and from America the word has gone to the Sandwich Islands The streets are rudely paved and pitch to the centre to form an aqueduct like the streets of old Sychar The inhabitants are in happy ignorance of the outside world They pass the day without a thought of work standing on the Plaza or in front of some public office staring vacantly into space or gossiping A cockfight will soonest rouse them from their lethargy They seem to have no purpose in life but to keep warm under their ponchos and to eat when they are hungry Guaranda is a healthy locality lying in a deep valley on the west bank of the Chimbo at an elevation according to our barometer of eight thousand eight hundred forty feet and having a mean temperature slightly less than that of Quito It is a place of importance inasmuch as it is the resting place before ascending or after descending the still loftier ranges and much more because it is the capital of the region which yields the invaluable cinchona or Peruvian bark fourteen This tree is indigenous to the Andes where it is found on the western slope between the altitudes of two thousand and nine thousand feet the species richest in alkaloids occupying the higher elevations where the air is moist doctor Weddell enumerates twenty one species seven of which are now found in Ecuador but the only one of value is the the C succirubra the calisaya has run out and this is now nearly extinct as the trees have been destroyed to obtain the bark This species is a beautiful tree having large broadly oval deep green shining leaves white fragrant flowers and red bark and sometimes though rarely attains the height of sixty feet A tree five feet in circumference will yield fifteen hundred pounds of green bark or eight hundred of the dry The roots contain the most alkaloid though the branches are usually barked for commerce The true cinchona barks containing quinine quinidine and cinchonine are distinguished from the false by their splintery fibrous texture the latter being pre eminently corky The cascarilleros begin to hunt for bark in August doctor Taylor of Riobamba found one tree which gave three thousand six hundred dollars worth of quinine The general yield is from three to five pounds to a quintal of bark The tree has been successfully transplanted to the United States and particularly to India where there are now over a million of plants It was introduced into India by Markham in eighteen sixty one The bark is said to be stronger than that from Ecuador yielding twice as much alkaloid or eleven per cent The quinine of commerce will doubtless come hereafter from the slopes of the Himalayas instead of the Andes In eighteen sixty seven only five thousand pounds of bark were exported from Guayaquil The Indians use the bark of another tree the Maravilla which is said to yield a much stronger alkaloid than cinchona It grows near Pallatanga Footnote fourteen This celebrated febrifuge was first taken to Europe about the middle of the seventeenth century and was named after the Countess of Chinchon who had been cured of intermittent fever at Lima Afterward when Cardinal de Lugo spread the knowledge of the remedy through France and recommended it to Cardinal Mazarin it received the name of Jesuits Bark The French chemists Pelletier and Caverton discovered quinine in eighteen twenty We left Guaranda at five A M by the light of Venus and Orion having exchanged our horses for the sure footed mule It was a romantic ride From a neighboring stand point Church took one of his celebrated views of The Heart of the Andes But the road as aforetime was a mere furrow made and kept by the tread of beasts For a long distance the track runs over the projecting and jagged edges of steeply inclined strata of slate which nobody has had the energy to smooth down At many places on the road side were human skulls set in niches in the bank telling tales of suffering in their ghastly silence while here and there a narrow passage was blocked up by the skeleton or carcass of a beast that had borne its last burden At nine o clock we came out on a narrow grassy ridge called the Ensillada or Saddleback where there were three straw huts with roofs resting on the ground and there we breakfasted on locro During our stay the Indians killed a pig and before the creature was fairly dead dry grass was heaped upon it and set on fire This is the ordinary method of removing the bristles Still ascending we lose sight of the valley of the Chimbo and find ourselves in a wilderness of crags and treeless mountains clothed with the long dreary looking paramo grass called paja But we are face to face with the monarch of the Andes and we shall have its company the rest of the day The snowy dome is flooded with the golden light of heaven delicate clouds of softest hues float around its breast while far below its feet are wrapped in the baser mists of earth We attained the summit of the pass at eleven A M All travelers strive to reach it early in the morning for in the afternoon it is swept by violent winds which render it uncomfortable if not dangerous This part of the road is called the Arenal from the sand and gravel which cover it It is about a league in length and crosses the side of Chimborazo at an elevation of more than fourteen thousand feet Chimborazo stands on the left of the traveler How tantalizing its summit It appears so easy of access and yet many a valiant philosopher from Humboldt down has panted for the glory and failed The depth of the snow and numerous precipices are the chief obstacles but the excessively rarefied air is another hinderance Even in crossing the Arenal a native of the lowlands complains of violent headache a propensity to vomit and a difficulty of breathing The Arenal is often swept by snow storms and history has it that some of the Spanish conquerors were here frozen to death The pale yellow gravel is considered by some geologists as the moraine of a glacier It is spread out like a broad gravel walk so that without exaggeration one of the best roads in Ecuador has been made by Nature s hand on the crest of the Andes It was interesting to trace the different hypsometrical zones by the change of vegetation from Bodegas to this lofty spot The laws of the decrease of heat are plainly written on the rapid slopes of the Cordilleras On the hot steaming lowlands of the coast reign bananas and palms As these thin out tree ferns take their place Losing these we found the cinchona bedewed by the cool clouds of Guaranda and last of all among the trees the polylepis The twisted gnarled trunk of this tree as well as its size and silvery foliage reminded us of the olive but the bark resembles that of the birch It reaches the greatest elevation of any tree on the globe Then followed shrubby fuchsia calceolaria eupatoria and red and purple gentians around and on the Arenal a uniform mantle of monocotyledonous plants with scattered tufts of valeriana viola and geranium all with rigid leaves in the characteristic rosettes of super alpine vegetation and on the porphyritic and trachytic sides of Chimborazo lichens alone Snow then covers the last effort of vegetable life fifteen The change in the architecture of the houses indicated likewise a change of altitude The open bamboo huts shingled with banana leaves were followed by warmer adobe houses and these in turn by the straw hovels of the mountain top made entirely of the long wiry grass of the paramos Footnote fifteen According to Sir J Hooker among the flowers which adorn the slopes of the Himalayas rhododendrons occupy the most prominent place and primroses next There are no orchids neither red gentians but blue Organic life ceases three thousand feet lower than on the Andes yet it is affirmed that flowering plants occur at the height of eighteen thousand four hundred sixty feet which is equivalent to the summit of Chimborazo in point of temperature The polylepis P racemosa is one of the Sanguisorbaceae in Quichua it is Sachaquinoa Leaving the Arenal we rapidly descended by the usual style of road stone stairs But down we went as all the goods for Quito the grand capital have done since the Spanish Conquest The old road from Beirut to Damascus is royal in comparison The general aspect of the eastern slope is that of a gray barren waste overgrown with paja but now and then we crossed deep gulleys whose sides were lined with mosses and sprinkled with calceolarias lupines et cetera In our descent we had before us the magnificent Valley of Quito and beyond it the eastern Cordillera Below us was Riobamba and far away to the right the deep gorge of the Pastassa Nevertheless this is one of the loneliest rides earth can furnish Not a tree nor human habitation is in sight Icy rivulets and mule trains are the only moving objects on this melancholy heath Even Drake s Plantation Bitters painted on the volcanic cliffs of Chimborazo would be a relief At last we reached our rude accommodations for the night It was a solitary mud tambo glorying in the euphonious name of Chuquipoyo The court yard was a sea of mud and manure for this is the halting place for all the caravans between Quito and the coast Our room was a horrid hole dark dirty damp and cold without a window or a fire There was one old rickety bedstead but as that belonged to the lady in our party the rest betook themselves to benches table and floor We filled our stomachs with an unpalatable potato soup containing cheese and eggs and laid down to wait for the morning Grass is the only fuel here but this is not the chief reason why it is so difficult to make good tea or cook potatoes at this wretched tambo Water boils at one hundred ninety deg or before it is fairly hot it is well the potatoes are small The muleteers slept with their beasts outside though the night was fearfully cold for Chuquipoyo lies on the frigid side of Chimborazo at an elevation of over twelve thousand feet above the sea As Johnson said to Boswell This is a dolorous place Gladly we left this cheerless tambo though a cold heavy mist was falling as we rode northward over the seemingly endless paramo of Sanancajas Here as throughout the highlands of Ecuador ditches are used for fences so that should the traveler wander from the path he finds himself stopped by an impassable gulf In two hours and a half we reached Mocha a lifeless pueblo under the shadow of Carguairazo Slowly descending from our high altitude we gradually entered a more congenial climate the zone of wheat and barley till finally signs of an eternal spring were all around us ripening corn on one side and blossoming peas on the other Late in the afternoon the road led us through a sandy sterile tract till suddenly we came in sight of Ambato beautifully situated in a deep ravine eight thousand five hundred and fifty feet above the Pacific The city ranks next to Quito in beauty It is certainly an oasis the green foliage of its numerous shade trees and orchards contrasting with the barren hills around It is two degrees warmer than Quito and is famous for its fruit and fine climate It is the Lynn of Ecuador the chief articles of manufacture being boots and shoes cheap but of poor quality It was destroyed by an earthquake in sixteen ninety eight The houses are built of sun dried brick and whitewashed The streets with gutters in the centre are at right angles and paved and adorned with numerous cypress looking trees called sauce a species of willow The Plaza which contains a useful if not ornamental fountain presents a lively scene on Sunday the great market day The inn is a fair specimen of a public house in Spanish America Around the court yard where the beasts are fed are three or four rooms to let They are ventilated only when opened for travelers The floor is of brick but alive with fleas the walls are plastered but veiled with cobwebs The furniture of primitive make and covered with dust consists of a chair or two a table and a bed of boards covered with a thin straw mat There is not a hotel in Ecuador where sheets and towels are furnished The landlords are seldom seen the entire management of the concern is left to a slovenly Indian boy who is both cook and hostler No amount of bribery will secure a meal in less than two hours Ten years ago there was not a posada in the country now there is entertainment for man and beast at Guayaquil Guaranda Mocha Ambato Tacunga Machachi and Quito Riobamba has a billiard saloon but no inn Leaving Ambato we breakfasted at Cunchebamba an Indian village of half a dozen straw huts Thence the road for a long distance winds through vast deposits of volcanic debris the only sign of vegetation being hedges of aloe and cactus Arid hills and dreary plains covered with plutonic rocks and pumice dust tell us we are approaching the most terrible volcano on the earth Crossing the sources of the Pastassa we entered Latacunga sixteen situated on a beautiful plain at the foot of Cotopaxi seven hundred feet higher than Ambato Its average temperature is fifty nine deg The population chiefly Indians numbers about fifteen thousand It is the dullest city in Ecuador without the show of enterprise or business Not even grass grows in the streets the usual sign of life in the Spanish towns It is also one of the filthiest and though it has been many times thoroughly shaken by earthquakes and buried under showers of volcanic dust it is still the paradise of fleas which have survived every revolution Ida Pfeiffer says that after a night s rest in Latacunga she awoke with her skin marked all over with red spots as if from an eruptive disease We can certify that we have been tattoed without the night s rest The town has a most stupid and forlorn aspect Half of it is in ruins It was four times destroyed between sixteen ninety eight and seventeen ninety seven In seventeen fifty six the Jesuit church was thrown down though its walls were five feet thick The houses are of one story and built of pumice widely different from the palaces and temples which are said to have stood here in the palmy days of the Incas Cotopaxi stands threateningly near and its rumbling thunder is the source of constant alarm Footnote sixteen This is shortened in parlance to Tacunga The full name according to La Condamine is Llacta cunga llacta meaning country and cunga neck From Latacunga to Quito there is a very fine carriage road the result of one man s administration Senor G Garcia Moreno For many miles it passes over an uncultivated plateau strewn with volcanic fragments The farms are confined to the slopes of the Cordilleras and as every where else the tumbling haciendas indicate the increasing poverty of the owner Superstition and indolence go hand in hand On a great rock rising out of the sandy plain they show a print of the foot of saint Bartholomew who alighted here on a visit surely to the volcanoes as it was long before the red man had found this valley Abreast of Cotopaxi the road cuts through high hills of fine pumice inter stratified with black earth and rapidly ascends till it reaches Tiupullo eleven thousand five hundred feet above the sea This high ridge seventeen stretching across the valley from Cotopaxi to Iliniza is a part of the great water shed of the continent the waters on the southern slope flowing through the Pastassa and Amazon to the Atlantic those on the north finding their way to the Pacific by the Rio Esmeraldas At this bleak place we breakfasted on punch and guinea pig Footnote seventeen Sometimes called Chisinche As soon as we began to descend the glittering cone of Cotopaxi and the gloomy plain it has so often devastated passed out of view and before us was a green valley exceedingly rich and well cultivated girt by a wall of mountains the towers of which were the peaks of Corazon and Ruminagui Loathsome lepers by the wayside alone disturbed the pleasing impression Three hours more of travel brought us to the straggling village of Machachi standing in the centre of the beautiful plain at an altitude of nine thousand nine hundred feet Nature designed this spot for a home of plenty and comfort but the habitations of the wretched proprietors are windowless adobe hovels thatched with dried grass and notorious for their filth We must needs make one more ascent for the ridge of Tambillo hides the goal of our journey The moment we reached the summit views unparalleled in the Andes or any where else met our astonished vision whithersoever we looked Far away to the south stretched the two Cordilleras till they were lost in the mist which enshrouded Chimborazo and Tunguragua Turning to the north we beheld the city of Quito at our feet and Pichincha and Antisana standing like gallant sentinels on either side of the proud capital Beautiful were the towering mountains and almost as delightful now are the memories of that hour A broad well traveled road gentlemen on horseback clad in rich ponchos droves of Indians bowed under their heavy burdens and long lines of laden donkeys hurrying to and fro indicate our approach to a great city Winding with the road through green pastures and fields of ripening grain and crossing the Machangara by an elegant bridge we enter the city of the Incas CHAPTER III Early History of Quito Its Splendor under the Incas Crushed by Spain Dying now Situation Altitude Streets

architectural effect CHAPTER IV Population of Quito Dress Manners Character Commerce Agriculture Manufactures Arts Education Amusements Quito Ladies Quitonians claim for their capital eighty thousand inhabitants but when we consider that one fourth of the city is covered with ecclesiastical buildings and that the dwelling houses are but two stories high we see that there is not room for more than half that number From thirty thousand to forty thousand is the estimate of the venerable doctor Jameson who has resided here for a generation twenty two Census taking is as difficult as in Constantinople the people hide themselves to escape taxation The women far outnumber the men The white population a stiff aristocracy of eight thousand souls is of Spanish descent but not more than half a dozen can boast of pure blood The coarse black hair prominent cheek bones and low foreheads reveal an Indian alliance This is the governing class from its ranks come those uneasy politicians who make laws for other people to obey and hatch revolutions when a rival party is in power They are blessed with fair mental capacity quick perception and uncommon civility but they lack education and industry energy and perseverance Their wealth which is not great consists mainly in haciendas yielding grain cotton and cattle The Aguirre family is one of the noblest and wealthiest in the city their mansion is on the Grand Plaza facing the Capitol The pure Indians of Quito number perhaps ten thousand not all those seen in the city are citizens as many serranos or mountaineers come in to sell produce They are the serfs that do the drudgery of the republic they are the tillers of the soil and beasts of burden Many sell themselves for money in advance and then are ever kept in debt Excepting a few Zambos the children of Indians and Negroes and a very few foreigners and Negroes the remainder constituting the bulk of the population are Cholos the offspring of whites and Indians They are not strictly half breeds for the Indian element stands out most prominent Though a mixed race they are far superior to their progenitors in enterprise and intelligence They are the soldiers artisans and tradesmen who keep up the only signs of life in Quito I know not the reason says Darwin but men of such origin seldom have a good expression of countenance This may be true on the pampas but Quito where there is every imaginable mixture of Indian and Spaniard is wonderfully free from ugly features It may be owing to the more peaceful and civilized history of this mountain city Footnote twenty two Spanish rhetoric is given to exaggeration All their geese are swans A Peruvian assured us that Cuzco contained two hundred thousand souls It is in fact about as large as Quito Gibbon says twenty thousand As to dress black is the color of etiquette but is not so national as in Madrid The upper class follow la mode de Paris gentlemen adding the classic cloak of Old Spain This modern toga fits an Ecuadorian admirably it favors habits of inactivity preventing the arms from doing any thing and covers a multitude of sins especially pride and poverty The poncho so peculiar to the West Coast and to the Gauchos of Buenos Ayres is a piece of cloth of divers colors with a slit in the centre through which the head is passed It is the only variable article of the wardrobe It is an excellent riding habit and is made of heavy woolen for mountain travel and of silk or cotton for warmer altitudes No gentleman will be seen walking in the streets of Quito under a poncho Hence citizens are divided into men with ponchos and gentlemen with cloaks The panuelon is the most essential article of female gear It answers to the mantilla of the mother country though it is not worn so gracefully as on the banks of the Tagus Andean ladies are not troubled with the distressing fluctuations in the style of hats a bonnet in Quito is as much out of place as a turban in New York When the daughter of our late minister resident appeared in the cathedral with one the innovation was the subject of severe remark The Spanish hair is the glory of the sex It is thick and black red being a rarity is considered a beauty and is braided in two long tresses A silk dress satin shoes and fancy jewelry complete the visible attire of the belles of Quito The ordinary costume of the Indians and Cholos consists of a coarse cotton shirt and drawers and silk cotton or woolen poncho of native manufacture the females adding a short petticoat generally of a light blue or butter nut color belted around the waist with a figured woolen belt woven by themselves The head arms legs and feet are often bare but by those who can afford it the head is covered with a straw or white felt broad brim and the feet protected by sandals called alpargates made of the fibres of the aloe They are very fond of bracelets and necklaces Infants are usually swathed from neck to feet with a broad strip of cloth so that they look like live mummies Quitonians put us to shame by their unequaled courtesy cordiality and good nature and are not far below the grave and decorous Castilian in dignified politeness twenty three Footnote twenty three I must express my admiration at the natural politeness of almost every Chileno We met near Mendoza a little and very fat negress riding astride on a mule She had a goitre so enormous that it was scarcely possible to avoid gazing at her for a moment but my two companions almost instantly by way of apology made the common salute of the country by taking off their hats Where would one of the lower or higher classes in Europe have shown such feeling politeness to a poor and miserable object of a degraded race Darwin s Naturalist s Voyage Rudeness which some Northerners fancy is a proof of equality and independence we never met with and duels and street quarrels are almost unknown We detected none of the touchy sensitiveness of the punctilious Spanish hidalgos Their compliments and promises are without end and made in the magnificent and ceremonious language of Spain twenty four are overwhelming to a stranger Thus a fair Quitonian sends by her servant the following message to another lady Go to the Senorita Fulana de Tal and tell her that she is my heart and the dear little friend of my soul tell her that I am dying for not having seen her and ask her why she does not come to see me tell her that I have been waiting for her more than a week and that I send her my best respects and considerations and ask her how she is and how her husband is and how her children are and whether they are all well in the family and tell her she is my little love and ask her whether she will be kind enough to send me that pattern which she promised me the other day twenty five This highly important message the servant delivers like a parrot not omitting a single compliment but rather adding thereto Footnote twenty four The Spanish tongue is the manly son of the Latin as the Italian is the fair daughter a language in which as Charles V said God ought alone to be addressed in prayer It is spoken in America with an Andalusian rather than Toledan pronunciation Footnote twenty five We are indebted to mister Hassaurek for this capital illustration Every lady married or unmarried is addressed Senorita or Miss A newly arrived foreigner is covered with promises houses horses servants yea every thing is at his disposal But alas the traveler soon finds that this ceremony of words does not extend to deeds He is never expected to call for the services so pompously proffered So long as he stays in Quito he will not lose sight of the contrast between big promise and beggarly performance This outward civility however is not hypocritical it is mere mechanical prattle the speaker does not expect to be taken at his word The love of superlatives and the want of good faith may be considered as prominent characteristics The readiness with which they break a promise or an agreement wrote Colonel Hall forty years ago can only be equaled by the sophistical ingenuity with which they defend themselves for having done so The Quitonians who are sensible of their shortcomings have this standing apology Our vices we owe to Spain our virtues to ourselves twenty six Footnote twenty six When speaking of these countries the manner in which they have been brought up by their unnatural parent Spain should always be borne in mind On the whole perhaps more credit is due for what has been done than blame for that which may be deficient Darwin s Journal of Researches p one hundred fifty eight Such is the mutual distrust partnerships are almost unknown we do not remember a single commercial firm save a few made up of brothers or father and son With this moral debility is joined the procrastinating spirit of the oriental Manana to morrow like the Boukra of the Arabs is the universal winding up of promises And very often if one promises a thing to morrow he means the day after that It is impossible to start a man into prompt compliance he will not commence a piece of work when you wish nor when he promises No amount of cajolery bribery or threats will induce a Quitonian to do any thing or be any where in season If there were a railroad in Ecuador every body would be too late for the first train There are only one or two watch tinkers in the great city and as may be inferred very few watches are in running order As a consequence the people have very little idea of time But this is not the sole reason for their dilatoriness they are indifferent Nobody seems to want to make money though all are in sad need of it nobody is in a hurry nobody is busy save the tailors who manifest a commendable diligence Contempt for labor a Spanish inheritance and lack of energy are traits which stand out in alto relievo One can form his own judgment of the spiritless people from the single statement which we have from doctor Jameson that during the last forty years not ten Quitonians have visited the grand crater of Pichincha though it is possible to ride horseback to its very edge Plenty of gentlemen by profession walk the streets and cathedral terrace proud as a Roman senator under his toga yet not ashamed to beg a cup of coffee at the door of a more fortunate fellow citizen Society is in a constant struggle between ostentation and want Nature has done more for Ecuador than for Ecuadorians She laid out this beautiful valley for an Elysian field de Quito al Cielo from Quito to Heaven is not an empty adage and it is painful to look upon tottering walls and impassable roads upon neglected fields and an idle population poor as poverty in the lap of boundless natural wealth The only really live man in the republic is the president Senor G Garcia Moreno a man of wide views and great energy standing in these respects head and shoulders above his fellow citizens Quito and Quito Valley owe nearly all their improvements to this one man It is easy to say what would be the industry of a people who spend much of their time repeating traditions of treasures buried by the Incas and stories of gold deposits in the mountains Of commerce there is scarcely enough to deserve the name Quito is an ecclesiastical city and is nearly supported by Guayaquil Without capital without energy without business habits Quitonians never embark in grand commercial schemes and industrial enterprises There is not a highway for commerce in any direction only a natural path called by the innocent natives a road which rises to the altitude of fourteen thousand feet by which the beasts of burden pick their way over the Cordillera And this is open only six months in the year Should a box designed for Quito arrive at Guayaquil at the beginning of the rainy season it must tarry half a year till Nature makes the road passable The unstable condition of the country does not encourage great undertakings all business is periodically paralyzed by revolution Merchants generally buy their goods in Lima to which city and Guayaquil the fabrics of England and France are brought by foreigners in foreign ships The shops of Quito as we have remarked are very small without windows and with only one wooden door The door is double and is fastened by a ponderous padlock They are open from seven A M till sunset excepting between nine and ten and between three and four when the stores are closed for breakfast and dinner the merchants never trusting their clerks even when they have any which is not usually the case They have no fixed price but get what they can The majority know nothing of wholesale and refuse to sell by the quantity fearing a cheat An Indian woman will sell you a real s worth of oranges any number of times but she would object to parting with a dollar s worth her arithmetic can not comprehend it In the portals or arcades of the Aguirre mansion and the nuncio s palace are the stalls of the haberdashers Articles are not wrapped in paper customers must get them home the best way they can Ladies of the higher class seldom go out shopping but send for samples It is considered disgraceful to either sex to be seen carrying any thing through the streets of Quito The common people buy only for immediate wants a dose of medicine or a handful of potatoes at a time Nearly all liquids kerosene as well as wine are sold by the bottle There was no bank in Quito in eighteen sixty seven but an attempt has just been made to establish one The paper money of Guayaquil is often at nine per cent discount in the capital The currency is silver adulterated with one third of copper The smallest coin the cale is worth about two and a half cents Above that are medios five cents reals ten cents two four and eight reals Eight reals make a soft dollar zero dollars eighty ten reals a hard dollar one dollar zero There is no copper coin oranges and loaves of bread are sometimes used to make change and nearly all the gold in circulation are New Granada condors and Peruvian onzas Many of the silver pieces have large holes cut in the centre so that they resemble rings Government set the example and the people followed on the plea that it would prevent the exportation of coin The plan has succeeded for it does not pass out of the valley Nearly the only sign of progress is the late introduction of the grape and silk worm and these give so much promise of success that the threadbare nobility have already begun to count their coming fortunes Husbandry is more pastoral than agricultural Thousands of cattle are raised on the paramos but almost wholly for beef A dislike to milk observes Humboldt or at least the absence of its use before the arrival of Europeans was generally speaking a feature common to all nations of the New Continent as likewise to the inhabitants of China Some cheese mostly unpressed curd and a little butter are made but in the patriarchal style Only one American churn is in operation the people insist upon first boiling the milk and then stirring with a spoon Custom is omnipotent here and its effects hereditary Milking is done at any hour of the day or whenever milk is wanted The operation is a formidable one to these bull fighting people Stopping at a hacienda near Pelileo for a drink of milk we were eye witness of a comical sight A mild looking cow was driven up to the door the woman evidently the bravest member of the household seized the beast by the horns a boy tied the hind legs with a long rope and held on to one end of it at a respectful distance while the father with outstretched arms milked into a calabash Agricultural machinery is not in use The first threshing machine Quito ever saw was made in eighteen sixty seven by some California miners but it remained unsold when we last saw it The spade is not known the nearest approach to it is a crowbar flattened at one end Hoes are clumsy and awkward Yankee plows are bought more as curiosities than for use Many a crooked stick is seen scratching the land as in Egypt which the cattle drag by their horns Sometimes a number of sharp nosed hogs are tied together and let into a field and driven from place to place till the whole is rooted up Corn is planted by making holes in the ground with a stick and dropping in the seed The soil and climate of Ecuador so infinitely varied offer a home to almost every useful plant The productions of either India could be naturalized on the lowlands while the highlands would welcome the grains and fruits of Europe But intertropical people do not subdue nature like the civilized men of the North they only pick up a livelihood Spanish Americans like Castilians on the banks of the Tagus have a singular antipathy to trees When Garcia Moreno made a park of the dusty Plaza Mayor he was ridiculed even threatened To plant a fruit or shade tree a thing of foresight and forethought for others in a land where people live for self and from hand to mouth is considered downright folly in theory and practice A large portion of the valley left treeless is becoming less favorable for cultivation Yet as it is the traveler is charmed by the emerald verdure of the coast and by evergreen Quito more beautiful than the hanging gardens of Babylon suspended far above the ordinary elevation of the clouds In the San Francisco market we find wheat barley maize beans peas potatoes cabbages beets salads pine apples chirimoyas guavas oranges lemons pears quinces peaches apricots melons and strawberries the last all the year round Most of these are exotics the early discoverers found not a cereal grain of the Old World not an orange or apple no sugar cane or strawberries twenty seven Footnote twenty seven The vase is still shown in which Father Rixi brought the first wheat from Europe It was sown in what is now the San Francisco Plaza the chief market place of the city There is but little manufacturing industry in the interior of Ecuador but much more than on the coast The chief articles manufactured are straw hats shoes baskets carpets embroidery tape thread ponchos coarse woolen and cotton cloth saddles sandals soap sugar cigars aguardiente powder sweetmeats carved images paints and pottery Wines crockery glassware cutlery silks and fine cloth are imported There are three cotton mills in the country one in Chillo established by Senors Aguirre in eighteen forty two another in Otovalo built by Senor Parija in eighteen fifty nine and a third in Cuenca eighteen sixty one The machinery of the Chillo factory came from England that of Otovalo from Patterson N J The latter was utterly destroyed in the late great earthquake and the proprietor killed The cotton is inferior to that of New Orleans it is not fat as mechanics say the seeds yield only two per cent of oil But it is whiter than American cotton though coarse and can be used only for very ordinary fabrics The average length is five eighths of an inch One pod will produce on an average three pennyweights The mills of Chillo and Otovalo consume four hundred twenty five thousand pounds annually The first sugar mill was erected by the Aguirres in eighteen forty at Nanegal Illustration Indian Dwellings Quito is more than a century behind this age of steam and lightning To form an adequate idea of the mechanic and fine arts in that city of the kings we must transport ourselves to the Saxon period of European civilization Both the material and the construction of the houses would craze Sir Christopher Wren With fine quarries close at hand they must build with mud mixed with stones or plastered on wattles like the Druses of Mount Lebanon Living on the equatorial line and on the meridian so accurately measured by the highest mathematics of France and Spain Quitonians must needs leave out every right angle or straight line in the walls and every square beam and rafter Except on the grand road from Quito to Ambato commenced by President Moreno there is not a wheel barrow to be seen paving stones lime brick and dirt are usually carried on human backs Saint Crispin never had the fortitude to do penance in the shoes of Quito and the huge nails which enter into the hoofs of the quadrupedants remind one of the Cyclops There are not six carts in Quito If you wish to move you must coax a dozen Indians who care little for your money or your threats Horse hire peonage and most mechanical work must be paid for in advance Carriages antique vehicles of which there are two or three in the city are drawn by mules The first was introduced by Senor Aguirre so late as eighteen fifty nine and he was fined by the police for the privilege of riding in it Quitonians are not a traveling people and they are painfully ignorant of their own country The most enterprising merchant ignores every thing but Quito and the road to Guayaquil We can not praise the musical talent of Spanish Americans their intonation is too nasal while in their jumpings and chirpings they take after the grasshopper A resident Englishman who has traveled in many countries and sings the songs of nearly every nation told us he could not remember one of Ecuador Pianos they have brought over the mountains at great expense but they are more at home with the guitar The embroidery and lace wood carving and portrait painting of Quito are commendable but the grandeur of the Andes like the beauty of the Alps was never sketched by a native Ecuador boasts of one University and eleven colleges yet the people are not educated Literature science philosophy law medicine are only names Nearly all young gentlemen are doctors of something but their education is strangely dwarfed defective and distorted and their knowledge such as they have is without power as it is without practice The University of Quito has two hundred and eighty five students of whom thirty five are pursuing law and eighteen medicine There are eleven professors They receive no fees from the students but an annual salary of three hundred dollars The library contains eleven thousand volumes nearly all old Latin Spanish and French works The cabinet is a bushel of stones cast into one corner of a lumber room covered with dust and crying out in vain for a man in the University to name them The College of Tacunga has forty five students a fine chemical and philosophical apparatus but no one to handle it and a set of rocks from Europe but only a handful from Ecuador The College of Riobamba has four professors and one hundred and twenty students In the common schools the pupils study in concert aloud Arab fashion There are four papers in the republic two in Guayaquil one in Cuenca and one in Quito El Nacional of the capital is an official organ not a newspaper it contains fourteen duodecimo pages and is published occasionally by the Minister of the Interior Like the Gazeta of Madrid it is one of the greatest satires ever deliberately published by any people on itself There is likewise but one paper in Cuzco El Triumfo del Pueblo The amusements of Quito are few and not very amusing Indo Castilian blood runs too slowly for merry making There are no operas or concerts no theatres or lectures no museums or menageries For dramas they have revolutions for menageries bull baitings A bull bait is not a bull fight There is no coliseum or amphitheatre no matador gives the scientific death wound Unlike their fraternity in the ring of Seville where they are doomed to die the animals are only doomed to be pothered they are scotched not killed They are teased and tormented by yelling crowds barking dogs brass bands red ponchos tail pulling fire crackers wooden lances and such like The Plaza de Toros is the Plaza de San Francisco This sport is reserved for the most notable days in the calendar Christmas New Year s Inauguration day and Independence day the tenth of August Cock fights come next in popularity and are bona fide fights Often the roosters are so heroic that both leave their blood in the arena and never crow again Little knives are fastened to the natural spurs with which the fowls cut each other up frightfully The interesting scene takes place on Sundays and Thursdays near the Church of Santa Catalina and is regulated by a municipal tribunal The admission fee of five cents and the tax of two per cent on bets yield the city a monthly revenue of one hundred dollars Other pastimes are carnivals and masquerades Carnival is observed by pelting one another with eggs and sprinkling with water Whoever invented this prelude to Lent should be canonized Masquerades occur during the holidays when all classes in disguise or fancy dress get up a little fun at each other s expense The monotony of social life is more frequently disturbed by fashionable funerals than by these amusements and as the principal families are inter related the rules of condolence keep the best part of society in mourning and the best pianos and guitars silent for at least six months in the year A word about the ladies of Quito We concur in the remark of our minister mister Hassaurek that their natural dignity gracefulness and politeness their entire self possession their elegant but unaffected bearing and the choiceness of their language would enable them to make a creditable appearance in any foreign drawing room Their natural talents are of a high order but we must add that the senoras are uneducated and are incapable of either great vices or great virtues Their minds like the soil of their native country are fertile but uncultivated and their hearts like the climate are of a mean temperature Prayer books and French novels imported as wanted for there is not a book store in the city are the alpha and the omega of their literature Paris is considered the centre of civilization They are comely but not beautiful Venus has given her girdle of fascination to few Sensible of this they paint Holinski gives his impressions by contrasting the fair Quitonians with the fairer Guayaquilians Les yeux vifs et ardent le pied fine et mignon les teintes chaudes et dorees distinguish the latter In the ladies of the high capital there is nothing of this Les yeux ne lancent pas de flammes le pied est sans gentillesse l epiderme ne reflete pas les rayons du soleil The ladies on the coast take all possible pains to preserve the small size of the foot a large foot is held in horror Von Tschudi once overheard some ladies extolling in high terms the beauty of an English lady all their praise however ending with this exclamation But what a foot Good heavens it is like a great boat Gibbon is continually talking of beautiful senoras and senoritas on the Andes surely the lieutenant is in sport twenty eight Footnote twenty eight The young ladies of Cuzco are in general very beautiful with regular features fresh olive complexions bright eyes full of intelligence furnished with long lashes and masses of black hair plaited in two tails Markham The ladies of Quito give few entertainments for lack of ready money They spend much of their time in needle work and gossip sitting like Turkish sultanas on divans or the floor They do not rise at your entrance or departure They converse in a very loud unmusical voice We never detected bashfulness in the street or parlor They go to mass every morning and make visits of etiquette on Sundays They take more interest in political than in domestic affairs Dust and cobwebs are unmistakable signs of indifference Brooms are rarities such as exist are besoms made of split stick Since our return we have sent to a Quitonian gentleman by request a package of broom corn seed which we trust will be the forerunner of a harvest of brooms and cleaner floors in the high city Not only the lords but also the ladies are inveterate smokers Little mats are used for spittoons Illustration Washerwomen Perhaps Quitonian ladies have too many Indian servants about them to keep tidy seven or eight is the average number for a family These are married and occupy the ground floor which swarms with nude children They are cheap thievish lazy and filthy No class pure blood or half breed is given to ablution though there are two public baths in the city Washerwomen repair to the Machangara where they beat the dirty linen of Quito over the smooth rocks We remember but two or three table cloths which entirely covered the table and only one which was clean There are but two daily meals one does not feel the need of more they are partaken at nine and three or an hour earlier than in Guayaquil When two unwashed uncombed cooks bend over a charcoal fire which is fanned by a third unkempt individual and all three blinded by smoke for there is no chimney so that it is not their fault if capillaries and something worse are mingled with the stew with onions to right of them onions to left of them onions in front of them and achote already in the pot in spite of your repeated anathemas and expostulations achote the same red coloring matter which the wild Indians use for painting their bodies and dyeing their cloth and with several aboriginal wee ones romping about the kitchen keen must be the appetite that will take hold with alacrity as the dishes are brought on by the most slovenly waiter imagination can body forth twenty nine The aim of Ecuadorian cookery is to eradicate all natural flavor you wouldn t know you were eating chicken except by the bones Even coffee and chocolate somehow lose their fine Guayaquilian aroma in this high altitude and the very pies are stuffed with onions But the beef minus the garlic is most excellent and the dulce unapproachable Footnote twenty nine We noticed at Riobamba a custom which formerly prevailed also at Quito As soon as the guests have finished and before they have risen the Indian waiter kneels devoutly down beside the table and offers thanks in a very solemn touching tone CHAPTER V Ecuador Extent Government Religion A Protestant Cemetery in Quito Climate Regularity of Tropical Nature Diseases on the Highlands The republic of Ecuador looks like a wedge driven into the continent between the Maranon and the Putumayo It has twelve hundred miles of Pacific coast and an area of about two hundred thousand square miles including the Galapagos Islands Peru however claims the oriental half drawing her northern boundary from Tumbez through Canelos and Archidona and she is entitled to much of it for she has established a regular line of steamers on the Maranon while the Quito government has not developed an acre east of the Andes Ecuador is hung between and upon two cordilleras which naturally divide it into three parts the western slope the Quitonian valley and the Napo region The fluvial system is mainly made up of the Napo Pastassa and Santiago tributaries of the Maranon and the Mira Esmeraldas and Guayaquil flowing westward into the Pacific There are no lakes proper but the natives enumerate fifty five lagunes the largest of which Capucuy is not over five miles long Villavicencio tells the world that his country has a total population of one million three hundred eight thousand forty two But doctor Jameson believes it does not exceed seven hundred thousand The government is based on the Constitution of eighteen forty five amended in eighteen fifty three The president is chosen by a plurality of votes holds his office for four years and has a salary of twelve thousand dollars He can not be re elected thirty nor can he exercise his functions more than twenty five miles from the capital But the law is often set aside by those in power During the administration of Garcia Moreno prominent citizens were shot or banished by his order without trial by jury To every plea for mercy the stern president replied that as he could not save the country according to the Constitution he should govern it according to his own views of public necessity Footnote thirty Since this was written Garcia Moreno has been re elected to the presidency and the Constitution revised Congress assembles on the fifteenth of September every other year and consists of eighteen senators and thirty representatives The chambers are small and literally barren of ornament The members sit in two rows facing each other have no desks and give an affirmative vote by a silent bow Politics has less to do with principles and parties than with personalities Often it has a financial aspect and the natural expression on learning of a revolution is Somebody is out of money The party in feathers its nest as fast as possible there is scarcely a public officer who is not open to bribery The party out plots a premature resurrection to power by the ladders of corruption slander and revolution thirty one Revolution has so rapidly followed revolution that history has ceased to count them and it may be said of them what Milton wrote of the wars of the Saxon Heptarchy that they are not more worthy of being recorded than the skirmishes of crows and kites The Grand Plaza the heart where all the great arteries of circulation meet and diverge is where the high tides of Quito affairs ebb and flow Footnote thirty one Government has more than once paid its debts by repudiation Congress lately voted to pay only seven per cent of the claims against the state which are dated prior to a certain year Among the sufferers is the venerable doctor Jameson a distinguished foreigner who has served this country faithfully for forty years first as assayer then as director of the mint and always by his scientific position The Supreme Court consists of five judges Criminal cases only are tried by jury and an attorney is not permitted to question a witness There are no penitentiaries second class criminals are made to work for the public while political offenders are banished to the banks of the Napo or to Peru Here as in no other country every man s house is his castle No search warrants are allowed a policeman can be shot dead on the threshold The person and property of a foreigner are safe and no native in the employ of a foreigner can be taken by the government for military purposes All except pure Indians can vote if over twenty one and can read and write A man s signature is without value if it lacks his flourish a custom of Spanish origin The permanent army consists of two regiments The soldiers are mostly half breeds and are generally followed by their wives They are poorly paid and as they are impressed into the service they carry out the principle by helping themselves wherever they go In marching they have a quicker step than Northern soldiers The chief expenditure of the republic is for the army about five hundred thousand dollars the next is for the payment of the national debt three hundred sixty thousand dollars The foreign debt is Lone million four hundred seventy thousand three hundred seventy four Ecuadorians claim a revenue of a million and a half of which one half is from the custom house and one fiftieth from the post office One would suppose that the people who breathe this high atmosphere and enjoy this delightful climate and are surrounded by all that is truly grand and beautiful would have some corresponding virtues But we find that Nature here as every where has mingled base and noble elements The lofty mountains bearing in their steadfastness the seal of their appointed symbol God s righteousness is like the great mountains look down upon one of the lowest and most corrupt forms of republican government on earth thirty two their snowy summits preach sermons on purity to Quitonian society but in vain and the great thoughts of God written all over the Andes are unable to lift this proud capital out of the mud and mire of mediaeval ignorance and superstition The established religion is the narrowest and most intolerant form of Romanism Mountains usually have a more elevating religious influence than monotonous plains The Olympian mythology of the Greek was far superior to the beastly worship on the banks of the Nile And yet at the very feet of glorious Chimborazo and Pichincha we see a nation bowing down to little images of the rudest sculpture with a devotion that reminds us of the Middle Ages Footnote thirty two Asking the late Chilian minister for his view of the rank of the different South American states he gave us this order Chile Brazil Argentine Republic Venezuela New Granada Central America Mexico Peru Bolivia Ecuador Illustration Ecclesiastics The belief is called La Fe or the only true one The oath of a Protestant is not regarded in courts of law One fourth of Quito is covered by convents and churches The convents alone number fifty seven and are very extensive sometimes spreading over eight or nine acres The Church revenue amounts to eight hundred thousand dollars There are more than four hundred priests monks and nuns in the capital The native ecclesiastics are notorious for their ignorance and immorality It is a very common thing says doctor Terry for a curate to have a whole flock of orphan nephews and nieces the children of an imaginary brother There is one ex president who has the reputation of tying a spur on the leg of a game cock better even than a curate The imported Jesuits are the most intelligent and influential clergy They control the universities and colleges and education generally Active and intellectual though not learned they have infused new life into the fat indolence of the Spanish system Men of this world rather than the next they have adopted a purely mundane policy abjured the gloomy cowl raised gorgeous temples and say He that cometh unto us shall in no wise lose heaven Their chief merit however is the discovery of the turkey and quinine The Protestant in Quito is annoyed by an everlasting jingling of bells and blowing of bugles night and day The latter are blown every third hour The bells are struck by boys not rung A bishop returning from a visit to London was asked if there were any good bells in England Very fine he replied but there is not a man there who knows how to ring them Foreign machinery is sprinkled with holy water to neutralize the inherent heresy but a miller for example will charge more for his flour after the baptism Lotteries are countenanced by both Church and State and in turn help support them we saw one grand scheme carried out on the cathedral terrace and defended by bayonets At half past nine in the morning all Quito is on its knees as the great bell of the cathedral announces the elevation of the Host The effect is astonishing Riders stop their horses foot passengers drop down on the pavement the cook lets go her dishes and the writer his pen the merchant lays aside his measure and the artisan his tool the half uttered oath carajo dies on the lips of the Cholo the arm of the cruel Zambo unmercifully beating his donkey is paralyzed and the smart repartee of the lively donna is cut short The solemn stillness lasts for a minute when the bell tolls again and all rise to work or play Holidays are frequent Processions led by a crucifix or wooden image are attractive sights in this dull city simply because little else is going on Occasionally a girl richly dressed to represent the humble mother of God is drawn about in a carriage and once a year the figures of the Virgin belonging to different churches are borne with much pomp to the Plaza where they bow to each other like automatons This is a bad country to live in and a worse one to die in said doctor Jameson But times have changed even in fossil Quito Through the efforts of our late minister honorable W T Coggeshall the bigoted government has at last consented to inclose a quarter of an acre outside the city for the subterranean burial of heretics The cemetery is on the edge of the beautiful plain of Inaquito and on the right of the road leading to Guapolo What a shame said a Quitonian lady of position that there should be a place to throw Protestant dogs On saint Nathaniel s day died Colonel Phineas Staunton Vice Chancellor of Ingham University New York An artist by profession and one of very high order Colonel Staunton joined our expedition to sketch the glories of the Andes but he fell a victim to the scourge of the lowlands one week after his arrival in Quito We buried him at noon day thirty three in the new cemetery wherein was never man laid and by the act consecrated the ground Peace to his ashes honor to his memory That eighth of September eighteen sixty seven was a new day in the annals of Quito On that day the imperial city beheld for the first time in three centuries the decent burial of a Protestant in a Protestant cemetery Somewhere mingled with the ashes of Pichincha is the dust of Atahuallpa who was buried in his beloved Quito at his own request after his murder in Caxamarca But dearer to us is that solitary grave the earth is yet fresh that covers the remains of one of nature s noblemen Footnote thirty three This was a new thing under the sun Quitonians bury at dead of night with lanterns dimly burning The dirges sung as the procession winds through the streets are extremely plaintive and are the most touching specimens of Ecuadorian music The corpse especially of a child is often carried in a chair in a sitting posture The wealthy class wall up their dead in niches on the side of Pichincha hypothetically till the resurrection but really for two years when unless an additional payment is made the bones are thrown into a common pit and the coffin burnt To prevent this a few who can afford it embalm the deceased One of the most distinguished citizens of Quito keeps his mummified father at his hacienda and annually dresses him up in a new suit of clothes Turn we now to a more delightful topic than the politics and religion of Quito The climate is perfect Fair Italy with her classic prestige and ready access will long be the land of promise to travelers expatriated in search of health But if ever the ancients had reached this Andean valley they would have located here the Elysian Fields or the seat of the blessed the happy and long lived of Anacreon thirty four No torrid heat enervates the inhabitant of this favored spot no icy breezes send him shivering to the fire Nobody is sun struck nobody s buds are nipped by the frost Stoves and chimneys starvation and epidemics are unknown It is never either spring summer or autumn but each day is a combination of all three The mean annual temperature of Quito is fifty eight deg eight the same as Madrid or as the month of May in Paris The average range in twenty four hours is about ten deg The coldest hour is six A M the warmest between two and three P M The extremes in a year are forty five deg and seventy deg those of Moscow are thirty eight deg and eighty nine deg It is a prevalent opinion that since the great earthquake of seventeen ninety seven the temperature has been lower It was suddenly reduced says the Encycl Metropolitana from sixty six deg or sixty eight deg to forty deg or forty five deg a manifest error The natives say that since the terremote of eighteen fifty nine the seasons have not commenced so regularly nor are they so well defined there are more rainy days in summer than before It remains to be seen whether the late convulsion has affected the climate Footnote thirty four In the mountain town of Caxamarca farther south there were living in seventeen ninety two seven persons aged one hundred fourteen one hundred seventeen one hundred twenty one one hundred thirty one one hundred thirty two one hundred forty one and one hundred forty seven One of them when he died left behind him eight hundred living descendants to mourn his loss We confess however that we saw very few old persons in Quito Foreigners outlive the natives because they live a more regular and temperate life The mean diurnal variation of the barometer is only eighty four So regular is the oscillation as likewise the variations of the magnetic needle that the hour may be known within fifteen minutes by the barometer or compass Such is the clock like order of Nature under the equator that even the rains the most irregular of all meteorological phenomena in temperate zones tell approximately the hour of the day The winds too have an orderly march the ebb and flow of an aerial ocean No wonder watch tinkers can not live where all the forces in nature keep time Nobody talks about the weather conversation begins with benedictions or compliments The greatest variations of the thermometer occur in autumn and the greatest quantity of rain falls in April thirty five While on the western side of the Andes south of the equator the dry season extends from June to January on the eastern side of the Cordillera the seasons are reversed the rain lasting from March to November The climate of the central valley is modified by this opposition of seasons on either side of it as also by the proximity of snowy peaks Nine such peaks stand around Quito within a circle of thirty miles The prevailing winds in summer are from the northeast in the winter the southwest predominate Footnote thirty five The mean annual fall of rain at Quito is seventy inches Charleston is forty five point nine inches New York is forty two point twenty three Albany is forty point ninety three Montreal is thirty six Madrid is ten There are only three small drug stores in the great city of Quito The serpent is used as the badge of apothecary art Physicians have no offices nor do they as a general rule call upon their patients When an invalid is not able to go to the doctor he is expected to die Yellow fever cholera and consumption are unknown while intermittent fevers dysentery and liver complaints so prevalent on the coast are uncommon The ordinary diseases are catarrhal affections and typhoid fever Cases of inflammation of the lungs are rare more coughing may be heard during a Sunday service in a New England meeting house than in six months in Quito The diseases to which the monks of saint Bernard are liable are pulmonary and the greater number become asthmatic Asthma is also common in Quito while phthisis increases as we descend to the sea Individuals are often seen with a handkerchief about the jaws or bits of plaster on the temples these are afflicted with headache or toothache resulting from a gratified passion for sweetmeats common to all ages and classes Digestive disorders are somewhat frequent contrary to the theory in Europe but they spring from improper food and sedentary habits The cuisine of the country does not tempt the stomach to repletion and the climate is decidedly peptic So the typhoid fever of Quito is due to filth poor diet and want of ventilation Corpulency especially among the men is astonishingly rare According to doctor Lombard mountain districts favor the development of diseases of the heart and contagious diseases are not arrested by the atmosphere of lofty regions This is true in Quito But while nervous diseases are rare in the inhabited highlands of Europe in Quito they are common Sleep is said to be more tranquil and refreshing and the circulation more regular at high altitudes but our experience does not sustain this Goitre is quite common among the mountains It is a sign of constitutional weakness for the children of goitred parents are usually deaf and dumb and the succeeding generation idiots Boussingault thinks it is owing to the lack of atmospheric air in the water but why is it nearly confined to the women In the southern provinces about Cuenca cutaneous affections are quite frequent In the highlands generally scrofulous diseases are more common than in the plains There are three hospitals for lepers one at Cuenca with two hundred patients one at Quito with one hundred and twelve patients and one at Ambato Near Riobamba is a community of dwarfs D Orbigny made a post mortem examination of some Indians from the highest regions and found the lungs of extraordinary dimensions the cells larger and more in number Hence the unnatural proportion of the trunk which is plainly out of harmony with the extremities The expanded chest of the mountaineers is evidently the result of larger inspirations to secure the requisite amount of oxygen which is much less in a given space at Quito than on the coast This is an instance observes Prichard of long continued habit and the result of external agencies modifying the structure of the body and with it the state of the most important functions of life We tried the experiment of burning a candle one hour at Guayaquil and another part of the same candle for the same period at Quito Temperature at Guayaquil eighty deg at Quito sixty two deg The loss at Guayaquil was one hundred forty grains at Quito one hundred fourteen or twenty six grains less at the elevation of nine thousand five hundred feet Acoustics will also illustrate the thinness of the air M Godin found seventeen forty five that a nine pounder could not be heard at the distance of one hundred twenty one thousand five hundred thirty seven feet and that an eight pounder at Paris at the distance of one hundred two thousand six hundred sixty four feet was louder than a nine pounder at Quito at the distance of sixty seven thousand two hundred forty feet According to doctor Archibald Smith the power of muscular exertion in a native of the coast is greatly increased by living at the height of ten thousand feet But it is also asserted by observing travelers that dogs and bulls lose their combativeness at twelve thousand feet and that hence there can never be a good bull fight or dog fight on the Sierras This is literally true the dogs seem to partake of the tameness of their masters Cats do not flourish at all in high altitudes and probably the lion transplanted from the low jungle to the table lands would lose much of his ferocity Still cock fights seem to prosper and the battle of Pichincha was fought on an elevation of nearly eleven thousand feet Bolivar and the Spaniards also fought like tigers on the high plain of Junin thirty six Footnote thirty six Gibbon states that the temperature of the blood of a young bull in Cuzco was one hundred deg air fifty seven deg At the base of the Andes a similar experiment resulted in one hundred one deg for the blood air seventy eight deg The lieutenant jocosely adds The Spaniards have forced the hog so high up on the Andes that he suffers every time he raises his bristles and dies out of place Puna has been attributed to the presence of arsenical vapor The sickness felt by some travelers at great elevations violent headache and disposition to vomit is called veta and the difficulty of breathing from the rarity of the air is termed puna Gerard complained of severe headache and depression of spirits at the height of fifteen thousand feet on the Himalayas doctor Barry in ascending Mont Blanc fifteen thousand seven hundred feet speaks of great thirst great dryness and constriction of skin loss of appetite difficult breathing tendency to syncope and utter indifference Baron Mueller in his ascent of Orizava seventeen thousand eight hundred feet found great difficulty in breathing and experienced the sensation of a red hot iron searing his lungs and agonizing pains in the chest followed by fainting fits and torrents of blood from his mouth Humboldt in scaling Chimborazo suffered from nausea akin to sea sickness and a flow of blood from the nose and lips while Herndon on the slope of Puy puy fifteen thousand seven hundred feet said he thought his heart would break from his breast with its violent agitation Though ascending the Andes to the height of sixteen thousand feet and running up the last few rods we experienced nothing of this except a temporary difficulty in respiration We were exhilarated rather than depressed The experience of Darwin on the Portillo ridge fourteen thousand feet was only a slight tightness across the head and chest There was some imagination even in this he adds for upon finding fossil shells on the highest ridge I entirely forgot the puna in my delight De Saussure says truly The strength is repaired as speedily as it has been exhausted Merely a cessation of movement for three or four minutes without even seating one s self seems to restore the strength so perfectly that on resuming progress one feels able to climb at a single stretch to the very peak of the mountain CHAPTER VI Astronomic Virtues of Quito Flora and Fauna of the Valley of Quito Primeval Inhabitants of the Andes Quichua Indians Quito with a position unparalleled for astronomical purposes has no observatory The largest telescope in the city is about five feet long but the astute professor of natural philosophy in the Jesuit College who has charge of it had not the most distant idea that an eclipse of the sun would occur on the twenty ninth of August and an eclipse of the moon fifteen days later In ancient days this holy city had within it the Pillar of the Sun which cast no shadow at noon and a temple was built for the god of light The title of the sovereign Inca was the Child of the Sun but there was very little knowledge of astronomy for being the national religion it was beyond the reach of scientific speculation The atmosphere of Quito is of transparent clearness Humboldt saw the poncho of a horseman with the naked eye at a horizontal distance of ninety thousand feet The sky is of a dark indigo color the azure is less blended with white because of the extreme dryness of the air The stars stand out with uncommon brilliancy and the dark openings between them the great German compared to tubes through which we look into the remotest depths of space It is true at Quito as Humboldt noticed at Cumana that the stars do not twinkle when they are more than fifteen degrees high the soft planetary light of the stars overhead is not mere rhetoric Living under the equatorial line Quitonians enjoy the peculiar privilege of beholding the stars of both hemispheres the guiding stars of Ursa Major as well as the Magellanic Clouds and Southern Cross not omitting that black spot near the latter the unappropriated region in the skies reserved by Manager Bingham for deposed American presidents The zodiacal light here appears in all its glory This strange phenomenon has long puzzled philosophers and they are still divided It is generally considered to be produced by a continuous zone of infinitesimal asteroids The majority place this zone beyond the orbit of the earth and concentric with the sun But reverend George Jones of Philadelphia who has spent several years in observing this light including eight months in Quito considers it geocentric and possibly situated between the earth and its satellite At New York only a short pyramidal light and this only at certain seasons is to be seen but here an arch twenty degrees wide and of considerable intensity shoots up to the zenith and mister Jones affirms that a complete arch is visible at midnight when the ecliptic is at right angles to the spectator s horizon We have not been so fortunate as to see it pass the zenith and Professor Barnard contends that it never does pass We may remark that the main part of the zodiacal light shifts to the south side of the celestial equator as we cross the line To us the most magnificent sight in the tropical heavens is the Milky Way especially near Sobieski s Shield where it is very luminous We observed that this starry tract divided at Greek a Centauri as Herschel says and not at Greek b as many maps and globes have it The brightest stars in the southern hemisphere follow the direction of a great circle passing through Greek e Orionis and Greek a Crucis Another thing which arrests the attention of the traveler is the comparatively well defined boundary line between day and night The twilight at Quito lasts only an hour and a half on the coast it is still shorter Nor is there any harvest moon the satellite rising with nearly equal intervals of forty eight minutes From the stars we step down to the floral kingdom on the Andes using as our ladder of descent the following sentence from Humboldt at the age of seventy five If I might be allowed to abandon myself to the recollections of my own distant travels I would instance among the most striking scenes of nature the calm sublimity of a tropical night when the stars not sparkling as in our Northern skies shed their soft and planetary light over the gently heaving ocean or I would recall the deep valleys of the Cordilleras where the tall and slender palms pierce the leafy veil around them and wave on high their feathery and arrow like branches Father Velasco praises Ecuador as the noblest portion of the New World Nature has doubtless gifted it with capabilities unsurpassed by those of any other country Situated on the equinoctial line and embracing within its limits some of the highest as well as lowest dry land on the globe it presents every grade of climate from the perpetual summer on the coast and in the Orient to the everlasting winter of the Andean summits while the high plateau between the Cordilleras enjoys an eternal spring The vegetable productions are consequently most varied and prolific Tropical temperate and arctic fruits and flowers are here found in profusion or could be successfully cultivated As the Ecuadorian sees all the constellations of the firmament so Nature surrounds him with representatives of every family of plants There are places where the eye may embrace an entire zone for it may look up to a barley field and potato patch and down to the sugar cane and pine apple Confining our attention to the Quito Valley we remark that the whole region from Pichincha to Chimborazo is as treeless as Palestine The densest forest is near Banos The most common tree is the Aliso Betula acuminata Walnut is the best timber There are no pines or oaks thirty seven The slopes of the mountains between twelve and fifteen thousand feet are clothed with a shrub peculiar to the high altitudes of the Andes called Chuquiragua This is a very valuable shrub the twigs are used for fuel and the yellow buds as a febrifuge The castor oil tree grows naturally by the road side sometimes to the height of twelve feet Footnote thirty seven On the Himalayas are oaks birches pines chestnuts maples junipers and willows no tree ferns bamboos or palms A very useful as well as the most ordinary plant in the valley is the American aloe or Century Plant thirty eight It is the largest of all herbs Not naturally social it imparts a melancholy character to the landscape as it rises solitary out of the arid plain Most of the roads are fenced with aloe hedges While the majority of tropical trees have naked stems with a crown of leaves on the top the aloe reverses this and looks like a great chandelier as its tall peduncle bearing greenish yellow flowers rises out of a graceful cluster of long thick fleshy leaves When cultivated the aloe flowers in much less time than a century but exhausted by the efflorescence it soon dies Nearly every part serves some purpose the broad leaves are used by the poorer class instead of paper in writing or for thatching their huts sirup flows out of the leaves when tapped and as they contain much alkali a soap which lathers with salt water as well as fresh is also manufactured from them the flowers make excellent pickles the flower stalk is used in building the pith of the stem is used by barbers for sharpening razors the fibres of the leaves and the roots are woven into sandals and sacks and the sharp spines are used as needles A species of yucca resembling the aloe but with more slender leaves and of a lighter green yields the hemp of Ecuador Footnote thirty eight The Agava Americana of botanists cabulla of Ecuadorians maguey of Venezuelans and metl of Mexicans It is an interesting fact brought to light by the researches of Carl Neuman that the Chinese in the fifth century passed over to America by way of the Aleutian Islands and penetrated as far south as Mexico which they called the land of fusung that being the celestial name of the aloe Terzozomoc the high priest of the ancient Mexicans gave aloe leaves inscribed with sacred characters to persons who had to journey among the volcanoes to protect them from injury The crack fruit of Quito and in fact of South America is the chirimoya thirty nine Its taste is a happy mixture of sweetness and acidity Hanke calls it a masterwork of Nature and Markham pronounces it a spiritualized strawberry It grows on a tree about fifteen feet high having a broad flat top and very fragrant flowers The ripe fruit often attaining in Peru the weight of sixteen pounds has a thick green skin and a snow white pulp containing about seventy black seeds Other pomological productions are alligator pears guavas guayavas granadillas cherries a small black variety peaches very poor pears equally bad plums quinces lemons oranges not native blackberries and strawberries large but flavorless forty The cultivation of the grape has just commenced Of vegetables there are onions in cookery the first and last and midst and without end beets carrots asparagus lettuce cabbages turnips tomatoes indigenous but inferior to ours potatoes also indigenous but much smaller than their descendants forty one red peppers peas always picked ripe while green ones are imported from France beans melons squashes and mushrooms The last are eaten to a limited extent Terra del Fuego says Darwin is the only country in the world where a cryptogamic plant affords a staple article of food Footnote thirty nine Bollaert derives the name from chiri cold and muhu seed Footnote forty doctor Jameson has found the following species of Rubus in the valley of Quito macrocarpus stipularis glabratus compactus glaucus rosaeflorus loxensis urticaefolius floribundus and nubigenus The common strawberry Fragaria vesca grows in the valley as also the Chilensis Footnote forty one Lieutenant Gilliss praises the potatoes of Peru but we saw no specimens in Ecuador worthy of note The Irish potato is a native of the Andes It was unknown to the early Mexicans It grows as far south on this continent as lat fifty deg The Spaniards carried the potato to Europe from Quito early in the sixteenth century From Spain it traveled to Italy Belgium and Germany Sir Walter Raleigh imported some from Virginia in fifteen eighty six and planted them on his estate near Cork Ireland It is raised in Asiatic countries only where Europeans have settled and for their consumption It is successfully grown in Australia and New Zealand where there is no native esculent farinaceous root Von Tschudi says there is no word in Quichua for potato It is called papa by the Napos The most important grains are barley red wheat and corn with short ears and elongated kernels of divers colors Near the coast three crops of corn a year are obtained at Quito it is of slower growth but fuller The sugar cane is grown sparingly in the valley but chiefly on the Pacific coast Its home is Polynesia Quito consumes about one hundred and fifty barrels of flour daily The best sells for four dollars a quintal The common fodder for cattle is alfalfa an imported lucerne There is no clover except a wild worthless three leaved species Trifolium amabile Nearly all in the above list are cultivated for home consumption only and many valuable fruits and vegetables which would grow well are unknown to Quitonians As Bates says of the Brazilians the incorrigible nonchalance and laziness of the people alone prevent them from surrounding themselves with all the luxuries of a temperate as well as tropical country It would be an endless task to speak of the flowers It must suffice to state that a Synopsis Plantarum AEquatoriensium the life work of the venerable Professor Jameson of the University of Quito has just been published by the tardy government Botanists will find in these two small volumes many new species unknown to American science and others more correctly described by one who has dwelt forty years among the Andes The last zone of vegetation nearest the snow line consists chiefly of yellow flowering Compositae In fact this family includes one fourth of the plants in the immediate vicinity of Quito The next most numerous family is the Labiatae and then follow Leguminosae and Gentians Although the Rosaceae is represented there is not one species of the genus Rosa not even in the whole southern hemisphere The magnificent Befaria found in the lower part of the valley is called the Rose of the Andes Fuchsias may be considered characteristic of South America since they are so numerous only one or two kinds occur in any other part of the world Flowers are found in Quito all the year round but the most favorable months are December and May Yellow is the predominating color The higher the altitude the brighter the hues of any given species Thus the Gentiana sedifolia is a small light blue flower in the lowlands but on the Assuay it has bright blue petals three times as large and sensitive This accords with Herschel s statement The chemical rays of the spectrum are powerfully absorbed in passing through the atmosphere and the effect of their greater abundance aloft is shown in the superior brilliancy of color in the flowers of Alpine regions America is plainly the continent of vegetation and wherever the vegetable element predominates the animal is subordinated We must not look therefore for a large amount or variety of animal life in the Ecuadorian forests Time was when colossal megatheroids mastodons and glyptodons browsed on the foliage of the Andes and the Amazon but now the terrestrial mammals of this tropical region are few and diminutive They are likewise old fashioned inferior in type as well as bulk to those of the eastern hemisphere for America was a finished continent long before Europe It seems most probable says Darwin that the North American elephants mastodons horse and hollow horned ruminants migrated on land since submerged near Behring s Straits from Siberia into North America and thence on land since submerged in the West Indies into South America where for a time they mingled with the forms characteristic of that southern continent and have since become extinct forty two The rise of the Mexican table land split up the New World into two well defined zoological provinces A few species as the puma peccari and opossum have crossed the barrier but South America is characterized by possessing a family of monkeys the llama tapir many peculiar rodents and several genera of edentates Footnote forty two Journal of Researches p one hundred thirty two The tapir the largest native quadruped is sometimes found on the mountains but never descends into the Quito Valley A link between the elephant and hog its true home is in the lowlands The tapir and peccari also found on the Andean slopes are the only indigenous pachyderms in South America while the llama forty three and deer both abounding in the valley are the only native ruminants there is not one native hollow horned ruminant on the continent The llama is the only native domesticated animal indeed South America never furnished any other animal serviceable to man the horse ox hog and sheep two four and six horned are importations Of these animals which rendered such important aid in the early civilization of Asia and Europe the genera even were unknown in South America four centuries ago and to day pure Indians with difficulty acquire a taste for beef mutton and pork The llama is still used as a beast of burden but it seldom carries a quintal more than twelve miles a day The black bear of the Andes ascends as high as Mont Blanc and is rarely found below three thousand five hundred feet The puma or maneless American lion has an immense range both in latitude and altitude being found from Oregon to the Straits of Magellan and nearly up to the limit of eternal snow It is as cowardly as the jaguar of the lowlands is ferocious It is a very silent animal uttering no cry even when wounded Its flesh which is very white and remarkably like veal in taste is eaten in Patagonia Squirrels hares bats a small species opossums and a large guinea pig Cuye del Monte are found in the neighborhood of Quito Footnote forty three The llama or mountain camel is a beautiful animal with long slender neck and fine legs a graceful carriage pointed ears soft restless eyes and quivering lips It has a gentle disposition but when angry it will spit and when hurt will shed tears We have seen specimens entirely white but it is generally dark brown with patches of white It requires very little food and drink Since the introduction of horses asses and mules the rearing of llamas has decreased They are more common in Peru The llama guanaco alpaca and vicuna were the four sheep of the Incas the first clothing the common people the second the nobles the third the royal governors the fourth the Incas The price of sheep s wool in Quito was formerly four cents a pound it is now twelve As only about sixty species of birds are common to North and South America the traveler from the United States recognizes few ornithic forms in the Valley of Quito Save the hummers beautiful plumage is rare as well as fine songsters But the moment we descend the Eastern Cordillera into the interior of the continent we find the feathered race in robes of richest colors The exact cause of this brilliant coloring in the tropics is still a problem It can not be owing to greater light and heat for the birds of the Galapagos Islands directly under the equator are dull forty four Footnote forty four mister Gould however holds that the difference of coloration is due to the different degrees of exposure to the sun s rays the brilliantly colored species being inhabitants of the edges of the forest Birds from Ucayali in the centre of the continent are far more splendid than those which represent them in countries nearer the sea owing to the clearer atmosphere inland But it is a fact at least exceptional to this theory that the Cock of the Rock Rupicola on the western side of the Andes Esmeraldas is of a richer deeper color than the same species on the eastern slope Napo In keeping with mister Gould s theory is the statement by mister Bates that the most gaudy butterflies the males flutter in the sunshine The males both of birds and butterflies are the most gaudily dressed In the highlands the most prominent birds are the condor and the humming bird These two extremes in size are found side by side on the summit of Pichincha The condor appears in its glory among the mountains of Quito Its ordinary haunt is at the height of Etna No other living creature can remove at pleasure to so great a distance from the earth and it seems to fly and respire as easily under the low barometric pressure of thirteen inches as at the sea shore It can dart in an instant from the dome of Chimborazo to the sultry coast of the Pacific It has not the kingly port of the eagle and is a cowardly robber a true vulture it prefers the relish of putrescence and the flavor of death It makes no nest but lays two eggs on a jutting ledge of some precipice and fiercely defends them The usual spread of wings is nine feet It does not live in pairs like the eagle but feeds in flocks like its loathsome relative the buzzard It is said to live forty days without food in captivity but at liberty it is very voracious The usual method of capture is to kill an old mare better than horse the natives say and allow the bird to gorge himself when he becomes so sluggish as to be easily lassoed It is such a heavy sleeper it is possible to take it from its roost The evidences in favor of and against its acute smelling powers are singularly balanced For reasons unknown the condor does not range north of Darien though it extends its empire through clouds and storms to the Straits of Magellan In the Inca language it was called cuntur and was anciently an object of worship The condor gallinazo turkey buzzard and caracara eagle says Darwin in their habits well supply the place of our carrion crows magpies and ravens a tribe of birds widely distributed over the rest of the world but entirely absent in South America The condor appears on the gold coins of New Granada and Chile Of Trochilidae there are hosts The valley swarms with these winged jewels of varied hues from the emerald green of Pichincha to the white of Chimborazo They build long purse like nests by weaving together fine vegetable fibres and lichens and thickly lining them with silk cotton In this delicate cradle suspended from a branch the female lays two eggs which are hatched in about twelve days The eggs are invariably white with one exception those of a species on the Upper Amazon which are spotted The young have much shorter bills than their parents The humming bird is exclusively American the nearest form in the Old World is the nectarinia or sunbird Other birds most commonly seen in the valley are Cyanocitta turcosa Jay Poecilothraupis atrierissa Pheuticus chrysogaster Chlorospingus superciliaris Buthraupis chloronata Tanagra Darwini Dubusia selysia Buarremon latinuchus and B assimilis The only geese in the valley are a few imported from Europe by Senor Aguirre of Chillo and these refuse to propagate Reptiles are so rare in the highlands the class can hardly be said to be represented During a residence of nearly three months in the Quito Valley we saw but one snake forty five Nevertheless we find the following sentence in such a respectable book as Bohn s Hand book of Modern Geography The inhabitants of Quito are dreadfully tormented by reptiles which it is scarcely possible to keep out of the beds Of frogs there are not enough to get up a choir and of fishes there is but one solitary species about a finger long forty six The entomology of Quito is also brief much to the satisfaction of travelers from the insectiferous coast Musquitoes and bedbugs do not seem to enjoy life at such an altitude and jiggers forty seven and flies are rare Fleas however have the hardihood to exist and bite in the summer months and if you attend an Indian fair you will be likely to feel something gently o er you creeping But fleas and lice are the only blood thirsty animals so that the great Valley of Quito is an almost painless paradise Of beetles and butterflies there are a few species the latter belonging for the most part to the familiar North American genera Pyrameis and Colias At Vinces on the coast we found the pretty brown butterfly Anartia Jatrophae which ranges from Texas to Brazil A light colored coleopter is eaten roasted by the inhabitants The cochineal is raised in the southern part of the valley particularly in Guananda at the foot of Tunguragua where the small flat leaved cactus Opuntia tuna on which the insect feeds is extensively cultivated The male is winged but the female is stationary fixed to the cactus and is of a dark brown color It takes seventy thousand to make a pound which is sold in the valley for from sixty cents to three dollars The best cochineal comes from Teneriffe where it was introduced from Honduras in eighteen thirty five The silk worm is destined to work a revolution in the finances of Ecuador Quito silk gained a gold medal at the Paris Exhibition No bees are hived in the republic the people seem to be content with treacle The Italian species would undoubtedly thrive here The bees of Ecuador like all the bees of the New World are inferior to those of the Old World Their cells are not perfectly hexagonal and their stings are undeveloped They are seldom seen feeding on flowers Mollusca in the Quito Valley are not great in number or variety They belong principally to the genera Bulimus Cyclostoma and Helix The first is as characteristic of the Southern Continent as Helix of the North and Achatina of Africa Footnote forty five Herpetodryas carinatus which we observed also at Guayaquil and on the Maranon We procured two or three species from the natives and several new forms from Pallatanga on the west slope Footnote forty six Antelopus laevis at Ambato and A longirostris a new species from Antisana Hacienda were the only frogs noticed The little fish is Pimelodes cyclopum prenadilla of the Spaniards imba of the Indians the same that was thrown out in the eruptions of Imbabura and Caraguairazo Footnote forty seven The jigger chigoe or nigua Pulex penetrans of science is a microscopic flea that buries itself under the skin and lays a myriad eggs the result is a painful tumor Jiggers are almost confined to sandy places From the animal creation we mount by a short step to the imbruted Indian When and by whom the Andes were first peopled is a period of darkness that lies beyond the domain of history But geology and archaeology are combining to prove that Sorata and Chimborazo have looked down upon a civilization far more ancient than that of the Incas and perhaps coeval with the flint flakes of Cornwall and the shell mounds of Denmark On the shores of Lake Titicaca are extensive ruins which antedate the advent of Manco Capac and may be as venerable as the lake dwellings of Geneva Wilson has traced six terraces in going up from the sea through the province of Esmeraldas toward Quito and underneath the living forest which is older than the Spanish invasion many gold copper and stone vestiges of a lost population were found In all cases these relics are situated below high tide mark in a bed of marine sediment from which he infers that this part of the country formerly stood higher above the sea If this be true vast must be the antiquity of these remains for the upheaval and subsidence of the coast is exceedingly slow Philology can aid us little in determining the relations of the primeval Quitonians for their language is nearly obscured by changes introduced by the Caras and afterward by the Incas who decreed that the Quichua the language of elegance and fashion three hundred years ago should be the universal tongue throughout the empire forty eight Quichua is to day spoken from the equator to twenty eight deg S except by the Aymara people or by nearly a million and a half We found it used corrupted however by Spanish at the month of the Napo There are five dialects of which the purest is spoken in Cuzco and the most impure in Quito The Indians of the northern valley are descendants of the ancient Quitus modified by Cara and Peruvian blood They have changed little since the invasion of Pizarro They remember their glory under the Incas and when they steal any thing from a white man they say they are not guilty of theft as they are only taking what originally belonged to them Some see in their sacred care of Incarial relics a lingering hope to regain their political life We noticed that the pure mountaineers without a trace of Spanish adulteration wore a black poncho underneath and we were informed by one well acquainted with their customs that this was in mourning for the Inca We attended an Indian masquerade dance at Machachi which seemed to have an historical meaning It was performed in full view of that romantic mountain which bears the name of the last captain of Atahuallpa There is a tradition that after the death of his chief Ruminagui burned the capital and retiring with his followers to this cordillera threw himself from the precipice The masquerade at Machachi was evidently intended to keep alive the memory of the Incas Three Indians fantastically adorned with embroidered garments plumed head dresses and gold and silver tinsel representing Atahuallpa and his generals danced to music of the rudest kind one individual pounding on a drum and blowing on a pipe at the same time Before them went three clowns or diablos with masks fit caricatures of the Spaniards Like all other Indian feasts this ended in getting gradually and completely drunk During the ceremony a troop of horsemen gayly dressed and headed by one in regimentals with a cocked hat galloped twice around the Plaza throwing oranges at the people after which there was a bull bait Footnote forty eight History says Prescott furnishes few examples of more absolute authority than such a revolution in the language of an empire at the bidding of a master The pronunciation of Quichua requires a harsh explosive utterance Gibbon says the sound of it to him resembled Welsh or Irish that of Aymara English The letters b d f g and o are wanting in the ancient tongue of Quito p was afterward changed to b t to d v to f c to g and u to o thus Chim pu razu is now Chimborazo A few words bear a striking analogy to corresponding Sanscrit words as Ynti the Inca for sun and Indra the Hindoo god of the heavens The features of the Quichuans have a peculiar cast which resembles in D Orbigny s opinion no other American but the Mexican and some ethnologists trace a striking similarity to the natives of Van Diemen s Land They have an oblong head longitudinally somewhat compressed at the sides and occiput short and very slightly arched forehead prominent long aquiline nose with large nostrils large mouth but not thick lips beautiful enduring teeth short chin but not receding cheek bones not prominent eyes horizontal and never large eyebrows long thick straight coarse yet soft jet black hair little or no beard a long broad deep highly arched chest small hands and feet short stature seldom reaching five feet and the women still shorter a mulatto color olive brown says D Orbigny bronze says Humboldt and a sad serious expression Their broad chests and square shoulders remind one of the gorilla but we find that unlike the anthropoid ape they have very weak arms their strength lies in their backs and legs They have shrewdness and penetration but lack independence and force We never heard one sing forty nine Always submissive to your face taking off his hat as he passes and muttering Blessed be the altar of God he is nevertheless very slow to perform Soured by long ill treatment he will hardly do any thing unless he is compelled And he will do nothing well unless he is treated as a slave Treat him kindly and you make him a thief whip him and he will rise up to thank you and he your humble servant A certain curate could never trust his Indian to carry important letters until he had given him twenty five lashes Servile and timid superstitious and indolent the Quichuans have not half the spirit of our North American Indians It has passed into a proverb that the Indian lives without shame eats without repugnance and dies without fear Abject as they are however they are not wholly without wit By a secret telegraph system they will communicate between Quito and Riobamba in one hour When there was a battle in Pasto the Indians of Riobamba knew of it two hours after though eighty leagues distant Footnote forty nine Their favorite musical instrument is the rondador a number of reeds of different lengths tied in a row The plaintive national songs which Markham heard at Cuzco are not sung in Ecuador The civilization of South America three centuries ago was nearly confined to this Andean family though they had attained only to the bronze period In the milder character of their ancient religion and gentleness of disposition they are strongly distinguished from the nations that encircled the vale of Anahuac the centre of civilization on the northern continent But little of this former glory is now apparent The Incas reached an astronomical knowledge which astonished the Spaniards but the Quichuans of to day count vaguely by moons and rains Great is the contrast between the architecture of this century and that in the days of Huayna Capac There are few Incarial relics however in the Valley of Quito for the Incas ruled there only half a century The chief monuments are the tolas or mounds mostly at Cuenca containing earthen vessels and bronze hatchets and earrings the Inga pirrca or oval fortress and the Intihuaicu or temple of the sun near Canar the Inga chungana a massive stone resembling a sofa where the Inca reposed to enjoy the delightful prospect over the Valley of Gulan and remnants of causeways and roads CHAPTER VII Geological History of South America Rise of the Andes Creation of the Amazon Characteristic Features of the Continent Andean Chain The Equatorial Volcanoes Three cycles ago an island rose from the sea where now expands the vast continent of South America It was the culminating point of the highlands of Guiana For ages this granite peak was the solo representative of dry land in our hemisphere south of the Canada hills In process of time a cluster of islands rose above the thermal waters They were the small beginnings of the future mountains of Brazil holding in their laps the diamonds which now sparkle in the crown of Dom Pedro II Long protracted eons elapsed without adding a page to the geology of South America The Creator seems to have been busy elsewhere Decorating the north with the gorgeous flora of the carboniferous period till in the language of Hugh Miller to distant planets our earth must have shone with a green and delicate ray he rubbed the picture out and ushered in the hideous reptilian age when monstrous saurians footed paddled and winged were the lords of this lower world All the great mountain chains were at this time slumbering beneath the ocean The city of New York was sure of its site but huge dinotheria wallowed in the mire where now stand the palaces of Paris London and Vienna At length the morning breaks upon the last day of creation and the fiat goes forth that the proud waves of the Pacific which have so long washed the table lands of Guiana and Brazil shall be stayed Far away toward the setting sun the white surf beats in long lines of foam against a low winding archipelago the western outline of the coming continent Fierce is the fight for the mastery between sea and land between the denuding power of the waves and the volcanic forces underneath But slowly very slowly yet surely rises the long chain of islands by a double process the submarine crust of the earth is cooling and the rocks are folded up as it shrivels while the molten material within pressed out through the crevices overflows and helps to build up the sea defiant wall A man s life would be too short to count even the centuries consumed in this operation The coast of Peru has risen eighty feet since it felt the tread of Pizarro supposing the Andes to have risen at this rate uniformly and without interruption seventy thousand years must have elapsed before they reached their present altitude But when we consider that in fact it was an intermittent movement alternate upheaval and subsidence we must add an unknown number of millennia Three times the Andes sank hundreds of feet beneath the ocean level and again were slowly brought up to their present height The suns of uncounted ages have risen and set upon these sculptured forms though geologically recent casting the same line of shadows century after century A long succession of brute races roamed over the mountains and plains of South America and died out ages ere man was created In those pre Adamite times long before the Incas ruled the mastodon and megatherium the horse and the tapir dwelt in the high valley of Quito yet all these passed away before the arrival of the aborigines the wild horses now feeding on the pampas of Buenos Ayres were imported from Europe three hundred and thirty three years ago fifty Footnote fifty At Paita the most western point of South America there is a raised beach three hundred feet high The basal slate and sandstone rocks dipping S of E are covered by conglomerate sand and a gypseous formation containing shells of living species Additional to those described by D Orbigny we found here Cerithium laeviuscula Ostrea gallus and Ampullina Ortoni as determined by W M Gabb esquire of Philadelphia Darwin found shells in Chile thirteen hundred feet above the sea covered with marine mud President Loomis of Lewisburg University Pa informs the writer that in eighteen fifty three after nearly a day s ride from Iquique he came to a former sea beach It furnished abundant specimens of Patellae and other shells still perfect and identical with others that I had that morning obtained at Iquique with the living animal inhabiting them This beach is elevated twenty five hundred feet above the Pacific The same observer says that near Potosi there is one uninterrupted mass of lava having a columnar structure not less than one hundred miles in length fifty miles wide and eight hundred feet thick It overlies a bed of saliferous sandstone which has been worked for salt Fifty feet within a mine and in the undisturbed rock which forms its roof the doctor found fragments of dicotyledonous trees with the bark on undecomposed uncharred and fibrous And now the Andes fifty one stand complete in their present gigantic proportions one of the grandest and most symmetrical mountain chains in the world Starting from the Land of Fire it stretches northward and mounts upward until it enters the Isthmus of Panama where it bows gracefully to either ocean but soon resumes under another name its former majesty and loses its magnificence only where the trappers chase the fur bearing animals over the Arctic plains Nowhere else does Nature present such a continuous and lofty chain of mountains unbroken for eight thousand miles save where it is rent asunder by the Magellanic Straits and proudly tossing up a thousand pinnacles into the region of eternal snow Nowhere in the Old World do we see a single well defined mountain chain only a broad belt of mountainous country traversing the heart of the continent Footnote fifty one The name Andes is often derived from anta an old Peruvian word signifying metal But Humboldt says There are no means of interpreting it by connecting it with any signification or idea if such connection exist it is buried in the obscurity of the past According to colonel Tod the northern Hindoos apply the name Andes to the Himalayan Mountains The moment the Andes arose the great continental valley of the Amazon was sketched out and moulded in its lap The tidal waves of the Atlantic were dashing against the Cordilleras and a legion of rivulets were busily plowing up the sides into deep ravines the sediment produced by this incessant wear and tear was carried eastward and spread out stratum by stratum till the shallow sea between the Andes and the islands of Guiana and Brazil was filled up with sand and clay Huge glaciers thinks Agassiz afterward descending moved over the inclined plane and ground the loose rock to powder fifty two Eddies and currents throwing up sand banks as they do now gradually defined the limits of the tributary streams and directed them into one main trunk which worked for itself a wide deep bed capable of containing its accumulated flood Then and thus was created the Amazon Footnote fifty two On this point see Chapter XVII In South America Nature has framed her works on a gigantic scale Where else combined do we see such a series of towering mountains such a volume of river water and such wide spreading plains We have no proper conception of Andine grandeur till we learn that the top of the tallest mountain in North America is nearly a mile beneath the untrodden dome of Chimborazo nor any just view of the vast dimensions of the Amazonian Valley till we find that all the United States could be packed in it without touching its boundaries nor any adequate idea of the Amazon itself till we ascertain that it drains a million square miles more than the Mississippi South America is a triangular continent with its axis the Andes not central as in Europe but lying on its extreme western edge and in harmony with the well known law that the highest mountains and the grandest volcanoes face the broadest ocean The highlands of Brazil and Guiana have neither volcanic nor snow clad peaks fifty three Like all the dry land which first appeared these primitive mountains on the Atlantic border trend east and west The result of this position is a triple river system the Orinoco Amazon and La Plata draining three immense plains the llanos of Venezuela the sylvas of Brazil and the pampas of the Argentine Republic The continuity and extent of these vast depressions are more remarkable even than the height and length of the mountain chains fifty four Footnote fifty three The interior plateau of Brazil says doctor Lund is composed of horizontal strata of the transition period which are nowhere covered with the secondary or tertiary formations The highest point in Brazil is five thousand seven hundred fifty five feet Darwin speaks of some ancient submarine volcanic rocks in the province of La Plata worth mentioning from their rarity on this eastern side of the continent With the exception of the coast of Venezuela the eastern system is little exposed to earthquakes Footnote fifty four These three plains constitute four fifths of all South America east of the Andes The west slope of the Ecuadorian Andes is about two hundred seventy five feet per mile on the east it is one hundred twenty five feet Such are the characteristic features of South America they are not repeated in any other continent fifty five Not one feature could be changed without destroying those peculiarities of soil and climate which so remarkably distinguish South America Its position on the equator places it in the path of the vapory trade winds which continually sweep over it westward till they strike the Andes which like a great condenser roll a thousand streams eastward again to feed the mighty Amazon So effectual is that barrier not a drop of moisture passes it and the trade wind is not felt again on the Pacific till you are one hundred and fifty miles from the coast Were the Andes on the Atlantic side South America would be turned into a vast Sahara As it is the interest which attaches to this continent save a few relics of the Incas is exclusively that of pure nature Nowhere does Nature affect us more deeply with the feeling of her grandeur nowhere does she exhibit wilder freaks or more startling contrasts nowhere do we find such a theatre for the free development of vegetable and animal life Footnote fifty five There is however a striking coincidence between the mountain and river systems of the northern and southern continents of this hemisphere Thus The Andes represent the Rocky Mountains Highland of Guiana represent the Canadian Mountains Brazil Appalachian Amazon Saskatchewan La Plata Mississippi Orinoco Mackenzie The long and lofty chain of the Andes is certainly one of the grandest results of the plications and uplifts of the earth s crust While the waves of the Pacific from Panama to Patagonia submissively kiss the feet of the Andes and the showers that swell the Amazon fall within sight of the mariner on that peaceful ocean the Rocky Mountains are situated five hundred miles from the sea The space west of the Andes does not contain twenty thousand square leagues while the country east of it equals four hundred twenty four thousand six hundred While the compact Andes have an average width of only sixty miles fifty six the straggling mountain system beyond the Mississippi has the breadth of the Empire State but the mean elevation of the latter would scarcely reach the bottom of the Quito Valley The mountains of Asia may surpass the Cordilleras in height but situated beyond the tropics and destitute of volcanoes they do not present that inexhaustible variety of phenomena which characterizes the latter The outbursts of porphyry and trachytic domes so characteristic of the high crests of the Cordilleras impart a physiognomy quite distinct from that presented by the mountains of Europe The Andes offer in the least space the greatest possible variety of impressions fifty seven There is near Huanca Peru a coal bed lifted up to the enormous height of fourteen thousand seven hundred feet and on the side of Chimborazo there is a salt spring thirteen thousand feet above the sea Marine shells have not been found in Europe above the summit of the Pyrenees or eleven thousand seven hundred feet but the Andes can show some a thousand feet higher A strange sight to see shells once crawling on the bottom of the ocean now resting at an elevation twice the height of Mount Washington Footnote fifty six The width of the chain south of the equator varies with that of the continent Footnote fifty seven No mountains which I have seen in Hungary Saxony or the Pyrenees are as irregular as the Andes or broken into such alternate substances manifesting such prodigious revolutions of nature Helms More sublime than the Alps by their ensemble the Andes lack those curious and charming details of which Nature has been so lavish in the old continent Holinski Beneath the Southern Cross out of a sea perpetually swept by fearful gales rise the rocky hills of Terra del Fuego It is the starting point of that granite chain which winds around the earth in a majestic curve first northwesterly to the Arctic Sea thence by the Aleutian and Japanese Isles to Asia crossing the Old World southwesterly from China to South Africa Skirting the bleak shores of Patagonia in a single narrow sierra the Andes enter Chile rising higher and higher till they culminate in the gigantic porphyritic peak of Aconcagua At the boundary line of Bolivia the chain which has so far followed a precise meridional direction turns to the northwest and at the same time separates into two Cordilleras inclosing the great table land of Desaguadero This wonderful valley the Thibet of the New World has four times the area of New York State and five times the elevation of the Catskill Mountain House At one end of the valley perched above the clouds is silvery Potosi the highest city in the world at the other stands the once golden capital of Cuzco Between them is Lake Titicaca fifty eight probably an ancient crater within which is an island celebrated as the cradle of the strange empire of Peru which though crushed by Pizarro in its budding civilization ranks as the most extraordinary and extensive empire in the annals of American history The Cordillera of which Sahama Sorata and Illimani are the pinnacles so completely inclose this high valley that not a drop of water can escape except by evaporation At the silver mines of Pasco the Andes throw off a third cordillera and with this triple arrangement and a lower altitude enter the republic of Ecuador There they resume the double line and surpass their former magnificence Twenty volcanoes presided over by the princely Chimborazo and Cotopaxi rise out of a sublime congregation of mountains surrounding the famous valley of Quito In New Granada there is a final and unique display of Andine grandeur the Cordilleras combine just above the equator into one dizzy ridge and then spread out like a fan or rather like the graceful branches of the palm One sierra bends to the east holding in its lap the city of Bogota and rolling off a thousand streams to swell the Orinoco terminates in the beautiful mountains of Caracas the central range culminates in the volcanic Tolima fifty nine but is soon lost in the Caribbean Sea the western chain turns to the left humbling itself as it threads the narrow isthmus and expands into the level table land of Mexico You may cross Mexico from ocean to ocean in a carriage but no wheeled vehicle ever crossed South America Footnote fifty eight This lake is the largest fresh water accumulation in South America It has diminished within the historic period Its surface is twelve thousand seven hundred ninety five feet above the Pacific or higher than the highest peaks of the Pyrenees Footnote fifty nine This is the loftiest summit of the Andes in the northern hemisphere being eighteen thousand two hundred feet It is also remarkable for being situated farther from the sea one hundred twenty miles than any other active volcano Illustration Profiles of Ecuadorian Volcanoes ten thousand fort Chimborazo ten thousand fort Cotopaxi ten thousand fort Caraguairazo ten thousand fort Pichincha We will now speak more particularly of the Andes of the equator The mountain chain is built up of granite gneissoid and schistose rocks often in vertical position and capped with trachyte and porphyry sixty Large masses of solid rock are rarely seen every thing is cracked calcined or triturated While in Bolivia the Eastern Cordillera shows a succession of sharp ragged peaks in contrast with the conical summits of the Cordillera of the coast there is no such distinction in the Andes of the equator sixty one The Eastern Cordillera has a greater mean height and it displays more volcanic activity Twenty volcanic mountains surround the valley of which twelve are in the oriental chain Three of the twenty are now active Cotopaxi Sangai and Pichincha and five others are known to have erupted since the Conquest Chiles Imbabura Guamani Tunguragua and Quirotoa The truncated cone of Cotopaxi the jagged Alpine crest of ruined Altar and the dome of Chimborazo are the representative forms of the volcanic summits The extinct volcanoes usually have double domes or peaks while the active peaks are slender cones Antisana and Cayambi are fashioned after Chimborazo though the latter is table topped rather than convex Caraguairazo Quirotoa Iliniza Sincholagua Ruminagui and Corazon resemble Altar Tunguragua Sangai Llanganati Cotocachi Chiles and Imbabura imitate Cotopaxi Pichincha Atacatzo and Guamani are irregular The Ecuadorian volcanoes have rarely ejected liquid lava but chiefly water mud ashes and fragments of trachyte and porphyry Cotopaxi alone produces pure foam like pumice and glossy translucent obsidian sixty two The paucity of quartz and the absence of basalt are remarkable Some of the porphyroids are conglomerate but the majority are true porphyries having a homogeneous base doctor T Sterry Hunt calls them porphyroid trachytes They have a black rarely reddish vitreous or impalpable base approaching obsidian with a specific gravity of two point fifty nine in pure specimens and holding crystals or crystalline grains of glassy feldspar and sometimes of pyroxene and hematite They differ from the Old World porphyries in containing no quartz and seldom mica sixty three D Orbigny considers the porphyries of the Andes to have been ejected at the close of the cretaceous period and formed the first relief of the Cordillera The prevalence of trachyte shows that the products have cooled under feeble pressure Footnote sixty As a general rule whenever the mass of mountains rises much above the limit of perpetual snow the primitive rocks disappear and the summits are trachyte or trappean porphyry Humboldt In general the great Cordilleras are formed of innumerable varieties of granites gneiss schists hornblende chloritic slates porphyries et cetera and these rocks alternate with each other in meridional bands which in the ridges frequently present the appearance of a radiated or fan shaped structure and under the plains are more or less vertical Evan Hopkins F G S Footnote sixty one Von Tschudi makes the incorrect statement that throughout the whole extent of South America there is not a single instance of the Western Cordillera being intersected by a river Witness the Esmeraldas Footnote sixty two It is a singular fact that true trachyte pumice and obsidian are wanting in the volcanic Galapagos Islands only seven hundred miles west of Pichincha Footnote sixty three As many of the crystals are partly fused or have round angles the porphyries were probably formed by the melting of a crystalline rock the base becoming fused into a homogeneous material while the less fusible crystals remain imbedded Dr Hunt From the deluges of water lately thrown out have resulted deep furrows in the sides and from the prevalence of the east wind which is always met by the traveler on the crest of either Cordillera there is a greater accumulation of ashes and less snow on the west slope Cotopaxi is a fine example of this In Pichincha Altar and Ruminagua however the western wall is lowest apparently broken down sixty four There is no synchronism in the eruptions of Cotopaxi and Pichincha These volcanoes must have independent reservoirs for the former is three thousand feet higher than the latter and only thirty miles distant The reputed eruptions of Pichincha are dated fifteen thirty four fifteen thirty nine fifteen sixty six fifteen seventy five fifteen eighty eight and sixteen sixty that of fifteen thirty four resting on the assertions of Checa Garcilazo and Herrera indorsed by Humboldt Excepting the traditional eruption in fifteen thirty four which probably is confounded with that of Pichincha Cotopaxi did not open till seventeen forty two then followed the eruptions of seventeen forty three seventeen forty four seventeen forty six seventeen sixty six seventeen sixty eight eighteen oh three eighteen fifty one and eighteen fifty five We must mention however that since the recent awakening of Pichincha Cotopaxi has been unusually silent There is also a remarkable coincidence which may not be wholly accidental in the renewed activity of Pichincha and the great eruption of Mauna Loa both occurring in March eighteen sixty eight It is generally believed by the natives that Cotopaxi and Tunguragua are sympathetic Footnote sixty four In the Galapagos volcanoes the south wall is lowest while the craters in Mexico and Sandwich Islands are lowest on the northeast There are fifty one volcanoes in the Andean chain Of these twenty girdle the Valley of Quito three active five dormant and twelve extinct sixty five Besides these are numerous mountain peaks not properly volcanic Nowhere on the face of the earth is there such a grand assemblage of mountains Twenty two summits are covered with perpetual snow and fifty are over ten thousand feet high sixty six Footnote sixty five The altitudes of the most important Ecuadorian volcanoes are WESTERN CHAIN Chimborazo twenty one thousand four hundred twenty feet Humboldt Caraguairazo nineteen thousand one

feet No living creature save the condor passes this limit naked rocks fogs and eternal snows mark the reign of uninterrupted solitude The following is the approximate limit of perpetual snow in different latitudes zero deg fifteen thousand eight hundred feet twenty seven deg eighteen thousand eight hundred thirty three deg twelve thousand seven hundred eighty forty deg eight thousand three hundred feet fifty four deg three thousand seven hundred seventy deg three thousand three hundred The limit appears to descend more rapidly going south of the equator than in going north All of these would be visible from a single stand point the summit of Cotopaxi The lofty peaks shoot up with so much method as almost to provoke the theory that the Incas in the zenith of their power planted them as signal monuments along the royal road to Cuzco The eastern series is called the Cordillera real because along its flank are the remnants of the splendid highway which once connected Quito and the Peruvian capital sixty seven It can also boast of such tremendous volcanoes as Cotopaxi and Sangai The Western Cordillera contains but one active volcano but then it can point to peerless Chimborazo and the deep crater of Pichincha These twenty volcanic mountains rise within a space only two hundred miles long and thirty miles wide It makes one tremble to think of the awful crevice over which they are placed sixty eight Footnote sixty seven We traveled over a portion of this ancient road in going from Riobamba to Cajabamba It is well paved with cut blocks of dark porphyry It is not graded but partakes of the irregularity of the country Designed not for carriages but for troops and llamas there are steps when the ascent is steep Footnote sixty eight Grand as the Andes are how insignificant in a general view How slightly they cause our globe to differ from a perfect sphere Cotopaxi constitutes only one eleven hundred of the earth s radius and on a globe six feet in diameter Chimborazo would be represented by a grain of sand less than one twenty of an inch in thickness CHAPTER VIII The Volcanoes of Ecuador Western Cordillera Chimborazo Iliniza Corazon Pichincha Descent into its Crater Coming up from Peru through the cinchona forests of Loja and over the barren hills of Assuay the traveler reaches Riobamba seated on the threshold of magnificence like Damascus an oasis in a sandy plain but unlike the Queen of the East surrounded with a splendid retinue of snowy peaks that look like icebergs floating in a sea of clouds On our left is the most sublime spectacle in the New World It is a majestic pile of snow its clear outline on the deep blue sky describing the profile of a lion in repose At noon the vertical sun and the profusion of light reflected from the glittering surface will not allow a shadow to be cast on any part so that you can easily fancy the figure is cut out of a mountain of spotless marble This is Chimborazo yet not the whole of it you see but a third of the great giant His feet are as eternally green as his head is everlastingly white but they are far away beneath the bananas and cocoa palms of the Pacific coast Rousseau was disappointed when he first saw the sea and the first glimpse of Niagara often fails to meet one s expectations But Chimborazo is sure of a worshiper the moment its overwhelming grandeur breaks upon the traveler You feel that you are in the presence chamber of the monarch of the Andes There is sublimity in his kingly look of which the ocean might be proud All that expands the spirit yet appals Gathers around this summit as if to show How earth may pierce to heaven yet leave vain man below Well do we remember our disappointment as we stood before that wonder of the world saint Peter s We mounted the pyramid of steps and looked up but were not overcome by the magnificence We read in our guide book that the edifice covers eight acres and to the tip top of the cross is almost five hundred feet that it took three hundred and fifty years and twelve successive artists to finish it and an expenditure of fifty million dollars and now costs thirty thousand dollars per annum to keep it in repair still we did not appreciate its greatness We pushed aside the curtain and walked in walked a day s journey across the transept and up and down the everlasting nave and yet continued heterodox We tried hard to believe it was very vast and sublime and knew we ought to feel its grandeur but somehow we did not Then we sat down by the Holy of Holies and there we were startled into a better judgment by the astounding fact that the Cathedral of saint Paul the largest edifice in Great Britain could stand upright spire dome body and all inside of saint Peter s that the letters of the inscription which run around the base of the dome though apparently but an inch are in reality six feet high Then for the first time the scales fell from our eyes the giant building began to grow higher and higher still it rose longer and deeper it expanded yet in perfect proportions the colossal structure now a living temple put on its beautiful garments and the robe of majesty And that dome the longer we looked at it the vaster it grew till finally it seemed to be a temple not made with hands the spacious canopy became the firmament the mosaic figures of cherubim and seraphim were endowed with life and as we fixed our eyes on the zenith where the Almighty is represented in glory we thought we had the vision of Stephen Long we gazed upward into this heaven of man s creation and gazed again till we were lost in wonder But the traveler needs no such steps to lift him up to the grand conception of the divine Architect as he beholds the great white dome of Chimborazo It looks lofty from the very first Now and then an expanse of thin sky like vapor would cut the mountain in twain and the dome islanded in the deep blue of the upper regions seemed to belong more to heaven than to earth We knew that Chimborazo was more than twice the altitude of Etna We could almost see the great Humboldt struggling up the mountain s side till he looked like a black speck moving over the mighty white but giving up in despair four thousand feet below the summit We see the intrepid Bolivar mounting still higher but the hero of Spanish American independence returns a defeated man Last of all comes the philosophic Boussingault and attains the prodigious elevation of nineteen thousand six hundred feet the highest point reached by man without the aid of a balloon but the dome remains unsullied by his foot Yet none of these facts increase our admiration The mountain has a tongue which speaks louder than all mathematical calculations There must be something singularly sublime about Chimborazo for the spectator at Riobamba is already nine thousand feet high and the mountain is not so elevated above him as Mont Blanc above the vale of Chamouni when in reality that culminating point of Europe would not reach up even to the snow limit of Chimborazo by two thousand feet sixty nine It is only while sailing on the Pacific that one sees Chimborazo in its complete proportions Its very magnitude diminishes the impression of awe and wonder for the Andes on which it rests are heaved to such a vast altitude above the sea that the relative elevation of its summit becomes reduced by comparison with the surrounding mountains Its altitude is twenty one thousand four hundred twenty feet or forty five times the height of Strasburg Cathedral or to state it otherwise the fall of one pound from the top of Chimborazo would raise the temperature of water thirty deg One fourth of this is perpetually covered with snow so that its ancient name Chimpurazu the mountain of snow is very appropriate seventy It is a stirring thought that this mountain now mantled with snow once gleamed with volcanic fires There is a hot spring on the north side and an immense amount of debris covers the slope below the snow limit consisting chiefly of fine grained iron stained trachyte and coarse porphyroid gray trachyte very rarely a dark vitreous trachyte Chimborazo is very likely not a solid mountain trachytic volcanoes are supposed to be full of cavities Bouguer found it made the plumb line deviate seven or eight Footnote sixty nine But Chimborazo is steeper than the Alp king and steepness is a quality more quickly appreciated than mere massiveness Mont Blanc says a writer in Frazer s Magazine is scarcely admired because he is built with a certain regard to stability but the apparently reckless architecture of the Matterhorn brings the traveler fairly on his knees with a respect akin to that felt for the leaning tower of Pisa or the soaring pinnacles of Antwerp Footnote seventy White Mountain is the natural and almost uniform name of the highest mountains in all countries thus Himalaya Mont Blanc Hocmus Sierra Nevada Ben Nevis Snowdon Lebanon White Mountains of United States Chimborazo and Illimani The valleys which furrow the flank of Chimborazo are in keeping with its colossal size Narrower but deeper than those of the Alps the mind swoons and sinks in the effort to comprehend their grim majesty The mountain appears to have been broken to pieces like so much thin crust and the strata thrown on their vertical edges revealing deep dark chasms that seem to lead to the confines of the lower world The deepest valley in Europe that of the Ordesa in the Pyrenees is three thousand two hundred feet deep but here are rents in the side of Chimborazo in which Vesuvius could be put away out of sight As you look down into the fathomless fissure you see a white fleck rising out of the gulf and expanding as it mounts till the wings of the condor fifteen feet in spread glitter in the sun as the proud bird fearlessly wheels over the dizzy chasm and then ascending above your head sails over the dome of Chimborazo seventy one Could the condor speak what a glowing description could he give of the landscape beneath him when his horizon is a thousand miles in diameter If Twelve fair counties saw the blaze from Malvern s lonely height what must be the panorama from a height fifteen times higher Footnote seventy one Humboldt s statement that the condor flies higher than Chimborazo has been questioned but we have seen numbers hovering at least a thousand feet above the summit of Pichincha Baron Mueller in his ascent of Orizaba saw two falcons flying at the height of full eighteen thousand feet doctor Hooker found crows and ravens on the Himalayas at sixteen thousand five hundred feet and flocks of wild geese are said to fly over the peak of Kintschinghow twenty two thousand seven hundred fifty six feet Chimborazo was long supposed to be the tallest mountain on the globe but its supremacy has been supplanted by Mount Everest in Asia and Aconcagua in Chile seventy two In mountain gloom and glory however it still stands unrivaled The Alps have the avalanche the thunderbolt of snow and the glaciers those icy Niagaras so beautiful and grand Here they are wanting seventy three The monarch of the Andes sits motionless in calm serenity and unbroken silence The silence is absolute and actually oppressive The road from Guayaquil to Quito crosses Chimborazo at the elevation of fourteen thousand feet Save the rush of the trade wind in the afternoon as it sweeps over the Andes not a sound is audible not the hum of an insect nor the chirp of a bird nor the roar of the puma nor the music of running waters Mid ocean is never so silent You can almost hear the globe turning on its axis There was a time when the monarch deigned to speak and spoke with a voice of thunder for the lava on its sides is an evidence of volcanic activity But ever since the morning stars sang together over man s creation Chimbo has sat in sullen silence satisfied to look from his throne of clouds o er half the world There is something very suggestive in this silence of Chimborazo It was once full of noise and fury it is now a completed mountain and thunders no more How silent was Jesus a completed character The reason we are so noisy is that we are so full of wants we are unfinished characters Had we perfect fullness of all things the beatitude of being without a want we should lapse into the eternal silence of God Footnote seventy two Mount Everest is twenty nine thousand feet and Aconcagua twenty three thousand two hundred Schlagintweit enumerates thirteen Himalayan summits over twenty five thousand feet and forty six above twenty thousand We have little confidence in the estimates of the Bolivian mountains Chimborazo has nearly the same latitude and altitude as the loftiest peak in Africa Kilima Njaro Footnote seventy three Humboldt ascribes the absence of glaciers in the Andes to the extreme steepness of the sides and the excessive dryness of the air doctor Loomis above quoted mentions indications of glacial action moraines and polished and striated rocks on the crest of the Cordillera between Peru and Bolivia lat twenty one deg S Chimborazo is a leader of a long train of ambitious crags and peaks but as he who comes after the king must not expect to be noticed we will only take a glimpse of these lesser lights as we pass up the Western Cordillera and then down the Eastern The first after leaving the monarch is Caraguairazo The Indians call it the wife of Chimborazo They are separated only by a very narrow valley One hundred and seventy years ago the top of this mountain fell in and torrents of mud flowed out containing multitudes of fishes It is now over seventeen thousand feet high and is one of the most Alpine of the Quitonian volcanoes having sharp pinnacles instead of the smooth trachytic domes usually double domes so characteristic of the Andean summits And now we pass in rapid succession numerous picturesque mountains some of them extinct volcanoes as Iliniza presenting two pyramidal peaks the highest seventeen thousand feet above the sea and Corazon so named from its heart shaped summit till we reach Pichincha whose smoking crater is only five miles distant in a straight line from the city of Quito or eleven by the traveled route The crown of this mountain presents three groups of rocky peaks The most westerly one is called Rucu Pichincha and alone manifests activity To the northeast of Rucu is Guagua Pichincha a ruined flue of the same fiery furnace and between the two is Cundur guachana seventy four Pichincha is the only volcano in Ecuador which has not a true cone crater Some violent eruption beyond the reach of history or tradition has formed an enormous funnel shaped basin twenty five hundred feet deep seventy five fifteen hundred in diameter at the bottom and expanding upward to a width of three fourths of a mile It is the deepest crater on the globe That of Kilauea is six hundred feet Orizaba five hundred Etna three hundred Hecla one hundred Vesuvius is a portable furnace in comparison The abyss is girt with a ragged wall of dark trachyte which rises on the inside at various angles between forty five deg and perpendicularity As we know of but one American besides the members of our expedition mister Farrand a photographer who has succeeded in entering the crater of this interesting volcano we will give a brief sketch of our visit Footnote seventy four Pichincha in the Inca language signifies the boiling mountain Rucu means old Guagua young and Cundur guachana the condor s nest Footnote seventy five More accurately twenty five twenty seven feet Wisse and Moreno made it twenty four sixty Illustration Crater of Pichincha Leaving Quito in the afternoon by the old arched gateway at the foot of Panecillo and crossing a spur of the mountain we stopped for the night at the Jesuit hacienda situated in the beautiful valley of Lloa but nearly ruined by the earthquake of eighteen fifty nine On the damp walls of this monastery perched ten thousand two hundred sixty eight feet above the ocean we found several old paintings among them a copy of the Visitation by Rubens The sunset views in this heart of the Andes were surpassingly beautiful Mounting our horses at break of day and taking an Indian guide we ascended rapidly by a narrow and difficult path through the forest that belts the volcano up to the height of twelve thousand feet emerging gradually into a thicket of stunted bushes and then entered the dreary paramo Splendid was the view of the Eastern Cordillera At least six dazzling white volcanoes were in sight just across the Valley of Quito among them table topped Cayambi majestic Antisana and princely Cotopaxi whose tapering summit is a mile above the clouds Toiling upward we reached the base of the cone where vegetation ceased entirely and tying our horses to some huge rocks that had fallen from the mural cliff above started off on hands and feet for the crater The cone is deeply covered with sand and cinders for about two hundred feet and the sides are inclined at an angle of about thirty five deg At ten o clock we reached the brim of the crater and the great gulf burst suddenly into view We can never forget the impression made upon us by the sight We speak of many things here below as awful but that word has its full meaning when carried to the top of Pichincha There you see a frightful opening in the earth s crust nearly a mile in width and half a mile deep and from the dark abyss comes rolling up a cloud of sulphurous vapors Monte Somma in the time of Strabo was a miniature but this crater is on the top of a mountain four times the height of the Italian volcano Imagination finds it difficult to conceive a spectacle of more fearful grandeur or such solemn magnificence It well accords with Milton s picture of the bottomless pit The united effect of the silence and solitude of the place the great depth of the cavity the dark precipitous sides and the column of smoke standing over an unseen crevice was to us more impressive than thundering Cotopaxi or fiery Vesuvius Humboldt after standing on this same brink exclaimed I have never beheld a grander or more remarkable picture than that presented by this volcano and La Condamine compared it to the Chaos of the poets Below us are the smouldering fires which may any moment spring forth into a conflagration around us are black ragged cliffs fit boundary for this gateway to the infernal regions They look as if they had just been dragged up from the central furnace of the earth Life seems to have fled in terror from the vicinity even lichens the children of the bare rocks refuse to clothe the scathed and beetling crags For some moments made mute by the dreadful sight we stood like statues on the rim of the mighty caldron with our eyes riveted on the abyss below lost in contemplating that which can not be described The panorama from this lofty summit is more pleasing but equally sublime Toward the rising sun is the long range of the Eastern Cordillera hiding from our view the great valley of the Amazon To right and left are the peaks of another procession of august mountains from Cotocachi to Chimborazo We are surrounded by the great patriarchs of the Andes and their speaker Cotopaxi ever and anon sends his muttering voice over the land The view westward is like looking down from a balloon Those parallel ridges of the mountain chain dropping one behind the other are the gigantic staircase by which the ice crowned Chimborazo steps down to the sea A white sea of clouds covers the peaceful Pacific and the lower parts of the coast But the vapory ocean curling into the ravines beautifully represents little coves and bays leaving islands and promontories like a true ocean on a broken shore We seem raised above the earth which lies like an opened map below us we can look down on the upper surface of the clouds and were it night down too upon the lightnings The crater of Pichincha has a sharp serrated edge which happily for Quito is broken down on the west side so that in the next eruption the volcano will doubtless pour its contents into the wilds of Esmeraldas The highest pinnacle is fifteen thousand eight hundred twenty seven feet so that the mountain just enters the region of perpetual winter Water boils at one hundred eighty five deg The summit is generally bare though snow is always found in the clefts of the rocks It is not compact or crystalline but resembles a conglomerate of little hailstones seventy six Out of the mingled snow and pumice dust rise a few delicate flowers particularly the violet Sida Pichinchensis the same which we had observed on the side of Chimborazo Think of gay flowers a thousand feet higher than the top of Mont Blanc Footnote seventy six The snow on the top of Mont Blanc is like dry dust in Lapland in open places it consists of hexagonal crystals and is called by the inhabitants sand snow The French and Spanish mathematicians Bouguer La Condamine and Ulloa in their story of ascending Pichincha give a long and dreadful account of their sufferings from cold and rarefied air whilst eating every one was obliged to keep his plate over a chafing dish of coals to prevent his food from freezing The traveler nowadays finds only a chilling wind This rise of temperature coupled with the fact that La Condamine seventeen forty five Humboldt eighteen oh two Boussingault eighteen thirty one and Wisse eighteen sixty three give to Quito a decreasing altitude inclines us to believe with Boussingault that the Andes are sinking Since the activity of the volcano in eighteen sixty eight the summit has been so warm that the snow has totally disappeared Ice cream has in consequence risen in price in Quito as snow must be brought from Sincholagua four days journey The first to reach the brink of the crater were the French Academicians in seventeen forty two Sixty years after Humboldt stood on the summit But it was not till eighteen forty four that any one dared to enter the crater This was accomplished by Garcia Moreno now President of Ecuador and Sebastian Wisse a French engineer Humboldt pronounced the bottom of the crater inaccessible from its great depth and precipitous descent We found it accessible but exceedingly perilous The moment we prepared to descend our guide ran away We went on without him but when halfway down were stopped by a precipice On the twenty twod of October eighteen sixty seven we returned to Pichincha with another guide and entered the crater by a different route Manuel our Indian led us to the south side and over the brink we went We were not long in realizing the danger of the undertaking Here the snow concealed an ugly fissure or covered a treacherous rock for nearly all the rocks are crumbling there we must cross a mass of loose sand moving like a glacier down the almost vertical side of the crater and on every hand rocks were giving way and gathering momentum at each revolution went thundering down leaping over precipices and jostling other rocks which joined in the race till they all struck the bottom with a deep rumbling sound shivered like so many bombshells into a thousand pieces and telling us what would be our fate it we made a single misstep We followed our Indian in single file keeping close together that the stones set free by those in the rear might not dash those below from their feet feeling our way with the greatest caution clinging with our hands to snow sand rock tufts of grass or any thing that would hold for a moment now leaping over a chasm now letting ourselves down from rock to rock at times paralyzed with fear and always with death staring us in the face thus we scrambled for two hours and a half till we reached the bottom of the crater Here we found a deeply furrowed plain strewn with ragged rocks and containing a few patches of vegetation with half a dozen species of flowers In the centre is an irregular heap of stones two hundred and sixty feet high by eight hundred in diameter This is the cone of eruption its sides and summit covered with an imposing group of vents seventy in number all lined with sulphur and exhaling steam black smoke and sulphurous gas The temperature of the vapor just within the fumarole is one hundred eighty four deg water boiling beside it at one hundred eighty nine deg The central vent or chimney gives forth a sound like the violent bubbling of boiling water As we sat on this fiery mount surrounded by a circular rampart of rocks and looked up at the immense towers of dark dolerite which ran up almost vertically to the height of twenty five hundred feet above us musing over the tremendous force which fashioned this awful amphitheatre spacious enough for all the gods of Tartarus to hold high carnival the clouds which hung in the thin air around the crest of the crater pealed forth thunder after thunder which reverberating from precipice to precipice were answered by the crash of rocks let loose by the storm till the whole mountain seemed to tremble like a leaf Such acoustics mingled with the flash of lightning and the smell of brimstone made us believe that we had fairly got into the realm of Pluto It is the spot where Dante s Inferno ought to be read Finishing our observations and warming our dinner over the steaming crevices we prepared to ascend The escape from this horrid hole was more perilous than the entrance and on reaching the top we sang with grateful hearts to the tune of Old Hundred Praise God from whom all blessings flow We doubt whether that famous tune and glorious doxology were ever sung so near to heaven The second line Praise him all creatures here below had a strange meaning fifteen thousand feet high There have been five eruptions of Pichincha since the Conquest The last was in sixteen sixty that of fifteen sixty six covered Quito three feet deep with ashes and stones while boiling water and bitumen descended in torrents In eighteen sixty seven the column of smoke did not rise above the crest of the crater but the volcano has lately been showing signs of activity such as it has not exhibited since the last grand eruption two centuries ago On the nineteenth of March eighteen sixty eight detonations were audible at Quito and three days after there were more thunderings with a great column of vapor visible from Chillo twelve miles to the east These phenomena were accompanied by an unusual fall of rain Since the great earthquake of August sixteenth Pichincha has continued to send forth dense columns of black smoke and so much fine sand that it is not possible to reach the crater The solid products of Pichincha since the Conquest have been chiefly pumice coarse grained and granular trachyte and reddish porphyroid trachyte The roads leading to Quito cut through hills of pumice dust On the plain of Inaquito and in the valley of Esmeraldas are vast erratic blocks of trachyte some containing twenty five cubic yards having sharp angles and in some cases a polished unstriated surface M Wisse does not consider them to have been thrown out of Pichincha as La Condamine and others have judged It is true as he says that they could not have come out of the present cone at a less angle than forty five deg for they would have hit the sides of the high rocky rampart and rolled back again and at a higher angle they would not have reached their present location But we see no reason why they could not be the upper portion of the solid trachyte cone blown into the air at the great eruption which cleared out this enormous crater There is a rumipamba or field of stones around each of the Quitonian volcanoes Leaving Pichincha we travel northward along the battlemented Andes passing by the conical mountains of Yana urcu and Cotocachi Yana urcu or black mountain is a mass of calcined rocks Cotocachi from cota and cachi salt is always snow clad On its side is Cuycocha one of the highest lakes in the world ten thousand two hundred feet and formed by the subsidence of a part of the volcano CHAPTER IX The Volcanoes of Ecuador Eastern Cordillera Imbabura Cayambi Antisana Cotopaxi Llanganati Tunguragua Altar Sangai Near the once busy city of Otovalo utterly destroyed in the late earthquake the two Cordilleras join and turning to the right we go down the eastern range The first in order is Imbabura seventy seven which poured forth a large quantity of mud with thousands of fishes seven years before the similar eruption of Caraguairazo At its feet is the beautiful lake of San Pablo five miles in circumference and very deep It contains the little black fish Pimelodes cyclopum already referred to as the only species in the valley and the same that was cast out by Imbabura and Caraguairazo Next comes the square topped Cayambi the loftiest mountain in this Cordillera being nineteen thousand five hundred feet It stands exactly on the equator a colossal monument placed by the hand of Nature to mark the grand division of the globe It is the only snowy spot says Humboldt which is crossed by the equator Beautiful is the view of Cayambi from Quito as its enormous mass of snow and ice glows with crimson splendor in the farewell rays of the setting sun No painter s brush could do justice to the prismatic tints which hover around the higher peaks But this flood of glory is soon followed by the pure whiteness of death Like a gigantic ghost shrouded in sepulchral sheets the mountain now hovers in the background of the landscape towering ghastly through the twilight until darkness closes upon the scene Footnote seventy seven From imba fish and bura to produce Its name can not be older than sixteen ninety one unless the mountain made similar eruptions before It has frequently ejected water Ten miles farther south is the bare headed Guamani range over which passes the road to the wild Napo country seventy eight The view from the crest is magnificent but like every grand panorama eludes description As we look eastward over the beginnings of the mighty forest which stretches unbroken to the Atlantic the vast ridges trending north and south and decreasing in height as they increase in distance seem like the waves of a great ocean rolling toward the mountains Footnote seventy eight The culminating point of Guamani is Sara urcu a volcano which threw out a vast quantity of ashes in eighteen forty three and eighteen fifty six Near by stands Antisana in his snowy robe This volcano ranks next to Chimborazo in dignity It has a double dome and an elevation of nineteen thousand feet Snow of Dian purity covers it for over three thousand feet but judging from the enormous streams of lava on its sides it must have been a fierce volcano in ages past The lava streams are worthy of the great mountain from which they flowed One of them called Volcan d Ansango is ten miles long and five hundred feet deep with an average slope of fifteen deg It is a magnificent sight as seen from the surrounding paramo a stream of dark ragged rocks coming down out of the clouds and snows which cover the summit The representative products of Antisana are a black cellular vitreous trachyte a fine grained tough porphyroid trachyte and a coarse reddish porphyroid trachyte An eruption as late as fifteen ninety is recorded in Johnston s Phys Atlas Humboldt saw smoke issuing from several openings in March eighteen oh two We ascended this volcano to the height of sixteen thousand feet On its side is the celebrated hacienda of Antisana which more than sixty years ago sheltered the great Humboldt from the sleet and rain and blast of this lofty region It was a welcome refuge to us for we had well nigh perished with cold on the dreary paramo It is one of the highest human habitations in the world being thirteen thousand three hundred feet above the sea or a thousand feet higher than the Peak of Teneriffe seventy nine The mean temperature is the same as that of Quebec so that thirteen thousand feet in elevation at the equator is equal to forty seven deg in latitude eighty Here is an extensive corral inclosing thousands of cattle owned by a rheumatic old gentleman Senor Valdevieso who supplies the beef market of Quito eighty one A desire for beef has alone brought man and his beast to this chilly altitude It is difficult to get a quart of milk and impossible to find a pound of butter at this hacienda The predominant colors of the cattle are red and black They feed on the wild paramo grass and the beef is not only remarkably cheap but superior in quality The lasso is used in catching the animals but not so skillfully as by the Gauchos of Rio Plata It is a singular fact that cattle have followed men over the whole earth from the coast of Africa to the highlands of Antisana The same species is attacked by crocodiles and condors Footnote seventy nine M d Abbadie professes to have visited a village in Abyssinia Arquiage which is twelve thousand four hundred fifty feet above the sea Potosi stands thirteen thousand five hundred feet Footnote eighty This agrees with Humboldt s calculation that a difference of elevation of two hundred seventy eight feet produces the same effect on the annual temperature as a change of one degree of latitude According to the experiments of Captain Pullen the minimum temperature of the great depths of the ocean thirty five deg and it commences soon after passing twelve thousand feet Footnote eighty one The great depots of cattle in Ecuador are at the two extremes of elevation the lowlands of saint Elena and the highlands of Antisana On the slope of Cayambi is another extensive cattle estate The atmospheric pressure is here so small that they frequently bleed at the nose and mouth when hunted We have already given our experience in ascending high altitudes We may add that while the pulse of Boussingault beat one hundred six pulsations at the height of eighteen thousand six hundred feet on Chimborazo ours was eighty seven at sixteen thousand feet on Antisana De Saussure says that a draught of liquor which would inebriate in the lowlands no longer has that effect on Mont Blanc This appears to be true on the Andes indeed there is very little drunkenness in Quito So the higher we perch our inebriate asylums the better for the patients Near the hacienda is a little lake called Mica on which we found a species of grebe with wings so short it could not fly Its legs also seem fitted only for paddling and it goes ashore only to lay its eggs It peeps like a gosling Associated with them were penguins in appearance they were so shy we could not secure one The query is How came they there Was this a centre of creation or were the fowls upheaved with the Andes They could not have flown or walked to this lofty lake and there are no water courses leading to it it is surrounded with a dry rolling waste where only the condor lives We turn to Darwin for an answer eighty two Footnote eighty two The grebe is considered by Messrs Cassin and Lawrence to be the Podiceps occipitalis Lisson P calipareus et Chilensis of Garnot which occurs in large flocks on the coast of Chile and in the Straits of Magellan It is quite different from the P micropterus of Lake Titicaca At Morococha Peru fifteen thousand six hundred feet above the sea Herndon found snipes and ducks The ragged Sincholagua eighty three and romantic Ruminagui follow Antisana and then we find ourselves looking up at the most beautiful and most terrible of volcanoes This is the far famed Cotopaxi or more properly Cutu pacsi meaning a brilliant mass Humboldt calls it the most regular and most picturesque of volcanic cones It looks like a huge truncated cone rising out of the Valley of Quito its sides deeply furrowed by the rivers of mud and water which have so often flowed out The cone itself is about six thousand feet high The east side is covered with snow but the west is nearly bare owing to the trade winds which sweeping across the continent carry the ashes westward Cotopaxi is the loftiest of active volcanoes though its grand eruptions are a century apart according to the general rule that the higher a volcano the less frequent its eruptions but all the more terrible when they do occur Imagine Vesuvius on the summit of Mont Blanc and you have the altitude of Cotopaxi Footnote eighty three In Brigham s Notes on the Volcanic Phenomena of the Hawaiian Islands this volcano is put down as active but there has been no eruption in the memory of man Its lithology is represented in our collection by porous gray granular trachyte fine grained compact trachyte and dark porphyroid trachyte The derivation of Sincholagua is unknown Ruminagui means the face of a rock Cotopaxi Sincholagua and Ruminagui and Cotopaxi Pichincha and Guamani form equilateral triangles The top just reaches the middle point of density in the atmosphere for at the height of three miles and a half the air below will balance that above The crater has never been seen by man the steepness of the sides and the depth of the ashes covering them render it inaccessible The valiant colonel Hall tried it with scaling ladders only to fail The telescope reveals a parapet of scoria on the brim as on Teneriffe Humboldt s sketch of the volcano so universally copied is overdrawn It makes the slope about fifty deg while in truth it is nearer thirty deg The apical angle is one hundred twenty two deg thirty eighty four Footnote eighty four MM Zurcher and Margalli make the slope fifty five deg and Guzman sixty nine deg thirty The slope of Mauna Loa is six deg thirty of Etna nine deg of Teneriffe twelve deg thirty of Vesuvius thirty five deg While cinder cones may have an angle of forty deg lava cones seldom exceed ten deg Cotopaxi is slumbering now or as mister Coan says of Hilo it is in a state of solemn and thoughtful suspense The only signs of life are the deep rumbling thunders and a cloud of smoke lazily issuing from the crater eighty five Sometimes at night the smoke looks like a pillar of fire and fine ashes and sand often fall around the base to the great annoyance of the farmers On the south side is a huge rock of porphyry called the Inca s Head Tradition has it that this was the original summit of the volcano torn off and hurled down by an eruption on the very day Atahuallpa was murdered by Pizarro The last great eruption occurred in eighteen oh three though so late as eighteen fifty five it tossed out stones water and sand Heaps of ruins piled up during the lapse of ages are scattered for miles around the mountain among them great boulders twenty feet square In one place Quinchevar the accumulation is six hundred feet deep Between Cotopaxi and Sincholagua are numerous conical hills covering the paramo reminding one of the mud volcanoes of Jorullo Footnote eighty five Even this has now August eighteen sixty nine ceased save an occasional grumble and the Tacungans are trembling with fear of another eruption Pumice and trachyte are the most common rocks around this mountain and these are augitic or porphyroid Obsidian also occurs though not on the immediate flank but farther down near Chillo In plowing thousands of pieces as large as flints are turned up The natives know nothing about their origin or use the large specimens were anciently polished and used for mirror But Cotopaxi is the great pumice producing volcano The new road up the valley cuts through a lofty hill formed by the successive eruptions the section presenting alternate layers of mud ashes and pumice is a written history of the volcano eighty six The cone itself is evidently composed of similar beds super imposed and holding fragments of porphyry and trachyte What is Vesuvius four thousand feet high to Cotopaxi belching forth fire from a crater fifteen thousand feet higher and shooting its contents three thousand feet above its snow bound summit with a voice of thunder heard six hundred miles Footnote eighty six Compare the following sections COTOPAXI near Tiupullo Soil one fort zero in Fine yellow pumice five zero Compact black ashes with seams of pumice ten zero Fine yellow pumice one six Compact black ashes twelve zero Fine yellow pumice two zero Compact black ashes with seams of pumice VESUVIUS at Pompeii Soil three fort zero in Brown incoherent tuff one six Small scoriae and white lapilli zero three Brown earthy tuff four nine Whitish lapilli zero one Gray solid tuff zero three Pumice and white lapilli zero three Leaving this terrible safety valve to the imprisoned fires under our feet we travel along the wooded flanks and savage valleys of the Llanganati Mountains whose lofty blue ridge is here and there pointed with snow eighty seven It is universally believed that the Incas buried an immense quantity of gold in an artificial lake on the sides of this mountain during the Spanish invasion and many an adventurous expedition has been made for it The inhabitants will tell you of one Valverde a Spaniard who from being very poor had suddenly become very rich which was attributed to his having married an Indian girl whose father showed him where the treasure was hidden and accompanied him on various occasions to bring away portions of it and that Valverde returned to Spain and on his death bed bequeathed the secret of his riches to the king But since Padre Longo suddenly disappeared while leading an expedition the timid Ecuadorians have been content with their poverty eighty eight Footnote eighty seven Immediately south of Cotopaxi the Cordillera consists of paramos sown with lakes and morasses and is rarely covered with snow Llanganati is probably from llanga to touch they touch the sources of nearly all the Ecuadorian rivers Footnote eighty eight The story is doubtless due to the fact that the eastern streams which issue from the foot of this cordillera are auriferous And now we have reached the perfect cone of Tunguragua the rival of Cotopaxi in symmetry and beauty eighty nine It stands sixteen thousand five hundred feet above the Pacific its upper part covered with a splendid robe of snow while the sugar cane grows in the romantic town of Banos ten thousand feet below the summit A cataract fifteen hundred feet high comes down at three bounds from the edge of the snow to the warm valley beneath and at Banos a hot ferruginous spring and a stream of ice water flow out of the volcano side by side Here too the fierce youth of the Pastassa born on the pumice slopes of Cotopaxi dashes through a deep tortuous chasm and down a precipice in hot haste as if conscious of the long distance before it ere it reaches the Amazon and the ocean Tunguragua was once a formidable mountain for we discovered a great stream of lava reaching from the clouds around the summit to the orange groves in the valley and blocking up the rivers which tumble over it in beautiful cascades It has been silent since seventeen eighty but it can afford to rest for then its activity lasted seven years ninety Footnote eighty nine From Tunguri the ankle joint alluding to its apical angle It is a little steeper than Cotopaxi having a slope of thirty eight deg Footnote ninety Spruce asserts that he saw smoke issuing from the western edge in eighteen fifty seven and doctor Terry says that in eighteen thirty two smoke ascended almost always from the summit doctor Taylor of Riobamba informs the writer that smoke is now almost constantly visible The characteristic rock is a black vitreous trachyte resembling pitchstone but anhydrous Close by rises beautiful Altar a thousand feet higher The Indians call it Capac urcu or the Chief They say it once overtopped Chimborazo but after a violent eruption which continued eight years the walls fell in Its craggy crest is still more Alpine than Caraguairazo eight snowy peaks shoot up like needles into the sky and surround an altar to whose elevated purity no mortal offering will ever attain The trachyte which once formed the summit of this mountain is now spread in fragments over the plain of Riobamba Leaving this broken down volcano but still the most picturesque in the Andes we travel over the rough and rugged range of Cubillin till our attention is arrested by terrific explosions like a naval broadside and a column of smoke that seems to come from the furnace of the Cyclops It is Sangai the most active volcano on the globe From its unapproachable crater three miles high it sends forth a constant stream of fire water mud and ashes ninety one Footnote ninety one La Condamine seventeen forty two adds sulphur and bitumen No intermission has been noticed since the Spaniards first saw it three hundred years ago Stromboli is the only volcano that will compare with it Its ashes are almost always falling on the city of Guayaquil one hundred miles distant and its explosions generally occurring every hour or two are sometimes heard in that city Wisse in eighteen forty nine counted two hundred sixty seven explosions in one hour We have now completed the series What an array of snow clad peaks wall in the narrow Valley of Quito Nature s Gothic spires to this her glorious temple If ever there was a time when all these volcanoes were active in concert this secluded vale must have witnessed the most splendid pyrotechnics conceivable Imagine fifty mountains as high as Etna three of them with smoking craters standing along the road between New York and Washington and you will have some idea of the ride down this gigantic colonnade from Quito to Riobamba If as Ruskin says the elements of beauty are in proportion to the increase of mountainous character Ecuador is artistically beautiful to a high degree Here amid these Plutonic peaks are the energies of volcanic action best studied The constancy of the volcanic fires is a striking fact First we have the deluges of submarine lavas which were poured out long before the Andes lifted their heads above the waters then alternate porphyritic strata feldspathic streams and gypseous exhalations then at a later day floods of basaltic lava next the old tertiary eruptions and lastly the vast accumulations of boulders gravel ashes pumice and mud of the present day spread over the Valley of Quito and the west slope of the Cordilleras to an unknown depth beneath the sea The incessant eruptions of Sangai and the frequent earthquakes show that the subterranean energy which heaved the Andes is not yet expended CHAPTER X The Valley of Quito Riobamba A Bed of Fossil Giants Chillo Hacienda Otovalo and Ibarra The Great Earthquake of eighteen sixty eight The Valley of Quito has about the same size and shape as the basin of Salt Lake but it is five thousand feet higher ninety two The two cordilleras inclosing it are tied by the mountain knots of Assuay and Chisinchi so that the valley is subdivided into three basins those of Cuenca Ambato and Quito proper which increase in beauty and altitude as we travel north There are several subordinate transversal dikes and some longitudinal ridges but all the basins lie parallel to the axes of the cordilleras a characteristic feature of the Andes The deep valleys on the outside flanks are evidently valleys of erosion but the basins between the cordilleras were created with them Footnote ninety two Compare the table lands in the Old World Thibet eleven thousand five hundred feet South Africa six thousand Mysore India twenty eight eighty Spain twenty two forty Bavaria seventeen seventy The first is fifty miles long It contains the cities of Loja and Cuenca ninety three the former distinguished for its cinchona forests the latter for Inca graves and mines of precious metals The middle basin one hundred thirty miles in length is covered with vast quantities of volcanic debris the outpourings of Cotopaxi Tunguragua and Altar on one side and of Chimborazo and Caraguairazo on the other Nothing relieves the barrenness of the landscape but hedges of century plant cactus and wild heliotrope which border the roads Whirlwinds of sand are often seen moving over the plain The mean temperature is sixty one deg five Here exist we can not say thrive the cities of Riobamba Ambato and Tacunga already noticed Riobamba ninety four properly Rayobamba the plain of lightning was founded at the beginning of this century or shortly after the destruction of the old city Excepting the ecclesiastical buildings the houses are of one story built of stone plastered with mud sometimes of adobe or bamboo and the windows are grated like those of a prison As in all Spanish American towns the main church fronts the great Plaza where the weekly fairs are held Save on fair day the city is lifeless Nothing is exported to the coast except a few eggs and fowls lard and potatoes Such is the power of habit an Indian will take a hen to Bodegas and sell it for four reals fifty cents when he could get three for it in Riobamba and six on the road Another instance of this dogged adherence to custom was related to us by doctor Taylor The Indians were accustomed to bring the curate of a certain village a bundle of alfalfa every day A new curate having no use for so much ordered them not to bring any more He was besieged by five hundred of his wild parishioners and had he not been a powerful man they would have killed him They told him they were accustomed to bring the curate that much of alfalfa and should continue Footnote ninety three The altitude of Loja is six thousand seven hundred sixty eight feet of Cuenca eight thousand six hundred forty feet Footnote ninety four According to Villavicencio Rio or Rie is Quichua for road bamba is plain Old Riobamba Cajabamba is situated twelve miles to the west This has been the scene of some of the most terrible paroxysms that over shook the Andes In seventeen ninety seven a part of Mount Cicalfa was thrown down crushing the city at its foot hills arose where valleys existed rivers disappeared and others took their places and the very site of the city was rent asunder The surviving inhabitants could not tell where their houses had stood and property was so mingled that litigation followed the earthquake Judging from the numerous sculptured columns lying broken and prostrate throughout the valley the city must have had a magnificence now unknown in Ecuador Around a coat of arms evidently Spanish we read these words Malo mori quam fedari I would rather die than be disgraced In the spring of eighteen sixty eight another convulsion caused a lake to disappear and a mountain to take its place Near Punin seven miles southwest of Riobamba we discovered in a deep ravine numerous fossil bones belonging chiefly to the mastodon and extinct species of the horse deer and llama They were imbedded in the middle of an unstratified cliff four hundred feet high of very compact silt or trachytic clay free from stones and resting on a hard quartzoze sandstone In the bed of the stream which runs through the ravine charged with nitrate of soda are some igneous rocks The bones were drifted to this spot and deposited many of them in a broken state in horizontal layers along with recent shells We have then this remarkable fact that this high valley was tenanted by elephantine quadrupeds all of which passed away before the arrival of the human species and yet while the land and probably the sea also were peopled with their present molluscan inhabitants This confirms the statement of mister Lyell that the longevity of mammalian species is much inferior to that of the testacea It is interesting to speculate on the probable climate and the character of the vegetation in this high valley when these extinct mammifers lived The great pachyderm would have no difficulty in thriving at the present day at Quito on the score of temperature or altitude The mammoth once flourished in Siberia and Gibbon met an elephant on the high table lands of Bolivia that had walked over the Cordillera at the pass of Antarangua sixteen thousand feet above the sea Darwin thinks that the climate of the Cordilleras has changed since the pleistocene period It is a marvelous fact in the history of mammalia says this naturalist that in South America a native horse should have lived and disappeared to be succeeded in after ages by the countless herds descended from the few introduced with the Spanish colonists The high ridge of Chisinchi stretching across the great plateau from Cotopaxi to Iliniza separates the evergreen Valley of Quito from the arid and melancholy valleys of Cuenca and Ambato It rolls out like a rich carpet of emerald verdure between the towering mountains of Pichincha and Antisana Cotacachi and Cayambi This was the centre of the most ancient native civilization after that of Titicaca Here while the darkness of the Middle Ages was settling over Europe dwelt the Quitus whose origin is lost in the mists of fable Then while Peter the Hermit was leading his fanatic host against the Saracens the Cara nation waged a more successful crusade and supplanted the Quitus Here too in the bloody days of Pizarro reigned and was buried the last of the Incas ill fated Atahuallpa To him indeed it was a more delightful spot than the vale of Vilcamayu the paradise of Peru The Puengasi Hills running through the valley from north to south partially divide the capital and its vicinity from the charming Valley of Chillo spread out at the foot of Antisana Here is the venerable hacienda of Chillo where Humboldt and Bonpland resided for some time It is owned by the Aguirres who are grand nephews of Don Carlos Montufar the companion of the famous travelers The hacienda contains two valuable paintings an original Crucifixion by Titian and a portrait of the great German from life as he appeared in eighteen oh three This latter relic interested us exceedingly and through the kindness of Sr Aguirre we were allowed to photograph it It represents Humboldt in his prime a traveler on the Andes dressed after the court fashion of Berlin very different from the usual portrait an old man in his library his head thinly covered with gray hair resting on his bosom Illustration Humboldt in eighteen oh two Thirty miles north of Quito near the volcanic Imbabura is the ruined city of Otovalo a thousand feet lower than the capital It was well built and contained seven thousand inhabitants Quichua was the prevailing language Its chief trade was in saddles ponchos straw hats and fruit Here was the cotton factory or quinta of Sr Pareja Three miles from Otovalo was the enterprising Indian village of Cotocachi at the mountain of the same name It was noted for its hand loom products A heap of ruins now marks the locality It is a doomed spot suffering more than any other town in eighteen fifty nine Four miles northwest of Otovalo was the city of Ibarra picturesquely seated on a plain two thousand feet lower than Quito and surrounded with orchards and gardens It numbered nearly ten thousand souls It was not a commercial place but the residence of landed proprietors The neighborhood produced cotton sugar and fruit A league distant was Carranqui the birthplace of Atahuallpa And finally the great valley fitly terminates in the plain of Atuntaqui ninety five where the decisive battle was fought which ushered in the reign of the Incas Illustration Ibarra Footnote ninety five Atuntaqui received its name from the big drum which was kept here in the days of Huayna Capac to give the war signal This northern province of Imbabura was the focus of the late terrible earthquake At half past one on Sunday morning August sixteen eighteen sixty eight with scarcely a premonitory sign save a slight trembling at three P M the previous day there was an upheaving of the ground and then one tremendous shock and rocking of the earth lasting one minute In that brief moment the rich and flourishing province became a wilderness and Misericordia went up like tho sound of many waters from ten villages and cities Otovalo Ibarra Cotocachi and Atantaqui are heaps of ruins At Otovalo six thousand perished After the first shock not a wall a yard high remained Houses in some instances seemed to have been cut from their foundation and thrown ten feet distant The large stone fountain in the Plaza was thrown many yards The cotton factory which was built on the edge of a ravine was by one stroke reduced to fragments Such was the force of the concussion the looms smashed each other the carding machines were thrown on their sides and the roof with part of the machinery was found in the river below The proprietor was killed Throughout this whole region roads were broken up and vast chasms created crossing the country in all directions One is two thousand yards long five hundred yards broad and eighty yards deep Large fissures were opened on the sides of Cotocachi and Imbabura from which issued immense torrents of water mud and bituminous substances carrying away and drowning hundreds of cattle A caravan of mules going to Chillo with cotton bales was found four days after grazing on a narrow strip of land on each side of which was a fearful chasm while the muleteers were killed At Quito comparatively little damage was done Fifteen lives were lost and the churches convents and many private houses are in a state of dilapidation Domes and arches which are much used because of the scarcity of timber were first to fall In the fierceness of the shock and the extent of the territory shaken the earthquake of August eighteen sixty eight is without a parallel in the New World The destruction of life fifty thousand officially reported in Ecuador alone has not been equaled in any other earthquake during this century The tremor was felt over four republics and from the Andes to the Sandwich Islands The water wave was felt on the coast of New Zealand sixteen hours after it had set a United States gunboat on the sand hills of Arica In some respects it is surpassed only by the Lisbon earthquake which reached from Sweden to the West Indies and from Barbary to Scotland The loss of property seems to have been greatest in Peru and the loss of life greatest in Ecuador The commotion seemed to be most violent along the Western Cordillera though it was felt even on the Napo There are few places where the crust of our planet is long at rest Brazil Egypt Russia and Greenland are comparatively free from earthquakes But had we delicate instruments scattered throughout the world upheaval and subsidence would doubtless be detected in every part of the so called terra firma The sea and not the land is the true image of stability Time writes no wrinkle on thy azure brow Such as creation s dawn beheld thou rollest now Earthquakes have occurred in every period of geological history and are independent of latitude The first well known earthquake came in the year sixty three and shattered Pompeii and Herculaneum sixteen years before they were overwhelmed by the first recorded eruption of Vesuvius The most celebrated earthquake and perhaps the most terrible manifestation of force during the human period was in seventeen fifty five The shock which seemed to originate in the bed of the Atlantic pervaded one twelfth of the earth s surface Unhappy Lisbon stood in its path An earthquake is a vertical vibration having an undulatory progression An example of the simple bounding movement occurred in seventeen ninety seven when the city of Riobamba in the Quito Valley was buried under part of a mountain shaken down by the violent concussion and men were tossed several hundred feet We saw one massive structure which had nearly turned a somersault The ordinary vibrations seldom exceed two feet in height The wave movement has a rate of from twenty to thirty miles a minute depending on the elasticity of the rock and the elevations on the surface When two undulations cross each other a rotatory or twisting motion is produced The waves are generally transmitted along the lines of primary mountain chains which are doubtless seated on a fracture The Lisbon waves moved from southwest to northeast or parallel to the mountain system of the Old World those of the United States in eighteen forty three ran parallel to the volcanic chain in Mexico In South America they roll along the Andes That of seventeen ninety seven left its tracks along a westerly line from Tunguragua through Pelileo and Guano It is a little singular that while the late trembling at Quito seemed to come from the north the great shock in Peru preceded that in Ecuador by three days Though the origin of earthquakes is deep seated the oscillation is mostly superficial as deep mines are little disturbed The most damage is done where the sedimentary plains abut against the hard upturned strata of the mountains The shock is usually brief That of Caracas lasted fifty seconds that of Lisbon six minutes but Humboldt witnessed one in South America which continued a quarter of an hour Several hypotheses have been advanced to account for earthquakes Rogers ascribes them to billowy pulsations in the molten matter upon which the flexible crust of the earth floats Mallet thinks they may be viewed as an uncompleted effort to establish a volcano Dana holds that they are occasioned by the folding up of the rocks in the slow process of cooling and consequent contraction of the earth s crust In this process there would occur enormous fractures to relieve the tension tilted strata would slip and caverns give way All this no doubt takes place but the sudden paroxysmal heavings incline us to refer the cause to the same eruptive impulse which makes Vesuvius and Cotopaxi discharge pent up subterranean vapor and gas The most destructive earthquakes occur when the overlying rocks do not break and give vent to the imprisoned gas There is some connection between volcanoes and earthquakes the former are to a certain extent safety valves The column of smoke from the volcano of Pasto suddenly disappeared just before the great earthquake at Riobamba In the spring of eighteen sixty eight Pichincha and Cotopaxi showed signs of increasing activity but in the summer became quiet again Cotocachi and Sangai two hundred miles apart were awaked simultaneously the former silent for centuries sent forth dense masses of earth and volcanic matter to a distance of many miles covering thousands of acres the latter thundered every half hour instead of hourly as before Still the greatest earthquakes do not occur in the vicinity of active volcanoes Lisbon and Lima where on an average forty five shocks occur annually and two fearful ones in a century are far distant from any volcanic vent likewise Northern India South Africa Scotland and the United States An earthquake is beyond the reach of calculation Professor Perrey of Dijon France is endeavoring to prove that there is a periodicity in earthquakes synchronous with that in the tides of the ocean the greatest number occurring at the time of new and full moon ninety six If this theory be sustained we must admit the existence of a vast subterranean sea of lava But all this is problematical Earthquakes appear independently of the geology of a country though the rate of undulation is modified by the mineral structure Earthquake waves seem to move more rapidly through the comparatively undisturbed beds of the Mississippi Valley than through the contorted strata of Europe Meteorology is unable to indicate a coming earthquake for there is no sure prophecy in sultry weather sirocco wind and leaden sky The Lisbon shock came without a warning Sudden changes of the weather however often occur after an earthquake Since the great convulsion of seventeen ninety seven the climate of the Valley of Quito is said to be much colder A heavy rain often follows a violent earthquake in Peru Footnote ninety six Professor Quinby of the University of Rochester has at our request calculated the position of the moon at the late earthquake August sixteenth eighteen sixty eight one A M the moon was on meridian one hundred thirty seven deg twenty one east of that of Quito or forty two deg thirty past the lower meridian of Quito assuming the longitude of Quito west of Greenwich to be seventy nine deg which it is very nearly This is but little after the vertex of the tidal wave should have passed the meridian of Quito on the supposition that the interior of the earth is a liquid mass The age of the moon at that time was twenty seven point thirty six days i e it was only about two days before new moon At the time of the earthquake eight A M March twenty two eighteen fifty nine the moon was on meridian twenty five deg forty eight east of that of Quito and was seventeen point six days old Shocks have since occurred March twentieth at three A M and April tenth at eight A M eighteen sixty nine No amount of familiarity with earthquakes enables one to laugh during the shock or even at the subterranean thunders which sound like the clanking of chains in the realm of Pluto All animated nature is terror stricken The horse trembles in his stall the cow moans a low melancholy tune the dog sends forth an unearthly yell sparrows drop from the trees as if dead crocodiles leave the trembling bed of the river and run with loud cries into the forest and man himself becomes bewildered and loses all capacity When the earth rocks beneath our feet the motion resembling in the words of Darwin that felt by a person skating over thin ice which bends under the weight of his body something besides giddiness is produced We feel our utter insignificance in the presence of a mysterious power that shakes the Andes like a reed But more there is an awful sensation of insecurity A moment says Humboldt destroys the illusion of a whole life our deceptive faith in the repose of nature vanishes and we feel transported as it were into a region of unknown destructive forces A judgment day seems impending and each moment is an age when one stands on a world convulsed CHAPTER XI The Province of the Orient or the Wild Napo Country The Napos Zaparos and Jivaros Indians Preparations to cross the Continent On the eastern slope of the Ecuadorian Andes between the Maranon and its tributary the Putumayo lies the Napo country This almost unknown region has the area of New York and New England together The government of Quito by a sonorous decree in eighteen fifty four baptized it La Provincia del Oriente Peru likewise claims it but neither republic has done any thing to colonize it A dense primeval forest broken only by the rivers covers the whole territory and is the home of wild races untouched by civilization ninety seven There is not a road in the whole province A footpath open only in the dry season and barely passable then connects Quito and the Rio Napo Congress lately promised to put Canelos in communication with the capital but the largest villages in this vast and fertile region Archidona Canelos and Macas still remain isolated from the outer world ninety eight Ecuador once appointed a functionary under the high sounding title of Governor of the Orient with a salary of seven hundred dollars but now the Indians are not troubled with any higher official than an alcalde Footnote ninety seven The boundary line between Ecuador and Peru is about as indefinite as the eastern limit of Bolivia Brazilians claiming as far west as the cattle of the empire roam Footnote ninety eight Quito might be made more accessible on the Atlantic than on the Pacific side But Ecuadorians dote on Guayaquil and refuse to connect themselves directly with the great nations of the East We believe there is a glorious future for Quito when it will once more become a city of palaces But it will not come until a road through the wilderness and a steamer on the Napo open a short communication with the wealth of Amazonia and the enterprise of Europe The country is very thinly inhabited The chief tribes are the semi Christianized Napos sometimes called Quijos dwelling on the north bank of the Napo the peaceful but uncivilized Zaparos living between the Napo and Pastassa and the warlike Jivaros spread over the unexplored region between the Pastassa and Santiago These oriental tribes would probably be assigned by D Orbigny to the Antisian branch of the Alpine races of South America Dwelling amid the darkness of primeval forests and on the gloomy banks of mountain torrents they have acquired modifications of character physical and moral which distinguish them from the natives of the high and open regions or the steaming lowlands of the Amazon In color however they do not appear to us to be entitled to the name of white men they approach nearer to the bronze complexion of the Quichuans than the yellow cast of the Brazilians We see no evidence of that bleaching process resulting from a life under the dense canopy of foliage of which the learned French naturalist speaks neither did we perceive the force of his statement that the color of the South American bears a very decided relation to the humidity of the atmosphere The features of the Napo Indians are Quichuan especially the low forehead squarely built face and dull expression but in stature they exceed the mountaineers From a skull in our possession we take the following measurements adding for comparison the dimensions of an ancient Peruvian cranium in doctor Morton s collection Napo Peruvian Longitudinal diameter six one two in six point one in Parietal five three eight six Frontal four four point seven Vertical four one two five point five Capacity eighty three one sixty four cub in eighty three cub in Facial angle seventy deg eighty one deg From this it will be seen that the capacity of this individual Napo is eight cubic inches greater than the average bulk seventy five cubic inches of the old Peruvians a trifle less than the average North American eighty four ten cubic inches less than the European ninety four and the same as the average Polynesian and native African He has a rounded head somewhat prominent vertex not an excessive protuberance of brain behind a line through the meatus dividing it into very nearly equal parts but a narrow front as viewed from above small vertical diameter quadrangular orbits vertical teeth and low facial angle These characters place him between the Toltecan and the more barbarous tribes of the New World The Napos are nominally subject to the Ecuadorian government which is represented by three or four petty alcaldes but the Jesuit missionaries who have established a bishopric and three curacies generally control affairs spiritual political and commercial The Indians of each village annually elect one of their number governor who serves without salary and whose only show of authority is a silver headed cane about four feet long He is attended by half a dozen justices whose duty it is to supply the curate alcalde and any traveling blanco who may happen to be in town with daily food at a reasonable rate The religion of the Napos is a mixture of Paganism and Christianity In common with all the other orient tribes they believe in good and evil principles and in metempsychosis They swear in the name of the devil They bury their dead horizontally in a coffin made of a part of a canoe with a lid of bamboo They are very kind to the aged Monogamy is the rule the usual age of wedlock is sixteen or seventeen The parents negotiate the marriage and the curate s fee is one castellano three dollars fifty cents When a person dies they hold an Irish wake over the body and then take the widow to the river and wash her They have seven semi religious feasts in a year To us they appeared to be nothing more than meaningless drunken frolics Attired in their best with head dresses consisting of a circlet of short richly colored feathers from the breast of the toucan surmounted with the long tail feathers of the macaw and with necklaces of beads seeds and monkeys teeth they keep up a constant monotonous tapping on little drums and trot around a circle like dogs on a treadmill stopping only to drink chicha This is kept up for three weeks when they all start off with wives and children for the forest to hunt monkeys for meat Chicha the favorite drink of all the Andean Indians is here brewed from yuca not from corn and barley as in the Quito Valley So true is it as Humboldt remarks that almost every where man finds means of preparing some kind of beverage from the vegetable kingdom The Chilotans Darwin informs us make chicha from a species of Bromelia In every zone too we find nations in a low degree of civilization living almost exclusively upon a single animal or plant Thus the Laplander has his reindeer the Esquimaux his seal the Sandwich Islander his tara root the Malay his sago palm the Napo Indian his yuca Yuca is the staple food in this region It is more commonly roasted but is sometimes ground into flour The manufacture of chicha is primitive and not a little disgusting A bee usually old women sit around a wooden trough each one takes a mouthful of yuca root and masticating it throws it into the trough The mass is then transferred to large earthen jars containing water and left to ferment The liquor is slightly acid but not intoxicating unless taken in excess This is done on feast days when the poor Indian keeps his stomach so constantly distended for weeks that the abdominal protrusion is not only unsightly but alarming to a stranger Chicha drinking is a part of the worship of these simple aborigines They seem to think that the more happy they make themselves while paying their devotions to the Creator the better he is satisfied The Jesuits have found it impossible to change this method of praise Here as among all rude nations an ancient custom is one half the religion In eating meat usually monkey sea cow and peccari we observed that they did not tear or bite it but putting one end of a long piece in the mouth cut off what they could not get in as Darwin noticed among the Fuegians They keep no domestic animals except fowls As to dress they make use of a coarse cotton cloth called lienzo woven by the more enlightened Indians of Quito dyeing it a dull brown by means of achote juice The men wear a strip of this around the loins and the women a short skirt On feast days or when musquitoes are thick the men add a little poncho and pantaloons They do not properly tattoo but color the skin with achote or anatto This substance which serves so many purposes in this part of the world is the red powder which covers the seeds contained in the prickly bur of the Bixa orellana The pigment is an article of commerce on the Amazon and is exported to Europe where it is used for coloring butter cheese and varnish They have no fixed pattern each paints to suit his fancy Usually however they draw horizontal bands from the month to the ears and across the forehead we never saw curved lines in which higher savages like the Tahitians tattoo The Napos have the provoking apathy of all the New World aborigines As Humboldt observed of another tribe their poverty stoicism and uncultivated state render them so rich and so free from wants of every kind that neither money nor other presents will induce them to turn three steps out of their ways They maintain a passive dignity in their bearing not seen in the proudest pope or emperor They seldom laugh or smile even under the inspiration of chicha and months of intercourse with them did not discover to us the power of song though Villavicencio says they do sometimes intone fragments of prose in their festival orgies They manifest little curiosity and little power of mimicry in which wild men generally excel the civilized ninety nine The old Spartans were never so laconic In conversation each says all he has to say in three or four words till his companion speaks when he replies in the same curt ejaculatory style A long sentence or a number of sentences at one time we do not remember of hearing from the lips of a Napo Indian one hundred Footnote ninety nine All savages appear to possess to an uncommon degree the power of mimicry Darwin Footnote one hundred Gibbon observes of his Indian paddlers on the Marmore They talk very little they silently pull along as though they were sleeping but their eyes are wandering all the time in every direction The women do most of the work while their lazy lords drink up the chicha and swing in their hammocks or possibly do a little hunting one hundred one They catch fish with bone hooks seines spears and by poisoning the water with barbasco one hundred two This last method is quite common throughout equatorial America Mashing the root they throw it into the quiet coves of the river when almost immediately the fish rise to the surface first the little fry and then the larger specimens The poison seems to stupefy rather than kill for we observed that some individuals behaved in a most lively manner shortly after they were caught The Indians drink the water with impunity Footnote one hundred one Some of these feminines however have a method of retaliation which happily does not exist further north They render their husbands idiotic by giving them an infusion of floripondio and then choose another consort We saw a sad example of this near Riobamba and heard of one husband who after being thus treated unconsciously served his wife and her new man like a slave Floripondio is the seed of the Datura sanguinea which is allied to the poisonous stramonium used by the priests of Apollo at Delphi to produce their frantic ravings Footnote one hundred two Jacquinia armillaris an evergreen bush The Indians on the Tapajos use a poisonous liana called timbo Paullinia pinnata The Napos are not brave their chief weapons for hunting are spears of chonta wood and blowpipes bodaqueras made of a small palm having a pith which when removed leaves a polished bore or of two separate lengths of wood each scooped out with patient labor and considerable skill by means of the incisor teeth of a rodent The whole is smeared with black wax a mouth piece fitted to the larger end and a sight made of bone imbedded in the wax Through this tube about ten feet long they blow slender arrows cut from the leaf stalks of a palm These are winged with a tuft of silk cotton common cotton would be too heavy and poisoned with urari of which we shall speak hereafter This noiseless gun is universally used on the Upper Amazon one hundred three Footnote one hundred three It is there called zarabatana or gravatana by the Peruvians pucuna It corresponds to the sumpitan of Borneo It is difficult to recognize the use of the blow gun but the natives will kill at the distance of one hundred fifty feet One which we brought home sent the slender arrow through the panel of a door The Zaparos in physiognomy somewhat resemble the Chinese having a middle stature round face small eyes set angularly and a broad flat nose Their language is of simple construction but nasal and guttural They have no words for numbers above three but show their fingers above ten they know nothing They take to themselves single names not double They reckon time by moons and the ripening of certain fruits Their name for God is Piatzo but we could not learn that it conveyed any distinct idea They believe the evil spirit Mungia is a black spectre dwelling in the woods They think the souls of the good and brave enter beautiful birds and feed on delicious fruits while cowardly souls become dirty reptiles Polygamy is common They bury in the sitting posture with the hammock of the deceased wrapped around him The very old men are buried with the mouth downward They make use of a narcotic drink called Ayahuasca which produces effects similar to those of opium The Zaparos are pacific and hospitable but there is little social life among them they never cluster into large villages but inhabit isolated ranchos Nomadic in their habits they wander along the banks of the Napo between the Andes and the Maranon They manufacture from the twisted fibre of the chambiri palm one hundred four most of the twine and hammocks seen in Eastern Ecuador Their government is patriarchal Footnote one hundred four This thorny palm is called tucum in Brazil The fibres of the budding top are used A woman will twist a hundred yards of twine a day and make a living by selling hammocks for twenty five cents a piece The Jivaros or Red Indians par excellence are the most numerous and the most spirited of the oriental tribes They are brave and resentful yet hospitable and industrious While the Napos and Zaparos live in rude often temporary huts of split bamboo the warlike Jivaros erect houses of hard wood with strong doors Blood relations live together on the communal principle the women keeping the rear half of the house which is divided by a partition Many Jivaros approach the Caucasian type the beard and lighter skin hinting a percentage of Spanish blood for this tribe was never conquered by the Incas nor did it brook Spanish avarice and cruelty but in one terrible conflict fifteen ninety nine the intruder was swept out of existence The wives of the El Dorado adventurers spent the rest of their days in the harems of the Jivaros These Indians have the singular custom and art of compressing the heads of their notable captives taking off the skin entire and drying it over a small mould they have a hideous mummy which preserves all the features of the original face but on a reduced scale one hundred five They also braid the long black hair of their foes into girdles which they wear as mementoes of their prowess They use chonta lances with triangular points notched and poisoned and shields of wood or hide They have a telegraphic system which enables them to concentrate their forces quickly in time of war large drums are placed on the tops of the hills and a certain number of strokes repeated along the line rapidly convey intelligence to the most distant habitation Footnote one hundred five Bates ii one hundred thirty two speaks of a similar custom among the ancient Mundurucus They used to sever the head with knives made of broad bamboo and then after taking out the brain and fleshy parts soak it in bitter vegetable oils and expose it several days over the smoke of a fire or in the sun An odd custom prevails among these wild Indians when an addition is made to the family circle The woman goes into the woods alone and on her return washes herself and new born babe in the river then the husband immediately takes to his bed for eight days during which time the wife serves him on the choicest dainties she can procure one hundred six They have also the unique practice of exchanging wives The Jivaro speech is sonorous and energetic They do not use salt so that they distinguish the Napo tribes as the Indians who eat salt The chief articles manufactured by them are cotton goods and blowpipes They trade mostly at Canelos and Macas generally purchasing iron implements such as hatchets and knives Footnote one hundred six A like custom existed among some Brazilian and Guiana tribes It also prevailed to some extent among the ancient Cantabrians and Corsicans the Congos and Tartars and in the Southern French provinces Canelos consists of about seventy families of Quichua speaking Indians and lies on the south bank of the Bobonaza A trail connects it with Banos at the foot of Tunguragua Canelos was founded in fifteen thirty six and derives its name from its situation in the Canela or American cinnamon forest The bark of the tree has the flavor of the Ceylon aromatic but according to doctor Taylor it is cassia Macas in the days of Spanish adventure a prosperous city under the name of Sevilla de Oro is now a cluster of huts on the banks of the Upano Its trade is in tobacco vanilla canela wax and copal The Spaniards took the trouble to transplant some genuine cinnamon trees from Ceylon to this locality and they flourished for a time On the thirtieth of October we left Quito on our march across the continent by the way of the Napo wilderness The preparations for our departure however commenced long before that date To leave Quito in any direction is the work of time But to plunge into that terra incognita el Oriente where for weeks perhaps months we should be lost to the civilized world and cut off from all resources east or west demanded more calculation and providence than a voyage round the world We were as long preparing for our journey to the Amazon as in making it In the first place not a man in Quito could give us a single item of information on the most important and dangerous part of our route Quitonians are not guilty of knowing any thing about trans Andine affairs or oriental geography From a few petty traders who had to the amazement of their fellow citizens traversed the forest and reached the banks of the Napo we gleaned some information which was of service But on the passage down the Napo from Santa Rosa to the Maranon a distance of over five hundred miles nobody had any thing to say except the delightful intelligence that in all probability if we escaped the fever we would be murdered by the savages The information we received was about as definite and reliable as Herndon obtained respecting any tributary to the Lower Amazon It runs a long way up it has rapids savages live upon its banks every thing grows there From M Gillette a Swiss gentleman trading at Para in Moyabamba hats we learned about the movements of the Peruvian steamer on the Maranon but how long it would take us to cross the mountains and the forest and descend the river we must find out by trial The commissary department was of primal importance As from all we could learn we could not depend upon obtaining supplies from the Indians or with our guns one hundred seven it was necessary to take provisions to last till we should reach the Maranon But how long we should be in the forest and on the river or what allowance to make for probable delays it was impossible to prophesy The utmost caution and forethought were therefore needed for to die of starvation in the wilderness was for all practical purposes equivalent to falling into the hands of cannibals As it turned out however we made a most fortunate hit for on arriving at Pebas the first village on the Maranon we found we had just enough solid food left to have one grand jubilee dinner Footnote one hundred seven The scarcity of game is well illustrated by the fate of Pizarro and his comrades In returning from their expedition to the Napo country they nearly perished with hunger living on lizards dogs horses saddles sword belts et cetera and reached Quito looking more like spectres than men For the benefit of future travelers and for the curiosity of others we give the bill of fare we provided for this journey stomachs five time forty two days Flour one hundred lbs Corn meal twenty seven Pea flour thirty Mashka forty seven Crackers one hundred Rice fifty Sugar ninety Chocolate twenty five Dried meat one hundred eight forty seven Salt ten Lard ten Cream tartar one one two Soda one Tea two Ham ten Tamarinds nine Eggs one hundred seventy Anisado pts five Footnote one hundred eight Jerked beef as it is called in South America consists of thin strips cut off the carcass after skinning and dried in the sun The butchers do not distinguish between sirloin and round To this we added by purchase from the Indians a few chickens and eggs five gallons of sirup and a peck of rice and on the river we helped ourselves to a little wild game as fish peccari deer and turtles eggs But these made only a drop in the commissary bucket had we depended upon finding provisions on the road we must have perished from sheer hunger Game in the dry season is exceedingly scarce Our provisions were packed in kerosene cans a part of which were soldered up to keep out moisture for the Valley of the Napo is a steaming vapor bath and to keep out the hands of Indians More than once have these treacherous yet indispensable guides robbed the white man of his food and then left him to his fate we lost not a pound by theft A four gallon keg of aguardiente one hundred nine from which we dealt out half a gill daily to each man kept our Indians in good humor Footnote one hundred nine This is the rum of the Andes corresponding to the cashaca of Brazil It is distilled from sugar cane When double distilled and flavored with anise it is called anisado As we must ascend to the cold altitude of fifteen thousand feet and then descend to the hot Valley of the Amazon we were obliged to carry both woolen and cotton garments besides rubber ponchos to shield them from the rain by day and to form the first substratum of our bed at night Two suits were needed in our long travel afoot through the forest one kept dry for the nightly bivouac the other for day service At the close of each day s journey we doffed every thread of our wearing apparel and donned the reserved suit for we were daily drenched either from the heavens above or by crossing swollen rivers and seas of mud Then too as boots would not answer for such kind of travel we must take alpargates a native sandal made of the aloe fibre and of these not a few for a pair would hardly hold together two days Two bales of lienzo besides knives fish hooks thread beads looking glasses and other trinkets were also needed for the Napo Indians must be paid in such currency There lienzo not gold and silver is the cry On this we made a small but lawful profit paying in Quito eighteen cents per yard and charging on the river twenty five An extensive culinary apparatus guns and ammunition taxidermal and medicinal chests physical instruments including a photographic establishment rope macheta axe saw nails candles matches and a thousand et caetera completed our outfit Among the essential et caetera were generous passports and mandatory letters from the President of Ecuador and the Peruvian Charge d Affaires addressed to all authorities on the Napo and the Maranon They were obligingly procured for us by Senor Hurtado the Chilian minister then acting for the United States through the influence of a communication from our own government and were of great value to the

Papallacta Domiciled at the Governor s An Indian Aristides Our Peon Train In the Wilderness Forty miles east southeast of Quito on the eastern slope of the Eastern Cordillera and on the western edge of the great forest is the Indian village of Papallacta From the capital to this point there is a path just passable for horses but thence to the Napo travelers must take to their feet Through the intervention of the curate of Papallacta who has great influence over his wild people but who has wit enough to reside in Quito instead of his parish we engaged the Indian governor to send over thirteen beasts and three peons to carry our party and baggage to Papallacta Wednesday morning the quadrupeds were at the door of our hotel five of them bestias de silla These horses judging by size color shape and bony prominences were of five different species The saddles likewise differed from one another and from any thing we had ever seen or desired to see One of them was so narrow and deep none of us could get into it so filling up the cavity with blankets we took turns in riding on the summit By noon October thirtieth we had seen our Andean collections in the hands of arrieros bound for Guayaquil whence they were to be shipped by way of Panama to Washington and our baggage train for Napo headed toward the rising sun So mounting our jades we defiled across the Grand Plaza and through the street of saint Augustine and down the Carniceria to the Alameda amid the vivas and adeos of our Quitonian friends who turned out to see the largest expedition that ever left the city for the wild Napo country since the days of Pizarro Few there were who expected to hear of our safe arrival on the shores of the Atlantic Crossing the magnificent plain of Inaquito we reached in an hour the romantic village of Guapulo Here is an elegant stone church dedicated to the Virgin of Guadaloupe to which the faithful make an annual pilgrimage Thence the road led us through the valley of the Guaillabamba a tributary to the Esmeraldas here and there blessed with signs of intelligent life a mud hut and little green fields of cane and alfalfa and dotted with trees of wild cherry and myrtle but having that air of sadness and death like repose so inseparable from a Quitonian landscape The greater part of this day s ride was over a rolling country so barren and dreary it was almost repulsive What a pity the sun shines on so much useless territory Just before sunset we arrived at Itulcachi a great cattle estate at the foot of the eastern chain of mountains The hacienda had seen better days and was poorly fitted to entertain man or beast The major domo however managed to make some small potato soup and find us shelter for the night In the room allotted us there were three immense kneading troughs and two bread boards to match for a grist mill and bakery were connected with the establishment In default of beds we made use of this furniture Five wiser men have slept in better berths but few have slept more soundly than we did in the bread trays of Itulcachi The following day we advanced five miles to Tablon an Indian hamlet on the mountain side Here we waited over night for our cargo train which had loitered on the road This was the only spot in South America where we found milk to our stomachs content Itulcachi with its herds of cattle did not yield a drop Our dormitory was a mud hovel without an aperture for light or ventilation and in this dark hole we all slept on a heap of barley Splendid was the view westward from Tablon Below us were the beautiful valleys of Chillo and Puembo separated by the isolated mountain of Ilalo around them in an imposing semicircle stood Cayambi Imbabura Pichincha Corazon Iliniza Ruminagui Cotopaxi Sincholagua and Antisana As the sun went down in his glory behind the western range the rocky head of Pichincha stood out in bold relief and cast a long shadow over the plain At this halting place we made the mortifying discovery that the bare legged Indian who had trotted by our side as a guide and body servant and whom we had ordered about with all the indifference of a surly slaveholder was none other than his Excellency Eugenio Mancheno governor of Papallacta After this we were more respectful The next morning our baggage having come up we pushed up the mountain through a grand ravine and over metamorphic rocks standing on their edges with a wavy strike till we reached a polylepis grove twelve thousand feet above the sea We lunched under the wide spreading branches of these gnarled and twisted trees which reminded us of the patriarchal olives in the Garden of Gethsemane and then ascending over the monotonous paramo we stood at the elevation of fifteen thousand feet on the narrow summit of the Guamani ridge Some priest had been before us and planted a cross by the roadside to guide and bless the traveler on his way Of the magnificent prospect eastward over the beginning of the Amazonian Valley which this lofty point commands we have already spoken There was a wild grandeur in the scene mountain behind mountain with deep intervening valleys all covered with one thick unbroken mass of foliage A tiny brook the child of everlasting snows still higher up murmured at our feet as if to tell us that we were on the Atlantic slope and then dashed into the great forest to lose itself in the mighty Amazon and be buried with it in the same ocean grave The trade wind too came rushing by us fresh from that sea of commerce which laves the shores of two worlds Guamani gave us also our finest view of Antisana its snow white dome rising out of a wilderness of mountains and presenting on the north side a profile of the human face divine And now we rapidly descended by a steep narrow path and over paramo and bog to a little tambo where we had the luxury of sleeping on a bed of straw Here we made the acquaintance of two Indians from the Napo who were on the way to Quito with the mail probably half a dozen letters A strip of cloth around the loins and a short cape just covering the shoulders were all their habiliments We noticed that they never sat down though a bench was close by them they would squat for an hour at a time The day following we took our last horseback ride in South America It was short but horrible Through quagmire and swamp and down a flight of rocky stairs in striking imitation of General Putnam s famous ride over rocks too made wondrously slippery by a pitiless rain but which our unshod Indian horses descended with great dexterity only one beast and his rider taking a somerset thus we traveled two hours reaching Papallacta at eleven A M We put up at the governor s This edifice the best in town had sides of upright poles stuccoed with mud a thatched roof and ground floor on which between three stones a fire was built for cookery and comfort Three or four earthen kettles and as many calabashes and wooden spoons were the sum total of kitchen utensils A large flat stone with another smaller one to rub over it was the mill for grinding corn and we were astonished to see how quickly our hostess reduced the grains to an impalpable meal The only thing that looked like a bed was a stiff rawhide thrown over a series of round poles running lengthwise This primitive couch and likewise the whole house the obsequious governor gave up to us insisting upon sleeping with his wife and little ones outside though the nights were cold and uncomfortable Parents and children were of the earth earthy unwashed uncombed and disgustingly filthy We found the governor one day taking lice for his lunch Sitting behind his little boy he picked out the little parasites with his nails and crushed them between his teeth with a look of satisfaction Eating lice is an old Indian custom and universal in the Andes In Inca times it was considered an infallible remedy against sore eyes We have seen half a dozen women sitting on the ground in a row picking out vermin from each other s heads We thought the arrangement was a little unfair for the first in the series had no lice to eat and the animals were left to roam undisturbed in the capillary forest of the last Papallacta is a village of thirty dwellings situated in a deep valley on the north slope of Antisana nearly surrounded by an amphitheatre of sandstone and basaltic precipices Here too is the terminus of the fourth great lava stream from the volcano it is not mentioned by Humboldt Papallacta is a thousand feet higher than Quito yet vegetation is more tropical Its name signifies the potato country but not a potato could we find here Though Mancheno was governor he was not really the greatest man in Papallacta This was Carlos Caguatijo he was the ruling man for he could read write and speak Spanish while the governor knew nothing but Quichua Carlos moreover was a good man he had an honest Quaker like air about him and his face reminded us of George Washington s In all his transactions we noticed no attempt to prevaricate or deceive what he promised he performed to the letter It was refreshing to meet one such upright soul in Ecuador though we found him not of Caucasian blood nor dwelling under the tiled roofs of the proud capital The old man was the spiritual father of Papallacta and in the absence of the curate officiated in the little church With him therefore and not with our host the governor we negotiated for peons to take us through the wilderness The journey from Papallacta to the Napo occupied us thirteen days including four days of rest It was performed on foot for the road is a trail But the untraveled reader can have little idea of a trail in a tropical forest fording bridgeless rivers wading through interminable bogs fens marshes quagmires and swamps and cutting one s way through dense vegetation must be done to be understood Half the year there is no intercourse between Quito and its Oriental province for the incessant heavy rains of summer swell every rivulet into a furious torrent and the path is overgrown and rendered impassable even by an Indian The only time for travel is between November and April for then though it rains nearly every day the clouds drop down in showers not floods But even then the traveler must sometimes wait two or three weeks beside a swollen river in imminent danger of starving and throughout the journey entertain the comforting prospect that his Indians may eat up his provisions to lighten their load or suddenly desert him as they did doctor Jameson There are other routes across South America much more feasible than the one we chose these will be described in Chapter XXIII But they all yield in interest to this passage along the equatorial line and especially in the line of history Who has not heard of Gonzalo Pizarro and his fatal yet famous expedition into the land of cinnamon How he was led farther and farther into the wilderness by the glittering illusions of an El Dorado one hundred eleven till the faithless Orellana deserting him floated down the Napo and made the magnificent discovery of the mighty Amazon Gonzalo who was held to be the best lancer that ever went to these countries and all confess that he never showed his back to the enemy returned to Quito with a few survivors to tell a tale of almost unparalleled suffering A century elapsed fifteen thirty sixteen thirty seven before any one ascended from Para to Quito by way of the Rio Napo this was accomplished by Pedro Teixeira Illustration Napo Peon Footnote one hundred eleven The king of this fabulous land was said to wear a magnificent attire fragrant with a costly gum and sprinkled with gold dust His palace was of porphyry and alabaster and his throne of ivory An Indian will carry three arrobas seventy five pounds besides his own provisions his provisions for the journey consisting of about twenty five pounds of roasted corn and barley meal The trunk or bundle is bound to his back by withes which pass across the forehead and chest a poncho or a handful of leaves protects the bare back from chafing All our luggage amounting to nearly fifteen hundred pounds was divided and packed to suit this method of transportation so that we required twenty Indians So many however of the right kind for they must be athletic young men to endure the fatigues of such a journey could not be furnished by the little village of Papallacta so we were obliged to wait a few days till more Indians could be summoned from a neighboring town When these arrived the little world of Papallacta men women and children assembled in front of the governor s house while Don Carlos sat by our side on a raised seat by the doorway A long parley ensued resulting in this that we should pay one hundred Ecuadorian dollars for the transfer of our baggage to Archidona while Carlos solemnly promised for the young men that they should start the next morning that they should arrive at Archidona within a stipulated time and that they should not depend upon us for an ounce of food The powerful influence of the curate which we had secured and the proclamation from the president which Carlos read aloud in the ears of all the people together with the authoritative charge of Carlos himself had the desired effect not a transportation company in the United States ever kept its engagement more faithfully than did these twenty peons and this too though we paid them in advance according to the custom of the country Upon a blanket spread at our feet the money was counted out and Carlos slowly distributed it with a grave and reverend air to every Indian five dollars one hundred twelve Footnote one hundred twelve We give below the autograph of this wisest man in all the Oriente Recibio del Senor James Orton la suma de centos one hundred pesos por vente twenty peones hasta Archidona Illustration reproduction of a signature is here Papallacta four Nov eighteen sixty seven Tuesday morning November fifth the peons promptly shouldered their burdens and we shod with alpargates and with Alpine staff in hand more needed here than in Switzerland followed after leaving the governor to sleep inside his mansion and to eat his lice unmolested On a little grassy knoll just outside the town our train halted for a moment the Indians to take their fill of chicha and bid their friends good by and we to call the roll and take an inventory Our leader was Isiro a bright intelligent finely featured stalwart Indian He could speak Spanish and his comrades acknowledged his superiority with marked deference Ten women and children followed us for two days to relieve the men of their burdens Their assistance was not needed in the latter part of the journey for our keen appetites rapidly lightened the provision cans Starting again we plunged at once into the forest taking a northeasterly course along the left bank of a tributary to the Coca The ups and downs of this day s travel of twelve miles were foreshadowings of what might come in our views afoot in South America We encamped at a spot the Indians called Maspa Herndon says The Peruvian Indians take no account of time or distance they stop when they get tired and arrive when God pleases one hundred thirteen But our Napo companions measured distance by hours quite accurately and they always traveled as far as we were willing to follow In ten minutes they built us a booth for the night driving two crotchets into the ground they joined them with a ridge pole against which they inclined a number of sticks for rafters These they covered with palm leaves so adroitly put together that our roof was generally rain proof After ablution and an entire change of garments we built a fire using for fuel a green tree called sindicaspi meaning the wood that burns a special provision in these damp forests where every thing is dripping with moisture The fall of a full grown tree under the strokes of a Yankee axe was a marvel in the eyes of our Indians Our second day s journey was far more difficult than the first the path winding up steep mountains and down into grand ravines for we were crossing the outlying spurs of the Eastern Cordillera Every where the track was slippery with mud and often we sank two feet into the mire How devoutly we did wish that the Ecuadorian Congress was compelled to travel this horrid road once a year At ten o clock we reached a lone habitation called Guila where wooden bowls are made for the Quito market Here we procured a fresh Indian to take the place of one of our peons who had given out under his burden We advanced this day sixteen miles in ten hours sleeping under an old bamboo hut beside a babbling brook bearing the euphonious name of Pachamama Footnote one hundred thirteen Distance is frequently estimated by the time that a man will occupy in taking a chew of coca or thirty seven one two minutes Herndon CHAPTER XIII Baeza The Forest Crossing the Cosanga Curi urcu Archidona Appearance Customs and Belief of the Natives Napo and Napo River Eight hours hard travel from Pachamama brought us to Baeza This Antigua Ciudad as Villavicencio calls it was founded in fifteen fifty two by Don Egilio Ramirez Davalos and named after the quite different spot where Scipio the Younger routed Asdrubal a thousand years before It consists of two habitations the residence of two families of Tumbaco Indians situated in a clearing of the forest on the summit of a high ridge running along the right bank of the Coca This point about one hundred miles east of Quito is important in the little traffic of the Oriente All Indian trains from the capital to the province pass through Baeza where the trail divides one branch passing on easterly to San Jose and thence down through Abila and Loreto to Santa Rosa the other leading to the Napo through Archidona Here we rested one day taking possession of one half of the larger hut a mere stockade with a palm leaf roof without chairs chimney or fire place except any place on the floor We swung our hammocks while our Indians stretched themselves on the ground beneath us The island of Juan Fernandez is not a more isolated spot than Baeza A dense forest impenetrable save by the trails stretches away on every side to the Andes and to the Atlantic and northerly and southerly along the slope of the entire mountain chain The forest is such an entangled mass of the living and the fallen it is difficult to say which is the predominant spirit life or death It is the cemetery as well as the birthplace of a world of vegetation The trees are more lofty than on the Lower Amazon and straight as an arrow but we saw none of remarkable size A perpetual mist seems to hang on the branches and the dense foliage forms dark lofty vaults which the sunlight never enters The soil and air are always cool and never dry Every thing is penetrated with dampness All our watches stopped and remained immovable till we reached Para It is this constant and excessive humidity which renders it so difficult to transport provisions or prepare an herbarium The pending branches of moss are so saturated with moisture that sometimes the branches are broken off to the peril of the passing traveler Yet the climate is healthy The stillness and gloom are almost painful the firing of a gun wakes a dull echo and any unlooked for noise is startling Scarce a bird or a flower is to be seen in these sombre shades Nearly the only signs of animal life visible thus far were insects mostly butterflies fire flies and beetles The only quadruped seen on our journey to the Napo was a long tailed marten caught by the Indians The silence is almost perfect its chief interruption is the crashing fall of some old patriarch of the forest overcome by the embrace of loving parasites that twine themselves about the trunk or sit upon the branches The most striking singularity in these tropical woods is the host of lianas or air roots of epiphytous plants which hang down from the lofty boughs straight as plumb lines some singly others in clusters some reaching half way to the ground others touching it and striking their rootlets into the earth We found lianas over one hundred feet long Sometimes a toppling tree is caught in the graceful arms of looping sipos and held for years by this natural cable It is these dead trunks standing like skeletons which give a character of solemnity to these primeval woods The wildest disorder is seen along the mountain torrents where the trees prostrated by the undermining current lie mingled with huge stones brought down by the force of the water In many places the crowns of stately monarchs standing on the bank interlock and form a sylvan arch over the river We left Baeza by the southerly trail for Archidona From Papallacta we had traveled east or parallel to the streams which flow down from the mountains We were now to cross them and their name is legion as also the intervening ridges so that our previous journey was nothing to that which followed Sometimes we were climbing up an almost vertical ascent then descending into a deep dark ravine to ford a furious river while on the lowlands the path seemed lost in a jungle of bamboos till our Indian bushwhackers opened a passage with their machetas and we crept under a low arcade of foliage This day we enjoyed something unusual in our forest trail a distant view The path brought us to the verge of a mountain whence we could look down on the savage valley of the Cosanga and upward to the dazzling dome of Antisana it was our farewell view of that glorious volcano At the distance of twelve miles from Baeza we reached the banks of the Rio Cosanga camping at a spot called Chiniplaya This is the river so much dreaded by Indians and whites traversing the Napo wilderness It is fearfully rapid a very Tigris from its source to its junction with the Coca The large smooth boulders strewn along its bed show its power Here sixty miles from its origin in the glaciers of Antisana it is seventy five feet wide but in the wet season it is one hundred yards The day following we threaded our difficult way a via dolorosa fifteen miles up the left bank of the Cosanga where we crossed and camped on the opposite side The Indians had thrown a log over the deepest part of the river and the rest we forded without much danger but that very night the rain raised the river to such a magnitude that the little bridge was carried off Had we been one day later we might have waited a week on the other side of the impassable gulf Between this point where we forded and Chiniplaya fifteen miles below the barometer indicated a fall of five hundred feet The roar of the rushing waters is like that of the sea In the beautiful language of Darwin Journal p three hundred sixteen The sound spoke eloquently to the geologist the thousands and thousands of stones which striking against each other made the one dull uniform sound were all hurrying in one direction It was like thinking on time when the minute that now glides past is irrecoverable So was it with these stones The ocean is their eternity and each note of that wild music told of one more step toward their destiny On account of the heavy rain and the sickness of a peon whom finally we were obliged to leave behind we rested one day but on the morrow we traveled fourteen miles crossing the lofty Guacamayo ridge one hundred fourteen fording at much risk the deep Cochachimbamba and camping at a spot the Indians have a name for almost any locality in the forest called Guayusapugaru The next day we must have advanced twenty miles besides crossing the furious Hondachi This river was very much swollen by the rains and it was only by the aid of a rope that we made the passage One stout Indian was carried down stream but soon recovered himself Footnote one hundred fourteen Humboldt speaks of this as an active volcano from which detonations are heard almost daily We heard nothing It is possible that he meant Guamani As we had lowered our altitude since leaving Papallacta seven thousand feet the climate was much warmer and vegetation more prolific Nowhere else between the Andes and the Atlantic did we notice such a majestic forest The tree ferns ennobled by the tropical sun and soil have a palm like appearance but with rougher stems and a usual height of fifty feet Plants akin to our scouring rush rise twenty five feet We saw to day the water tree or huadhuas of the natives a kind of bamboo which sometimes yields between the joints two quarts of clear taste less water Late in the evening we reached an old rancho called Curi urcu the mountain of gold but we had traveled so far ahead of our cargo train we did not see it again till the next morning We were obliged therefore to sleep on the ground in our wet clothes and put up with hard commons half parched corn which our Indian guides gave us and unleavened cakes or flour paste baked on the coals Thence after a short day s journey of ten miles we arrived at Archidona by a path however that was slippery with a soft yellow clay We were a sorry looking company soaked by incessant rains exhausted by perspiration plastered with mud tattered and torn but we were kindly met by the Jesuit bishop who took us to his own habitation where one Indian washed our feet and another prepared a most refreshing drink of guayusa tea We then took up our quarters at the Government House opposite the bishop s sojourning several days on account of our swollen feet and also on account of a swollen river which ran between us and the Napo Here we made a valuable collection of birds lizards fishes and butterflies Archidona is situated in a beautiful plain on the high northern bank of the Misagualli two thousand feet above the Atlantic The site is a cleared spot in the heart of an almost boundless forest and it was a relief not easily conceived to emerge from beneath the dense leafy canopy into this open space and look up to the sky and to the snowy Andes The climate is uniform and delightful the mean annual temperature being seventy seven degrees Sand flies however resembling our punkies abound and the natives are constantly slapping their naked sides eating the little pests as the Papallactans do their lice one hundred fifteen Archidona is the largest village in the Napo country containing about five hundred souls The houses are of split bamboo and palm thatch often hid in a plantation of yuca and plantain The central and most important structure is the little church its rude belfry portico chancel images and other attempts at ornament remind us of the fitting words of missus Agassiz that there is something touching in the idea that these poor uneducated people of the forest have cared to build themselves a temple with their own hands lavishing upon it such ideas of beauty and taste as they have and bringing at least their best to their humble altar Founded by Davalos in fifteen sixty Archidona has been a missionary station for two hundred years The people are child like and docile but the bishop confessed there was no intellectual advance Every morning and evening at the tinkling of a little bell all Archidona assembled in the open porch where the bishop taught them to sing and pray It was a novel sight to see these children of the forest coming out of the woods on all sides and running up to the temple for these natives whenever they move almost invariably go on a run The men are tall and slim and of a dark red color and their legs are bent backward at the knees The governor was the only portly individual we saw The women are short with high shoulders and are very timid they seldom stand erect and with the knees bent forward they run sneakingly to church Their eyes have a characteristic soft drooping look They carry their babes generally on the hip not on the back as in Quito The men are hatless shirtless and shoeless their only garments are short drawers about six inches long and little ponchos both of lienzo dyed a dark purple with achote the red seeds of the bixa which the cooks of Quito use to color their soups All paint their bodies with the same pigment The women wear a frock reaching from the waist to the knees it is nothing more than a yard or two of lienzo wound around the body The Archidonians are the most Christianized of all the Napo Indians but they can not be called religious Their rites they can hardly be said to have a creed are the a b c of Romanism mingled with some strange notions the relics of a lost paganism They are very superstitious and believe as before remarked in the transmigration of souls Maniacs they think are possessed by an evil demon and therefore are treated with great cruelty Negroes of whom a few specimens have come up the Napo from Brazil are held to be under the ban of the Almighty and their color is ascribed to the singeing which they got in the flames of hell They do not believe in disease but like the Mundurucus on the Tapajos say that death is always caused by the sorceries of an enemy They usually bury in the church or in the tambo of the deceased Celibacy and polygamy homicide and suicide are rare Footnote one hundred fifteen The Chasuta Indians Herndon says eat musquitoes that they catch on their bodies with the idea of restoring the blood which the insect has abstracted The only sign of industry in Archidona is the manufacture of pita thread from the aloe It is exported to Quito on human backs The inhabitants also collect copal at the headwaters of the Hondachi and use it for illumination It can be bought in Archidona for three or four cents a pound The gum exudes from a lofty leguminous tree having an oak like bark It resembles the anime of Madagascar rather than the copal of India which flows from an entirely different tree Guayusa or Napo tea is another and celebrated production of Archidona It is the large leaf of a tall shrub growing wild An infusion of guayusa like the mate of Paraguay which belongs to the same genus Ilex is so refreshing it supplies for a long time the place of food The Indians will go to Quito on this beverage alone its virtues being similar to those of coca on the strength of which the posts of the Incas used to travel incredible distances It is by no means however such a stimulant It is a singular fact observes doctor Jameson that tea coffee cacao mate and guayusa contain the same alkaloid caffeine The last however contains only one fifteenth as much of the active principle as tea and no volatile oil Herndon found guayusa on the Ucayali At Archidona we took a new set of peons for Napo as the Papallactans do not travel farther The distance is sixteen miles and the path is comparatively good though it crosses two rivers the Misagualli and Tena On this journey we found the only serpent seen since leaving Quito This solitary specimen was sluggish and harmless but exceedingly beautiful It was the Amphisboena fuliginosa or slow worm It lives in the chambers of the Saueba ants We met a procession of these ants each carrying a circular piece of a leaf vertically over its head These insects are peculiar to tropical America and are much dreaded in Brazil where they soon despoil valuable trees of their foliage They cut the leaves with their scissor like jaws and use them to thatch the domes at the entrance of their subterranean dwellings At Napo we took possession of the governor s house Each village in the Napo province was obliged to build an edifice of split bamboo for that dignitary and as he no longer exists they are left unoccupied They generally stand on the highest and best site in the town and are a god send to travelers Immediately on our arrival the Indian governor and his staff of justices called to see what we wanted and during our stay supplied us with chickens eggs plantains yucas and fuel His excellency would always come silver headed cane in hand though the justices had only six eggs or a single fowl to bring us The alcalde also paid us his respects He is an old blanco as the whites are called doing a little traffic in gold dust lienzo and pita but is the highest representative of Ecuador in the Napo country Here too we met to our great delight mister George Edwards a native of Connecticut who has settled himself probably for life in the depths of this wilderness He was equally rejoiced to see the face and hear the speech of a countryman His industry and upright character have won for him the respect and good will of the Indians and he is favorably known in Quito The government has given him a tract of land on the Yusupino two miles west of Napo village Here he is cultivating vanilla of which he has now three thousand plants and also his patience for six years elapse after transplanting before a pod appears He has been so long in the country thirteen years his English would now and then run off into Spanish or Quichua Napo is prettily situated on the left bank of the Rio Napo a dense forest inclosing it on every side The maximum number of inhabitants is eighty families but many of these are in town only in festival seasons It was well for us that we reached the Napo during the feasts otherwise we might not have found men enough to man our canoes down the river There are three or four blancos petty merchants who follow the old Spanish practice of compulsory sales forcing the Indians to take lienzo knives beads et cetera at exorbitant prices and making them pay in gold dust and pita This kind of commerce is known under the name of repartos It is hard to find an Indian whose gold or whose labor is not claimed by the blancos The present and possible productions of this region are bananas plantains yucas one hundred sixteen yams sweet potatoes rice beans corn lemons oranges chirimoyas anonas a similar fruit to the preceding pine apples palm cabbages guavas guayavas castor oil beans coffee cacao cinnamon India rubber vanilla two kinds one hundred seventeen chonta palm nuts sarsaparilla contrayerva a mint tobacco

small Trigona bee that builds its comb in the ground of manufactures pita hammocks twine calabashes aguardiente from the plantain chicha from the yuca one hundred eighteen sugar and molasses from the cane which grows luxuriantly and manati lard of minerals gold dust The gold in minute spangles is washed down by the rivers at flood time chiefly from the Llanganati Mountains The articles desired in exchange are lienzo thread needles axes hoes knives fish hooks rings medals crosses beads mirrors salt and poison Quito nearly monopolizes the trade though a few canoes go down the Napo to the Maranon after salt and poison The salt comes from near Chasuta on the Huallaga one hundred nineteen the urari from the Ticuna Indians It takes about twenty days to paddle down to the Maranon and three months to pole up The Napo is navigable for a flat bottomed steamer as far as Santa Rosa one hundred twenty and it is a wonder that Anglo Saxon enterprise has not put one upon these waters The profits would be great as soon as commercial relations with the various tribes were established one hundred twenty one Four yards of coarse cotton cloth for example will exchange for one hundred pounds of sarsaparilla Urari is sold at Napo for its weight in silver By a decree of the Ecuadorian Congress there will be no duty on foreign goods entering the Napo for twenty years The Napo region under proper cultivation would yield the most valuable productions of either hemisphere in profusion But agriculture is unknown there is no word for plow The natives spend most of their time in idleness or feasting and hunting Their weapons are blow guns and wooden spears our guns they call by a word which signifies thunder and lightning Laying up for the future or for commerce is foreign to their ideas The houses are all built of bamboo tied together with lianas and shingled with leaves of the sunipanga palm The Indians are peaceful good natured and idle They seldom steal any thing but food Their only stimulants are chicha guayusa and tobacco This last they roll up in plantain leaves and smoke or snuff an infusion of it through the nose from the upper bill of a toucan The Peruvians says Prescott quoting Garcilasso differ from every other Indian nation to whom tobacco was known by using it only for medicinal purposes in the form of snuff There is no bread on the Napo the nearest approach to flour is yuca starch There are no clocks or watches time is measured by the position of the sun The mean temperature at Napo village is about one degree warmer than that of Archidona Its altitude above the sea is fourteen fifty feet The nights are cool and there are no musquitoes but sand flies are innumerable Jiggers also have been seen There are no well defined wet and dry seasons but the most rain falls in May June and July The lightning Edwards informed us seldom strikes Dysentery fevers and rheumatism are the prevailing diseases and we saw one case of goitre But the climate is considered salubrious Few twins are born and there are fewer children than in Archidona a difference ascribed by some to the exposure of the Napo people in gold washing by others to the greater quantity of guayusa drunk by the Archidonians Footnote one hundred sixteen Sometimes called yuca dulce or sweet yuca to distinguish it from the yuca brava or wild yuca the mandioca of the Amazon from which farina is made The yuca is the beet like root of a little tree about ten feet high It is a good substitute for potatoes and bread Footnote one hundred seventeen Vanilla belongs to the orchid family and is the only member which possesses any economical value It is a graceful climber and has a pretty star like flower Footnote one hundred eighteen In Peru the liquor made from yuca is called masato Footnote one hundred nineteen Rock salt is found on both sides of the Andes The general character of the geology of these countries would rather lead to the opinion that its origin is in some way connected with volcanic heat at the bottom of the sea Darwin s Observations pt iii p two hundred thirty five Footnote one hundred twenty The Napo Herndon was told is very full of sand banks and twenty days from its mouth or near the confluence of the Curaray the men have to get overboard and drag the canoes Report p two hundred twenty nine Footnote one hundred twenty one The chief difficulty throughout the Upper Amazon is in getting the Indians to concentrate along the bank But honorable dealing would accomplish this in time The Napo is the largest river in the republic From its source in the oriental defiles of Cotopaxi and Sincholagua to its embouchure at the Maranon its length is not far from eight hundred miles or about twice that of the Susquehanna one hundred twenty two From Napo village to the mouth of the river our barometer showed a fall of a thousand feet At Napo the current is six miles an hour between Napo and Santa Rosa there are rapids and between Santa Rosa and the Maranon the rate is not less than four miles an hour At Napo the breadth is about forty yards at Coca the main channel is fifteen hundred feet wide and at Camindo it is a full Spanish mile Below Coca the river throws out numerous canals which isolating portions of the forest clad lowlands create numerous picturesque islands Around and between them the river winds usually making one bend in every league The tall trees covering them are bound together by creeping plants into a thick jungle the home of capybaras and the lair of the jaguar The islands entirely alluvial are periodically flooded and undergo a constant round of decay and renovation Indeed the whole river annually changes its channel so that navigation is somewhat difficult The Indians on coming to a fork were frequently at a loss to know which was the main channel Then too the river is full of snags and plaias or low shelving sand banks rising just above the water level the resort of turtles during the egg season It was interesting to trace the bed of the river as we floated down on the rapid slope of the Cordilleras rushing over or rolling along huge boulders which farther on were rapidly reduced in size till in time boulders were broken into pebbles pebbles turned into sand and sand reduced to impalpable mud one hundred twenty three The plaias are not auriferous Below Coca there is a wilderness of lagunes all connected with the river the undisturbed retreat of innumerable water fowl The only spot on the Napo where the underlying rocks are exposed is near Napo village There it is a dark slate gently dipping east Farther west in fact throughout this side of the Andes the prevailing rock is mica schist But the entire Napo country is covered with an alluvial bed on the average ten feet thick Footnote one hundred twenty two Its actual source is the Rio del Valle which runs northward through the Valle Vicioso Its longest tributary the Curaray rises only a few miles to the south in the Cordillera de los Mulatos The two rivers run side by side four deg of longitude before meeting Coca the northern branch originates in the flanks of Cayambi The Napo and its branches are represented incorrectly in every map we have examined The Aguarico is confounded with the Santa Maria and made too long and the Curaray is represented too far above the mouth of the Napo There are no settlements between Coca and Camindo Footnote one hundred twenty three From specimens of sand which we obtained at different points in descending the river we find that at Coca it contains seventeen point five per cent of pure quartz grains the rest being colored dark with augite at the mouth of the Napo there is fifty per cent of pure quartz the other half being light colored and feldspathic CHAPTER XIV

7030_64588_000003_000001	train-clean-360	It is no easy matter to hire or cajole the Indians for any service 
7030_64588_000003_000002	train-clean-360	Out of feast time they are out of town and during the festival they are loth to leave or are so full of chicha they do not know what they want 
none	none	We first woke up the indolent alcalde by showing him the President s order and then used him to entice or to compel we know not his motive power eight Indians including the governor to take us to Santa Rosa We paid them about twenty four yards of lienzo the usual currency here 
7030_64588_000003_000005	train-clean-360	They furnished three canoes two for baggage and one covered with a palm leaf awning for ourselves 
7030_64588_000003_000006	train-clean-360	The canoes were of red cedar and flat bottomed the paddles had oval blades to which short quick strokes were given perpendicularly to the water entering and leaving 
7030_64588_000003_000007	train-clean-360	But there was little need of paddling on this trip 
7030_64588_000004_000000	train-clean-360	The Napo starts off in furious haste for the fall between Napo village and Santa Rosa a distance of eighty miles is three hundred and fifty feet 
7030_64588_000004_000001	train-clean-360	We were about seven hours in the voyage down and it takes seven days to pole back 
none	none	The passage of the rapids is dangerous to all but an Indian As Wallace says of a spot on the Rio Negro you are bewildered by the conflicting motions of the water Whirling and boiling eddies burst as if from some subaqueous explosion down currents are on one side of the canoe and an up current on the other now a cross stream at the bows and a diagonal one at the stern with a foaming Scylla on your right and a whirling Charybdis on the left But our nervousness gave way to admiration as our popero or pilot the sedate governor gave the canoe a sheer with the swoop of his long paddle turning it gracefully around the corner of a rock against which it seemed we must be dashed and we felt like joining in the wild scream of the Indians as our little craft shot like an arrow past the danger and down the rapids and danced on the waters below 
7030_64588_000005_000000	train-clean-360	In four hours we were abreast the little village of Aguano on the opposite bank we could see the tambos of the gold washers 
7030_64588_000005_000001	train-clean-360	At five P M we reached the deserted site of Old Santa Rosa the village having been removed a few years ago on account of its unhealthy location 
7030_64588_000005_000002	train-clean-360	It is now overgrown with sour orange and calabash trees the latter bearing large fruit shells so useful to the Indians in making pilches or cups 
7030_64588_000005_000003	train-clean-360	In pitch darkness and in a drizzling rain we arrived at New Santa Rosa and swung our hammocks in the Government House 
7030_64588_000006_000000	train-clean-360	Santa Rosa once the prosperous capital of the Provincia del Oriente now contains about two hundred men women and children 
7030_64588_000006_000001	train-clean-360	The town is pleasantly situated on the left bank of the river about fifteen feet above the water level 
7030_64588_000006_000002	train-clean-360	A little bamboo church open only when the missionary from Archidona makes his annual visit stood near our quarters 
7030_64588_000006_000003	train-clean-360	The Indians were keeping one of their seven feasts in a hut near by and their drumming was the last thing we heard as we turned into our hammocks and the first in the morning 
none	none	The alcalde Pablo Sandoval is the only white inhabitant and he is an Indian in every respect save speech and color His habitation is one of the largest structures on the Napo the posts are of chonta palm the sides and roof of the usual material split bamboo and palm leaves 
7030_64588_000006_000006	train-clean-360	It is embowered in a magnificent grove of plantains and papayas

7030_64588_000006_000011	train-clean-360	When a stranger enters he is invited to sit in a hammock and at Santa Rosa we were always presented with a cup of guayusa in Brazil with a cup of coffee 
7030_64588_000006_000012	train-clean-360	Sandoval wore nothing but shirt and pantaloons the dignity of the barefooted functionary was confined to his Spanish blood 
none	none	He had lived long among the Zaparos and from him his daughter and a Zaparo servant we obtained much valuable information respecting that wild and little known tribe Illustration Papaya tree 
7030_64588_000008_000000	train-clean-360	At Santa Rosa we procured Indians and canoes for the Maranon 
7030_64588_000008_000001	train-clean-360	This was not easily done 
7030_64588_000008_000002	train-clean-360	The Indians seemed reluctant to quit their feasts and go on such a long voyage and the alcalde was unwilling they should go and manufactured a host of lies and excuses 
7030_64588_000008_000003	train-clean-360	He declared there was but one large canoe in town and that we must send to Suno for another and for men to man it 
none	none	There were indeed few Indians in Santa Rosa for while we were disputing a largo number went off with shoutings down the river to spend weeks in the forest hunting monkeys one hundred twenty four It was a stirring sight to see these untamed red men in the depths of the Napo wilderness starting on a monkey crusade but it was still more stirring to think of paddling our own canoe down to Brazil 
7030_64588_000008_000005	train-clean-360	After some time lost in word fighting we tried the virtues of authority 
none	none	We presented the president s order which commanded all civil and military powers on the Napo to aid and not to hinder the expedition then we put into his hand an official letter from the alcalde of Napo to whom Pablo was subordinate which with a flourish of dignified Spanish threatened Santa Rosa with the doom of Sodom and Gomorrah if any impediment was placed in our way Footnote one hundred twenty four Monkeys form an article of food throughout tropical America The meat is tough but keeps longer than any other in that climate The Indians told Gibbon that the tail is the most delicate part when the hair is properly singed To all this Edwards who had kindly accompanied us down the river thus far added with frightful gestures that he purposed to report him to the Quito government 
7030_64588_000010_000001	train-clean-360	After this bombardment Sandoval was another man and the two canoes and four Indians we wanted were forthcoming 
7030_64588_000010_000002	train-clean-360	We had to wait however two days for the Indians to prepare their chicha for the journey and to cover the canoes with palm awnings 
none	none	The price of a canoe for the Maranon is twenty five varas of lienzo and the same for each Indian 
7030_64588_000010_000004	train-clean-360	Unfortunately we had only fifty varas left but through the influence of the now good natured alcalde we induced the Indians to take the balance in coin 
7030_64588_000010_000005	train-clean-360	After many delays we put our baggage into one canoe and ourselves into the other and pushed off into the rapid current of the Napo 
7030_64588_000010_000006	train-clean-360	We had three styles of valediction on leaving 
7030_64588_000010_000007	train-clean-360	Our Indian quartet after several last drinks of chicha bade their friends farewell by clasping hands one kissing the joined hands and then the other 
none	none	Sandoval muttered adios in reply to ours meaning no doubt good riddance while we shouted a hearty good bye to Edwards as he pushed his way up stream to continue his lonely but chosen Indian life on the banks of the Yusupino 
7030_64588_000011_000000	train-clean-360	The Napo at Santa Rosa runs at least five miles an hour and we were soon picking our way now drifting now paddling through a labyrinth of islands and snags 
7030_64588_000011_000001	train-clean-360	The Indians so accustomed to brutal violence from the hands of the whites had begged of us before our departure that we would not beat them 
7030_64588_000011_000002	train-clean-360	But shortly after we left one of them who was literally filled with chicha dropped his paddle and tumbled into a heap at the bottom of the canoe dead drunk 
none	none	Pratt our gigantic Mississippi boatman whom we had engaged at Quito as captain and cook down the river and who was an awful Goliath in the eyes of the red skins seized the fellow and gave him a terrible shaking the like of which was never seen or heard of in all Napo 
7030_64588_000011_000004	train-clean-360	At once the liquor left the muddled brain of the astonished culprit and taking his paddle he became from that hour the best of the crew 
none	none	This was the only case of discipline on the voyage Always obsequious they obeyed us with fear and trembling 
7030_64588_000011_000007	train-clean-360	None of them could speak Spanish so we had provided ourselves with a vocabulary of Quichua 
none	none	But some English words like the imperative paddle were more effective than the tongue of the Incas 
7030_64588_000011_000009	train-clean-360	Indeed when we mixed up our Quichua with a little Anglo Saxon they evidently thought the latter was a terrible anathema for they sprang to their places without delay 
none	none	In seven hours we arrived at Suno a collection of half a dozen palm booths five feet high the miserable owners of which do a little fishing and gold washing 
7030_64588_000012_000001	train-clean-360	They gave us possession of their largest hut in which they had been roasting a sea cow and the stench was intolerable 
7030_64588_000012_000002	train-clean-360	Nevertheless one of our number bravely threw down his blanket within and went to sleep two swung their hammocks between the trees and the rest slept in the canoe 
none	none	Here for the first time since leaving Guayaquil we were tormented by musquitoes Bats were also quite numerous but none of them were blood thirsty and we may add that nowhere in South America were we troubled by those diabolical imps of imaginative travelers the leaf nosed species 
7030_64588_000012_000005	train-clean-360	So far as our experience goes we can say with Bates that the vampire so common on the Amazon is the most harmless of all bats 
7030_64588_000012_000006	train-clean-360	It has however a most hideous physiognomy 
7030_64588_000012_000007	train-clean-360	A full grown specimen will measure twenty eight inches in expanse of wing 
7030_64588_000012_000008	train-clean-360	Bates found two species on the Amazon one black the other of a ruddy line and both fruit eaters 
7030_64588_000013_000000	train-clean-360	The nocturnal music of these forests is made by crickets and tree toads The voice of the latter sounds like the cracking of wood 
7030_64588_000013_000001	train-clean-360	Occasionally frogs owls and goat suckers croak hoot and wail 
7030_64588_000013_000002	train-clean-360	Between midnight and three A M almost perfect silence reigns 
none	none	At early dawn the animal creation awakes with a scream Pre eminent are the discordant cries of monkeys and macaws 
7030_64588_000013_000005	train-clean-360	As the sun rises higher one musician after another seeks the forest shade and the morning concert ends at noon 
7030_64588_000013_000006	train-clean-360	In the heat of the day there is an all pervading rustling sound caused by the fluttering of myriad insects and the gliding of lizards and snakes 
7030_64588_000013_000007	train-clean-360	At sunset parrots and monkeys resume their chatter for a season and then give way to the noiseless flight of innumerable bats chasing the hawk moth and beetle 
7030_64588_000013_000008	train-clean-360	There is scarcely a sound in a tropical forest which is joyous and cheering 
7030_64588_000013_000009	train-clean-360	The birds are usually silent those that have voices utter a plaintive song or hoarse shrill cry 
none	none	Our door yards are far more melodious on a May morning 
7030_64588_000013_000011	train-clean-360	The most common birds on the Napo are macaws parrots toucans and ciganas 
7030_64588_000013_000012	train-clean-360	The parrots like the majority in South America are of the green type 
7030_64588_000013_000013	train-clean-360	The toucan peculiar to the New World and distinguished by its enormous bill is a quarrelsome imperious bird 
7030_64588_000013_000014	train-clean-360	It is clumsy in flight but nimble in leaping from limb to limb 
none	none	It hops on the ground like a robin and makes a shrill yelping pia po o co Ecuadorians call it the predicador or preacher because it wags its head like a priest and seems to say God gave it you The feathers of the breast are of most brilliant yellow orange and rose colors and the robes of the royal dames of Europe in the sixteenth century were trimmed with them 
7030_64588_000013_000017	train-clean-360	The cigana or gypsy in Peru called chansu resembles a pheasant 
7030_64588_000013_000018	train-clean-360	The flesh has a musky odor and it is for this reason perhaps that they exist in such numbers throughout the country 
7030_64588_000013_000019	train-clean-360	The Indians never eat them 
none	none	In no country as in the Amazonian Valley is there such a variety of insects nowhere do we find species of larger size or greater beauty It is the richest locality for butterflies Bates found twelve hundred species in Brazil alone or three times as many as in all Europe 
7030_64588_000013_000021	train-clean-360	The splendid metallic blue and the yellow and transparent winged are very abundant on the Napo some rise high in the air others living in societies look like fluttering clouds 
none	none	Moths are comparatively rare The most conspicuous beetle on the river is a magnificent green species Chrysophora chrysochlora always found arboreal like the majority of tropical coleopters they look like emerald gems clinging to the branches There are two kinds of bees the black and yellow which the Napos name respectively cushillo mishke monkey honey and sara mishke corn honey 
7030_64588_000013_000024	train-clean-360	It is singular these Indians have no term for bees but call them honey and distinguish them by their color 
7030_64588_000013_000025	train-clean-360	The black species is said to make the most honey and the yellow the best The quadrupeds of the Oriente are few and far between in the dry season Not a sloth nor armadillo did we see 
7030_64588_000013_000026	train-clean-360	But when the rains descend the wilderness is a menagerie of tigers and tapirs pumas and bears while a host of reptiles led by the gigantic boa creep forth from their hiding places

7030_64588_000014_000006	train-clean-360	We remained here two days to construct a more comfortable craft for our voyage to the Amazon a distance of at least five hundred miles 
7030_64588_000014_000007	train-clean-360	The canoe is the only means of navigation known to the Indians But the idea of spending fifteen days cooped cribbed and cramped in a narrow canoe exposed to a tropical sun and furious rains was intolerable

none	none	But when our gallant ship left Coca obediently to the helm and at the rate of six miles an hour when paddles and current worked together they shouted bueno Our trunks and provision cans were arranged along the two sides of the platform so that we had abundance of from for exercise by day and for sleeping under musquito tents at night

none	none	In the forecastle the bows of the large canoes which projected beyond our cabin sat three Indians to paddle The fourth who was the governor of Santa Rosa we honored with the post of steersman and he was always to be seen on the poop behind the kitchen standing bolt upright on the alert and on the lookout 
7030_64588_000017_000009	train-clean-360	On approaching any human habitation the Indians blew horns to indicate that they came as friends 
none	none	These horns must have come from Brazil as there are no bovines on the Napo Whenever they enter an unknown lagune they blow their horns also to charm the yacu mama or mother of waters as they call the imaginary serpent

7030_64588_000023_000004	train-clean-360	Favored by a powerful current and the rhythmic paddling of our Santa Rosans we made this day sixty miles but our average daily run was fifty miles 
7030_64588_000023_000005	train-clean-360	The winds doubtless the trades were almost unchangeably from the east but an occasional puff would come from the northwest when we relieved our paddlers by hoisting a blanket for a sail 
7030_64588_000023_000006	train-clean-360	Six o clock was our usual hour of departure and ten or twelve hours our traveling time always tying up at a plaia or island of which there are hosts in the Napo but never to the main land for fear of unfriendly Indians and the still more unwelcome tiger Our crew encamped at a respectful though hailing distance 
7030_64588_000024_000000	train-clean-360	On the second day from Coca we were caught in a squall and to save our roof we ran ashore 
7030_64588_000024_000001	train-clean-360	Nearly every afternoon we were treated to a shower accompanied by a strong wind but seldom by thunder and lightning though at Coca we had a brilliant thunder storm at night 
7030_64588_000024_000002	train-clean-360	They always came after a uniform fashion and at a regular hour so that we learned when to expect them 
7030_64588_000024_000003	train-clean-360	About noon the eastern horizon would become suddenly black and when this had spread to the zenith we heard the rush of a mighty wind sweeping through the forest and the crash of falling trees and then down fell the deluge 
none	none	The Indians have a saying that the path of the sun is the path of the storm These storm clouds moved rapidly for in half an hour all was quiet on the Napo At Quito two hundred miles west the usual afternoon shower occurs two hours later To day we enjoyed our last glimpse of the Andes Far away across the great forest we had traversed we could see the beautiful cone of Cotopaxi and the flat top of Cayambi standing out in proud pre eminence Long will it be ere we forget this farewell view of the magnificent Cordillera CHAPTER XV Sea Cows and Turtles Eggs The Forest Peccaries Indian Tribes on the Lower Napo Anacondas and Howling Monkeys Insect Pests Battle with Ants Barometric Anomaly First View of the Amazon Pebas The thirtieth of November was an exciting day on the monotonous Napo We fell in with numerous sea cows sporting in the middle of the stream They were greatly disturbed by the sight of our huge craft and lifting their ugly heads high out of the water gave a peculiar snort as if in defiance but always dived out of sight when fired upon The sea cow is called vaca marina by the Spaniards peixe boy by the Brazilians and manati in the West Indies It has no bovine feature except in its upper lip The head and skin remind one of a large seal In many respects it may be likened to a hippopotamus without tusks or legs It has a semicircular flat tail and behind the head are two oval fins beneath which are the breasts which yield a white milk The flesh resembles pork with a disagreeable fishy flavor To day we anchored at several plaias to hunt turtles eggs Our Indians were very expert in finding the nests Guided approximately by the tracks of the tortugas as the turtles are called they thrust a stick into the sand and wherever it went down easily they immediately commenced digging with their hands and invariably struck eggs In four nests whose contents we counted there were one hundred and thirty two one hundred and fourteen one hundred and twelve and ninety seven but we have heard of one hundred and sixty eggs in a single nest The turtles lay in the night and in pits about two feet deep which they excavate with their broad webbed paws The eggs are about an inch and a half in diameter having a thin leathery shell a very oily yolk and a white which does not coagulate The Indians ate them uncooked We used them chiefly in making corn griddles Here as throughout its whole course the Napo runs between two walls of evergreen verdure On either hand are low clay banks no rocks are visible and from these the forest rises to a uniform height of seventy or eighty feet It has a more cheerful aspect than the sombre silent wilderness of Baeza Old aristocrats of the woods are overrun by a gay democracy of creepers and climbers which interlace the entire forest and descending to take root again appear like the shrouds and stays of a line of battle ship Monkeys gambol on this wild rigging and mingle their chatter with the screams of the parrot Trees as lofty as our oaks are covered with flowers as beautiful as our lilies Here are orchids of softest tints one hundred twenty eight flowering ferns fifty feet high the graceful bamboo and wild banana while high over all countless species of palm wave their nodding plumes Art could not arrange these beautiful forms so harmoniously as nature has done Footnote one hundred twenty eight Some orchid is in flower all the year round The finest species is the odontoglossum having long chocolate colored petals margined with yellow Such is their number and variety wrote Humboldt that the entire life of a painter would be too short to delineate all the magnificent Orchideae which adorn the recesses of the deep valleys of the Peruvian Andes For many curious facts respecting the structure of these flowers see Darwin s Fertilization of Orchids Illustration Hunting Turtles Eggs The tropics moreover are strangers to the uniformity of association seen in temperate climes We have so many social plants that we speak of a forest of oaks and pines and birches but there variety is the law Individuals of the same species are seldom seen growing together Every tree is surrounded by strangers that seemingly prefer its room to its company and such is the struggle for possession of the soil it is difficult to tell to which stem the different leaves and flowers belong The peculiar charm of a tropical forest is increased by the mystery of its impenetrable thicket Within that dense matted shrubbery and behind that phalanx of trees the imagination of the traveler sees all manner of four footed beasts and creeping things Tropical vegetation is of fresher verdure more luxuriant and succulent and adorned with larger and more shining leaves than the vegetation of the north The leaves are not shed periodically a character common not only to the equator but also to the whole southern hemisphere Yet there is a variety of tints though not autumnal The leaves put on their best attire while budding instead of falling passing as they come to maturity through different shades of red brown and green The majority of tropical trees bear small flowers The most conspicuous trees are the palms to which the prize of beauty has been given by the concurrent voice of all ages The earliest civilization of mankind belonged to countries bordering on the region of palms South America the continent of mingled heat and moisture excels the rest of the world in the number and perfection of her palms They are mostly of the feathery and fan like species the latter are inferior in rank to the former The peculiarly majestic character of the palm is given not only by their lofty stems but also in a very high degree by the form and arrangement of their leaves How diverse yet equally graceful are the aspiring branches of the jagua and the drooping foliage of the cocoa the shuttlecock shaped crowns of the ubussu and the plumes of the jupati forty feet in length The inflorescence always springs from the top of the trunk and the male flowers are generally yellowish Unlike the oak all species of which have similar fruit there is a vast difference in the fruits of the palm compare the triangular cocoa nut the peach like date and grape like assai The silk cotton tree is the rival of the palm in dignity it has a white bark and a lofty flat crown Among the loveliest children of Flora we must include the mimosa with its delicately pinnated foliage so endowed with sensibility that it seems to have stepped out of the bounds of vegetable life The bamboo the king of grasses forms a distinctive feature in the landscape of the Napo frequently rising eighty feet in length though not in height for the fronds curve downward Fancy the airy grace of our meadow grasses united with the lordly growth of the poplar and you have a faint idea of bamboo beauty The first day of winter how strangely that sounds under a vertical sun was Sunday but it was folly to attempt to rest where punkies were as thick as atoms so we floated on It was only by keeping in mid river and moving rapidly enough to create a breeze through our cabin that life was made tolerable A little after noon we were again obliged to tie up for a storm Not a human being nor a habitation have we seen since leaving Coca and to day nothing is visible but the river with its islands and plains and the green palisades the edges of the boundless forest Not a hill over one hundred feet high are we destined to see till we reach Obidos fifteen hundred miles eastward Were it not for the wealth of vegetation all new to trans tropical eyes and the concerts of monkeys and macaws oppressively lonely would be the sail down the Napo between its uninhabited shores But we believe the day though distant will come when its banks will be busy with life Toward evening three or four canoes pulled out from the shore and came alongside They were filled with the lowest class of Indians we have seen in South America The women were nearly nude the man there was only one had on a sleeveless frock reaching to the knees made from the bark of a tree called llanchama All were destitute of eyebrows their hair was parted in the middle and their teeth and lips were dyed black They had rude pottery peccari meat and wooden lances to sell Like all the Napo Indians they had a weakness for beads and they wore necklaces of tiger and monkey teeth They were stupid rather than brutal and probably belonged to a degraded tribe of the great Zaparo family With Darwin one s mind hurries back over past centuries and then asks could our progenitors have been men like these men whose very signs and expressions are less intelligible to us than those of the domesticated animals men who do not possess the instinct of those animals nor yet appear to boast of human reason or at least of arts consequent on that reason I do not believe it is possible to describe or paint the difference between savage and civilized man It is the difference between a wild and tame animal and part of the interest in beholding a savage is the same which would lead every one to desire to see the lion in his desert the tiger tearing his prey in the jungle or the rhinoceros wandering over the wild plains of Africa On the morrow our falcon eyed Indians whispered cuche long before we saw any thing one hundred twenty nine Williams went ashore and came upon a herd of peccaries killing two The peccari is a pugnacious fearless animal It is not frightened by the noise of fire arms and when wounded is a dangerous foe but captured when young it is easily tamed It has a higher back than the domestic hog and cleanlier habits an odoriferous gland on the loins and three toed hind feet We preserved the skins for science and a ham for the table the rest we gave to our crew and fellow voyagers who devoured every thing even the viscera They sat up late that night around their camp fire cooking peccari meat part they parboiled in a pot and some they roasted skewered on sticks which slanted over the flames the rest they cured with smoke for lack of salt The meat though rank is palatable but not equal to macaw which we served up the next day one hundred thirty Footnote one hundred twenty nine In the Quichua of Quito the peccari is called saino Footnote one hundred thirty The Uaupes on the Napo according to Wallace will not eat peccari meat Meat putrifies in this climate of the Tapajos in less than twenty four hours and salting is of no use unless the pieces are cut in thin slices and dried immediately in the sun Bates We had now passed the mouth of the Aguarico leaving behind us the Christian Quitus and the peaceful Zaparos Henceforth the right bank of the Napo is inhabited by the Mazanes and Iquitos while on the left are the wilder Santa Marias Anguteros Oritos and Orejones The Orejones or Big Ears enlarge those appendages to such an extent that they are said to lie down on one ear and cover themselves with the other This practice is now going out of fashion These Indians received their name Orejones or Oregones from the Spaniards on account of this singular custom of inserting disks of wood in the ears to enlarge them the like practice prevailed among the tribes on the Columbia River Oregon They trade in hammocks poisons and provisions The Anguteros or Putumayos have a bad reputation They are reported to have killed and robbed sarsaparilla traders coming up stream Nevertheless we kept watch only one night during the voyage though we always anchored to an island and between Coca and the Amazon we did not see twenty five men Equally rare were the savage brutes not a jaguar showed himself and only one anaconda The anaconda or water boa Eunectes murinus one hundred thirty one is larger and more formidable than the boa constrictor which lives on the land It has a hideous appearance broad in the middle and tapering abruptly at both ends We did not learn from the natives that anacondas over twenty feet long had been seen on the Napo but specimens twice that size are found on the Amazon Land boas do not often exceed fifteen feet in length Footnote one hundred thirty one The specific name was strangely given for its habit when young of darting upon mice Anaconda is a Ceylonese word Illustration A Howler Gangs of the large howling monkeys often entertained us with their terrific unearthly yells which in the truthful language of Bates increased tenfold the feeling of inhospitable wildness which the forest is calculated to inspire They are of a maroon color the males wear a long red beard and have under the jaw a bony goitre an expansion of the os hyoides by means of which they produce their loud rolling noise They set up an unusual chorus whenever they saw us scampering to the tops of the highest trees the dams carrying the young upon their backs They are the only monkeys which the natives have not been able to tame Vast numbers of screaming parrots and macaws flew over our heads always going in pairs and at a great height Groups of gypsy birds were perched on the trees overhanging the river and black ducks cormorants and white cranes floated on the water or stalked along the plaias But one form of life superabounded From the rising of the sun to the going down thereof clouds of ubiquitous sand flies filled our cabin save when the wind was high As soon as the sand flies ceased myriads of musquitoes began their work of torture without much preparatory piping and kept it up all night one hundred thirty two These pests were occasionally relieved or assisted by piums minute flies that alight unnoticed and squatting close to the skin suck their fill of blood leaving dark spots and a disagreeable irritation Our hands were nearly black with their punctures We also made the acquaintance of the montuca a large black fly whose horny lancets make a gash in the flesh painless but blood letting All these insects are most abundant in the latter part of the rainy season when the Maranon is almost uninhabitable The apostrophe of Midshipman Wilberforce was prompted by sufferings which we can fully appreciate Ye greedy animals I am ashamed of you Can not you once forego your dinner and feast your mind with the poetry of the landscape Right welcome was the usual afternoon squall which sent these pests kiting over the stern Footnote one hundred thirty two Sand flies are called by the natives musquitoes and what we call musquitoes they call sancudos On Wednesday we fell in with a petty sarsaparilla trader with two canoes bound for the Maranon He was sick with fever Sarsaparilla written salsaparrilha in Brazil and meaning bramble vine is the root of a prickly climbing plant found throughout the whole Amazonian forest but chiefly on dry rocky ground On the morning of the seventh day from Coca we passed the mouth of the Curaray the largest tributary of the Napo It rises on the slopes of the Llanganati mountains and is considered auriferous It is probably derived from curi gold Seeing a hut on the banks we sent an Indian to purchase provisions he returned with a few yucas and eggs The day following we were attacked from a new quarter Stopping to escape a storm a party went ashore to cut down a tree of which we desired a section It fell with its top in the river just above our craft when lo to our consternation down came countless hosts of ants Ecitons Myriads were of course swept down stream but myriads more crawled up the sides of our canoes and in one minute after the tree fell our whole establishment from hold to roof was swarming with ants We gave one look of despair at each other our provisions and collections and then commenced a war of extermination It was a battle for life The ants whose nest we had so suddenly immersed in the Napo refused to quit their new lodgings As we were loosely dressed the tenacious little creatures hid themselves under our clothing and when plucked off would leave their heads and jaws sticking in the skin At last the deck was cleared by means of boots slippers and towels but had the ants persevered they might have taken possession of the boat To day we saw a high bank called in Quichua pucaurcu or red hill consisting of fine laminated clays of many colors red orange yellow gray black and white This is the beginning of that vast deposit which covers the whole Amazonian Valley It rests upon a bed of lignite or bituminous shale and a coarse iron cemented conglomerate The latter is not visible on the Napo but crops out particularly at Obidos and Para The Indians prepare their paints from these colored clays Our Santa Rosans seemed to have little tact in fishing still their spears and our hooks gathered not a few representatives of ichthyic life in the Napo The species most common belong to the genus Pimelodus or catfish tribe Below tho Curaray the sand bars yielded turtles eggs of a different kind from those found above the tracaja They were smaller and oval and buried only six or eight inches deep thirty in a nest December nine Passed early this morning the mouth of the Mazan four huts at the junction To day we noticed the anomaly first observed by Herndon From Papallacta to the Curaray the rise of the mercury was regular but on the lower Napo there were great fluctuations At one time both barometer and boiling apparatus with which we made daily and simultaneous observations unanimously declared that our canoes were gliding up stream though we were descending at the rate of five miles an hour The temperature is decidedly lower and the winds are stronger as we near the Amazon December ten Our last day on the Napo In celebration of the event we killed a fine young doe as it was crossing the river It closely resembled the Virginia deer At nine A M the Indians shouted in their quiet way Maranon It was as thrilling as Thalatta to Xenophon s soldiers We were not expecting to reach it till night being deceived by Villavicencio s map which in common with all others locates the Curaray and Mazan too far to the north We halted for an hour at Camindo a little fishing hamlet claimed by Peru and then hastened to get our first sight of the Amazon With emotions we can not express we gazed upon this ocean stream The march of the great river in its silent grandeur is sublime In its untamed might it rolls through the wilderness with a stately solemn air showing its awful power in cutting away the banks tearing down trees and building up islands in a day Down the river we can look till the sky and water meet as on the sea while the forest on either hand dwindles in the perspective to a long black line Between these even walls of ever living green the resistless current hurries out of Peru sweeps past the imperial guns of Tabatinga into Brazil and plows its way visibly two hundred miles into the Atlantic At a small island standing where the Napo pays tribute to the monarch of rivers mingling its waters with the Huallaga and Ucayali which have already come down from the Peruvian Andes we bade adieu to our captain and cook who in the little canoe paddled his way westward to seek his fortune in Iquitus At this point the Maranon for so the natives call the Upper Amazon does not appear very much broader than the Napo but its depth is far greater and there are few sand bars one hundred thirty three The water is always of a turbid yellow while the Napo though muddy during our voyage is usually clear The forest moreover on the banks of the Maranon is not so striking as on the tributary The palms are not so numerous and the uniform height of the trees gives a monotonous sea like horizon Footnote one hundred thirty three Herndon makes the mouth of the Napo one hundred fifty yards broad and the soundings six or seven fathoms This is not a fair representation for the Napo like all the other tributaries empties its waters by several mouths At Camindo five miles above the confluence the Napo is certainly a mile wide We arrived at Pebas December twelve ten hours after leaving the mouth of the Napo and a month and a half from Quito The first individual we met addressed us in good English and proved to be mister Hauxwell of birds and insects who has resided thirty years on the Amazon His house the largest and best in town though but a roofed stockade was generously placed at our disposal and the fatted calf an immense turtle was immediately killed To us after the transit of the Andes and the dangers and hardships of the wilderness and the river it seemed as if we had reached the end of our journey though we were over two thousand miles from the Atlantic Pebas is situated on a high clay bluff beside the Ambiyacu a mile above its entrance into the Maranon Excepting mister Hauxwell the Peruvian governor and two or three other whites the inhabitants are Indians of the Orejones and Yagua tribes The exportations are hammocks sarsaparilla palo de cruz and urari Palo de cruz is the very hard dark colored wood of a small leguminous tree bearing large pink flowers Urari is the poison used by all the Amazonian Indians it is made by the Ticunas on the Putumayo by boiling to a jelly the juices of certain roots and herbs chiefly of the Strychnos toxifera though it does not contain any trace of strychnine Tipped with urari the needle like arrow used in blow guns will kill an ox in twenty minutes and a monkey in ten We have reason to congratulate ourselves wrote the facetious Sidney Smith that our method of terminating disputes is by sword and pistol and not by these medicated pins But the poison appears to be harmless to man and other salt eating animals salt being an antidote one hundred thirty four We were not troubled with sand flies after leaving the plaias of the Napo but the musquitoes at Pebas were supernumerary Perhaps however it was a special gathering on our account for the natives have a notion that just before the arrival of a foreigner the musquitoes come in great numbers Footnote one hundred thirty four Urari is mentioned by Raleigh Humboldt was the first to take any considerable quantity to Europe The experiments of Virchau and Muenster make it probable that it does not belong to the class of tetanic poisons but that its particular effect is to take away the power of voluntary muscular movement while the involuntary functions of the heart and intestines still continue See Ann de Chim et de Phys t xxxix eighteen twenty eight p twenty four and Schoemberg s Reisen in Britisch Guiana th i s four hundred forty one The frightful poison tieute of India is prepared from a Java species of strychnos Many of the Indians are disfigured by dark blotches on the skin the effect of a cutaneous disease very prevalent in Central Amazonia Here we first noticed the singular habit among the children of eating clay This habit is not confined to the Otomacs on the Oronoco nor to Indians altogether for negroes and whites have the same propensity mister Hauxwell found it impossible to restrain his own children Bates ascribes the morbid craving to the meagre diet This may be true to some extent but it is certainly strange that the extraordinary desire to swallow earth chiefly unctuous clays is found only in the tropics where vegetation is so rank and fruit so abundant CHAPTER XVI Down the Amazon Steam on the Great River Loreto San Antonio Tabatinga Brazilian Steamers Scenery on the Amazon Tocantins Fonte Boa Ega Rio Negro Manaos We left Pebas for Tabatinga in the Peruvian steamer Morona Captain Raygado Going up to Jerusalem by railroad or ascending the Nile by a screw whisking the sacred waters is not so startling as the sight of a steamer in the heart of South America There is such a contrast between the primeval wildness of the country and the people and this triumph of civilized life and one looks forward to the dazzling future of this great valley when the ships of all nations will crowd the network of rivers for the gold and perfumes the gems and woods of this western Ophir The natives call the steamer the devil s boat or big canoe but they manifest little curiosity Our Napo Indians were evidently afraid of it and stood afar off The first steamers that broke the deep solitude of the Maranon were the Huallaga and Tirado brought out in eighteen fifty three by doctor Whittemore for Peru They were built in New York of Georgia pine costing Peru seventy five thousand dollars and reflected no credit on the United States they lie rotting near Nauta Peru has now two iron steamers of London make the Morona and Pastassa besides two smaller craft for exploring the tributaries These steamers are for government service but three more are building in England with passenger accommodations The Morona has a tonnage of five hundred and an engine of one hundred and fifty horse power The engineers are English and the cook is a Chinaman She makes monthly trips between Yurimaguas on the Huallaga River and Tabatinga on the Brazilian frontier Her rate down stream is eighteen miles an hour and from eleven to twelve against the current These steamers do not pay expenses at present but they preserve the authority of Peru on the Maranon and supply with material the government works at Iquitos They also do a little commerce taking down sarsaparilla and Moyabamba hats and bringing up English dry goods There were not half a dozen passengers on board The only towns of any consequence west of Pebas are Iquitos Nauta and Yurimaguas Peru claims them in fact all the villages on the Maranon Iquitos is the most thriving town on the Upper Amazon It is situated on an elevated plain on the left bank of the river sixty miles above the mouth of the Napo In Herndon s time it was a fishing village of two hundred twenty seven inhabitants it now contains two thousand Here are the government iron works carried on by English mechanics In eighteen sixty seven there were six engineers two iron molders two brass molders two coppersmiths three blacksmiths three pattern makers two boiler makers five shipwrights three sawyers besides bricklayers brick makers carpenters coopers et cetera in all forty two All the coal for the furnaces is brought from England the lignite on the banks of the Maranon is unfit for the purpose A floating dock for vessels of a thousand tons has just been built Nauta lies on the north bank of the Maranon opposite the entrance of the Ucayali Its inhabitants about one thousand trade in fish sarsaparilla and wax from Ucayali Yurimaguas is the port of Moyabamba a city of ten thousand souls six days travel southwest This vast eastern slope lying on the branches of the Maranon is called the Montana of Peru It is a region of inexhaustible fertility and would yield ample returns to energy and capital The villages are open to foreign commerce free of duty but at present the voice of civilized man is seldom heard save on the main fluvial highway between Moyabamba and the Brazilian frontier The Portuguese are the most adventurous traders The value of imports to Peru by the Amazonian steamers during eighteen sixty seven was three hundred twenty four thousand five hundred thirty three dollars of exports two hundred sixty seven thousand seven hundred forty eight dollars In two hours and a half we arrive at Maucallacta or Old Town an Indian village on the right bank of the river Here our passports were vised by the Peruvian governor and the steamer wooded up One of the hands on the Morona was Manuel Medina a mameluco who was employed by Bates and Agassiz in their explorations We left at noon of the following day and anchored for the night off Caballococha for the Peruvian steamers run only in the daytime Caballococha or Horse lake is a Ticuna town situated on a level tract of light loam closely surrounded by the dense forest and beside a cano of clear water leading to a pretty lake Ecuador claims this town and likewise all the settlements on the Maranon but her learned geographer Villavicencio with characteristic ignorance of the country has located it on the north bank of the river We passed in the afternoon the little tug Napo having on board Admiral Tucker the rebel who with some associates is exploring the tributaries of the Upper Amazon for the Peruvian government They had just returned from a voyage of two hundred and fifty miles up the Javari One of the party had a tame tiger cat in his arms We arrived at Loreto early the next morning This village of twenty houses and a church is prettily situated on the left bank with a green slope in front It is the most easterly town of Peru on the Amazon Here resides mister Wilkens the Brazilian consul of German birth but North American education The inhabitants are Peruvians Portuguese Negroes and Ticuna Indians The musquitoes hold high carnival at this place In two hours we were at San Antonio a military post on the Peruvian frontier commanded by a French engineer Manuel Charon who also studied in the United States One large building and a flag staff on a high bluff of red clay were all that was visible of San Antonio but the Morona brought down a gang of Indians impressed no doubt to build a fort for twenty guns The site is in dispute a Brazilian claiming it as private property The white barracks of Tabatinga the first fortress in Brazil are in plain sight the voyage consuming but twenty minutes Between San Antonio and Tabatinga is a ravine on either side of which is a white pole marking the limits of the republic and the empire Tabatinga has long been a military post but excepting the government buildings there are not a dozen houses Numerous Indians however of the Ticuna tribe dwell in the neighboring forest The commandante was O Illustrissimo Senor Tenente Aristides Juste Mavignier a tall thin stooping officer dressed in brown linen He received us with great civility and tendered a house and servant during our stay in port We preferred however to accept the hospitalities of the Morona till the arrival of the Brazilian steamer Senor Mavignier was commandante of Manaos when visited by Agassiz and presented the Professor with a hundred varieties of wood With the like courtesy he gave us a collection of reptiles all of them rare and many of them new species He showed us also a live raposa or wild dog peculiar to the Amazon but seldom seen Tabatinga stands on an eminence of yellow clay and is defended by twelve guns The river in front is quite narrow only about half a mile wide Here our passports which had been signed at Maucallacta and Loreto were indorsed by the commandante They were afterward examined at Ega Manaos and Para The mean temperature of Tabatinga we found to be eighty two deg one hundred thirty five Some rubber and salt fish are exported but nothing of consequence is cultivated Grapes the people say grow well but are destroyed by the ants The only fruit trees we noticed were the mamai in Spanish papaya araca and abio The papaw tree bears male and female flowers on different trees and hence receives the name of papaya or mamai according to one s view of the pre eminence of the sex The juice of this tree is used by the ladies of the West Indies as a cosmetic and by the butchers to render the toughest meat tender The fruit is melon shaped and of an orange yellow color Vauquelin discovered in it fibrine till lately supposed to be confined to the animal kingdom Footnote one hundred thirty five According to Lieutenant Azevedo the latitude of Tabatinga is four deg fourteen thirty longitude seventy deg two twenty four magnetic variation six deg thirty five ten N E The Peruvian steamers connect at Tabatinga with the Brazilian line There are eight imperial steamers on the Amazon the Icamiaba running between Tabatinga and Manaos the Tapajos and Belem plying between Manaos and Para the Inca and Manaos between Obidos and Para besides two steamers on the Tocantins one between Para and Chares and projected lines for the Negro Tapajos and Madeira The captains get a small salary but the perquisites are large as they have a percentage on the freight One captain pocketed in one year nine thousand dollars We embarked December twelve on the Icamiaba which promptly arrived at Tabatinga The commander formerly a lieutenant in the Imperial Navy and for twelve years a popular officer on the Upper Amazon was a polished gentleman but rigid disciplinarian As an example of Brazilian etiquette we give his full address from one of our letters of introduction Ilmo Sr Capn de Fragata Nuno Alvez Pereira de Mello Cardozo Digno Commandante de Vapor Icamiaba The Icamiaba was an iron boat of four hundred and fifty tons with two engines of fifty horse power each The engineer was an Austrian yet the captain gave his orders in English though neither could speak the language The saloon with berths for twenty five passengers was above deck and open at both ends for ventilation The passengers however usually swung their hammocks on the upper deck which was covered by an awning This was a delightfully breezy and commanding position and though every part of the steamer was in perfect order this was scrupulously neat Here the table was spread with every tropical luxury and attentively served by young men in spotless attire Happy the traveler who sits at the table of Commandante Cardozo The refreshment hours were Coffee as soon as the passengers turned out of their hammocks and sometimes before breakfast at ten dinner at five and tea at eight Live bullocks fowls and turtles were kept on board so that of fresh meat particularly beef the first we had tasted since leaving Quito there was no lack At breakfast we counted nine different courses of meat The Peruvian steamers are limited to turtle and salt fish Rice and farina are extensively used in Brazil but we saw very little tapioca Farina is the flour of the country and is eaten in hard dry grains it will not keep in any other form It can not be very nutritious as it contains little gluten All bread and butter are imported from the United States and England The captains of Brazilian steamers are their own stewards and in the midst of other business in port they stop to negotiate for a chicken or a dozen eggs with an Indian or Negro The Icamiaba left Tabatinga with only three first class passengers besides our own party On no Amazon steamer did we meet with a lady passenger Madame Godin who came down the river from the Andes and missus Agassiz who ascended to Tabatinga were among the few ladies who have seen these upper waters But how differently they traveled one on a raft the other on the beautiful Icamiaba Between Tabatinga and Teffe a distance of five hundred miles is perhaps the most uncivilized part of the main river Ascending we find improvements multiply as we near the mountains of Peru descending we see the march of civilization in the budding cities and expanding commerce culminating at Grand Para The scenery from the deck of an Amazonian steamer if described appears monotonous A vast volume of smooth yellow water floating trees and beds of aquatic grass low linear shaped wooded islets a dark even forest the shores of a boundless sea of verdure and a cloudless sky occasionally obscured by flocks of parrots these are the general features No busy towns are seen along the banks of the Middle Amazon only here and there a palm hut or semi Indian village half buried in the wilderness We agree with Darwin speaking of the Plata that a wide expanse of muddy water has neither grandeur nor beauty The real grandeur however of a great river like this is derived from reflecting upon its prospective commercial importance and its immense drainage A lover of nature moreover can never tire of gazing at the picturesque grouping and variety of trees with their mantles of creeping plants while a little imagination can see in the alligators ganoid fishes sea cows and tall gray herons the ichthyosaurus holoptychius dinotherium and brontozoum of ancient days Here and there the river is bordered with low alluvial deposits covered with feathery topped arrow grass and amphibious vegetation but generally the banks are about ten feet high and magnificently wooded they are abrupt and land slides are frequent A few minutes after leaving Tabatinga we passed the mouth of the Javari which forms the natural boundary between Peru and Brazil Henceforth the river loses the name of Maranon and is called Solimoens or more commonly simply Amazon We were ten hours in reaching San Paulo a wretched Ticuna village of five hundred souls built on a grassy table land nearly one hundred feet high Steps have been cut in the slippery clay bluff to facilitate the ascent Swamps lie back of the town rendering it unhealthy On damp nights says the Naturalist on the Amazon the chorus of frogs and toads which swarm in weedy back yards creates such a bewildering uproar that it is impossible to carry on a conversation in doors except by shouting In ten hours more we had passed the Putumayo and entered the Tunantins a sluggish dark colored tributary emptying into the Amazon about two hundred miles below the Javari one hundred thirty six On the bank of white earth which strongly contrasts with the tinted stream is a dilapidated hamlet of twenty five hovels built of bamboo plastered with mud and whitewashed We saw but one two storied house and all have ground floors and double thatched roofs The inhabitants are semi civilized Shumana and Passe Indians and half breeds but in the gloomy forest which hugs the town live the wild Caishanas The atmosphere is close and steaming but not hot the mercury at noon standing at eighty three deg The place is alive with insects and birds The nights on the Amazon were invariably cool on the Lower Amazon cold so that we required a heavy blanket Footnote one hundred thirty six Herndon says p two hundred forty one the Tunantins is about fifty yards broad and seems deep with a considerable current Illustration Kitchen on the Amazon Taking on board wood beeves turtles salt fish and water melons we left at half past two P M The Brazilian steamers run all night and with no slackening of speed At one o clock we were awakened by a cry from the watch Stop her And immediately after there was a crash but it was only the breaking of crockery caused by the sudden stoppage The night was fearfully dark and for aught we knew the steamer was running headlong into the forest Fortunately there was no collision and in a few minutes we were again on our way arriving at Fonte Boa at four A M This little village stands in a palm grove on a high bank of ochre colored sandy clay beside a slue of sluggish black water eight miles from the Amazon one hundred thirty seven The inhabitants about three hundred are ignorant lazy mamelucos They dress like the majority of the semi civilized people on the Amazon the men content with shirt and pantaloons the women wearing cotton or gauze chemises and calico petticoats Fonte Boa is a museum for the naturalist but the headquarters of musquitoes small but persistent Taking in a large quantity of turtle oil the Icamiaba turned down the cano but almost immediately ran aground and we were two hours getting off These yearly shifting shoals in the Amazon can not be laid down in charts and the most experienced pilots often run foul of them In twelve hours we entered the Teffe a tributary from the Bolivian mountains Just before reaching the Great River it expands into a beautiful lake with a white sandy beach On a grassy slope stretching out into the lake with a harbor on each side of it lies the city of Ega A hundred palm thatched cottages of mud and tiled frame houses each with an inclosed orchard of orange lemon banana and guava trees surround a rude church marked by a huge wooden crucifix on the green before it instead of a steeple Cacao assai and pupunha palms rise above the town adding greatly to its beauty while back of all on the summit of the green slope begins the picturesque forest pathless save here and there a faint hunter s track leading to the untrodden interior The sheep and cattle grazing on the lawn a rare sight in Alto Amazonas gives a peaceful and inviting aspect to the scene The inhabitants numbering about twelve hundred are made up of pure Indians half castes negroes mulattoes and whites Ega also called Teffe is the largest and most thriving town between Manaos and Iquitos a distance of twelve hundred miles It is also one of the oldest settlements on the river having been founded during the English revolution or nearly two centuries ago Tupi is the common idiom The productions of the country are cacao sarsaparilla Brazil nuts bast for caulking vessels copaiba balsam India rubber salt fish turtle oil manati grass hammocks and tiles Bates calculates the value of the annual exports at nearly forty thousand dollars The Icamiaba calls here twice a month besides which there are small schooners which occupy about five months in the round trip between Ega and Para The place is healthy writes the charming Naturalist on the Amazon and almost free from insect pests perpetual verdure surrounds it the soil is of marvelous fertility even for Brazil the endless rivers and labyrinths of channels teem with fish and turtle a fleet of steamers might anchor at any season of the year in the lake which has uninterrupted water communication straight to the Atlantic What a future is in store for the sleepy little tropical village Here Bates pursued butterflies for four years and a half and Agassiz fished for six months Footnote one hundred thirty seven Smyth says the town gets its name from the clearness of the water but Herndon found it muddy and to our eyes it was dark as the Negro Illustration Natives on the Middle Amazon Ega is the half way point across the continent but its exact altitude above the sea is unknown Herndon s boiling apparatus gave two thousand feet and what is worse the lieutenant believed it Our barometer made it one hundred feet but as our instrument though perfect in itself behaved very strangely on the Middle Amazon we do not rely on the calculation The true height is not far from one hundred and twenty five feet or one fifth the elevation of the middle point in the North American continent one hundred thirty eight Taking on board salt fish turtle oil and tiles we left Ega two hours after midnight reaching Coary at noon The Amazon began to look more like a lake than a river having a width of four or five miles Floating gulls and rolling porpoises remind one of the sea Coary is a huddle of fifteen houses six of them plastered without whitewashed and tiled It is situated on a lake of the same name the expanded outlet of a small river whose waters are dark brown and whose banks are low and covered with bushes Here we took in turtles and turtle oil Brazil nuts and cocoa nuts rubber salt fish and wood and six hours after leaving more fish and rubber were received at Cudaja Cudaja is a lonely spot on the edge of an extensive system of back waters and lakes running through a dense unexplored forest inhabited by Mura savages Footnote one hundred thirty eight For a discussion of the barometric perturbations on the Amazon see American Journal of Science for Sept eighteen sixty eight At three in the afternoon of Christmas seventy four hours running time from Tabatinga we entered the Rio Negro Strong is the contrast between its black dyed waters and the yellow Amazon The line separating the two rivers is sharply drawn the waters meeting not mingling Circular patches of the dark waters of the Negro are seen floating like oil amid the turbid waters of the Amazon The sluggish tributary seems to be dammed up by the impetuous monarch The banks of the latter are low ragged perpendicular beds of clay covered with a bright green foliage the Negro is fringed with sandy beaches with hills in the background clothed with a sombre monotonous forest containing few palms or leguminous trees Musquitoes piums and montucas never trouble the traveler on the inky stream When seen in a tumbler the water of the Negro is clear but of a light red color due undoubtedly to vegetable matter The visible mouth of the river at this season of the year December is three miles wide but from main land to main land it can not be less than twenty Illustration A Siesta In forty minutes after leaving the Amazon we arrived at Manaos This important city lies on the left bank of the Negro ten miles from its mouth and twenty feet above high water level The site is very uneven and consists of ferruginous sandstone There was originally a fort here erected by the Portuguese to protect their slave hunting expeditions among the Indians on the river hence the ancient name of Barra On the old map of Father Fritz seventeen oh seven the spot is named Taromas Since eighteen fifty two it has been called Manaos after the most warlike tribe Some of the houses are two storied but the majority are low adobe structures white and yellow washed floored and roofed with tiles and having green doors and shutters Every room is furnished with hooks for hanging hammocks We did not see a bed between Quito and New York except on the steamers The population numbering two thousand one hundred thirty nine is a mongrel set Brazilians Portuguese Italians Jews Negroes and Indians with divers crosses between them Laziness is the prominent characteristic A gentleman offered an Indian passing his door twenty five cents if he would bring him a pitcher of water from the river only a few rods distant He declined But I will give you fifty cents Whereupon the half clothed penniless aboriginal replied I will give you a dollar to bring me some one hundred forty While every inch of the soil is of exuberant fertility there is always a scarcity of food It is the dearest spot on the Amazon Most of the essentials and all of the luxuries come from Liverpool Lisbon and New York Agriculture is at a discount on the Amazon Brazilians will not work European immigrants are traders nothing can be done with Indians and negroes are few in number the slave trade being abolished emancipation begun and the Paraguayan war not ended A laboring class will ever be a desideratum in this tropical country With a healthy climate one hundred forty one and a situation at the juncture of two great navigable rivers Manaos is destined to become the saint Louis of South America In commercial advantages it is hardly to be surpassed by any other city in the world having water communication with two thirds of the continent and also with the Atlantic It is now the principal station for the Brazilian line of steamers Here all goods for a higher or lower point are reshipped The chief articles of export are coffee of superior quality sarsaparilla Brazil nuts piassaba and fish The Negro at this point is really five or six miles wide but the opposite shore is masked by low islands so that it appears to be but a mile and a half Footnote one hundred thirty nine Official returns for eighteen forty eight give three thousand six hundred fourteen Bates eighteen fifty reckons three thousand Footnote one hundred forty Darwin met a similar specimen in Banda Oriental I asked two men why they did not work One gravely said the days were too long the other that he was too poor Footnote one hundred forty one It is however one of the warmest spots on the river The average temperature according to Azevedo and Pinto is only seventy nine point seven deg but the highest point readied on the Amazon in eighteen sixty two eighty seven point three deg was at Manaos and the extraordinary height of ninety five deg has been noted there The country around Manaos is quite romantic for the Amazonian Valley The land is undulating and furrowed by ravines and the vegetation covering it is marvelously rich and diversified In the forest two miles from the city there is a natural curiosity celebrated by all travelers from Spix and Martius down A rivulet coming out of the wilderness falls over a ledge of red sandstone ten feet high and fifty feet broad forming a beautiful cascade The water is cool and of a deep orange color The foundation of a fine stone cathedral was laid in Manaos fourteen years ago but this generation is not likely to witness the dedication Life in this Amazonian city is dull enough commerce is not brisk and society is stiff balls are about the only amusements On Sunday the holiday every body who can afford it comes out in Paris fashions There are carts hut no coaches We called upon the President at his Palace an odd term for a two storied whitewashed edifice His excellency received us with less formality and more cordiality than we expected to find in the solemn officials of the empire The first glance at the reception room with the four chairs for visitors set in two lines at right angles to the chair of state promised cold etiquette but he addressed us with considerable familiarity and evident good will We found however that his authority was quite limited for a written order which he gave us for a subordinate did not receive the slightest consideration At the house of a Jew named Levy we met a party of Southerners Captains Mallory Jones Sandedge and Winn commanded by doctor Dowsing who since the late onpleasantness as Nasby calls it have determined to settle in this country The government grants them twenty square leagues of land on any tributary on condition that they will colonize it They were about to start for the Rio Branco on an exploring tour CHAPTER XVII Down the Amazon Serpa Villa Nova Obidos Santarem A Colony of Southerners Monte Alegre Porto do Moz Leaving the Amazon Breves Para River The City of Para Legislation and Currency Religion and Education Nonpareil Climate At ten P M we left Manaos in the Tapajos an iron steamer of seven hundred tons We missed the snow white cleanliness and rigid regularity of the Icamiaba and Captain Jose Antunes Rodrigues de Oliveira Catramby was quite a contrast to Lieutenant Nuno There were only five first class passengers besides ourselves and four of these were dead heads though there were accommodations for sixty four Between Manaos and Para a distance of one thousand miles there were fourteen additions Passing the mouth of the Madeira the largest tributary to the Amazon we anchored thirty miles below at Serpa after nine hours sailing Serpa is a village of ninety houses built on a high bank of variegated clay whence its Indian name Ita coatiara or painted rock It was the most animated place we had seen on the river The town is irregularly laid out and overrun with weeds but there is a busy tile factory and the port was full of canoes montarias and cubertas The African element in the population began to show itself prominently here and increased in importance as we neared Para The Negroes are very ebony and are employed as stevedores The Indians are well featured and wear a long gown of bark cloth reaching to the knees Taking on board rubber and salt fish the Tapajos steamed down stream passing the perpendicular pink clay cliffs of Cararaucu arriving in ten hours at Villa Nova one hundred forty two one hundred and fifty miles below Serpa Villa Nova is a straggling village of mud huts standing on a conglomerate bank The trade is chiefly in rubber copaiba and fish The location is healthy and in many respects is one of the most desirable places on the river Here the Amazon begins to narrow being scarcely three miles wide but the channel which has a rocky bed is very deep One hundred miles from Villa Nova is Obidos airily situated on a bluff of pink and yellow clay one hundred feet above the river The clay rests on a white calcareous earth and this on red sandstone It is a picturesque substantially built town with a population mostly white engaged in raising cacao and cattle Cacao is the most valuable product on the Amazon below Villa Nova The soil is fertile and the surrounding forest is alive with monkeys birds and insects and abounds with precious woods and fruits Obidos is blessed with a church a school and a weekly newspaper and is defended by thirty two guns This is the Thermopylae of the Amazon the great river contracting to a strait not a mile in width through which it rushes with tremendous velocity The depth is forty fathoms and the current two point four feet per second As Bates remarks however the river valley is not contracted to this breadth the southern shore not being continental land but a low alluvial tract subject to inundation Back of Obidos is an eminence which has been named Mount Agassiz in honor of the Naturalist There is no mountain between it and Cotopaxi save the spurs from the Eastern Cordillera Five miles above the town is the mouth of the Trombetas where Orellana had his celebrated fight with the fabulous Amazons Footnote one hundred forty two Otherwise called on Brazilian maps Villa Bella da Imperatriz Illustration Santarem Adding to her cargo wood hides horses and Paraguayan prisoners short athletic men the Tapajos sailed for Santarem The river scenery below Obidos loses its wild and solitary character and is relieved with scattered habitations factories and cacao plantations We arrived at Santarem in seven hours from Obidos a distance of fifty miles This city the largest on the Amazon save Para stands on a pretty slope at the mouth of the Rio Tapajos and five hundred miles from the sea one hundred forty three It mainly consists of three long rows of whitewashed tiled houses girt with green gardens The citizens made up of Brazilians Portuguese mulattoes and blacks number about two thousand five hundred The surrounding country which is an undulating campo with patches of wood is sparsely inhabited by Tapajocos Cattle estates and cacao plantations are the great investments but the soil is poor Considerable sarsaparilla of superior quality rubber copaiba Brazil nuts and farina come down the Tapajos The climate is delightful the trade winds tempering the heat and driving away all insect pests Leprosy is somewhat common among the poorer class At Santarem is one of the largest colonies which migrated from the disaffected Gulf States for Brazil One hundred and sixty Southerners pitched their tents here Many of them however were soon disgusted with the country and if we are to believe reports the country was disgusted with them On the first of January eighteen sixty eight only seventy five remained The colony does not fairly represent the United States being made up in great part of the roughs of Mobile A few are contented and are doing well Amazonia will be indebted to them for some valuable ideas Bates says Butter making is unknown in this country the milk I was told was too poor But these Anglo Saxon immigrants have no difficulty in making butter Santarem sends to Para for sugar but the cavaliers of Alabama are proving that the sugar cane grows better than in Louisiana attaining the height of twenty feet and that it will yield for ten or twelve years without transplanting or cultivation It is not however so sweet or juicy as the Southern cane Some of the colonists are making tapioca and cashaca or Brazilian rum others have gone into the pork business while one doctor Jones expects to realize a fortune burning lime Here we met the rebel ex General Dobbins who had been prospecting on the Tapajos River but had not yet located himself Footnote one hundred forty three Herndon makes Santarem four hundred sixty miles from the Negro and six hundred fifty from the sea Bates calls it four hundred miles from the Atlantic and nearly fifty from Obidos Below Santarem the Amazon vastly increases in width at one point the southern shore was invisible from the steamer The waves often run very high At ten A M eight hours from Santarem we entered the romantic port of Monte Alegre The road from the river to the village just visible inland runs through a pretty dell Back of the village beyond a low swampy flat rise the table topped blue hills of Almeyrim It was an exhilarating sight and a great relief to gaze upon a mountain range from three hundred to one thousand feet high the greatest elevations along the Amazon east of the Andes Agassiz considers these singular mountains the remnants of a plain which once filled the whole valley of the Amazon but Bates believes them to be the southern terminus of the high land of Guiana Their geological constitution a pebbly sandstone favors the Professor s theory The range extends ninety miles along the north bank of the river the western limit at Monte Alegre bearing the local name of Serra Erere Mount Agassiz at Obidos is a spur of the same table land The Amazon is here about five miles wide the southern shore being low uninhabited and covered with coarse grass Five schooners were anchored in the harbor of Monte Alegre a sign of considerable trade for the Amazon The place exports cattle cacao rubber and fish In four hours we reached Prayinha a dilapidated village of forty houses situated on a low sandy beach The chief occupation is the manufacture of turtle oil In ten hours more we were taking in wood at Porto do Moz situated just within the mouth of the Xingu the last great tributary to the Amazon Dismal was our farewell sail on the great river With the highlands came foul weather We were treated to frequent and furious showers accompanied by a violent wind and the atmosphere was filled with smoke caused by numerous fires in the forest Where the Xingu comes in the Amazon is ten miles wide but it is soon divided by a series of islands the first of which is Grand Island Twenty miles below Porto do Moz is Gurupa where we took in rubber The village nearly as inanimate as Pompeii consists of one street half deserted built on an isolated site Forty miles below Gurupa we left the Amazon proper turning to the right down a narrow channel leading into the river Para The forest became more luxuriant the palms especially increasing in number and beauty At one place there was a forest of palms a singularity for trees of the same order are seldom associated The forest densely packed and gloomy stands on very low flat banks of hard river mud Scarcely a sign of animal life was visible but as we progressed dusky faces peered out of the woods little shanties belonging to the seringeros or rubber makers here and there broke the solitude and occasionally a large group of half clad natives greeted us from the shore A labyrinth of channels connects the Amazon with the Para the steamers usually take the Tajapuru This natural canal is of great depth and from fifty to one hundred yards in width so that hemmed in by two green walls eighty feet high we seemed to be sailing through a deep gorge in some places it was so narrow it was nearly overarched by the foliage One hundred and twenty five miles from Gurupa is Breves a busy little town on the southwest corner of the great island of Marajo The inhabitants mostly Portuguese are engaged in the rubber trade the Indians in the vicinity manufacture fancy earthen ware and painted cuyas or calabashes Soon after leaving Breves we entered the Para River which suddenly begins with the enormous width of eight miles It is however shallow and contains numerous shoals and islands It is properly an estuary immense volumes of fresh water flowing into it from the south The tides are felt through its entire length of one hundred and sixty miles but the water is only slightly brackish It has a dingy orange brown color A narrow blue line on our left miles away was all that was visible at times of the island of Marajo and as we passed the broad mouth of the Tocantins we were struck with the magnificent sea like expanse for there was scarcely a point of mainland to be seen Illustration Para At four P M eighteen hours from Breves we entered the peaceful bay of Goajara and anchored in front of the city of Para Beautiful was the view of the city from the harbor in the rays of the declining sun The towering spires and cupolas the palatial government buildings the long row of tall warehouses facing a fleet of schooners ships and steamers and pretty white villas in the suburbs nestling in luxuriant gardens were to us who had just come down the Andes from mediaeval Quito the ultima thule of civilization We seemed to have stepped at once from the Amazon to New York or London We might indeed say ne plus ultra in one respect we had crossed the continent and Para was the terminus of our wanderings the end of romantic adventures of privations and perils We were kindly met on the pier by mister James Henderson an elderly Scotchman whom a long residence in Para a bottomless fund of information and a readiness to serve an Anglo Saxon have made an invaluable cicerone We shot through the devious narrow streets to the Hotel Diana where we made our toilet for our habiliments too had reached their ultima thule As La Condamine said on his arrival at Quito Je me trouvai hors d etat de paroitre en public avec decence The same year which saw Shakspeare carried to his grave beside the Avon witnessed the founding of Para or speaking more respectfully of Santa Maria de Belem do Gram Para The city stands on a low elbow of land formed by the junction of the rivers Guama and Para seventy five miles from the ocean The great forest comes close up to the suburbs and in fact vegetation is so rapid the city fathers have a hard struggle to keep the jungle out of the streets The river in front is twenty miles wide but the vast expanse is broken by numerous islets Ships of any size will float within one hundred and fifty yards of the shore All passengers and goods are landed by boats at the custom house wharf The city is regularly laid out there are several public squares and many of the streets especially in the commercial part are well paved Magnificent avenues lined with silk cotton trees cocoa palms and almonds lead out to beautiful rocinhas or country residences of one story but having spacious verandas The President s house built in the Italian style whose marble staircase is a wonder to Brazil the six large churches including the cathedral after patterns from Lisbon the post office custom house and convent looking warehouses on the mole these are the most prominent buildings The architecture is superior to that of Quito The houses generally two storied are tiled plastered and whitewashed or painted the popular colors are red yellow and blue A few have porcelain facing The majority have elegant balconies and glass windows but not all the old projecting lattice casements have disappeared Some of the buildings bear the marks of the cannonading in the Revolution of eighteen thirty five Instead of bedrooms and beds the largest apartments and verandahs have hooks in the wall for hammocks A carpeted cushioned room is seldom seen and is out of place in the tropics Coaches and gas are supplanting ox carts and candles There are two hotels but scant accommodations for travelers Beef is almost the only meat used the fish are poor and dear the oysters are horrible Bananas oranges and coffee are the best native productions on the table Illustration Fruit Peddlers The population of Para is thirty five thousand or double what it was when Wallace and Bates entered it twenty years ago It is the largest city on the largest river in the world and the capital of a province ten times the size of New York State The enterprising wealthy class consists of Portuguese and pure Brazilians with a few English Germans French and North Americans The multitude is an amalgamation of Portuguese Indian and Negro The diversity of races and the mingled dialects of the Amazon and Europe make an attractive street scene Side by side we see the corpulent Brazilian planter the swarthy Portuguese trader the merry Negro porter and the apathetic Indian boatman Some of the more recent offspring are dressed a la Adam before the fall numbers wear only a shirt or skirt the negro girls who go about the streets with trays of sweetmeats on their heads are loosely yet prettily dressed in pure white with massive gilded chains and earrings but the middle and upper classes generally follow Paris fashions The mechanic arts are in the hands of free Negroes and Indians mulattoes and mamelucos one hundred forty four Commerce is carried on almost exclusively by Portuguese and other foreigners Dry goods come chiefly from England and France groceries from Portugal flour and hardware from the United States The principal exports are rubber cacao coffee one hundred forty five sugar cotton Brazil nuts sarsaparilla vanilla farina copaiba tobacco rum hides fish parrots and monkeys one hundred forty six Para exceeds in the number of its indigenous commodities any other port in the world but the trade at present is insignificant when we consider the vast extent and resources of the country The city can never have a rival at the mouth of the Amazon and is destined to become a great emporium But Brazilian legislation stands in the way Heavy import duties are charged from thirty five to forty five per cent and on the first of January eighteen sixty eight it was ordered that fifteen per cent must be paid in English gold The consequence has been that gold has risen from twenty eight to thirty above par creating an additional tax Exportation is equally discouraging There is a duty of nine per cent to be paid at the custom house and seven per cent more at the consulado But this is not the sum total Those who live outside of the province of Para say above Obidos must first pay an import of thirteen per cent to get their produce into Para For example up the river crude rubber can be bought for twenty five cents a pound the trader pays twenty five cents an arroba thirty two pounds for transportation to Para from Santarem exclusive of canoe hire and shipping thirteen per cent duty in entering Para ten per cent to the commission merchant and sixteen per cent more as export tax making a total loss on labor of about fifty per cent Brazil abounds with the most valuable woods in the world but is prevented from competing with other nations by this system of self strangulation In eighteen sixty seven the import duty on timber was twelve per cent Though situated on the edge of a boundless forest Para consumes large quantities of North American pine There is not a grist mill on the Amazon and only two or three saw mills A dozen boards of red cedar a very common timber costs sixtyzero dollars per thousand about thirty dollars at Santarem There is no duty on goods going to Peru The current money besides foreign gold consists of copper coins and imperial treasury notes The basis of calculation is the imaginary rey equivalent to half a mill The coins in use are the vintem twenty reys answering to our cent the half vintem and double vintem The currency has so fluctuated in value that many of the pieces have been restamped Fifty vintems make a milrey expressed thus onezero dollars This is the smallest paper issue Unfortunately the notes may suddenly fall below par As a great many counterfeits made in Portugal are in circulation the government recalls the issue which has been counterfeited notifying holders by the provincial papers that all such bills must be exchanged for a new issue within six months Those not brought in at the end of that period lose ten per cent of their value and ten per cent for each following month until the value of the note is nil The result has been that many persons trading up the river have lost heavily and now demand hard money Change is very scarce in Para Footnote one hundred forty four We are inclined to doubt the assertion of Mansfield that Paraguay is the only country in eastern South America with an industrious peasantry Footnote one hundred forty five Brazil yields more than one half the quantity of coffee consumed by the world That of Ceara is the best Footnote one hundred forty six In January eighteen sixty eight the current prices were as follows Refined Sugar per arroba three dollars zero Rice one forty Cacao three twenty Coffee three fifty Farina seventy five Tapioca three zero Pure rubber eleven fifty Plassaba cord six fifty Tobacco one fifty Sarsparilla eleven fifty The Brazilian arroba is seven pounds heavier than the Spanish The province of Para is governed by a president chosen at Rio and every four years sends representatives to the Imperial Parliament The Constitution of Brazil is very liberal every householder without distinction of race or color has a vote and may work his way up to high position There are two drawbacks the want of intelligence and virtue in the people and the immense staff of officials employed to administer the government There are also many formalities which are not only useless but a hinderance to prosperity Thus the internal trade of a province carried on by Brazilian subjects is not exempt from the passport system A foreigner finds as much trouble in getting his passport en regle in Para as in Vienna The religion of Para is Romish and not so tolerant as in Rio We arrived during festa When did a traveler enter a Portuguese town on any other than a feast day That night was made hideous with rockets fire crackers cannon and bells Music noise and fireworks says Wallace are the three essentials to please a Brazilian populace The most celebrated shrine in Northern Brazil is Our Lady of Nazareth The little chapel stands about a mile out of the city and is now rebuilding for the third time The image is a doll about the size of a girl ten years old wearing a silver crown and a dress of blue silk glittering with golden stars Hosts of miracles are attributed to Our Lady and we were shown votive offerings and models of legs arms heads et cetera et cetera the grateful in memoriam of wonderful cures besides a boat whose crew were saved by invoking the protection of Mary The facilities for education are improving There are several seminaries in Para of which the chief is the Lyceo da Capital Too many youths however as in Quito are satisfied with a little rhetoric and law The city supports four newspapers Paraenses may well be proud of their delightful climate Wallace says the thermometer ranges from seventy four deg to eighty seven deg our observation made the mean annual temperature eighty point two deg The mean daily temperature does not vary more than two or three degrees The climate is more equable than that of any other observed part of the New World one hundred forty seven The greatest heat is reached at two o clock but it is never so oppressive as in New York The greater the heat the stronger the sea breeze and in three hundred out of three hundred and sixty five days the air is farther cooled by an afternoon shower The rainiest month is April the dryest October or November Lying in the delta of a great river in the middle of the tropics and half surrounded by swamps its salubrity is remarkable We readily excuse the proverb Quem vai para Para para He who goes to Para stops there and we might have made it good had we not been tempted by the magnificent steamer South America which came up from Rio on the way to New York On the moonlit night of the seventh of January when the ice king had thrown his white robes over the North we turned our backs upon the glimmering lights of Para and noiselessly as a canoe glided down the great river As the sun rose for the last time to us upon the land of perpetual verdure our gallant ship was plowing the mottled waters on the edge of the ocean mingled yellow patches of the Amazon and dark streaks from the Para floating on the Atlantic green Far behind us we could see the breakers dashing against the Braganza Banks a moment after Cape Magoary dropped beneath the horizon and with it South America vanished from our view Footnote one hundred forty seven The traveler in going from the equator toward the tropics is less struck by the decrease of the mean annual temperature than by the unequal distribution of heat in different parts of the year Humboldt The great German fixes the mean temperature of the equator at eighty one point five deg Brewster at eighty two point eight deg Kirwan eighty three point nine deg Atkinson eighty four point five deg CHAPTER XVIII The River Amazon Its Source and Magnitude Tributaries and Tints Volume and Current Rise and Fall Navigation Expeditions on the Great River Near the silver mines of Cerro Pasco in the little Lake of Lauricocha just below the limit of perpetual winter rises the King of Waters one hundred forty eight For the first five hundred miles it flows northerly in a continuous series of cataracts and rapids through a deep valley between the parallel Cordilleras of Peru Upon reaching the frontier of Ecuador it turns to the right and runs easterly two thousand five hundred miles across the great equatorial plain of the continent one hundred forty nine No other river flows in the same latitude and retains therefore the same climatic conditions for so great a distance The breadth of the Amazon also is well proportioned to its extraordinary length At Tabatinga two thousand miles above its mouth it is a mile and a half wide at the entrance of the Madeira it is three miles below Santarem it is ten and if the Para be considered a part of the great river it fronts the Atlantic one hundred and eighty miles Brazilians proudly call it the Mediterranean of the New World Its vast expanse presenting below Teffe magnificent reaches with blank horizons and forming a barrier between different species of animals its system of back channels joining the tributaries and linking a series of lagunes too many ever to be named its network of navigable waters stretching over one third of the continent its oceanic fauna porpoises and manatis gulls and frigate birds remind the traveler of a great inland sea with endless ramifications rather than a river The side channels through the forest called by the Indians igarapes or canoe paths are one of the characteristic features of the Amazon one hundred fifty They often run to a great distance parallel to the great river and intersecting the tributaries so that one can go from Santarem a thousand miles up the Amazon without once entering it These natural highways will be of immense advantage for inter communication Illustration Igarape or Canoe path Footnote one hundred forty eight Herndon gives for the altitude of Cerro Pasco thirteen thousand eight hundred two feet Rivero fourteen thousand two hundred seventy nine The lieutenant thus describes his first view from the rough hills surrounding this birthplace of the greatest of rivers I can compare it to nothing so fitly as looking from the broken and ragged edges of a volcano into the crater beneath Footnote one hundred forty nine From Lauricocha to its mouth the Amazon following the main curves is twenty seven forty miles long as estimated by Bates in a straight line twenty fifty from Para to the head of the Ucayali three thousand From north to south the tributaries stretch seventeen twenty miles Footnote one hundred fifty Igarape is sometimes limited to a creek filled with back water paranamirim is the proper term for a narrow arm of the main river and furos are the diminutive mouths of the tributaries But extraordinary as is this network of natural canals the tributaries of the Amazon are still more wonderful They are so numerous they appear on the map like a thousand ribbons streaming from a main mast and many of the obscure affluents though large as the Hudson are unknown to geography From three degrees north to twenty degrees south every river that flows down the eastern slope of the Andes is a contributor as though all the rivers between Mexico and Mount Hooker united their waters in the Mississippi While the great river of the northern continent drains an area of one million two hundred thousand square miles the Amazon not including the Tocantins is spread over a million more or over a surface equal to two thirds of all Europe Let us journey around the grand trunk and take a glimpse of the main branches The first we meet in going up the left bank is the Rio Negro It rises in the Sierra Tunuhy an isolated mountain group in the llanos of Colombia and enters the Amazon at Manaos a thousand miles from the sea The upper part down to the parallel of one degree north has a very rapid current at San Gabriel are the first rapids in ascending between San Gabriel and Barcellos the rate is not over two or three miles per hour between Barcellos and Manaos it is a deep but sluggish river and in the annual rise of the Amazon its waters are stagnant for several hundred miles up or actually flow back Its extreme length is twelve hundred miles and its greatest breadth is at Barcellos where it is twelve or fifteen miles Excepting this middle section the usual breadth of the Negro below the equatorial line is about one mile It is joined to the Orinoco by the navigable Cassiquiari one hundred fifty one a natural canal three fourths of a mile wide and a portage of only two hours divides the head of its tributary the Branco from the Essequibo of Guiana The Negro yields to commerce coffee cacao farina sarsaparilla Brazil nuts pitch piassaba and valuable woods The commerce of Brazil with Venezuela by the Rio Negro amounted in eighteen sixty seven to twenty two thousand dollars of which nine thousand dollars was the value of imports The principal villages above Manaos are San Miguel and Moroa which contain about fifty dwellings each Tireguin Barcellos Toma San Carlos Coana San Gabriel and Santa Isabel Footnote one hundred fifty one The Cassiquiari belongs indifferently to both river systems the level being so complete at one point between them as to obliterate the line of water shed Herschel The next great affluent is the Japura It rises in the mountains of New Granada and flowing southeasterly a thousand miles enters the Amazon opposite Ega five hundred miles above Manaos Its principal mouth is three hundred feet wide but it has a host of distributing channels the extremes of which are two hundred miles apart Its current is only three quarters of a mile an hour and it has been ascended by canoes five hundred miles A natural canal like the Cassiquiari is said to connect it with the Orinoco The products of the Japura are sarsaparilla copaiba rubber cacao farina Brazil nuts moira piranga a hard fine grained wood of a rich cherry red color and carajuru a brilliant scarlet dye Parallel to the Japura is the Putumayo or Issa Its source is the Lake of San Pablo at the foot of the volcano of Pasto its mouth as given by Herndon is half a mile broad and its current two and three fourths miles an hour Farther west are the Napo and Pastassa starting from the volcanoes of Quito The former is nearly seven hundred miles long navigable five hundred The latter is an unnavigable torrent One of its branches the Topo is one continued rapid of those who have fallen into it only one has come out alive Another the Patate rises near Iliniza runs through the plain to a little south of Cotopaxi receives all streams flowing from the eastern side of the western Cordillera from Iliniza to Chimborazo and unites near Tunguragua with the Chambo which rises near Sangai Castelnau and Bates saw pumice floating on the Amazon it was probably brought from Cotopaxi by the Pastassa Crossing the Maranon and going eastward we first pass the Huallaga a rapid river of the size of the Cumberland coming down the Peruvian Andes from an altitude of eight thousand six hundred feet and entering the great river nearly opposite the Pastassa Its mouth is a mile wide and for a hundred miles up its average depth is three fathoms In July August and September the steamers are not able to ascend to Yurimaguas Canoe navigation begins at Tinga Maria three hundred miles from Lima The fertile plain through which the river flows is very attractive to an agriculturist Cotton is gathered six months after sowing and rice in five months At Tarapoto a large amount of cotton cloth is woven for export The next great tributary from the south is the Ucayali This magnificent stream originates near ancient Cuzco and has a fall of eighty seven of a foot per mile and a length nearly equal to that of the Negro For two hundred and fifty miles above its mouth it averages half a mile in width and has a current of three miles an hour At Sarayacu it is twenty feet deep The Ucayali is navigable for at least seven hundred miles The Morona a steamer of five hundred tons has been up to the entrance of the Pachitea in the dry season a distance of six hundred miles and in the wet season ascended that branch to Mayro A small Peruvian steamer has recently ascended the Tambo to within sixty miles of Fort Ramon or seven hundred and seventy three miles from Nauta Leaving the Ucayali we pass by six rivers rising in the unknown lands of Northern Bolivia the Javari navigable by steam for two hundred and fifty miles the sluggish Jutahi half a mile broad and four hundred miles long the Jurua four times the size of our Connecticut and navigable nearly its entire length the unhealthy little known Teffe and Coary and the Purus a deep slow river over a thousand miles long and open to navigation half way to its source Soldan and Pinto claim to have ascended the Javari in a steamer about one thousand miles and it is said Chandlers went up the Purus one thousand eight hundred miles The Teffe is narrow with a strong current Of all these six rivers the Purus is the most important It is probably the Amaru mayu or serpent river of the Incas and its affluents enjoy the privilege of draining the waters of those beautiful Andes which formed the eastern boundary of the empire of Manco Capac and fertilizing the romantic valley of Paucar tambo or Inn of the Flowery Meadow The banks of this noble stream are now held by the untamable Chunchos but the steam whistle will accomplish what the rifle can not The Purus communicates with the Madeira proving the absence of rapids and of intervening mountains Sixty miles below the confluence of the Negro the mighty Madeira the largest tributary of the Amazon blends its milky waters with the turbid king of rivers It is about two thousand miles in length one branch the Beni rising near Lake Titicaca drains the fertile valleys of Yungus and Apollo rich in cinchona chocolate and gold the Marmore springs from the vicinity of Chuquisaca within fifteen miles of a source of the Paraguay traversing the territory of the brave and intelligent Moxos while the Itinez washes down the gold and diamonds of Matto Grosso Were it not for the cascade four hundred and eighty miles from its mouth large vessels might sail from the Amazon into the very heart of Bolivia When full it has a three mile current and at its junction with the Amazon it is two miles wide and sixty six feet deep Five hundred miles from its mouth it is a mile wide and one hundred feet deep It contains numerous islands and runs in a comparatively straight course It received its name from the vast quantity of drift wood often seen floating down The value of Brazilian commerce with Bolivia by the Madeira was in eighteen sixty seven forty three thousand dollars one hundred fifty two Footnote one hundred fifty two In the map of Friar Fritz published in seventeen oh seven the Madeira is one of the most insignificant of the tributaries and the Ucayali and Putumayo are the largest At Santarem the Amazon receives another great tributary the Tapajos or Rio Preto as the Portuguese call it a thousand miles long and for the last eighty miles from four to twelve miles in breadth It rises amid the glittering mines of Matto Grosso only twenty miles from the headwaters of the Rio Plata and flows rapidly down through a magnificent hilly country to the last cataract which is one hundred and sixty miles above Santarem and is the end of navigation to sailing vessels Thence to the Amazon it has little current and no great depth From Santarem to Diamantino it is about twenty six days travel Large quantities of sarsaparilla rubber tonka beans mandioca and guarana are brought down this river Parallel to the Tapajos and about two hundred miles distant flows the Xingu It rises in the heart of the empire has the length of the Ohio and Monongahela and can be navigated one hundred and fifty miles This is the last great tributary of the Amazon proper if however we consider the Para as only one of the outlets of the great river we may then add to the list the grand Tocantins one hundred fifty three This splendid river has its source in the rich province of Minas the source also of the San Francisco and Uruguay not six hundred miles from Rio Janeiro a region possessing the finest climate in Brazil and yielding diamonds and rubies the sapphire topaz and opal gold silver and petroleum The Tocantins is sixteen hundred miles long and ten miles broad at its mouth but unfortunately rapids commence one hundred and twenty miles above Cameta The Araguaia its main branch is according to Castelnau one mile wide with a current of three fourths of a mile an hour Footnote one hundred fifty three We are inclined to hold with Bates and others that the Para River is not strictly speaking one of the mouths of the Amazon It is made to appear so on many of the maps in common use because the channels which connect it with the main river are there given much broader than they are in reality conveying the impression that a large body of water finds an outlet from the main river into the Para It is doubtful however if there be any considerable stream of water flowing constantly downward through these channels There is a great contrast in general appearance between the Para and the main Amazon In the former the flow of the tide always creates a strong current upward while in the Amazon the turbid flow of the mighty stream overpowers all tides and produces a constant downward current The color of the water is different that of the Para being of a dingy orange brown while the Amazon has an ochreous or yellowish clay tint The forests on their banks have a different aspect On the Para the infinitely diversified trees seem to rise directly out of the water the forest frontage is covered with greenery and wears a placid aspect while the shores of the main Amazon are encumbered with fallen trunks and are fringed with a belt of broad leaved grasses Naturalist on the Amazon i p three five Here are six tributaries all of them superior to any river in Europe outside of Russia save the Danube and ten times greater than any stream on the west slope of the Andes While the Arkansas joins the Mississippi four hundred miles above New Orleans the Madeira of equal length enters the Amazon nine hundred miles from Para But vast as are these tributary streams they seem to make no impression on the Amazon they are lost like brooks in the ocean Our ideas of the magnitude of the great river are wonderfully increased when we see the Madeira coming down two thousand miles yet its enormous contribution imperceptible half way across the giant river or the dark waters of the Negro creeping along the shore and becoming undistinguishable five miles from its mouth Though the Amazon carries a larger amount of sediment than any other river it has no true delta the archipelago in its mouth for like our own saint Lawrence it has its Bay of a Thousand Isles not being an alluvial formation but having a rocky base The great island of Marajo in physical configuration resembles the mainland of Guiana The deltoid outlet is confined to the tributaries nearly all of them like the disembogning Nile emptying themselves by innumerable embouchures To several tributaries the Amazon gives water before it receives their tribute Thus by ascending the Negro sixty miles we have the singular spectacle of water pouring in from the Amazon through the Guariba Channel The waters of this great river system are of divers tints The Amazon as it leaps from the Andes and as far down as the Ucayali is blue passing into a clear olive green likewise the Pastassa Huallaga Tapajos Xingu and Tocantins Below the Ucayali it is of a pale yellowish olive the Madeira one hundred fifty four Purus Jurua Jutahi Javari Ucayali Napo Ica and Japura are of similar color The Negro Coary and Teffe are black Humboldt observes that a cooler atmosphere fewer musquitoes greater salubrity and absence of crocodiles as also of fish mark the region of these black rivers This is not altogether true The Amazon throughout is healthy being swept by the trade winds The branches which are not so constantly refreshed by the ocean breezes are occasionally malarious the white water tributaries except when they have a slack current in the dry season have the best reputation while intermittent fevers are nearly confined to the dark colored streams Much of the sickness on these tropical waters however is due to exposure and want of proper food rather than to the climate The river system of South America will favorably compare in point of salubrity with the river system of its continental neighbor one hundred fifty five Footnote one hundred fifty four The Madeira has often a milky color which it receives from the white clay along its banks Footnote one hundred fifty five The average temperature of the water in the Lower Amazon is eighty one deg that of the air being a little less The temperature of the Huallaga at Yurimaguas was seventy five deg when the air was eighty eight deg in the shade in another experiment both the river and air were eighty deg The Maranon at Iquitos was seventy nine deg when the air was ninety deg At the mouth of the Jurua Herndon found both water and air eighty two deg In the tropics the difference between the temperature of the water and air is proportionally less than in high latitudes As we might expect the volume of the Amazon is beyond all parallel Half a million cubic feet of water pour through the narrows of Obidos every second and fresh water may be taken up from the Atlantic far out of sight of land The fall of the main easterly trunk of the Amazon is about six and a half inches per mile equivalent to a slope of twenty one the same as that of the Nile and one third that of the Mississippi Below Jaen there are thirty cataracts and rapids at the Pongo de Manseriche at the altitude of eleven sixty four feet according to Humboldt it bids adieu to mountain scenery Between Tabatinga and the ocean the average current is three miles an hour It diminishes toward Para and is every where at a minimum in the dry season but it always has the swing of an ocean current Though not so rapid as the Mississippi the Amazon is deeper There are seven fathoms of water at Nauta twenty two hundred miles from the Atlantic eleven at Tabatinga and twenty seven on the average below Mandaos one hundred fifty six Footnote one hundred fifty six The assertion of the Ency Metropolitana that its current has great violence and rapidity and its depth is unfathomable must be received with some allowance The Amazon and its branches are subject to an annual rise of great regularity It does not take place simultaneously over the whole river but there is a succession of freshets At the foot of the Andes the rise commences in January at Ega it begins about the end of February Coinciding with this contribution from the west the October rains on the highlands of Bolivia and Brazil swell the southern tributaries whose accumulated floods reach the main stream in February and the latter unable to discharge the avalanche of waters inundates a vast area and even crowds up the northern tributaries As the Madeira Tapajos and Purus subside the Negro fed by the spring rains in Guiana and Venezuela presses downward till the central stream rolls back the now sluggish affluents from the south There is therefore a rhythmical correspondence in the rise and fall of the arms of the Amazon so that this great fresh water sea sways alternately north and south while the onward swell in the grand trunk is a progressive undulation eastward As the Cambridge Professor well says In this oceanic river the tidal action has an annual instead of a daily ebb and flow it obeys a larger orb and is ruled by the sun and not the moon As the southern affluents have the greatest volume the Amazon receives its largest accession after the sun has been in the southern hemisphere The rise is gradual increasing to one foot per day One lowland after another sinks beneath the flood the forest stands up to its middle in the water and shady dells are transformed into navigable creeks one hundred fifty seven Swarms of turtles leave the river for the inland lakes flocks of wading birds migrate to the banks of the Negro and Orinoco to enjoy the cloudless sky of the dry season alligators swim where a short time before the jaguar lay in wait for the tapir and the natives unable to fish huddle in their villages to spend the winter of their discontent The Lower Amazon is at its minimum in September or October The rise above this lowest level is between seven and eight fathoms If we consider the average width of the Amazon two miles we shall have a surface of at least five thousand square miles raised fifty feet by the inundation An extraordinary freshet is expected every sixth year Footnote one hundred fifty seven The flooded lands are called gapos The Atlantic tide is perceptible at Obidos four hundred and fifty miles above Para and Bates observed it up the Tapajos five hundred and thirty miles distant The tide however does not flow up there is only a rising and falling of the waters the momentary check of the great river in its conflict with the ocean The bore or piroroco is a colossal wave at spring tide rising suddenly along the whole width of the Amazon to a height of twelve or fifteen feet and then collapsing with a frightful roar The Amazon presents an unparalleled extent of water communication So many and far reaching are its tributaries it touches every country on the continent except Chile and Patagonia South America is well nigh quartered by its river system the Amazon starts within sixty miles of the Pacific the Tapajos and Madeira reach down to the La Plata while the Negro mingles its waters with those of the Orinoco The tributaries also communicate with each other by intersecting canals so numerous that central Amazonia is truly a cluster of islands Wagons and railroads will be out of the question for ages hence in this aquatic basin No other river runs in so deep a channel to so great a distance For two thousand miles from its month there are not less than seven fathoms of water Not a fall interrupts navigation on the main stream for two thousand five hundred miles and it so happens that while the current is ever east for even the ocean can not send up its tide against it there is a constant trade wind westward so that navigation up or down has always something in its favor As a general rule the breeze is not so strong during the rise of the river There are at least six thousand miles of navigation for large vessels It was lately said that the Mississippi carries more vessels in a month and the Yang tse Kiang in a day than the Amazon all the year round But this is no longer true Steamers already ascend regularly to the port of Moyabamba which is less than twenty days travel from the Pacific coast The Amazon was opened to the world September seven eighteen sixty seven and the time can not be far distant when the exhaustless wealth of the great valley its timber fruit medicinal plants gums and dye stuffs will be emptied by this great highway into the commercial lap of the Atlantic when crowded steamers will plow all these waters yellow black and blue and the sloths and alligators monkeys and jaguars toucans and turtles will have a bad time of it Officially free to the world the great river is however for the present practically closed to foreign shipping as it is difficult to compete with the Brazilian steamers For by the contract which lasts till eighteen seventy seven the company is allowed an annual subsidy of four million dollars which has since been increased by two hundred fifty milreys per voyage In eighteen sixty seven the steamers and sailing vessels on the Amazon were divided as follows though it must be remembered that few of the foreign ships excepting Portuguese ascended beyond Para Nationality No Tonnage United States thirty seven thirty nine thousand nine hundred one one two Brazil forty nine twenty eight thousand six hundred thirty nine England fifty two thirteen thousand two hundred seventy six one two Portugal twenty four seven thousand eight hundred seventy one France eighteen five thousand three hundred forty four Prussia four eight hundred eighty nine one two Holland three five hundred thirty eight Denmark two five hundred twenty five Holstein three four hundred ninety eight Norway one one hundred thirty five Spain one ninety The vessels carrying the stars and stripes exported from Para to the value of three billion two hundred thirty five million seventy three thousand nine hundred fifty dollars or eight times the amount carried by Brazilian craft and fifty thousand milreys more than England While therefore the Imperial Company has the monopoly of trade on the Amazon our ships distribute one third of the products to the world The United States is the natural commercial partner with Brazil for not only is New York the half way house between Para and Liverpool but a chip thrown into the sea at the mouth of the Amazon will float close by Cape Hatteras The official value of exports from Para in eighteen sixty seven was nine billion nine hundred twenty six million nine hundred twelve thousand five hundred fifty seven dollars or about five millions of dollars an increase of one million over eighteen sixty six The early expeditions into the Valley of the Amazon in search of the Gilded King are the most romantic episodes in the history of Spanish discovery To the wild wanderings of these worshipers of gold succeeded the more earnest explorations of the Jesuits those pioneers of geographical knowledge Pinzon discovered the mouth of the river in fifteen hundred but Orellana who came down the Napo in fifteen forty one was the first to navigate its waters Twenty years later Aguirre descended from Cuzco in sixteen thirty seven Texeira ascended to Quito by the Napo Cabrera descended from Peru in sixteen thirty nine Juan de Palacios by the Napo in seventeen twenty five La Condamine from Jaen in seventeen forty four and Madame Godin by the Pastassa in seventeen sixty nine The principal travelers who preceded us in crossing the continent this century were Mawe eighteen twenty eight Poeppig eighteen thirty one Smyth eighteen thirty four Von Tschudi eighteen forty five Castelnau eighteen forty six Herndon and Gibbon eighteen fifty one and Marcoy eighteen sixty seven who came down through Peru and a Spanish commission Almagro Spada Martinez and Isern who made the Napo transit in eighteen sixty five To Spix and Martius eighteen twenty Bates and Wallace eighteen forty eight eighteen fifty seven Azevedo and Pinto eighteen sixty two eighteen sixty four and Agassiz eighteen sixty five the world is indebted for the most scientific surveys of the river in Brazil Such is the Amazon the mightiest river in the world rising amid the loftiest volcanoes on the globe and flowing through a forest unparalleled in extent It only wants wrote Father Acuna in order to surpass the Ganges Euphrates and the Nile in felicity that its source should be in Paradise As if one name were not sufficient for its grandeur it has three appellations Maranon Solimoens and Amazon the first applied to the part in Peru the second to the portion between Tabatinga and Manaos and the third to all below the Rio Negro one hundred fifty eight We have no proper conception of the vast dimensions of the thousand armed river till we sail for weeks over its broad bosom beholding it sweeping disdainfully by the great Madeira as if its contribution was of no account discharging into the sea one hundred thousand cubic feet of water per second more than our Mississippi rolling its turbid waves thousands of miles exactly as it pleases plowing a new channel every year with tributaries twenty miles wide and an island in its mouth twice the size of Massachusetts Footnote one hundred fifty eight The upper part of the Maranon from its source to Jaen is sometimes called the Tunguragua Solimoens is now seldom heard but instead Middle Amazon or simply Amazon The term Alto Amazonas or High Amazon is also applied to all above the Negro Maranon says Velasco derives its name from the circumstance that a soldier sent by Pizarro to discover the sources of the Rio Piura having beheld the mighty stream from the neighborhood of Jaen and astonished to behold a sea of fresh water exclaimed Hac mare an non Orellana s pretended fight with a nation of female warriors gave rise to the Portuguese name of the river Amazonas anglicized Amazon after the mythical women in Cappadocia who are said to have burnt off their right breasts that they might use the bow and javelin with more skill and force and hence their name Greek Amazones from Greek a and Greek mazos Orellana s story probably grew out of the fact that the men wear long tunics part the hair in the middle and in certain tribes alone wear ornaments Some derive the name from the Indian word amassona boat destroyer The old name Orellana after the discoverer is obsolete as also the Indian term Parana tinga or King of Waters In ordinary conversation it is designated as the river in distinction from its tributaries In all parts of the world says Hamboldt the largest rivers are called by those who dwell on their banks The River without any distinct and peculiar appellation CHAPTER XIX The Valley of the Amazon Its Physical Geography Geology Climate Vegetation From the Atlantic shore to the foot of the Andes and from the Orinoco to the Paraguay stretches the great Valley of the Amazon In this vast area the United States might be packed without touching its boundaries It could contain the basins of the Mississippi the Danube the Nile and the Hoang Ho It is girt on three sides by a wall of mountains on the north are the highlands of Guiana and Venezuela on the west stand the Andes on the south rise the table lands of Matto Grosso The valley begins at such an altitude that on the western edge vegetation differs as much from the vegetation at Para though in the same latitude as the flora of Canada from the flora of the West Indies The greater part of the region drained by the Amazon however is not a valley proper but an extensive plain From the mouth of the Napo to the ocean a distance of eighteen hundred miles in a straight line the slope is one foot in five miles one hundred fifty nine At Coca on the Napo the altitude is eight hundred fifty feet according to our observations at Tinga Maria on the Huallaga it is twenty two hundred according to Herndon at the junction of the Negro with the Cassiquiari it is four hundred according to Wallace at the mouth of the Marmore it is eight hundred according to Gibbon at the Pongo de Manseriche below all rapids it is eleven sixty according to Humboldt and at the junction of Araguaia with the Tocantins it is two hundred according to Castelnau These barometrical measurements represent the basin of the Amazon as a shallow trough lying parallel to the equator the southern side having double the inclination of the northern and the whole gently sloping eastward Farthermore the channel of the great river is not in the centre of the basin but lies to the north of it thus the hills of Almeyrim rise directly from the river while the first falls on the Tocantins Xingu and Tapajos are nearly two hundred miles above their mouths the rapids of San Gabriel on the Negro are one hundred and seventy five miles from the Amazon while the first obstruction to the navigation of the Madeira is a hundred miles farther from the great river Footnote one hundred fifty nine Professor Agassiz gives the average slope as hardly more than a foot in ten miles which is based on the farther assertion that the distance from Tabatinga to the sea shore is more than two thousand miles in a straight line The distance is not sixteen hundred or exactly fifteen hundred from Para See A Journey in Brazil p three hundred forty nine Of the creation of this valley we have already spoken No region on the face of the globe of equal extent has such a monotonous geology Around the rim of the basin are the outcroppings of a cretaceous deposit this rests on the hidden mezozoic and palaeozoic strata which form the ribs of the Andes Above it covering the whole basin from New Granada to the Argentine Republic one hundred sixty are the following formations first a stratified accumulation of sand second a series of laminated clays of divers colors without a pebble third a fine compact sandstone fourth a coarse porous sandstone so ferruginous as to resemble bog iron ore This last was originally a thousand feet in thickness but was worn down perhaps in some sudden escape of the pent up waters of the valley The table topped hills of Almeyrim are almost the sole relics one hundred sixty one Finally over the undulating surface of the denuded sandstone an ochraceous unstratified sandy clay was deposited Footnote one hundred sixty Messrs Myers and Forbes found this red clay on the Negro most abundantly near Barcellos also in small quantities on the Orinoco above Maipures The officers of the Morona assured us that the same formation was traceable far up the Ucayali and Huallaga This clay from the Amazon as examined microscopically by Prof H James Clark contains fragments of gasteropod shells and bivalve casts The red earth of the Pampas according to Ehrenberg contains eight fresh water to one salt water animalcule Footnote one hundred sixty one On the South American coast where tertiary and supra tertiary beds have been extensively elevated I repeatedly noticed that the uppermost beds were formed of coarser materials than the lower this appears to indicate that as the sea becomes shallower the force of the waves or currents increased Darwin s Observations pt ii one hundred thirty one Nowhere in the Pampas is there any appearance of much superficial denudation Pt iii one hundred It is a question to what period this great accumulation is to be assigned Humboldt called it Old Red Sandstone Martius pronounced it New Red Agassiz says Drift the glacial deposit brought down from the Andes and worked over by the melting of the ice which transported it one hundred sixty two The Professor farther declares that these deposits are fresh water deposits they show no sign of a marine origin no sea shells nor remains of any marine animal have as yet been found throughout their whole extent tertiary deposits have never been observed in any part of the Amazonian basin This was true up to eighteen sixty seven Neither Bates Wallace nor Agassiz found any marine fossil on the banks of the great river But there is danger in building a theory on negative evidence These explorers ascended no farther than Tabatinga Two hundred miles west of that fort is the little Peruvian village of Pebas at the confluence of the Ambiyacu We came down the Napo and Maranon and stopped at this place Here we discovered a fossiliferous bed intercalated between the variegated clays so peculiar to the Amazon It was crowded with marine tertiary shells This was Pebas vs Cambridge It was unmistakable proof that the formation was not drift but tertiary not of fresh but salt water origin The species as determined by W M Gabb esquire of Philadelphia are Neritina pupa Turbonilla minuscula Mesalia Ortoni Tellina Amazonenis Pachydon obliqua and P tenua one hundred sixty three All of these are new forms excepting the first and the last is a new genus It is a singular fact that the Neritina is now living in the West India waters and the species found at Pebas retains its peculiar markings So that we have some ground for the supposition that not many years ago there was a connection between the Caribbean Sea and the Upper Amazon in other words that Guiana has only very lately ceased to be an island There is no mountain range on the water shed between the Orinoco and the Negro and Japura but the three rivers are linked by natural canals one hundred sixty four Interstratified with the clay deposit are seams of a highly bituminous lignite we traced it from near the mouth of the Curaray on the Rio Napo to Loreto on the Maranon a distance of about four hundred miles It occurs also at Iquitos This is farther testimony against the glacial theory of the formation of the Amazonian Valley The paucity of shells in such a vast deposit is not astonishing It is as remarkable in the similar accumulation of reddish argillaceous earth called Pampean mud which overspreads the Rio Plata region one hundred sixty five Some of the Pampa shells like those at Pebas are proper to brackish water and occur only on the highest banks The Pampean formation is believed by mister Darwin to be an estuary or delta deposit We will mention in this connection that silicified wood is found at the head waters of the Napo the Indians use it instead of flint which does not occur there in striking a light Darwin found silicified trees on the same slope of the Andes as the Uspallata Pass Footnote one hundred sixty two A Journey in Brazil p two hundred fifty four hundred eleven four hundred twenty four Again in his Lecture before the Lowell Institute eighteen sixty six These deposits could not have been made by the sea nor in a large lake as they contain no marine nor fresh water fossils Footnote one hundred sixty three These interesting fossils are figured and described in the Am Journal of Conchology Footnote one hundred sixty four The whole basin between the Orinoco and the Amazon is composed of granite and gneiss slightly covered with debris There is a total absence of sedimentary rocks The surface is often bare and destitute of soil the undulations being only a few feet above or below a straight line Evan Hopkins in Quart Jour Geol Soc vol vi Footnote one hundred sixty five See Darwin on the absence of extensive modern conchiferous deposits in South America Geological Observations pt iii ch v The climatology of the Valley of the Amazon is as simple as its physical geography There is no circle of the seasons as with us nature moves in a straight line The daily order of the weather is uniform for months There is very little difference between the dry and hot seasons the former lasting from July to December is varied with showers and the latter from January to June with sunny days while the daily temperature is the same within two or three degrees throughout the year On the water shed between the Orinoco and Negro it rains throughout the year but most water falls between May and November the coolest season in that region On the Middle Negro the wet season extends from June first to December first and is the most sultry time Comparatively few insects birds or beasts are to be seen in summer but it is the harvest time of the inhabitants who spend the glorious weather rambling over the plaias and beaches fishing and turtle hunting The middle of September is the midsummer of the valley The rainy season or winter is ushered in by violent thunder storms from the west It is then that the woods are eloquent with buzzing insects shrill cicadas screaming parrots chattering monkeys and roaring jaguars The greatest activity of animal and vegetable life is in June and July The heaviest rains fall in April May and June Scarcely ever is there a continuous rain for twenty four hours Castelnau witnessed at Pebas a fall of not less than thirty inches in a single storm The greatest amount noticed in New York during the whole month of September was twelve point two inches The humidity of the atmosphere as likewise the luxuriance of vegetation and the abundance and beauty of animal forms increases from the Atlantic to the Andes At the foot of the Andes Poeppig found that the most refined sugar in a few days dissolved into sirup and the best gunpowder became liquid even when inclosed in canisters So we found the Napo steaming with vapor Fogs however are rarely seen on the Amazon The animals and plants are not all simultaneously affected by the change of seasons The trees retain their verdure through the dry vera o and have no set time for renewing their foliage There are a few trees like Mongruba which drop their leaves at particular seasons but they are so few in number they create the impression of a few dead leaves in a thick growing forest Leaves are falling and flowers drooping all the year round Each species and in some cases each individual has its own particular autumn and spring There is no hibernation nor aestivation except by land shells birds have not one uniform time for nidification and moulting extends from February to May Amazonia though equatorially situated has a temperate climate It is cooler than Guinea or Guiana This is owing to the constant evaporation from so much submerged land and the ceaseless trade winds The mean annual temperature of the air is about eighty one deg one hundred sixty six The nights are always cool There are no sudden changes and no fiery dog days Venereal and cutaneous affections are found among the people but they spring from an irregular life A traveler on the slow black tributaries may take the tertiana but only after weeks of exposure Yellow fever and cholera seldom ascend the river above Para and on the Middle Amazon there are neither endemics nor epidemics though the trades are feebly felt there and the air is stagnant and sultry According to Bates swampy and weedy places on the Amazon are generally more healthy than dry ones Whatever exceptions be taken to the branches the main river is certainly as healthy as the Mississippi the rapid current of the water and the continual movement of the air maintaining its salubrity The few English residents Messrs Hislop Jeffreys and Hauxwell who have lived here thirty or forty years are as fresh and florid as if they had never left their native country The native women preserve their beauty until late in life Great is the contrast between the gloomy winters and dusty summers the chilly springs and frosty autumns of the temperate zone and the perennial beauty of the equator No traveler on the Amazon would exchange what Wallace calls the magic half hour after sunset for the long gray twilight of the north The man accustomed to this climate wrote Herndon is ever unwilling to give it up for a more bracing one Footnote one hundred sixty six Agassiz calls the average temperature eighty four deg which it seems to us is too high The mean between the temperatures of Para Manaos and Tabatinga is eighty point seven deg The mineral kingdom is represented only by sand clay and loam The solid rock except the sandstone already mentioned begins above the falls on the tributaries The precious gems and metals are confined to the still higher lands of Goyaz Matto Grosso and the slopes of the Andes The soil on the Lower Amazon is sandy on the Solimoens and Maranon it is a stiff loam or vegetable mould in many places twenty feet deep Both in botany and zoology South America is a natural and strongly marked division quite as distinct from North America as from the Old World and as there are no transverse barriers there is a remarkable unity in the character of the vegetation No spot on the globe contains so much vegetable matter as the Valley of the Amazon From the grassy steppes of Venezuela to the treeless Pampas of Buenos Ayres expands a sea of verdure in which we may draw a circle of eleven hundred miles in diameter which shall include an ever green unbroken forest There is a most bewildering diversity of grand and beautiful trees a wild unconquered race of vegetable giants draped festooned corded matted and ribboned with climbing and creeping plants woody and succulent in endless variety The exuberance of nature displayed in these million square acres of tangled impenetrable forest offers a bar to civilization nearly as great as its sterility in the African deserts A macheta is a necessary predecessor the moment you land and it is often difficult to get a footing on the bank you are confronted by a wall of vegetation Lithe lianas starred with flowers coil up the stately trees and then hang down like strung jewels they can be counted only by myriads yet they are mere superfluities The dense dome of green overhead is supported by crowded columns often branchless for eighty feet The reckless competition among both small and great adds to the solemnity and gloom of a tropical forest Individual struggles with individual and species with species to monopolize the air light and soil In the effort to spread their roots some of the weaker sort unable to find a footing climb a powerful neighbor and let their roots dangle in the air while many a full grown tree has been lifted up as it were in the strife and now stands on the ends of its stilt like roots so that a man may walk upright between the roots and under the trunk one hundred sixty seven Footnote one hundred sixty seven Buttress roots are not peculiar to any one species but common to most of the large trees in the crowded forest where the lateral growth of the roots is made difficult by the multitude of rivals The Paxiuba or big bellied palm is a fine example The mass of the forest on the banks of the great river is composed of palms about thirty species one hundred sixty eight leguminous or pod bearing trees colossal nut trees broad leaved Musaceae or bananas and giant grasses The most prominent palms are the architectural Pupunha or peach palm with spiny stems drooping deep green leaves and bunches of mealy nutritious fruit the slender Assai with a graceful head of delicate green plumes the Ubussu with mammoth undivided fronds the stiff serrated leaved Bussu and gigantic Miriti One of the noblest trees of the forest is the Massaranduba or cow tree Brosimum galactodendron often rising one hundred and fifty feet It is a hard fine grained durable timber and has a red bark and leathery fig like foliage The milk has the consistency of cream and may be used for tea coffee or custards It hardens by exposure so as to resemble gutta percha Another interesting tree and one which yields the chief article of export is the Caucho or India rubber tree one hundred sixty nine Siphonia Brasiliensis growing in the lowlands of the Amazon for eighteen hundred miles above Para It has an erect tall trunk from forty to eighty feet high a smooth gray bark and thick glossy leaves The milk resembles thick yellow cream and is colored by a dense smoke obtained by burning palm nuts It is gathered between August and December A man can collect six pounds a day though this is rarely done It is frequently adulterated with sand The tree belongs to the same apetalous family as our castor oil and the mandioca while the tree which furnishes the caoutchouc of the East Indies and Africa is a species of Ficus and yields an inferior article to the rubber of America Other characteristic trees are the Mongruba one of the few which shed their foliage before the new leaf buds expand the giant Samauema or silk cotton tree called huimba in Peru the Calabash or cuieira whose gourd like fruit furnishes the cups used throughout the Amazon the Itauba or stone wood furnishing ship timber as durable as teak the red and white Cedar used for canoes not coniferous like the northern evergreen but allied to the mahogany the Jacaranda or rose wood resembling our locust Palo de sangre one of the most valuable woods on the river Huacapu a very common timber Capirona used as fuel on the steamers and Tauari a heavy close grained wood the bark of which splits into thin leaves much used in making cigarettes The Piassaba a palm yielding a fibre extensively manufactured into cables and ropes and exported to foreign countries for brushes and brooms being singularly elastic strong and more durable than hemp and the Moira pinima or tortoise shell wood the most beautiful wood in all Amazonia if not in the world grow on the Upper Rio Negro A small willow represents the great catkin family Footnote one hundred sixty eight Von Martius in his great work on the Brazilian Palms enumerates in all five hundred eighty two species Footnote one hundred sixty nine The Portuguese and Brazilians call it seringa or syringe in which form it is still used extensively injections forming a great feature in the popular system of cures The tree mentioned above yields most of the rubber of commerce and is considered distinct from the species in Guiana S elastica while the rubber from the Upper Amazon and Rio Negro comes from the S lutea and S brevifolia Agassiz puts milk weed in the same family The valley is as remarkable for the abundance variety and value of its timber as for any thing else Within an area of half a mile square Agassiz counted one hundred and seventeen different kinds of woods many of them eminently fitted by their hardness tints and beautiful grain for the finest cabinet work Enough palo de sangre or moira pinima is doubtless wasted annually to veneer all the palaces of Europe While most of our fruits belong to the rose family those of the Amazon come from the myrtle tribe The delicious flavor for which our fruits are indebted to centuries of cultivation is wanting in many of the torrid productions We prefer the sweetness of Pomona in temperate climes to her savage beauty in the sunny south It is a curious fact noticed by Herndon that nearly all the valuable fruits of the valley are inclosed in hard shells or acid pulps They also reach a larger size in advancing westward The common Brazil nut is the product of one of the tallest trees in the forest Bertholletia excelsa The fruit is a hard round shell resembling a common ball which contains from twenty to twenty four nuts Eighteen months are required for the bud to reach maturity This tree says Humboldt offers the most remarkable example of high organic development Akin to it is the Sapucaya or chickens nuts Lecythis sapucaya whose capsule has a natural lid and is called monkey s drinking cup The nuts about a dozen in number are of irregular shape and much richer than the preceding But they do not find their way to market because they drop out of the capsule as soon as ripe and are devoured by peccaries and monkeys The most luscious fruit on the Amazon is the atta of Santarem It has the color taste and size of the chirimoya but the rind which incloses a rich custardly pulp frosted with sugar is scaled Next in rank are the melting pine apples of Para and the golden papayas fully equal to those on the western coast This is the original home of the cacao It grows abundantly in the forests of the upper river and particularly on the banks of the Madeira The wild nut is smaller but more oily than the cultivated The Amazon is destined to supply the world with the bulk of chocolate The aromatic tonka beans Cumaru used in flavoring snuff and the Brazilian nutmegs Puxiri inferior to the Ceylon grow on lofty trees on the Negro and Lower Amazon The Guarana beans are the seeds of a trailing plant from these the Mauhes prepare the great medicine on the Amazon for diarrhoea and intermittent fevers Its active principle caffeine is more abundant than in any other substance amounting to five point seven per cent while black tea contains only two point thirteen Coffee rice tobacco and sugar cane are grown to a limited extent Rio Negro coffee if put into the market would probably eclipse that of Ceara the best Brazilian Wild rice grows abundantly on the banks of the rivers and lakes The cultivated grain is said to yield forty fold Most of the tobacco comes down from the Maranon and Madeira It is put up in slender rolls from three to six feet long tapering at each end and wound with palm fibre The sugar cane is an exotic from Southeastern Asia but grows well The first sugar made in the New World was by the Dutch in the island of saint Thomas sixteen ten Farina is the principal farinaceous production of Brazil The mandioca or cassava Manihot utilissima from which it is made is supposed to be indigenous though it is not found wild It does not grow at a higher altitude than two thousand feet Life and death are blended in the plant yet every part is useful The cattle eat the leaves and stalks while the roots are ground into pulp which when pressed and baked forms farina the bread of all classes The juice is a deadly poison thirty five drops were sufficient to kill in six minutes a negro convicted of murder but it deposits a fine sediment of pure starch that is the well known tapioca and the juice when fermented and boiled forms a drink On the upper waters grow the celebrated coca a shrub with small light green leaves having a bitter aromatic taste The powdered leaves mixed with lime form ypadu This is to Peruvians what opium is to the Turk betel to the Malay and tobacco to the Yankee Thirty million pounds are annually consumed in South America It is not however an opiate but a powerful stimulant With it the Indian will perform prodigies of labor traveling days without fatigue or food Von Tschudi considers its moderate consumption wholesome and instances the fact that one coca chewer attained the good old age of one hundred and thirty years but when used to excess it leads to idiocy The signs of intemperance are an uncertain step sallow complexion black rimmed deeply sunken eyes trembling lips incoherent speech and stolid apathy Coca played an important part in the religious rights of the Incas and divine honors were paid to it Even to day the miners of Peru throw a quid of coca against the hard veins of ore affirming that it renders them more easily worked and the Indians sometimes put coca in the mouth of the dead to insure them a welcome in the other world The alkaloid cocaine was discovered by Woehler Flowers are nearly confined to the edges of the dense forest the banks of the rivers and lagunes There are a greater number of species under the equator but we have brighter colors in the temperate zone There is grandeur and sublimity in the tropical forest wrote Wallace after four years of observation but little of beauty or brilliancy of color Perhaps the finest example of inflorescence in the world is seen in the Victoria Regia the magnificent water lily discovered by Schoemberg in eighteen thirty seven It inhabits the tranquil waters of the shallow lakes which border the Amazon The leaves are from fifteen to eighteen feet in circumference and will bear up a child twelve years old the upper part is dark glossy green the under side violet or crimson The flowers are a foot in diameter at first pure white passing in twenty four hours through successive hues from rose to bright red This queen of water plants was dedicated to the Queen whose empire is never at once shrouded in night Illustration Coca plant CHAPTER XX Life within the Great River Fishes Alligators Turtles Porpoises and Manatis The Amazon is a crowded aquarium holding representatives of every zoological class infusoria hydras fresh water shells chiefly Ampullaria Melania and Unios aquatic beetles belonging mostly to new genera fishes reptiles water birds and cetaceans The abundance and variety of fishes are extraordinary so also are the species This great river is a peculiar ichthyic province and each part has its characteristics According to Agassiz the whole river as well as its tributaries is broken up into numerous distinct fauna one hundred seventy The pirarucu or redfish the Sudis gigas of science is at once the largest most common and most useful fish The Peruvian Indians call it payshi It is a powerful fish often measuring eight feet in length and five in girth clad in an ornamental coat of mail its large scales being margined with bright red It ranges from Peru to Para It is usually taken by the arrow or spear Salted and dried the meat will keep for a year and forms with farina the staple food on the Amazon The hard rough tongue is used as a grater Other fishes most frequently seen are the prettily spotted catfish Pescada Piranha Acara which carries its young in its mouth and a long slender needle fish There are ganoids in the river but no sturgeons proper Pickerel perch and trout are also wanting The sting ray represents the shark family As a whole the fishes of the Amazon have a marine character peculiarly their own Footnote one hundred seventy We await the Professor s examination of his more than eighty thousand specimens before we give the number of new species The reptilian inhabitants of this inland sea are introduced by numerous batrachians water snakes Heliops and anacondas But alligators bear the palm for ugliness size and strength In summer the main river swarms with them in the wet season they retreat to the interior lakes and flooded forests It was for this reason that we did not see an alligator on the Napo At low water they are found above the entrance of the Curaray About Obidos where many of the pools dry up in the fine months the alligator buries itself in the mud and sleeps till the rainy season returns It is scarcely exaggerating to say writes Bates that the waters of the Solimoens are as well stocked with large alligators in the dry season as a ditch in England is in summer with tadpoles There are three or four species in the Amazon The largest the Jacare uassu of the natives attains a length of twenty feet The Jacare tinga is a smaller kind only five feet long when full grown and has the long slender muzzle of the extinct teleosaurus The South American alligators are smaller than the crocodiles of the Nile or Ganges and they are also inferior in rank The head of the Jacare uassu the ordinary species is broad while the gavial of India has a long narrow muzzle and that of the Egyptian lizard is oblong The dentition differs while in the Old World saurian the teeth interlock so that the two jaws are brought close together the teeth in the upper jaw of the Amazonian cayman pass by the lower series outside of them The latter has therefore much less power It has a ventral cuirass as well as dorsal and it is web footed while the crocodile has the toes free another mark of inferiority Sluggish on land the alligator is very agile in its element It never attacks man when on his guard but it is cunning enough to know when it may do this with safety It lays its eggs about twenty some distance from the river bank covering them with leaves and sticks They are larger than those of Guayaquil or about four inches long of an elliptical shape with a rough calcareous shell Negro venders sell them cooked in the streets of Para Turtles are perhaps the most important product of the Amazon not excepting the pirarucu The largest and most abundant species is the Tortaruga grande It measures when full grown nearly three feet in length and two in breadth and has an oval smooth dark colored shell Every house has a little pond called currul in the back yard to hold a stock of turtles through the wet season It furnishes the best meat on the Upper Amazon We found it very tender palatable and wholesome but Bates who was obliged to live on it for years says it is very cloying Every part of the creature is turned to account The entrails are made into soup sausages are made of the stomach steaks are cut from the breast and the rest is roasted in the shell one hundred seventy one The turtle lays its eggs generally between midnight and dawn on the central and highest part of the plaias or about a hundred feet from the shore The Indians say it will lay only where itself was hatched out With its hind flippers it digs a hole two or three feet deep and deposits from eighty to one hundred and sixty eggs Gibbon says from one hundred and fifty to two hundred These are covered with sand and the next comer makes another deposit on the top and so on until the pit is full Egg laying comes earlier on the Amazon than on the Napo taking place in August and September The tracaja a smaller species lays in July and August its eggs are smaller and oval but richer than those of the great turtles Footnote one hundred seventy one The natives have this notion about the land tortoise that by throwing it three times over the head the liver the best part will be enlarged The mammoth tortoise of the Galapagos lays an egg very similar in size and shape to that of the Tortaruga but a month later or in October The hunting of turtle eggs is a great business on the Amazon They are used chiefly in manufacturing oil manteca for illumination Thrown into a canoe they are broken and beaten up by human feet water is then poured in and the floating oil is skimmed off purified over the fire in copper kettles and finally put up in three gallon earthen jars for the market The turtles are caught for the table as they return to the river after laying their eggs To secure them it suffices to turn them over on their backs The turtles certainly have a hard time of it The alligators and large fishes swallow the young ones by hundreds jaguars pounce upon the full grown specimens as they crawl over the plaias and vultures and ibises attend the feast But man is their most formidable foe The destruction of turtle life is incredible It is calculated that fifty millions of eggs are annually destroyed Thousands of those that escape capture in the egg period are collected as soon as hatched and devoured the remains of yolk in their entrails being considered a great delicacy An unknown number of full grown turtles are eaten by the natives on the banks of the Maranon and Solimoens and their tributaries while every steamer schooner and little craft that descends the Amazon is laden with turtles for the tables of Manaos Santarem and Para When we consider also that all the mature turtles taken are females we wonder that the race is not well nigh extinct They are in fact rapidly decreasing in numbers A large turtle which twenty years ago could be bought for fifty cents now commands three dollars One would suppose that the males being unmolested would far outnumber the other sex but Bates says they are immensely less numerous than the females The male turtles or Capitaris are distinguishable by their much smaller size more circular shape and the greater length and thickness of their tails Near the Tapajos we met a third species called Mata mata It has a deeply keeled carapax beautifully bossed and a hideous triangular head having curious lobed fleshy appendages and nostrils prolonged into a tube It is supposed to have great virtues as a remedy for rheumatism But the most noticeable feature of the Amazonian fauna as Agassiz has remarked is the abundance of cetaceans through its whole extent From the brackish estuary of Para to the clear cool waters at the base of the Andes these clumsy refugees from the ocean may be seen gamboling and blowing as in their native element Four different kinds of porpoises have been seen A black species lives in the Bay of Marajo In the Middle Amazon are two distinct porpoises one flesh colored one hundred seventy two and in the upper tributaries is the Inia Boliviensis resembling but specifically different from the sea dolphin and the soosoo of the Ganges It was several years says the Naturalist on the Amazon before I could induce a fisherman to harpoon dolphins Boutos for me as specimens for no one ever kills these animals voluntarily the superstitious people believe that blindness would result from the use of the oil in lamps The herbivorous manati already mentioned Chap XV is found throughout the great river It differs slightly from the Atlantic species It rarely measures over twelve feet in length It is taken by the harpoon or nets of chambiri twine Both Herndon and Gibbon mention seals as occurring in the Peruvian tributaries but we saw none neither did Bates Agassiz or Edwards They probably meant the manati Footnote one hundred seventy two Dephinus pallidus Bates observed this species at Villa Nova we saw it at Coary five hundred miles west and Herndon found it in the Huallaga CHAPTER XXI Life around the Great River Insects Reptiles Birds Mammals The forest of the Amazon is less full of life than the river Beasts birds and reptiles are exceedingly scarce still there is in fact a great variety but they are widely scattered and very shy In the animal as in the vegetable kingdom diversity is the law there is a great paucity of individuals compared with the species one hundred seventy three Insects are rare in the dense forest they are almost confined to the more open country along the banks of the rivers Ants are perhaps the most numerous There is one species over an inch long But the most prominent by their immense numbers are the dreaded sauebas Well beaten paths branch off in every direction through the forest on which broad columns may be seen marching to and fro each bearing vertically a circular piece of leaf Unfortunately they prefer cultivated trees especially the coffee and orange They are also given to plundering provisions in a single night they will carry off bushels of farina They are of a light red color with powerful jaws In every formicarium or ant colony there are three sets of individuals males females and workers but the sauebas have the singularity of possessing three classes of workers The light colored mounds often met in the forest sometimes measuring forty feet in diameter by two feet in height are the domes which overlie the entrances to the vast subterranean galleries of the saueba ants These ants are eaten by the Rio Negro Indians and esteemed a luxury while the Tapajos tribes use them to season their mandioca sauce Akin to the vegetable feeding sauebas are the carnivorous ecitons or foraging ants of which Bates found ten distinct species They hunt for prey in large organized armies almost every species having its own special manner of marching and hunting Fortunately the ecitons choose the thickest part of the forest The fire ant is the great plague on the Tapajos It is small and of a shiny reddish color but its sting is very painful and it disputes every fragment of food with the inhabitants All eatables and hammocks have to be hung by cords smeared with copaiba balsam Footnote one hundred seventy three Amazonia is divided into four distinct zoological districts those of Ecuador Peru Guiana and Brazil the limits being the Amazon Madeira and Negro The species found on one side of these rivers are seldom found on the other The traveler on the Amazon frequently meets with conical hillocks of compact earth from three to five feet high from which radiate narrow covered galleries or arcades The architects of these wonderful structures are the termites or white ants so called though they belong to a higher order of insects widely differing from the true ants The only thing in common is the principle of division of labor The termite neuters are subdivided into two classes soldiers and workers both wingless and blind Their great enemy is the ant eater but it is a singular fact noticed by Bates that the soldiers only attach themselves to the long worm like tongue of this animal so that the workers on whom the prosperity of the termitarum depends are saved by the self sacrifice of the fighting caste The office of the termites in the tropics seems to be to hasten the decomposition of decaying vegetation But they also work their way into houses trunks wardrobes and libraries It is principally owing to their destructiveness wrote Humboldt that it is so rare to find papers in tropical America older than fifty or sixty years Dragon flies are conspicuous specimens of insect life on the Amazon The largest and most brilliant kinds are found by the shady brooks and creeks in the recesses of the forest some of them with green or crimson bodies seven inches long and their elegant lace like wings tipped with white or yellow Still more noticeable are the butterflies There is a vast number of genera and species and great beauty of dress unequaled in the temperate zone Some idea of the diversity is conveyed by the fact mentioned by mister Bates that about seven hundred species are found within an hour s walk of Para and five hundred fifty at Ega while the total number found in the British Islands does not exceed sixty six and the whole of Europe supports only three hundred After a shower in the dry season the butterflies appear in fluttering clouds for they live in societies white yellow red green purple black and blue many of them bordered with metallic lines and spots of a silvery or golden lustre The sulphur yellow and orange colored kinds predominate A colossal morpho seven and a half inches in expanse and visible a quarter of a mile off frequents the shady glades splendid swallow tailed papilios green rose or velvety black are seen only in the thickets while the Hetaira esmeralda with transparent wings having one spot of a violet hue as it flies over the dead leaves in the dense forest looks like a wandering petal of a flower Very abundant is the Heliconius which plays such an important figure by its variations in Wallace s theory of the origin of species On the Maranon we found Callidryas eubule a yellow butterfly common in Florida The most brilliant butterflies are found on the Middle Amazon out of reach of the strong trade winds The males far outnumber the other sex are more richly colored and generally lead a sunshiny life The females are of dull hues and spend their lives in the gloomy shadows of the forest Caterpillars and nocturnal moths are rare There are no true hive bees Apides in South America one hundred seventy four but instead there are about one hundred and fifty species of bees mostly social Moliponas smaller than the European stingless and constructing oblong cells Their colonies are much larger than those of the honey bee The Trigona occurs on the Napo Unlike the Melipona it is not confined to the New World A large sooty black Bombus represents our humble bee Shrill cicadas blood thirsty mantucas piums punkies and musquitoes are always associated in the traveler s memory with the glorious river Of the last there are several kinds The forest musquito belongs to a different species from that of the town being much larger and having transparent wings It is a little cloud that one carries about his person every step on a woodland ramble and their hum is so loud that it prevents one hearing well the notes of birds The town musquito has opaque speckled wings a less severe sting and a silent way of going to work The inhabitants ought to be thankful the big noisy fellows never come out of the forest Bates ii three hundred eighty six There are few musquitoes below Ega above that point a musquito net is indispensable Beetles abound particularly in shady places and are of all sizes from that of a pin s head to several inches in length The most noticeable are the gigantic Megalosoma and Enema armed with horns Very few are carnivorous This is the more remarkable observes Darwin when compared to the case of carnivorous quadrupeds which are so abundant in hot countries Very few are terrestrial even the carnivorous species being found clinging to branches and leaves In going from the pole to the equator we find that insect life increases in the same proportion as vegetable life There is not a single beetle on Melville Island eleven species are found in Greenland in England twenty five hundred in Brazil eight thousand Here lives the king of spiders the Mygale Blondii a monstrous hairy fellow five inches long of a brown color with yellowish lines along its stout legs Its abode is a slanting subterranean gallery about two feet in length the sides of which are beautifully lined with silk Other spiders barricade the walks in the forest with invisible threads some build nests in the trees and attack birds others again spin a closely woven web resembling fine muslin under the thatched roofs of the houses Footnote one hundred seventy four The honey bee of Europe was introduced into South America in eighteen forty five Of land vertebrates lizards are the first to attract the attention of the traveler on the equator Great in number and variety they are met every where crawling up the walls of buildings scampering over the hot dusty roads gliding through the forest They stand up on their legs carry their tails cocked up in the air and run with the activity of a warm blooded animal It is almost impossible to catch them Some of them are far from being the unpleasant looking animals many people imagine but in their coats of many colors green gray brown and yellow they may be pronounced beautiful Others however have a repulsive aspect and are a yard in length The iguana peculiar to the New World tropics is covered with minute green scales handed with brown though it changes its color like the chameleon and has a serrated back and gular pouch It grows to the length of five feet and is arboreal Its white flesh and its oblong oily eggs arc considered great delicacies We heard of a lady who kept one as a pet Frogs and toads the chief musicians in the Amazonian forest are of all sizes from an inch to a foot in diameter The Bufo gigas is of a dull gray color and is covered with warts Tree frogs Hyla are very abundant they do not occur on the Andes or on the Pacific coast Their quack quack drum drum hoo hoo is one of our pleasant memories of South America Of snakes there is no lack and yet they are not so numerous as imagination would make them There are one hundred and fifty species in South America or one half as many on the same area as in the East Indies The diabolical family is led by the boa while the rear is brought up by the Amphisbaenas or double headed snakes which progress equally well with either end forward so that it is difficult to make head or tail of them The majority are harmless The deadly coral is found on both sides of the Andes and wherever there is a cacao plantation One of the most beautiful specimens of the venomous kind is a new species Elaps imperator Cope which we discovered on the Maranon It has a slender body more than two feet in length with black and red bands margined with yellow and a black and yellow head with permanently erect fangs Illustration Iguana We have already mentioned the most common birds Probably says Wallace no country in the world contains a greater variety of birds than the Amazonian Valley But the number does not equal the expectations of the traveler he may ramble a whole day without meeting one The rarity however is more apparent than real we forget for the moment the vastness of their dwelling place The birds of the country moreover are gregarious so that a locality may be deserted and silent at one time and swarming with them at another Parrots and toucans are the most characteristic groups To the former belong true parrots parroquets and macaws The first are rarely seen walking but are rapid flyers and expert climbers On the trees they are social as monkeys but in flight they always go in pairs The parroquets go in flocks The Hyacinthine macaw the Araruna of the natives is one of the finest and rarest species of the parrot family It is found only on the south side of the Amazon The macaw was considered sacred by the Maya Indians of Yucatan and dedicated to the sun The Quichuans call it guacamayo guaca meaning sacred Of toucans there are many species the largest is the toco with a beak shaped like a banana the most beautiful are the curb crested or Beauharnais toucans and the P flavirostris whose breast is adorned with broad belts of red crimson and black Wherefore such a beak every naturalist has asked but the toucan still wags his head as much as to say you can not tell There must be some other reason than adaptation Birds of the same habits are found beside it the ibis pigeon spoonbill and toucan are seen feeding together How astonishing are the freaks and fancies of Nature wrote the funny Sidney Smith To what purpose we say is a bird placed in the woods of Cayenne with a bill a yard long making a noise like a puppy dog and laying eggs in hollow trees The toucan to be sure might retort to what purpose are certain foolish prating members of Parliament created pestering the House of Commons with their ignorance and folly and impeding the business of the country There is no end to such questions so we will not enter into the metaphysics of the toucan Illustration Toucans On the flooded islands of the Negro and Upper Amazon is found the rare and curious umbrella bird black as a crow and decorated with a crest of hairy plumes and a long lobe suspended from the neck covered with glossy blue feathers This latter appendage is connected with the vocal organs and assists the bird in producing its deep loud and lengthy fluty note There are three species Another rare bird is the Uruponga or Campanero in English the tolling bell bird found only on the borders of Guiana It is of the size of our jay of a pure white color with a black tubercle on the upper side of the bill Orpheus himself says Waterton would drop his lute to listen to him so sweet so novel and romantic is the toll of the pretty snow white Campanero The Campanero may be heard three miles echoes Sidney Smith This single little bird being more powerful than the belfry of a cathedral ringing for a new dean It is impossible to contradict a gentleman who has been in the forests of Cayenne but we are determined as soon as a Campanero is brought to England to make him toll in a public place and have the distance measured one hundred seventy five But the most remarkable songster of the Amazonian forest is the Realejo or organ bird Its notes are as musical as the flageolet It is the only songster says Bates which makes any impression on the natives Besides those are the Jacamars peculiar to equatorial America stupid but of the most beautiful golden bronze and steel colors sulky Trogons with glossy green backs and rose colored breasts long toed Jacanas half wader half fowl the rich velvety purple and black Rhamphocoelus Jacapa having an immense range from Archidona to Para the gallinaceous yet arboreal Ciganas scarlet ibises smaller but more beautiful than their sacred cousins of the Nile stilted flamingoes whose awkwardness is atoned for by their brilliant red plumage glossy black Mutums or curassow turkeys ghostly storks white egrets ash colored herons black ducks barbets kingfishers sandpipers gulls plovers woodpeckers oreoles tanagers essentially a South American family and excepting three or four species found only east of the Andes wagtails finches thrushes doves and hummers The last by western Indians living sunbeams named are few and not to be compared with the swarms in the Andean valleys The birds of the Amazon have no uniform time for breeding The majority however build their nests between September and New Year s and rarely lay more than two eggs Footnote one hundred seventy five Review of Waterton s Wanderings in South America Illustration Brazilian Hummers Illustration Capybara Amazonia like Australia is poor in terrestrial mammals and the species are of small size Nearly the only game a hunter can depend upon for food besides toucans and macaws is peccari One species of tapir to represent the elephants and rhinoceroses of the Old World three small species of deer taking the places of deer antelopes buffaloes sheep and goats of the other continent three species of large Felidae one peccari and a wild dog with opossums ant eaters armadilloes sloths squirrels the only rodents which approach ours one hundred seventy six capybaras pacas agoutis and monkeys comprise all the quadrupeds of equatorial America The last two are the most numerous Marsupial rats take the place of the insectivorous mammals Of ant eaters there are at least four distinct species but they are scattered sparingly and are seldom found on the low flooded lands Four or five species of armadillo inhabit the valley These little nocturnal burrowing edentates are the puny representatives of the gigantic Glyptodon of Pleistocene times and the sloths are the dwindling shadows of the lordly Megatherium There are two species of three toed sloths one inhabiting the swampy lowlands the other confined to the terra firma land They lead a lonely life never in groups harmless and frugal as a hermit They have four stomachs but not the long intestines of ruminating animals They feed chiefly on the leaves of the trumpet tree Cecropia resembling our horse chestnut The natives both Indian and Brazilian hold the common opinion that the sloth is the type of laziness The capybara or ronsoco the largest of living rodents is quite common on the river side It is gregarious and amphibious and resembles a mammoth guinea pig Pacas and agoutis are most abundant in the lowlands and are nocturnal These semi hoofed rodents like the Toxodon of old approach the Pachyderms The tapir or gran bestia as it is called is a characteristic quadruped of South America It is a clumsy looking animal with a tough hide of an iron gray color covered with a coat of short coarse hair Its flesh is dry but very palatable It has a less powerful proboscis than the Malay species M Roulin distinguishes another species from the mountains which more nearly resembles the Asiatic The tapir like the condor for an unknown reason is not found north of eight deg N though it wanders as far south as forty deg We met but one species of peccari the white lipped D labiatus It is much larger than the Mexican hog and too thick headed to understand danger is a formidable antagonist The raposa is seen only on the Middle Amazon and very rarely there It has a long tapering muzzle small ears bushy tail and grayish hair It takes to the water for the one we saw at Tabatinga was caught while crossing the Amazon Fawn colored pumas spotted jaguars black tigers tiger cats all members of the graceful feline family inhabit all parts of the valley but are seldom seen The puma or panther is more common on the Pacific side of the Andes The jaguar one hundred seventy seven is the fiercest and most powerful animal in South America It is marked like the leopard roses of black spots on a yellowish ground but they are angular instead of rounded and have a central dot There are also several black streaks across the breast which easily distinguish it from its transatlantic representative It is also longer than the leopard indeed Humboldt says he saw a jaguar whose length surpassed that of any of the tigers of India which he had seen in the collections of Europe The jaguar frequents the borders of the rivers and lagunes and its common prey is the capybara It fears the peccari The night air is alive with bats of many species the most prominent one being the Dysopes perotis which measures two feet from tip to tip of the wings If these Cheiropters are as impish as they look and as blood thirsty as some travelers report it is singular that Bates and Waterton though residing for years in the country and ourselves though sleeping for months unprotected were unmolested Footnote one hundred seventy six Large rats abound on the Marnanon but they are not American Footnote one hundred seventy seven The Tupi word for dog is yaguara and for wolf yagua men or old dog Illustration Jaguar About forty species of monkeys or one half of the New World forms inhabit the Valley of the Amazon Wallace in a residence of four years saw twenty one species seven with prehensile and fourteen with non prehensile tails They all differ from the apes of the other hemisphere While those of Africa and Asia Europe has only one have opposable thumbs on the fore feet as well as hind uniformly ten molar teeth in each jaw as in man and generally cheek pouches and naked collosities the American monkeys arc destitute of the two latter characteristics None of them are terrestrial like the baboon all save the marmosets have twenty four molars the thumbs of the fore hands are not habitually opposed to the fingers one genus Ateles the imperfect is thumbless altogether the nostrils open on the sides of the nose instead of beneath it as in the gorilla and the majority have long prehensile tails They are inferior in rank to the anthropoids of the Old World though superior to the lemurs of Madagascar They are usually grouped in two families Marmosets and Cebidre The former are restless timid squirrel like lilliputs one species is only seven inches long with tails not prehensile in the case of the scarlet faced nearly wanting The Barigudos or gluttons Lagothrix are the largest of American monkeys but are not so tall as the Coaitas They are found west of Manaos They have more human features than the other monkeys and with their woolly gray fur resemble an old negro There are three kinds of howlers Mycetes the red or mono colorado of Humboldt the black and the M beelzebub found only near Para The forest is full of these surly untamable guaribas as the natives call them They are gifted with a voice of tremendous power and volume with which they make night and day hideous They represent the baboons of the Old World in disposition and facial angle thirty deg and the gibbons in their yells and gregarious habits one hundred seventy eight The Sapajous Cebus are distributed throughout Brazil and have the reputation of being the most mischievous monkeys in the country On the west coast of South America there are at least three or four species of monkeys among them a black howler and a Cebus capucinus The Coitas or spider monkeys are the highest of American quadrumana They are slender legged sluggish and thumbless with a most perfectly prehensile tail terminating in a naked palm which answers for a fifth hand The Indians say they walk under the limbs like the sloth They are the most common pets in Brazil but they refuse to breed in captivity Both Coitas and Barigudos are much persecuted for their flesh which is highly esteemed by the Indians Footnote one hundred seventy eight Ruetimeyer has found a fossil howler in the Swiss Jura middle cocene mister Bates has called our attention to the arboreal character of a large share of the animals in the Amazonian forest All the monkeys and bats are climbers and live in the trees Nearly all the carnivores are feline and are therefore tree mounters though they lead a terrestrial life The plantigrade Cercoleptes has a long tail and is entirely arboreal Of the edentates the sloth can do nothing on the ground The gallinaceous birds as the cigana and curassow the pheasant and turkey of the Amazon perch on the trees while the great number of arboreal frogs and beetles is an additional proof of the adaptation of the fauna to a forest region Even the epiphytous plants sitting on the branches suggest this arboreal feature in animal life CHAPTER XXII Life around the Great River Origin of the Red Man General Characteristics of the Amazonian Indians Their Languages Costumes and Habitations Principal Tribes Mixed Breeds Brazilians and Brazil We come now to the genus Homo Man makes a very insignificant figure in the vast solitudes of the Amazon Between Manaos and Para the most densely peopled part of the valley there is only one man to every four square miles and the native race takes a low place in the scale of humanity As the western continent is geologically more primitive than the eastern and as the brute creation is also inferior in rank so the American man in point of progress seems to stand in the rear of the Old World races Both the geology and zoology of the continent were arrested in their development Vegetable life alone has been favored The aboriginal American wrote Von Martius is at once in the incapacity of infancy and unpliancy of old age he unites the opposite poles of intellectual life one hundred seventy nine Footnote one hundred seventy nine I think I discover in the Americans said Humboldt the descendants of a rare which early separated from the rest of mankind has followed up for a series of years a peculiar road in the unfolding of its intellectual faculties and its tendency toward civilization The South American Indian seems to have a natural aptitude for the arts of civilized life not found in the red men of our continent We will not touch the debatable ground of the red man s origin nor inquire whether he is the last remains of a people once high in civilization But we are tempted to express the full belief that tropical America is not his centre of creation He is not the true child of the tropics and he lives as a stranger far less fitted for its climate than the Negro or Caucasian Yet a little while and the race will be as extinct as the Dodo He has not the supple organization of the European enabling him to accommodate himself to diverse conditions Among the Andean tribes there are seldom over five children generally but one in a family and Bates speaking of Brazilian Indians says their fecundity is of a low degree and it is very rare to find a family having so many as four children one hundred eighty Footnote one hundred eighty We do not infer however from this fact alone that the race is exotic for the Negroes of Central Africa multiply very slowly While it is probable that Mexico was peopled from the north it is very certain that the Tupi and Guarani the long headed hordes that occupied eastern South America came up from the south moving from the Paraguay to the banks of the Orinoco From the Tupi nation perhaps a branch of the Guarani sprung the multitudinous tribes now dwelling in the vast valley of the Amazon In such a country unbroken by a mountain uniform in climate we need not look for great diversity The general characters are these skin of a brown color with yellowish tinge often nearly the tint of mahogany thick straight black hair black horizontal eyes low forehead somewhat compensated by its breadth beardless of the middle height but thick set broad muscular chest small hands and feet incurious unambitious impassive undemonstrative with a dull imagination and little superstition with no definite idea of a Supreme Being few tribes having a name for God though one for the Demon with no belief in a future state and excepting civility with virtues all negative The semi civilized along the Lower Amazon called Tupuyos seem to have lost in the language of Wallace the good qualities of savage life and gained only the vices of civilization There are several hundred different tribes in Amazonia each having a different language even the scattered members of the same tribe can not understand each other one hundred eighty one This segregation of dialects is due in great part to the inflexibility of Indian character and his isolated and narrow round of thought and life When and where the Babel existed whence the many branches of the great Tupi family separated we know not We only know that though different in words these languages have the same grammatical construction In more than one respect the polyglot American is antipodal to the Chinese The language of the former is richest in words that of the latter the poorest The preposition follows the noun and the verb ends the sentence Ancient Tupi is the basis of the Lingoa Geral the inter tribal tongue on the Middle Amazon The semi civilized Ticunas Mundurucus et cetera have one costume the men in trowsers and white cotton shirts the women in calico petticoats with short loose chemises and their hair held in a knot on the top of the head by a comb usually of foreign make but sometimes made of bamboo splinters The wild tribes north and south go nearly or quite nude while those on the western tributaries wear cotton or bark togas or ponchos The habitations are generally a frame work of poles thatched with palm leaves the walls sometimes latticed and plastered with mud and the furniture chiefly hammocks and earthen vessels Illustration Native Comb Footnote one hundred eighty one Authors compute in South America from two hundred eighty to seven hundred languages Abbe Royo said two thousand of which four fifths are composed of idioms radically distinct The Mundurucus are the most numerous and warlike tribe in Amazonia They inhabit both banks of the Tapajos and can muster it is said two thousand fighting men They are friendly to the whites and industrious selling to traders large quantities of farina sarsaparilla rubber and tonka beans Their houses are conical or quadrangular huts sometimes open sheds and generally contain many families According to Wallace the Mundurucus are the only perfectly tattooed nation in South America It takes at least ten years to complete the tattooing of the whole person The skin is pricked with spines and then the soot from burning pitch rubbed in Their neighbors the Pararauates are intractable wandering savages roaming through the forest and sleeping in hammocks slung to the trees They have delicately formed hands and feet an oval face and glistening black eyes On the west side of the Tapajos near Villa Nova are the Mauhes an agricultural tribe well formed and of a mild disposition On the Lower Madeira are the houseless formidable Araras who paint their chins red with achote anatto and usually have a black tattooed streak on each side of the face They have long made the navigation of the great tributary hazardous Above them dwell the Parentintins light colored and finely featured but nude and savage In the labyrinth of lakes and channels at the mouth of the Madeira live the lazy brutal Muras the most degraded tribe on the Amazon They have a darker skin than their neighbors an extraordinary breadth of chest muscular arms short legs protuberant abdomens a thin beard and a bold restless expression They pierce the lips and wear peccari tusks in them in time of war The Indians on the Purus live generally on the communal principle and are unwarlike and indolent The Puru purus bury in sandy beaches go naked and have one wife On the great northwest tributary of the Rio Negro the Uacaiari there are numerous tribes collectively known as the Uaupes They have permanent abodes in shape a parallelogram with a semicircle at one end and of a size to contain several families sometimes a whole tribe One of them Wallace informs us was one hundred fifteen feet long by seventy five broad and about thirty high The walls are bullet proof Partitions of palm leaves divide it into apartments for families the chief occupying the semicircular end The men alone wear clothes and ornaments but both sexes paint their bodies with red black and yellow colors in regular patterns The men have a little beard which they pull out as also the eyebrows and allow the hair to grow unshorn tying it behind with a cord and wearing a comb while the women cut theirs and wear no comb They are an agricultural people peaceable ingenious apathetic diffident and bashful The Catauishes inhabit the banks of the Teffe They perforate the lips and wear rows of sticks in the holes At the mouth of the Jurua are the uncivilized but tall noble looking Marauas They pierce the ears and lips and insert sticks They live in separate families and have no common chief Above them live the treacherous Arauas one hundred eighty two On the opposite side of the Amazon are the nearly extinct Passes and Juris the finest tribes in central South America They are peaceable and industrious and have always been friendly to the whites The Passes are a slenderly built light colored dignified superior race distinguished by a large square tattooed patch in the middle of the face The Juris tattoo in a circle round the mouth Near by are the Uaenambeus or Humming birds distinguished by a small blue mark on the upper lip Higher up the Japura is the large cannibal tribe of Miranhas living in isolated families and on the Tocantins dwell the low Caishanas who kill their first born children Along the left bank of the Amazon from Loreto to Japura are the scattered houses and villages of the Tucunas This is an extensive tribe leading a settled agricultural life each horde having a chief and a medicine man or priest of their superstitions They are good natured and ingenious excelling most of the other tribes in the manufacture of pottery but they are idle and debauched naked except in the villages and tattooed in numbers of short straight lines on the face The Marubos on the Javari have a dark complexion and a slight beard and on the west side of the same river roam the Majeronas fierce hostile light colored bearded cannibals In the vicinity of Pebas dwell the inoffensive Yaguas The shape of the head but not their vacant expression is well represented by Catlin s portrait of Black Hawk a Sauk chief They are quite free from the encumbrance of dress the men wearing a girdle of fibrous bark around the loins with bunches looking like a mop hanging down in front and rear and similar bunches hung around the neck and arms The women tie a strip of brown cotton cloth about the hips They paint the whole body with achote one hundred eighty three They sometimes live in communities One large structure with Gothic roof is used in common on the inside of which around the walls are built family sleeping rooms The Yaguas are given to drinking and dancing They are said to bury their dead inside the house of the deceased and then set fire to it but this conflicts with their communal life Perhaps with the other tribes on the Japura Ica and Napo they are fragments of the great Omagua nation but the languages have no resemblance Of the Oriente Indians we have already spoken The tall finely built Cucamas near Nauta are shrewd hard working canoe men notorious for the singular desire of acquiring property and the Yameos a white tribe wander across the Maranon as far as Sarayacu On the Ucayali are numerous vagabond tribes living for the most part in their canoes and temporary huts They are all lazy and faithless using their wives polygamy is common as slaves Infanticide is practiced i e deformed children they put out of the way saying they belong to the devil They worship nothing They bury their dead in a canoe or earthen jar under the house which is vacated forever and throw away his property one hundred eighty four The common costume is a long gown called cushma of closely twilled cotton woven by the women Their weapons are two edged battle axes of hard wood as palo de sangre and bows and arrows The arrows five or six feet long are made from the flower stalk of the arrow grass Gynerium the head pointed with the flinty chonta and tipped with bone often anointed with poison At the base two rows of feathers are spirally arranged showing the Indian s knowledge of the rifle principle When they have fixed abodes several families live together under one roof with no division separating the women as among the Red Indians on the Pastassa The roof is not over ten feet from the ground The Piros are the highest tribe they have but one wife The Conibos are an agricultural people yet cannibals stretching from the Upper Ucayali to the sources of the Purus They are a fair looking athletic people and like the Shipibos of ten wear a piece of money under the lip The Campas are the most numerous and warlike one hundred eighty five They are little known as travelers give them a wide berth Herndon fancied they were the descendants of the Inca race They are said to be cannibals and from the specimen we saw we should judge them uncommonly sharp He was averse to telling us any thing about his tribe but turned our questions with an equivocal repartee and a laugh The Cashibos on the Pachitea is another cannibal tribe They are light colored and bearded The dwarfish filthy Rimos alone of the Ucayali Indians tattoo though not so perfectly as the Mundurucus using black and blue colors The other tribes simply paint It was among these wild Indians on the Ucayali that the Franciscan friars labored so long and zealously and with a success far greater and more lasting than that which attended any other missionary enterprise in the valley Footnote one hundred eighty two Near the sources of this river Castlenau locates the Canamas and Uginas the former dwarfs the latter having tails a palm and a half long a hybrid from an Indian and Barigudo monkey Footnote one hundred eighty three Query Is the name Yagua blood derived from the practice of coloring the body red Footnote one hundred eighty four Compare the ancient burial custom on the Andes On the decease of the Inca his palaces are abandoned all his treasures except those that were employed in his obsequies his furniture and apparel were suffered to remain as he left them and his mansions save one were closed up forever Prescott Footnote one hundred eighty five The women circumcise themselves and a man will not marry a woman who is not circumcised They perform the singular rite upon arriving at the age of puberty and have a great feast at the time Other tribes flog and imprison their daughters when they reach womanhood The remaining inhabitants of the Amazon are mixed breeds Negroes and whites The amalgamations form the greater part of the population of the large towns Von Tschudi gives a catalogue of twenty three hybrids in Peru and there are undoubtedly as many or more in Brazil The most common are Mamelucos offspring of white with Indian Mulattoes from white and Negro Cafuzos or Zambos from Indian and Negro Curibocos from Cafuzo and Indian and Xibaros from Cafuzo and Negro To define their characteristics correctly says Von Tschudi would be impossible for their minds partake of the mixture of their blood As a general rule it may be said that they unite in themselves all the faults without any of the virtues of their progenitors As men they are generally inferior to the pure races and as members of society they are the worst class of citizens Yet they display considerable talent and enterprise as in Quito a proof that mental degeneracy does not necessarily result from the mixture of white with Indian blood There is however confesses Bates after ten years experience a considerable number of superlatively lazy tricky and sensual characters among the half castes both in rural places and in the towns Our observations do not support the opinion that the result of amalgamation is a vague compound lacking character and expression The moral part is perhaps deteriorated but in tact and enterprise they often excel their progenitors Negroes are to be seen only on the Lower Amazon By the new act of emancipation such as are slaves continue so but their children are free Negroes born in the country are called creoles Of the white population save a handful of English French and German the Portuguese immigrants are the most enterprising men on the river They are willing to work trade or do any thing to turn a penny Those who acquire a fortune generally retire to Lisbon The Brazilians proper are the descendants of the men who declared themselves free and independent of the mother country Few of them are of pure Caucasian descent for the immigration from Portugal for many years has been almost exclusively of the male sex It is generally considered bad taste in Brazil to boast purity of descent Bates i two hundred forty one Brazilians are stiff and formal yet courteous and lively communicative and hospitable well bred and intelligent They are not ambitious but content to live and enjoy what nature spontaneously offers The most a Brazilian wants is farina and coffee a hammock and cigar Brazilian ladies have led a dreary life of constraint and silence without education or society the husband making a nun of his wife after the old bigoted Portuguese notion but during the last twenty years the doors have been opened Brazil attained her independence in eighteen twenty three Brazilian women in eighteen forty eight Here in this virgin valley where every plant is an evergreen possessing the most agreeable and enjoyable climate in the world with a brilliant atmosphere rivaled only by that of Quito and with no changes of seasons here we may locate the paradise of the lazy Life may be maintained with as little labor as in the Garden of Eden Perhaps no country in the world is capable of yielding so large a return for agriculture Nature evidently designing this land as the home of a great nation has heaped up her bounties of every description fruits of richest flavors woods of finest grain dyes of gayest colors and drugs of rarest virtues and left no sirocco or earthquake to disturb its people Providence moreover has given the present emperor a wise and understanding heart and the government is a happy blending of imperial dignity and republican freedom White Negro half caste and Indian may be seen sitting side by side on the jury bench Certainly the nation can not be a despicable one whose best men are able to work themselves up to positions of trust and influence God bless the Empire of the South CHAPTER XXIII How to Travel in South America Routes Expenses Outfit Precautions Dangers The most vague and incorrect notions prevail in respect to traveling in South America The sources of trustworthy and desirable information are very meagre Murray has not yet published a Hand book for the Andes routes methods and expenses of travel are almost unknown and the imagination depicts vampires and scorpions tigers and anacondas wild Indians and fevers without end impassable rivers and inaccessible mountains as the portion of the tourist The following statements which can be depended upon may therefore be acceptable to those who contemplate a trip on the Andes and the Amazon The shortest cheapest most feasible and least interesting route across the continent is from Valparaiso to Buenos Ayres The breadth of South America is here only eight hundred miles By railroad from Valparaiso to the foot of the Andes thence a short mule ride by the Uspallata Pass altitude twelve thousand feet under the shadow of Aconcagua to Mendoza thence by coach across the pampas to the Rio Plata The Portillo Pass traversed by Darwin is nearer but more lofty and dangerous Bolivia offers the difficult path of Gibbon From the coast to Cochabamba thence down the Marmore and Madeira There are three routes through Peru First from Lima to Mayro by way of Cerro Pasco and Huanaco by mule ten days thence down the Pachitea by canoe six days thence down the Ucayali to Iquitos by steamer six days forty five hours running time When the road from Lima to Mayro is finished the passage will be shortened four days No snow is met in crossing the Andes in summer but in winter it is very deep Second Herndon s route from Lima to Tinga Maria by way of Huanaco by mule fifteen days distance three hundred miles the passage is difficult in the rainy season thence by canoe fifteen days down the Huallaga to Yurimaguas Third and best by mule from Truxillo to Caximarca five days note the magnificent ruins thence to Chachapoyas seven days here are pre Incarial relics thence to Moyabamba eight days thence on foot to Balsa Puerto four days thence by canoe to Yurimaguas two days Price of a mule from Truxillo to Moyabamba is thirty dollars canoe hire ten dollars The Peruvian steamers arrive at Yurimaguas the fifth of every month and leave the seventh reach Nauta the ninth and Iquitos the tenth leave Iquitos the sixteenth and arrive at Tabatinga the nineteenth to connect with the Brazilian line Going up they leave Tabatinga the twenty first and arrive at Iquitos the twenty fourth stopping six days Running time from Yurimaguas to Tabatinga forty eight hours fare seventy dollars gold third class seventeen dollars La Condamine s route via Loxa and the Maranon is difficult and Md Godin s via the Pastassa is perilous on account of rapids and savages The transit by the Napo we will now give in detail Six hundred dollars in gold will be amply sufficient for a first class passage from New York to New York across the continent of South America making no allowance for stoppages For necessary expenses in Ecuador take a draft on London which will sell to advantage in Guayaquil so will Mexican dollars American gold should be taken for expenses on the Amazon in Brazil at Para it commands a premium On the Maranon it is below par Peruvian gold should therefore be bought at Guayaquil for that part of the route Also French medios or quarter francs they will be very useful every where on the route especially on the Upper Amazon where change is scarce Fifty dollars worth will not be too many for as the Scotchman said of sixpences they are canny little dogs and often do the work of shillings Take a passport for Brazil Leave behind your delicacies and superfluities of clothing woolen clothes will be serviceable throughout A trunk for mountain travel should not exceed twenty four by fifteen by fifteen inches smaller the better Take a rubber air pillow and mattress there is no bed between Guayaquil and Para A hammock for the Amazon can be bought on the Napo The Pacific Mail steamships which leave New York on the first and sixteenth of each month connect at Panama without delay with the British Steam Navigation line on the South Pacific Fare first class from New York to Guayaquil by way of Panama and Paita two hundred fifteen dollars gold second class one hundred twenty eight dollars Time to Panama eight days to Paita four days to Guayaquil one day A coasting steamer leaves Panama for Guayaquil the thirteenth of each month There are two so called hotels in Guayaquil Los tres Mosqueteros kept by Sr Gonzales is the best Take a front room one dollar per day and board at the Fonda Italiana or La Santa Rosa one dollar per day Here complete your outfit for the mountains saddle with strong girth and crupper saddle bags saddle cover sweat cloth and bridle forty dollars paper woolen poncho nine dollars rubber poncho four dollars blanket six dollars leggins native spurs and stirrups knife fork spoon tea pot chocolate tea pure and cheap should be purchased at Panama candles matches soap towels and tarpaulin for wrapping up baggage Convert your draft into paper quantum sufficit for Guayaquil the rest into silver Besides this outer outfit an inner one is needed of patience without stint You will soon learn that it is one thing to plan and quite another to execute To get out of the inn is one half of the journey is very appropriately a Spanish proverb Spaniards do nothing d appressado in a hurry but every thing manana to morrow You will find fondas horses and roads divided into the bad the worse and the worst and bad is the best But fret not thyself Serenity of mind wrote Humboldt almost the first requisite for an undertaking in inhospitable regions passionate love for some class of scientific labor and a pure feeling for the enjoyment which nature in her freedom is ready to impart are elements which when they meet together in an individual insure the attainment of valuable results from a great and important journey The journey to Quito must be made between May and November in the rainy season the roads are impassable From Guayaquil to Bodegas by Yankee steamer fare two dollars time eight hours At Bodegas hire beasts at the Consignacion for Guaranda price for riding and cargo beasts four dollars each No extras for the arriero A mule will carry two hundred and fifty pounds Buy bread at Bodegas and Guaranda The Indians on the road are very loth to sell any thing buy a fowl therefore at the first opportunity or you will have to live on dirty potato soup and be glad of that At the tambos or wayside inns you pay only for yerba fodder Never unsaddle your beast till it is cool an Indian will even leave the bridle on for a time To Guaranda three full days There take mules safer than horses in climbing the mountains for Quito six dollars twenty five silver per beast time five days Be sure to leave Guaranda by four a m for in the afternoon Chimborazo is swept by furious winds Also start with a full stomach you will get nothing for two days Drink sparingly of the snow water which dashes down the mountain You will be tempted to curse Chuquipoyo but thank heaven it is no worse There are two hotels in Quito French and American the former has the better location the latter the better rooms Best front room furnished half a dollar a day cheaper by the month Meals two twenty five cents each The beef is excellent but the cuisine oh onions God sends the meat and the evil one cooks You can hire a professional male cook Indian for five dollars a month but you can t teach him any thing Fish is not to be had in Quito Gibbon speaks of having some in Cuzco but does not tell us where it came from one hundred eighty six Price of best flour three dollars sixty per quintal butter thirty cents a pound beef one dollar an arroba twenty five pounds refined sugar three dollars fifty an arroba brown sugar rapidura one hundred eighty seven five cents a pound cigars from six to sixteen for a dime cigarettes five cents a hundred Horse hire from fifty cents to one dollar per day If you are to remain some time buy a beast a good mule costs forty dollars an ordinary horse fifty dollars The Post office Department is a swindle If you pay through you will find on your arrival home that your letters have been paid at both ends Ask our consul at Guayaquil to forward them Footnote one hundred eighty six The Guayaquil market is well supplied with fish of a fair quality Usually the fish of warm tropical waters are poor but the cold Humboldt current which passes along the west coast of Ecuador renders them as edible as those of temperate zones Footnote one hundred eighty seven Called chancaca in Peru In flavor it is very nearly equal to maple sugar The necessary preparations for the Napo journey have been given in a previous chapter Chap XI We might add to the list a few cans of preserved milk from New York for you will not see a drop between the Andes and the Atlantic Fail not to take plenty of lienzo you must have it to pay the Indians and any surplus can be sold to advantage A bale of thirty varas costs about five dollars Rely not at all on game a champion sharpshooter could not live by his rifle Santa Rosa and Coca will be represented to you as small New Yorks but you will do well if you can buy a chicken between them From Quito to Papallacta two days and a half riding beast two dollars silver and one dollar twenty for each cargo of three arrobas At Papallacta hire Indians for Archidona each carries three arrobas and wants five dollars silver in advance You take to your feet time nine days including one day of rest at Baeza At Archidona you take a new set of peons for Napo at twenty five cents apiece time one day From Napo down the river to Santa Rosa one day You give two and a half varas of lienzo to each Indian and the same for the canoe From Santa Rosa to Pebas on the Maranon fifteen days cost of an Indian twenty five varas ditto for a canoe We advise you to stop at Coca and rig up a raft or craft of some kind we ascribe our uninterrupted good health to the length and breadth of our accommodations The Peruvian steamer from the west arrives at Pebas on the sixteenth of each month fare to Tabatinga fifteen dollars gold time four days running time eleven hours Brazilian steamer leaves Tabatinga the twentieth of each month fare to Manaos forty four dollars forty four gold time five days distance one thousand miles From Manaos to Para fifty five dollars fifty five gold time six days distance one thousand miles The Brazilian steamers make semi monthly trips We found two hotels in Para the Italiana dear and poor the Diana unpretending but comfortable Charges at the latter for room and board two dollars a day The best time for traveling on the Amazon is between July and December The United States and Brazilian steamships on their homeward voyage call at Para the seventh of each month fare to New York one hundred fifty dollars gold the same as down the whole length of the Amazon second class seventy five dollars time fourteen days distance by way of saint Thomas sixteen ten fourteen hundred miles Steamer for Rio the ninth of each month fare one hundred twenty five dollars time twelve days distance twenty one ninety miles Fare from Rio to New York two hundred dollars Fare by sailing vessel from Para to New York from fifty dollars to seventy five dollars time three weeks A British steamer from Rio stops at Para and Lisbon A word about health First take one grain of common sense daily do as the natives do keep out of the noon day sun and make haste slowly Secondly take with you quinine in two grain pills and begin to take them before leaving New York as the great African traveler Du Chaillu recommended us As preventive against the intermittent fevers on the lowlands and rivers nothing is better than doctor Copeland s celebrated pills quinine twelve grains camphor twelve grains cayenne pepper twelve grains Mix with mucilage and divide into twelve pills take one every night or morning as required On the Amazon carry guarana Woolen socks are recommended by those who have had much experience of tropical fevers Never bathe when the air is moist avoid a chill a native will not bathe till the sun is well up Rub yourself with aguardiente native rum after a bath and always when caught in a shower Freely exercise in Quito to ward off liver complaints Drink little water coffee or chocolate is better and tea is best Avoid spirits with fruit and fruit after dinner The sickliest time in Guayaquil is at the breaking up of the rainy season As to dangers First from the people Traveling is as safe in Ecuador as in New York and safer than in Missouri There are no Spanish banditti though some places as Chambo near Riobamba bear a bad name It is not wise to tempt a penniless footpad by a show of gold but no more so in Ecuador than any where We have traveled from Guayaquil to Damascus but have never had occasion to use a weapon in self defense and only once for offense when we threatened to demolish an Arab sheik with an umbrella Secondly from brutes Some travelers would have us infer that it is impossible to stir in South America without being affectionately entwined by a serpent or sprung upon by a jaguar or bitten by a rattlesnake jiggers in every sand heap and scorpions under every stone Edinburgh Review xliii three hundred ten Padre Vernazza speaks of meeting a serpent two yards in diameter But you will be disappointed at the paucity of animal life We were two months on the Andes August and September before we saw a live snake They are plentiful in the wet season in cacao plantations but the majority are harmless doctor Russel who particularly studied the reptiles of India found that out of forty three species which he examined not more than seven had poisonous fangs and Sir E Tennent after a long residence in Ceylon declared he had never heard of the death of an European by the bite of a snake It is true however that the number and proportion of the venomous species are greater in South America than in any other part of the world but it is some consolation to know that zoologically they are inferior in rank to the harmless ones and certainly adds Sidney Smith a snake that feels fourteen or fifteen stone stamping on his tail has little time for reflection and may be allowed to be poisonous If bitten apply ammonia externally immediately and take five drops in water internally it is an almost certain antidote The discomforts and dangers arising from the animal creation are no greater than one would meet in traveling overland from New York to New Orleans Finally of one thing the tourist in South America may be assured that dear to him as it is to us will be the remembrance of those romantic rides over the Cordilleras amid the wild magnificence of nature the adventurous walk through the primeval forest the exciting canoe life on the Napo and the long monotonous sail on the waters of the Great River CHAPTER XXIV IN MEMORIAM A life that all the Muses decked With gifts of grace that might express All comprehensive tenderness All subtilizing intellect TENNYSON On the east of the city of Quito is a beautiful and extensive plain so level that it is literally a table land It is the classic ground of the astronomy of the eighteenth century here the French and Spanish academicians made their celebrated measurement of a meridian of the earth As you stand on the edge of this plain just without the city you see the dazzling summit of Cayambi looking down from the north on your left are the picturesque defiles of Pichincha on your right the slopes of Antisana Close by you standing between the city and the plain is a high white wall inclosing a little plot like the city above four square You are reminded by its shape and also by its position relative to Quito and Pichincha of that other sacred inclosure just outside the walls of Jerusalem and at the foot of Olivet the Garden of Gethsemane This is the Protestant Cemetery Illustration P Staunton Through the efforts of our late representative now also numbered with the dead this place was assigned by the government for the interment of foreigners who do not die in the Romish faith And there we buried our fellow traveler COLONEL PHINEAS STAUNTON the artist of the expedition and Vice Chancellor of Ingham University New York On the eighth of September eighteen sixty seven we bore him through the streets of Quito to this quiet resting place without parade and in solemn silence just as we believe his unobtrusive spirit would have desired and just as his Savior was carried from the cross to the sepulchre No splendid hearse or nodding plumes no long procession save the unheard tread of the angels no requiem save the unheard harps of the seraphs We gave him a Protestant Christian burial such as Quito never saw In this corner of nature s vast cathedral the secluded shrine of grandeur and beauty not found in Westminster Abbey we left him We parted with him on the mount which is to be the scene of his transfiguration It would be difficult for an artist to find a grave whose surroundings are so akin to his feelings He lies in the lofty lap of the Andes and snow white pinnacles stand around him on every side just as we imagine the mountains are around the city of God We think we hear him saying as Fanny Kemble Butler said of another burial ground I will not rise to trouble any one if they will let me sleep here I will only ask to be permitted once in a while to raise my head and look out upon this glorious scene No dark and dismal fogs gather at evening about that spot It lies nearer to heaven than any other Protestant cemetery in the world It is good says Beecher to have our mortal remains go upward for their burial and catch the earliest sounds of that trumpet which shall raise the dead And the day is coming when that precious vein of gold that now lies in the bosom of the mighty Andes shall leave its rocky bed and shine in seven fold purity Indeed the artist is already in that higher studio among the mountains of Beulah A simple sculptured obelisk of sorrow stands over the dust of Colonel Staunton his most fitting monument is his own life work He was the very painter Humboldt longed for in his writings the artist who studying in nature s great hot house bounded by the tropics should add a new and more magnificent kingdom of nature to art Colonel Staunton true and lovely in his own character was ever seeking in nature for whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are pure and now was about to add whatsoever things are grand He was a Christian artist in sympathy with such men as Raphael and Leonardo de Vinci The habitual choice of sacred subjects says Ruskin implies that the painter has a natural disposition to dwell on the highest thoughts of which humanity is capable No shallow or false person could have conceived his Ascension Only the highest qualities of the intellect and heart a soul already half ascended could have given such ethereal lightness to those two men in white apparel Only the pure in heart see God As we revisit in imagination the spot where he sleeps so well we behold in the calm sublimity of the mountains that surround his grave an image of the undisturbed repose of his spirit on the Rock of Ages APPENDICES APPENDIX A BAROMETRICAL MEASUREMENTS ACROSS SOUTH AMERICA one hundred eighty eight Footnote one hundred eighty eight First published in

two hundred eighty two In a letter to the author mister Darwin says Your discovery of marine shells high up the Amazon possesses extreme interest not only in itself but as one more most striking instance how rash it is to assert that any deposit is not a marine formation because it does not contain fossils As for myself I never believed for a moment in Agassiz s idea of the origin of the Amazonian formation Agassiz candidly confesses Lyell s Principles i four hundred sixty eight that he failed to discover any of those proofs which we are accustomed to regard even in temperate latitudes as essential for the establishment of the former existence of glaciers where they are now no more No glaciated pebbles or far transported angular blocks with polished and striated sides no
