1804-170447-0000	train-other-500	a slow and sluggish stream compared to the neighbouring river of Wharfe Keighley station is on this line of railway about a quarter of a mile from the town of the same name The number of inhabitants and the importance of Keighley
1804-170447-0001	train-other-500	have been very greatly increased during the last twenty years owing to the rapidly extended market for worsted manufactures a branch of industry that mainly employs the factory population of this part of Yorkshire
none	none	 which has Bradford for its centre and metropolis Keighley is in process of transformation from a populous 
1804-170447-0002	train-other-500	old fashioned village into a still more populous and flourishing town It is evident to the stranger that as the gable ended houses which obtrude themselves corner wise on the widening street fall vacant
1804-170447-0003	train-other-500	they are pulled down to allow of greater space for traffic and a more modern style of architecture The quaint and narrow shop windows of fifty years ago are giving way to large panes and plate glass
1804-170447-0004	train-other-500	Nearly every dwelling seems devoted to some branch of commerce In passing hastily through the town one hardly perceives where the necessary lawyer and doctor can live
1804-170447-0005	train-other-500	so little appearance is there of any dwellings of the professional middle class such as abound in our old cathedral towns In fact nothing can be more opposed than the state of society the modes of thinking
1804-170447-0006	train-other-500	the standards of reference on all points of morality manners and even politics and religion in such a new manufacturing place as Keighley in the north and any stately sleepy picturesque cathedral town in the south
1804-170447-0007	train-other-500	Yet the aspect of Keighley promises well for future stateliness if not picturesqueness Grey stone abounds and the rows of houses built of it have a kind of solid grandeur
1804-170447-0008	train-other-500	connected with their uniform and enduring lines The frame work of the doors and the lintels of the windows even in the smallest dwellings are made of blocks of stone
none	none	 There is no painted wood to require continual beautifying 
1804-170447-0009	train-other-500	or else present a shabby aspect and the stone is kept scrupulously clean by the notable Yorkshire housewives Such glimpses into the interior as a passer by obtains
none	none	 reveal a rough abundance of the means of living 
1804-170447-0010	train-other-500	and diligent and active habits in the women But the voices of the people are hard and their tones discordant promising little of the musical taste that distinguishes the district and which has already furnished a Carrodus to the musical world
1804-170447-0011	train-other-500	The names over the shops of which the one just given is a sample seem strange even to an inhabitant of the neighbouring county and have a peculiar smack and flavour of the place
1804-170447-0012	train-other-500	The town of Keighley never quite melts into country on the road to Haworth although the houses become more sparse as the traveller journeys upwards to the grey round hills that seem to bound his journey in a westerly direction
1804-170447-0013	train-other-500	First come some villas just sufficiently retired from the road to show that they can scarcely belong to any one liable to be summoned in a hurry at the call of suffering or danger from his comfortable fireside
1804-170447-0014	train-other-500	the lawyer the doctor and the clergyman live at hand and hardly in the suburbs with a screen of shrubs for concealment In a town one does not look for vivid colouring
1804-170447-0015	train-other-500	what there may be of this is furnished by the wares in the shops not by foliage or atmospheric effects but in the country some brilliancy and vividness seems to be instinctively expected
1804-170447-0016	train-other-500	and there is consequently a slight feeling of disappointment at the grey neutral tint of every object near or far off on the way from Keighley to Haworth The distance is about four miles
1804-170447-0017	train-other-500	and as I have said what with villas great worsted factories rows of workmen s houses with here and there an old fashioned farmhouse and out buildings it can hardly be called country
1804-170447-0018	train-other-500	any part of the way For two miles the road passes over tolerably level ground distant hills on the left a beck flowing through meadows on the right and furnishing water power at certain points
1804-170447-0019	train-other-500	to the factories built on its banks The air is dim and lightless with the smoke from all these habitations and places of business The soil in the valley or bottom to use the local term is rich
1804-170447-0020	train-other-500	but as the road begins to ascend the vegetation becomes poorer it does not flourish it merely exists and instead of trees there are only bushes and shrubs about the dwellings
none	none	 Stone dykes are everywhere used in place of hedges and what crops there are on the patches of arable land consist of pale hungry looking grey green oats 
1804-170447-0021	train-other-500	Right before the traveller on this road rises Haworth village he can see it for two miles before he arrives for it is situated on the side of a pretty steep hill with a back ground of dun and purple moors
1804-170447-0022	train-other-500	rising and sweeping away yet higher than the church which is built at the very summit of the long narrow street All round the horizon there is this same line of sinuous wave like hills the scoops into which they fall
none	none	 only revealing other hills beyond of similar colour and shape 
1804-170447-0023	train-other-500	crowned with wild bleak moors grand from the ideas of solitude and loneliness which they suggest or oppressive from the feeling which they give of being pent up by some monotonous
1804-170447-0024	train-other-500	and illimitable barrier according to the mood of mind in which the spectator may be For a short distance the road appears to turn away from Haworth as it winds round the base of the shoulder of a hill
1804-170447-0025	train-other-500	but then it crosses a bridge over the beck and the ascent through the village begins The flag stones with which it is paved are placed end ways in order to give a better hold to the horses feet and
1804-170447-0026	train-other-500	even with this help they seem to be in constant danger of slipping backwards The old stone houses are high compared to the width of the street which makes an abrupt turn before reaching the more level ground at the head of the village
1804-170447-0027	train-other-500	so that the steep aspect of the place in one part is almost like that of a wall But this surmounted the church lies a little off the main road on the left a hundred yards or so and the driver relaxes his care
1804-170447-0028	train-other-500	and the horse breathes more easily as they pass into the quite little by street that leads to Haworth Parsonage The churchyard is on one side of this lane the school house and the sexton s dwelling where the curates formerly lodged
none	none	 on the other 
1804-170447-0029	train-other-500	The parsonage stands at right angles to the road facing down upon the church so that in fact parsonage church and belfried school house form three sides of an irregular oblong
none	none	 of which the fourth is open to the fields and moors that lie beyond The area of this oblong is filled up by a crowded churchyard and a small garden or court in front of the clergyman s house 
1804-170447-0030	train-other-500	As the entrance to this from the road is at the side the path goes round the corner into the little plot of ground Underneath the windows is a narrow flower border carefully tended in days of yore
1804-170447-0031	train-other-500	although only the most hardy plants could be made to grow there Within the stone wall which keeps out the surrounding churchyard are bushes of elder and lilac
1804-170447-0032	train-other-500	the rest of the ground is occupied by a square grass plot and a gravel walk The house is of grey stone two stories high heavily roofed with flags
1804-170447-0033	train-other-500	in order to resist the winds that might strip off a lighter covering It appears to have been built about a hundred years ago and to consist of four rooms on each story
1804-170447-0034	train-other-500	the two windows on the right as the visitor stands with his back to the church ready to enter in at the front door belonging to mister Bronte s study the two on the left to the family sitting room
1804-170447-0035	train-other-500	Everything about the place tells of the most dainty order the most exquisite cleanliness The door steps are spotless the small old fashioned window panes glitter like looking glass
1804-170447-0036	train-other-500	Inside and outside of that house cleanliness goes up into its essence purity
none	none	 The little church lies as I mentioned above most of the houses in the village 
1804-170447-0037	train-other-500	and the graveyard rises above the church and is terribly full of upright tombstones The chapel or church claims greater antiquity than any other in that part of the kingdom but there is no appearance of this in the external aspect
1804-170447-0038	train-other-500	of the present edifice unless it be in the two eastern windows which remain unmodernized and in the lower part of the steeple
none	none	 Inside the character of the pillars shows that they were constructed before the reign of Henry VII 
1804-170447-0039	train-other-500	It is probable that there existed on this ground a field kirk or oratory in the earliest times
none	none	 and from the Archbishop s registry at York it is ascertained that there was a chapel at Haworth in thirteen seventeen The inhabitants refer inquirers concerning the date to the following inscription on a stone in the church tower Hic fecit Caenobium Monachorum Auteste fundator A D sexcentissimo 
1804-170447-0040	train-other-500	That is to say before the preaching of Christianity in Northumbria
none	none	 Whitaker says that this mistake originated in the illiterate copying out by some modern stone cutter of an inscription in the character of Henry the Eighth s time on an adjoining stone 
1804-170447-0041	train-other-500	Orate pro bono statu Eutest Tod Now every antiquary knows that the formula of prayer bono statu always refers to the living I suspect this singular Christian name
1804-170447-0042	train-other-500	has been mistaken by the stone cutter for Austet
none	none	 a contraction of Eustatius but the word Tod 
1804-170447-0043	train-other-500	which has been mis read for the Arabic figures six hundred is perfectly fair and legible On the presumption of this foolish claim to antiquity the people would needs set up for independence
1804-170447-0044	train-other-500	and contest the right of the Vicar of Bradford to nominate a curate at Haworth I have given this extract in order to explain the imaginary groundwork of a commotion which took place in Haworth about five and thirty years ago
1804-170447-0045	train-other-500	to which I shall have occasion to allude again more particularly The interior of the church is commonplace it is neither old enough nor modern enough to compel notice The pews are of black oak with high divisions
1804-170447-0046	train-other-500	and the names of those to whom they belong are painted in white letters on the doors There are neither brasses nor altar tombs nor monuments but there is a mural tablet on the right hand side of the communion table
none	none	 bearing the following inscription HERE LIE THE REMAINS OF MARIA BRONTE WIFE OF THE reverend P BRONTE A B MINISTER OF HAWORTH HER SOUL DEPARTED TO THE SAVIOUR SEPT fifteenTH eighteen twenty one IN THE thirty nineTH YEAR OF HER AGE Be ye also ready for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of Man cometh MATTHEW xxiv forty four ALSO HERE LIE THE REMAINS OF MARIA BRONTE DAUGHTER OF THE AFORESAID SHE DIED ON THE sixTH OF MAY eighteen twenty five IN THE twelveTH YEAR OF HER AGE AND OF ELIZABETH BRONTE HER SISTER WHO DIED JUNE fifteenTH eighteen twenty five IN THE elevenTH YEAR OF HER AGE Verily I say unto you Except ye be converted and become as little children ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven MATTHEW xviii three HERE ALSO LIE THE REMAINS OF PATRICK BRANWELL BRONTE WHO DIED SEPT twenty fourTH eighteen forty eight AGED thirty YEARS AND OF EMILY JANE BRONTE WHO DIED DEC nineteenTH eighteen forty eight AGED twenty nine YEARS SON AND DAUGHTER OF THE reverend P BRONTE INCUMBENT THIS STONE IS ALSO DEDICATED TO THE MEMORY OF ANNE BRONTE YOUNGEST DAUGHTER OF THE reverend P BRONTE

1804-170447-0048	train-other-500	in their fond affection thought little of the margin and verge they were leaving for those who were still living But as one dead member of the household follows another fast to the grave the lines are pressed together and the letters become small and cramped
1804-170447-0049	train-other-500	After the record of Anne s death there is room for no other But one more of that generation the last of that nursery of six little motherless children was yet to follow before the survivor

none	none	 WIFE OF THE reverend ARTHUR BELL NICHOLLS A B AND DAUGHTER OF THE reverend P BRONTE A B INCUMBENT SHE DIED MARCH thirty oneST eighteen fifty five IN THE thirty nineTH YEAR OF HER AGE This tablet which corrects the error in the former tablet as to the age of Anne Bronte bears the following inscription in Roman letters the initials however being in old English CHAPTER II For a right understanding of the life of my dear friend Charlotte Bronte it appears to me more necessary in her case than in most others that the reader should be made acquainted with the peculiar forms of population and society amidst which her earliest years were passed and from which both her own and her sisters first impressions of human life must have been received I shall endeavour therefore before proceeding further with my work to present some idea of the character of the people of Haworth and the surrounding districts Even an inhabitant of the neighbouring county of Lancaster is struck by the peculiar force of character which the Yorkshiremen display This makes them interesting as a race while at the same time as individuals the remarkable degree of self sufficiency they possess gives them an air of independence rather apt to repel a stranger I use this expression self sufficiency in the largest sense Conscious of the strong sagacity and the dogged power of will which seem almost the birthright of the natives of the West Riding each man relies upon himself and seeks no help at the hands of his neighbour From rarely requiring the assistance of others he comes to doubt the power of bestowing it from the general success of his efforts he grows to depend upon them and to over esteem his own energy and power He belongs to that keen yet short sighted class who consider suspicion of all whose honesty is not proved as a sign of wisdom The practical qualities of a man are held in great respect but the want of faith in strangers and untried modes of action extends itself even to the manner in which the virtues are regarded and if they produce no immediate and tangible result they are rather put aside as unfit for this busy striving world especially if they are more of a passive than an active character The affections are strong and their foundations lie deep but they are not such affections seldom are wide spreading nor do they show themselves on the surface Indeed there is little display of any of the amenities of life among this wild rough population Their accost is curt their accent and tone of speech blunt and harsh Something of this may probably be attributed to the freedom of mountain air and of isolated hill side life something be derived from their rough Norse ancestry They have a quick perception of character and a keen sense of humour the dwellers among them must be prepared for certain uncomplimentary though most likely true observations pithily expressed Their feelings are not easily roused but their duration is lasting Hence there is much close friendship and faithful service and for a correct exemplification of the form in which the latter frequently appears I need only refer the reader of Wuthering Heights to the character of Joseph From the same cause come also enduring grudges in some cases amounting to hatred which occasionally has been bequeathed from generation to generation I remember Miss Bronte once telling me that it was a saying round about Haworth Keep a stone in thy pocket seven year turn it and keep it seven year longer that it may be ever ready to thine hand when thine enemy draws near The West Riding men are sleuth hounds in pursuit of money Miss Bronte related to my husband a curious instance illustrative of this eager desire for riches A man that she knew who was a small manufacturer had engaged in many local speculations which had always turned out well and thereby rendered him a person of some wealth He was rather past middle age when he bethought him of insuring his life and he had only just taken out his policy when he fell ill of an acute disease which was certain to end fatally in a very few days The doctor half hesitatingly revealed to him his hopeless state By jingo cried he rousing up at once into the old energy I shall do the insurance company I always was a lucky fellow These men are keen and shrewd faithful and persevering in following out a good purpose fell in tracking an evil one They are not emotional they are not easily made into either friends or enemies but once lovers or haters it is difficult to change their feeling They are a powerful race both in mind and body both for good and for evil The woollen manufacture was introduced into this district in the days of Edward III It is traditionally said that a colony of Flemings came over and settled in the West Riding to teach the inhabitants what to do with their wool The mixture of agricultural with manufacturing labour that ensued and prevailed in the West Riding up to a very recent period sounds pleasant enough at this distance of time when the classical impression is left and the details forgotten or only brought to light by those who explore the few remote parts of England where the custom still lingers The idea of the mistress and her maidens spinning at the great wheels while the master was abroad ploughing his fields or seeing after his flocks on the purple moors is very poetical to look back upon but when such life actually touches on our own days and we can hear particulars from the lips of those now living there come out details of coarseness of the uncouthness of the rustic mingled with the sharpness of the tradesman of irregularity and fierce lawlessness that rather mar the vision of pastoral innocence and simplicity Still as it is the exceptional and exaggerated characteristics of any period that leave the most vivid memory behind them it would be wrong and in my opinion faithless to conclude that such and such forms of society and modes of living were not best for the period when they prevailed although the abuses they may have led into and the gradual progress of the world have made it well that such ways and manners should pass away for ever and as preposterous to attempt to return to them as it would be for a man to return to the clothes of his childhood The patent granted to Alderman Cockayne and the further restrictions imposed by James I on the export of undyed woollen cloths met by a prohibition on the part of the States of Holland of the import of English dyed cloths injured the trade of the West Riding manufacturers considerably Their independence of character their dislike of authority and their strong powers of thought predisposed them to rebellion against the religious dictation of such men as Laud and the arbitrary rule of the Stuarts and the injury done by James and Charles to the trade by which they gained their bread made the great majority of them Commonwealth men I shall have occasion afterwards to give one or two instances of the warm feelings and extensive knowledge on subjects of both home and foreign politics existing at the present day in the villages lying west and east of the mountainous ridge that separates Yorkshire and Lancashire the inhabitants of which are of the same race and possess the same quality of character The descendants of many who served under Cromwell at Dunbar live on the same lands as their ancestors occupied then and perhaps there is no part of England where the traditional and fond recollections of the Commonwealth have lingered so long as in that inhabited by the woollen manufacturing population of the West Riding who had the restrictions taken off their trade by the Protector s admirable commercial policy I have it on good authority that not thirty years ago the phrase in Oliver s days was in common use to denote a time of unusual prosperity The class of Christian names prevalent in a district is one indication of the direction in which its tide of hero worship sets Grave enthusiasts in politics or religion perceive not the ludicrous side of those which they give to their children and some are to be found still in their infancy not a dozen miles from Haworth that will have to go through life as Lamartine Kossuth and Dembinsky And so there is a testimony to what I have said of the traditional feeling of the district in the fact that the Old Testament names in general use among the Puritans are yet the prevalent appellations in most Yorkshire families of middle or humble rank whatever their religious persuasion may be There are numerous records too that show the kindly way in which the ejected ministers were received by the gentry as well as by the poorer part of the inhabitants during the persecuting days of Charles II These little facts all testify to the old hereditary spirit of independence ready ever to resist authority which was conceived to be unjustly exercised that distinguishes the people of the West Riding to the present day The parish of Halifax touches that of Bradford in which the chapelry of Haworth is included and the nature of the ground in the two parishes is much the of the same wild and hilly description The abundance of coal and the number of mountain streams in the district make it highly favourable to manufactures and accordingly as I stated the inhabitants have for centuries been engaged in making cloth as well as in agricultural pursuits But the intercourse of trade failed for a long time to bring amenity and civilization into these outlying hamlets or widely scattered dwellings mister Hunter in his Life of Oliver Heywood quotes a sentence out of a memorial of one James Rither living in the reign of Elizabeth which is partially true to this day They have no superior to court no civilities to practise a sour and sturdy humour is the consequence so that a stranger is shocked by a tone of defiance in every voice and an air of fierceness in every countenance Even now a stranger can hardly ask a question without receiving some crusty reply if indeed he receive any at all Sometimes the sour rudeness amounts to positive insult Yet if the foreigner takes all this churlishness good humouredly or as a matter of course and makes good any claim upon their latent kindliness and hospitality they are faithful and generous and thoroughly to be relied upon As a slight illustration of the roughness that pervades all classes in these out of the way villages I may relate a little adventure which happened to my husband and myself three years ago at Addingham From Penigent to Pendle Hill From Linton to Long Addingham And all that Craven coasts did tell c one of the places that sent forth its fighting men to the famous old battle of Flodden Field and a village not many miles from Haworth We were driving along the street when one of those ne er do weel lads who seem to have a kind of magnetic power for misfortunes having jumped into the stream that runs through the place just where all the broken glass and bottles are thrown staggered naked and nearly covered with blood into a cottage before us Besides receiving another bad cut in the arm he had completely laid open the artery and was in a fair way of bleeding to death which one of his relations comforted him by saying would be likely to save a deal o trouble When my husband had checked the effusion of blood with a strap that one of the bystanders unbuckled from his leg he asked if a surgeon had been sent for Yoi was the answer but we dunna think he ll come Why not He s owd yo seen and asthmatic and it s up hill My husband taking a boy for his guide drove as fast as he could to the surgeon s house which was about three quarters of a mile off and met the aunt of the wounded lad leaving it Is he coming inquired my husband Well he didna say he wouldna come But tell him the lad may bleed to death I did And what did he say Why only D n him what do I care It ended however in his sending one of his sons who though not brought up to the surgering trade was able to do what was necessary in the way of bandages and plasters The excuse made for the surgeon was that he was near eighty and getting a bit doited and had had a matter o twenty childer Among the most unmoved of the lookers on was the brother of the boy so badly hurt and while he was lying in a pool of blood on the flag floor and crying out how much his arm was warching his stoical relation stood coolly smoking his bit of black pipe and uttered not a single word of either sympathy or sorrow Forest customs existing in the fringes of dark wood which clothed the declivity of the hills on either side tended to brutalize the population until the middle of the seventeenth century Execution by beheading was performed in a summary way upon either men or women who were guilty of but very slight crimes and a dogged yet in some cases fine indifference to human life was thus generated The roads were so notoriously bad even up to the last thirty years that there was little communication between one village and another if the produce of industry could be conveyed at stated times to the cloth market of the district it was all that could be done and in lonely houses on the distant hill side or by the small magnates of secluded hamlets crimes might be committed almost unknown certainly without any great uprising of popular indignation calculated to bring down the strong arm of the law It must be remembered that in those days there was no rural constabulary and the few magistrates left to themselves and generally related to one another were most of them inclined to tolerate eccentricity and to wink at faults too much like their own Men hardly past middle life talk of the days of their youth spent in this part of the country when during the winter months they rode up to the saddle girths in mud when absolute business was the only reason for stirring beyond the precincts of home and when that business was conducted under a pressure of difficulties which they themselves borne along to Bradford market in a swift first class carriage can hardly believe to have been possible For instance one woollen manufacturer says that not five and twenty years ago he had to rise betimes to set off on a winter s morning in order to be at Bradford with the great waggon load of goods manufactured by his father this load was packed over night but in the morning there was a great gathering around it and flashing of lanterns and examination of horses feet before the ponderous waggon got under way and then some one had to go groping here and there on hands and knees and always sounding with a staff down the long steep slippery brow to find where the horses might tread safely until they reached the comparative easy going of the deep rutted main road People went on horseback over the upland moors following the tracks of the pack horses that carried the parcels baggage or goods from one town to another between which there did not happen to be a highway But in winter all such communication was impossible by reason of the snow which lay long and late on the bleak high ground I have known people who travelling by the mail coach over Blackstone Edge had been snowed up for a week or ten days at the little inn near the summit and obliged to spend both Christmas and New Year s Day there till the store of provisions laid in for the use of the landlord and his family falling short before the inroads of the unexpected visitors they had recourse to the turkeys geese and Yorkshire pies with which the coach was laden and even these were beginning to fail when a fortunate thaw released them from their prison Isolated as the hill villages may be they are in the world compared with the loneliness of the grey ancestral houses to be seen here and there in the dense hollows of the moors These dwellings are not large yet they are solid and roomy enough for the accommodation of those who live in them and to whom the surrounding estates belong The land has often been held by one family since the days of the Tudors the owners are in fact the remains of the old yeomanry small squires who are rapidly becoming extinct as a class from one of two causes Either the possessor falls into idle drinking habits and so is obliged eventually to sell his property or he finds if more shrewd and adventurous that the beck running down the mountain side or the minerals beneath his feet can be turned into a new source of wealth and leaving the old plodding life of a landowner with small capital he turns manufacturer or digs for coal or quarries for stone Still there are those remaining of this class dwellers in the lonely houses far away in the upland districts even at the present day who sufficiently indicate what strange eccentricity what wild strength of will nay even what unnatural power of crime was fostered by a mode of living in which a man seldom met his fellows and where public opinion was only a distant and inarticulate echo of some clearer voice sounding behind the sweeping horizon A solitary life cherishes mere fancies until they become manias And the powerful Yorkshire character which was scarcely tamed into subjection by all the contact it met with in busy town or crowded mart has before now broken out into strange wilfulness in the remoter districts A singular account was recently given me of a landowner living it is true on the Lancashire side of the hills but of the same blood and nature as the dwellers on the other who was supposed to be in the receipt of seven or eight hundred a year and whose house bore marks of handsome antiquity as if his forefathers had been for a long time people of consideration My informant was struck with the appearance of the place and proposed to the countryman who was accompanying him to go up to it and take a nearer inspection The reply was Yo d better not he d threap yo down th loan He s let fly at some folk s legs and let shot lodge in em afore now for going too near to his house And finding on closer inquiry that such was really the inhospitable custom of this moorland squire the gentleman gave up his purpose I believe that the savage yeoman is still living Another squire of more distinguished family and larger property one is thence led to imagine of better education but that does not always follow died at his house not many miles from Haworth only a few years ago His great amusement and occupation had been cock fighting When he was confined to his chamber with what he knew would be his last illness he had his cocks brought up there and watched the bloody battle from his bed As his mortal disease increased and it became impossible for him to turn so as to follow the combat he had looking glasses arranged in such a manner around and above him as he lay that he could still see the cocks fighting And in this manner he died These are merely instances of eccentricity compared to the tales of positive violence and crime that have occurred in these isolated dwellings which still linger in the memories of the old people of the district and some of which were doubtless familiar to the authors of Wuthering Heights and The Tenant of Wildfell Hall The amusements of the lower classes could hardly be expected to be more humane than those of the wealthy and better educated The gentleman who has kindly furnished me with some of the particulars I have given remembers the bull baitings at Rochdale not thirty years ago The bull was fastened by a chain or rope to a post in the river To increase the amount of water as well as to give their workpeople the opportunity of savage delight the masters were accustomed to stop their mills on the day when the sport took place The bull would sometimes wheel suddenly round so that the rope by which he was fastened swept those who had been careless enough to come within its range down into the water and the good people of Rochdale had the excitement of seeing one or two of their neighbours drowned as well as of witnessing the bull baited and the dogs torn and tossed The people of Haworth were not less strong and full of character than their neighbours on either side of the hills The village lies embedded in the moors between the two counties on the old road between Keighley and Colne About the middle of the last century it became famous in the religious world as the scene of the ministrations of the reverend William Grimshaw curate of Haworth for twenty years Before this time it is probable that the curates were of the same order as one mister Nicholls a Yorkshire clergyman in the days immediately succeeding the Reformation who was much addicted to drinking and company keeping and used to say to his companions You must not heed me but when I am got three feet above the earth that was into the pulpit mister Grimshaw s life was written by Newton Cowper s friend and from it may be gathered some curious particulars of the manner in which a rough population were swayed and governed by a man of deep convictions and strong earnestness of purpose It seems that he had not been in any way remarkable for religious zeal though he had led a moral life and been conscientious in fulfilling his parochial duties until a certain Sunday in September seventeen forty four when the servant rising at five found her master already engaged in prayer she stated that after remaining in his chamber for some time he went to engage in religious exercises in the house of a parishioner then home again to pray thence still fasting to the church where as he was reading the second lesson he fell down and on his partial recovery had to be led from the church As he went out he spoke to the congregation and told them not to disperse as he had something to say to them and would return presently He was taken to the clerk s house and again became insensible His servant rubbed him to restore the circulation and when he was brought to himself he seemed in a great rapture and the first words he uttered were I have had a glorious vision from the third heaven He did not say what he had seen but returned into the church and began the service again at two in the afternoon and went on until seven From this time he devoted himself with the fervour of a Wesley and something of the fanaticism of a Whitfield to calling out a religious life among his parishioners They had been in the habit of playing at foot ball on Sunday using stones for this purpose and giving and receiving challenges from other parishes There were horse races held on the moors just above the village which were periodical sources of drunkenness and profligacy Scarcely a wedding took place without the rough amusement of foot races where the half naked runners were a scandal to all decent strangers The old custom of arvills or funeral feasts led to frequent pitched battles between the drunken mourners Such customs were the outward signs of the kind of people with whom mister Grimshaw had to deal But by various means some of the most practical kind he wrought a great change in his parish In his preaching he was occasionally assisted by Wesley and Whitfield and at such times the little church proved much too small to hold the throng that poured in from distant villages or lonely moorland hamlets and frequently they were obliged to meet in the open air indeed there was not room enough in the church even for the communicants mister Whitfield was once preaching in Haworth and made use of some such expression as that he hoped there was no need to say much to this congregation as they had sat under so pious and godly a minister for so many years whereupon mister Grimshaw stood up in his place and said with a loud voice Oh sir for God s sake do not speak so I pray you do not flatter them I fear the greater part of them are going to hell with their eyes open But if they were so bound it was not for want of exertion on mister Grimshaw s part to prevent them He used to preach twenty or thirty times a week in private houses If he perceived any one inattentive to his prayers he would stop and rebuke the offender and not go on till he saw every one on their knees He was very earnest in enforcing the strict observance of Sunday and would not even allow his parishioners to walk in the fields between services He sometimes gave out a very long Psalm tradition says the one hundred and nineteenth and while it was being sung he left the reading desk and taking a horsewhip went into the public houses and flogged the loiterers into church They were swift who could escape the lash of the parson by sneaking out the back way He had strong health and an active body and rode far and wide over the hills awakening those who had previously had no sense of religion To save time and be no charge to the families at whose houses he held his prayer meetings he carried his provisions with him all the food he took in the day on such occasions consisting simply of a piece of bread and butter or dry bread and a raw onion The horse races were justly objectionable to mister Grimshaw they attracted numbers of profligate people to Haworth and brought a match to the combustible materials of the place only too ready to blaze out into wickedness The story is that he tried all means of persuasion and even intimidation to have the races discontinued but in vain At length in despair he prayed with such fervour of earnestness that the rain came down in torrents and deluged the ground so that there was no footing for man or beast even if the multitude had been willing to stand such a flood let down from above And so Haworth races were stopped and have never been resumed to this day Even now the memory of this good man is held in reverence and his faithful ministrations and real virtues are one of the boasts of the parish But after his time I fear there was a falling back into the wild rough heathen ways from which he had pulled them up as it were by the passionate force of his individual character He had built a chapel for the Wesleyan Methodists and not very long after the Baptists established themselves in a place of worship Indeed as doctor Whitaker says the people of this district are strong religionists only fifty years ago their religion did not work down into their lives Half that length of time back the code of morals seemed to be formed upon that of their Norse ancestors Revenge was handed down from father to son as an hereditary duty and a great capability for drinking without the head being affected was considered as one of the manly virtues The games of foot ball on Sundays with the challenges to the neighbouring parishes were resumed bringing in an influx of riotous strangers to fill the public houses and make the more sober minded inhabitants long for good mister Grimshaw s stout arm and ready horsewhip The old custom of arvills was as prevalent as ever The sexton standing at the foot of the open grave announced that the arvill would be held at the Black Bull or whatever public house might be fixed upon by the friends of the dead and thither the mourners and their acquaintances repaired The origin of the custom had been the necessity of furnishing some refreshment for those who came from a distance to pay the last mark of respect to a friend In the life of Oliver Heywood there are two quotations which show what sort of food was provided for arvills in quiet Nonconformist connections in the seventeenth century the first from Thoresby tells of cold possets stewed prunes cake and cheese as being the arvill after Oliver Heywood s funeral The second gives as rather shabby according to the notion of the times sixteen seventy three nothing but a bit of cake draught of wine piece of rosemary and pair of gloves But the arvills at Haworth were often far more jovial doings Among the poor the mourners were only expected to provide a kind of spiced roll for each person and the expense of the liquors rum or ale or a mixture of both called dog s nose was generally defrayed by each guest placing some money on a plate set in the middle of the table Richer people would order a dinner for their friends At the funeral of mister Charnock the next successor but one to mister Grimshaw in the incumbency above eighty people were bid to the arvill and the price of the feast was fours sixd per head all of which was defrayed by the friends of the deceased As few shirked their liquor there were very frequently up and down fights before the close of the day sometimes with the horrid additions of pawsing and gouging and biting Although I have dwelt on the exceptional traits in the characteristics of these stalwart West Ridingers such as they were in the first quarter of this century if not a few years later I have little doubt that in the everyday life of the people so independent wilful and full of grim humour there would be much found even at present that would shock those accustomed only to the local manners of the south and in return I suspect the shrewd sagacious energetic Yorkshireman would hold such foreigners in no small contempt I have said it is most probable that where Haworth Church now stands there was once an ancient field kirk or oratory It occupied the third or lowest class of ecclesiastical structures according to the Saxon law and had no right of sepulture or administration of sacraments It was so called because it was built without enclosure and open to the adjoining fields or moors The founder according to the laws of Edgar was bound without subtracting from his tithes to maintain the ministering priest out of the remaining nine parts of his income After the Reformation the right of choosing their clergyman at any of those chapels of ease which had formerly been field kirks was vested in the freeholders and trustees subject to the approval of the vicar of the parish But owing to some negligence this right has been lost to the freeholders and trustees at Haworth ever since the days of Archbishop Sharp and the power of choosing a minister has lapsed into the hands of the Vicar of Bradford So runs the account according to one authority mister Bronte says This living has for its patrons the Vicar of Bradford and certain trustees My predecessor took the living with the consent of the Vicar of Bradford but in opposition to the trustees in consequence of which he was so opposed that after only three weeks possession he was compelled to resign A Yorkshire gentleman who has kindly sent me some additional information on this subject since the second edition of my work was published write thus The sole right of presentation to the incumbency of Haworth is vested in the Vicar of Bradford He only can present The funds however from which the clergyman s stipend mainly proceeds are vested in the hands of trustees who have the power to withhold them if a nominee is sent of whom they disapprove On the decease of mister Charnock the Vicar first tendered the preferment to mister Bronte and he went over to his expected cure He was told that towards himself they had no personal objection but as a nominee of the Vicar he would not be received He therefore retired with the declaration that if he could not come with the approval of the parish his ministry could not be useful Upon this the attempt was made to introduce mister Redhead When mister Redhead was repelled a fresh difficulty arose Some one must first move towards a settlement but a spirit being evoked which could not be allayed action became perplexing The matter had to be referred to some independent arbitrator and my father was the gentleman to whom each party turned its eye A meeting was convened and the business settled by the Vicar s conceding the choice to the trustees and the acceptance of the Vicar s presentation That choice forthwith fell on mister Bronte whose promptness and prudence had won their hearts In conversing on the character of the inhabitants of the West Riding with doctor Scoresby who had been for some time Vicar of Bradford he alluded to certain riotous transactions which had taken place at Haworth on the presentation of the living to mister Redhead and said that there had been so much in the particulars indicative of the character of the people that he advised me to inquire into them I have accordingly done so and from the lips of some of the survivors among the actors and spectators I have learnt the means taken to eject the nominee of the Vicar The previous incumbent had been the mister Charnock whom I have mentioned as next but one in succession to mister Grimshaw He had a long illness which rendered him unable to discharge his duties without assistance and mister Redhead gave him occasional help to the great satisfaction of the parishioners and was highly respected by them during mister Charnock s lifetime But the case was entirely altered when at mister Charnock s death in eighteen nineteen they conceived that the trustees had been unjustly deprived of their rights by the Vicar of Bradford who appointed mister Redhead as perpetual curate The first Sunday he officiated Haworth Church was filled even to the aisles most of the people wearing the wooden clogs of the district But while mister Redhead was reading the second lesson the whole congregation as by one impulse began to leave the church making all the noise they could with clattering and clumping of clogs till at length mister Redhead and the clerk were the only two left to continue the service This was bad enough but the next Sunday the proceedings were far worse Then as before the church was well filled but the aisles were left clear not a creature not an obstacle was in the way The reason for this was made evident about the same time in the reading of the service as the disturbances had begun the previous week A man rode into the church upon an ass with his face turned towards the tail and as many old hats piled on his head as he could possibly carry He began urging his beast round the aisles and the screams and cries and laughter of the congregation entirely drowned all sound of mister Redhead s voice and I believe he was obliged to desist Hitherto they had not proceeded to anything like personal violence but on the third Sunday they must have been greatly irritated at seeing mister Redhead determined to brave their will ride up the village street accompanied by several gentlemen from Bradford They put up their horses at the Black Bull the little inn close upon the churchyard for the convenience of arvills as well as for other purposes and went into church On this the people followed with a chimney sweeper whom they had employed to clean the chimneys of some out buildings belonging to the church that very morning and afterward plied with drink till he was in a state of solemn intoxication They placed him right before the reading desk where his blackened face nodded a drunken stupid assent to all that mister Redhead said At last either prompted by some mischief maker or from some tipsy impulse he clambered up the pulpit stairs and attempted to embrace mister Redhead Then the profane fun grew fast and furious Some of the more riotous pushed the soot covered chimney sweeper against mister Redhead as he tried to escape They threw both him and his tormentor down on the ground in the churchyard where the soot bag had been emptied and though at last mister Redhead escaped into the Black Bull the doors of which were immediately barred the people raged without threatening to stone him and his friends One of my informants is an old man who was the landlord of the inn at the time and he stands to it that such was the temper of the irritated mob that mister Redhead was in real danger of his life This man however planned an escape for his unpopular inmates The Black Bull is near the top of the long steep Haworth street and at the bottom close by the bridge on the road to Keighley is a turnpike Giving directions to his hunted guests to steal out at the back door through which probably many a ne er do weel has escaped from good mister Grimshaw s horsewhip the landlord and some of the stable boys rode the horses belonging to the party from Bradford backwards and forwards before his front door among the fiercely expectant crowd Through some opening between the houses those on the horses saw mister Redhead and his friends creeping along behind the street and then striking spurs they dashed quickly down to the turnpike the obnoxious clergyman and his friends mounted in haste and had sped some distance before the people found out that their prey had escaped and came running to the closed turnpike gate This was mister Redhead s last appearance at Haworth for many years Long afterwards he came to preach and in his sermon to a large and attentive congregation he good humouredly reminded them of the circumstances which I have described They gave him a hearty welcome for they owed him no grudge although before they had been ready enough to stone him in order to maintain what they considered to be their rights The foregoing account which I heard from two of the survivors in the presence of a friend who can vouch for the accuracy of my repetition has to a certain degree been confirmed by a letter from the Yorkshire gentleman whose words I have already quoted I am not surprised at your difficulty in authenticating matter of fact I find this in recalling what I have heard and the authority on which I have heard anything As to the donkey tale I believe you are right mister Redhead and doctor Ramsbotham his son in law are no strangers to me Each of them has a niche in my affections I have asked this day two persons who lived in Haworth at the time to which you allude the son and daughter of an acting trustee and each of them between sixty and seventy years of age and they assure me that the donkey was introduced One of them says it was mounted by a half witted man seated with his face towards the tail of the beast and having several hats piled on his head Neither of my informants was however present at these edifying services I believe that no movement was made in the church on either Sunday until the whole of the authorised reading service was gone through and I am sure that nothing was more remote from the more respectable party than any personal antagonism toward mister Redhead He was one of the most amiable and worthy of men a man to myself endeared by many ties and obligations I never heard before your book that the sweep ascended the pulpit steps He was present however in the clerical habiliments of his order I may also add that among the many who were present at those sad Sunday orgies the majority were non residents and came from those moorland fastnesses on the outskirts of the parish locally designated as ovver th steyres one stage more remote than Haworth from modern civilization To an instance or two more of the rusticity of the inhabitants of the chapelry of Haworth I may introduce you A Haworth carrier called at the office of a friend of mine to deliver a parcel on a cold winter s day and stood with the door open Robin shut the door said the recipient Have you no doors in your country Yoi responded Robin we hev but we nivver steik em I have frequently remarked the number of doors open even in winter When well directed the indomitable and independent energies of the natives of this part of the country are invaluable dangerous when perverted I shall never forget the fierce actions and utterances of one suffering from delirium tremens Whether in its wrath disdain or its dismay the countenance was infernal I called once upon a time on a most respectable yeoman and I was in language earnest and homely pressed to accept the hospitality of the house I consented The word to me was Nah Maister yah mun stop an hev sum te ah yah mun eah yah mun A bountiful table was soon spread at all events time soon went while I scaled the hills to see t maire at wor thretty year owd an t feil at wor fewer On sitting down to the table a venerable woman officiated and after filling the cups she thus addressed me Nah Maister yah mun loawze th taible loose the table The master said Shah meeans yah mun sey t greyce I took the hint and uttered the blessing I spoke with an aged and tried woman at one time who after recording her mercies stated among others her powers of speech by asserting Thank the Lord ah nivver wor a meilly meouthed wumman I feel particularly at fault in attempting the orthography of the dialect but must excuse myself by telling you that I once saw a letter in which the word I have just now used excuse was written ecksqueaize There are some things however which rather tend to soften the idea of the rudeness of Haworth No rural district has been more markedly the abode of musical taste and acquirement and this at a period when it was difficult to find them to the same extent apart from towns in advance of their times I have gone to Haworth and found an orchestra to meet me filled with local performers vocal and instrumental to whom the best works of Handel Haydn Mozart Marcello c c were familiar as household words By knowledge taste and voice they were markedly separate from ordinary village choirs and have been put in extensive requisition for the solo and chorus of many an imposing festival One man still survives who for fifty years has had one of the finest tenor voices I ever heard and with it a refined and cultivated taste To him and to others many inducements have been offered to migrate but the loom the association the mountain air have had charms enow to secure their continuance at home I love the recollection of their performance that recollection extends over more than sixty years The attachments the antipathies and the hospitalities of the district are ardent hearty and homely Cordiality in each is the prominent characteristic As a people these mountaineers have ever been accessible to gentleness and truth so far as I have known them but excite suspicion or resentment and they give emphatic and not impotent resistance Compulsion they defy I accompanied mister Heap on his first visit to Haworth after his accession to the vicarage of Bradford It was on Easter day either eighteen sixteen or eighteen seventeen His predecessor the venerable John Crosse known as the blind vicar had been inattentive to the vicarial claims A searching investigation had to be made and enforced and as it proceeded stout and sturdy utterances were not lacking on the part of the parishioners To a spectator though rude they were amusing and significant foretelling what might be expected and what was afterwards realised on the advent of a new incumbent if they deemed him an intruder From their peculiar parochial position and circumstances the inhabitants of the chapelry have been prompt earnest and persevering in their opposition to church rates Although ten miles from the mother church they were called upon to defray a large proportion of this obnoxious tax I believe one fifth Besides this they had to maintain their own edifice c c They resisted therefore with energy that which they deemed to be oppression and injustice By scores would they wend their way from the hills to attend a vestry meeting at Bradford and in such service failed not to show less of the suaviter in modo than the fortiter in re Happily such occasion for their action has not occurred for many years The use of patronymics has been common in this locality Inquire for a man by his Christian name and surname and you may have some difficulty in finding him ask however for George o Ned s or Dick o Bob s or Tom o Jack s as the case may be and your difficulty is at an end In many instances the person is designated by his residence In my early years I had occasion to inquire for Jonathan Whitaker who owned a considerable farm in the township I was sent hither and thither until it occurred to me to ask for Jonathan o th Gate My difficulties were then at an end Such circumstances arise out of the settled character and isolation of the natives Those who have witnessed a Haworth wedding when the parties were above the rank of labourers will not easily forget the scene A levy was made on the horses of the neighbourhood and a merry cavalcade of mounted men and women single or double traversed the way to Bradford church The inn and church appeared to be in natural connection and as the labours of the Temperance Society had then to begin the interests of sobriety were not always consulted On remounting their steeds they commenced with a race and not unfrequently an inebriate or unskilful horseman or woman was put hors de combat A race also was frequent at the end of these wedding expeditions from the bridge to the toll bar at Haworth The race course you will know to be anything but level Into the midst of this lawless yet not unkindly population mister Bronte brought his wife and six little children in February eighteen twenty There are those yet alive who remember seven heavily laden carts lumbering slowly up the long stone street bearing the new parson s household goods to his future abode One wonders how the bleak aspect of her new home the low oblong stone parsonage high up yet with a still higher back ground of sweeping moors struck on the gentle delicate wife whose health even then was failing CHAPTER III The reverend Patrick Bronte is a native of the County Down in Ireland His father Hugh Bronte was left an orphan at an early age He came from the south to the north of the island and settled in the parish of Ahaderg near Loughbrickland There was some family tradition that humble as Hugh Bronte s circumstances were he was the descendant of an ancient family But about this neither he nor his descendants have cared to inquire He made an early marriage and reared and educated ten children on the proceeds of the few acres of land which he farmed This large family were remarkable for great physical strength and much personal beauty Even in his old age mister Bronte is a striking looking man above the common height with a nobly shaped head and erect carriage In his youth he must have been unusually handsome He was born on Patrickmas day March seventeen seventeen seventy seven and early gave tokens of extraordinary quickness and intelligence He had also his full share of ambition and of his strong sense and forethought there is a proof in the fact that knowing that his father could afford him no pecuniary aid and that he must depend upon his own exertions he opened a public school at the early age of sixteen and this mode of living he continued to follow for five or six years He then became a tutor in the family of the reverend mister Tighe rector of Drumgooland parish Thence he proceeded to saint John s College Cambridge where he was entered in July eighteen oh two being at the time five and twenty years of age After nearly four years residence he obtained his B A degree and was ordained to a curacy in Essex whence he removed into Yorkshire The course of life of which this is the outline shows a powerful and remarkable character originating and pursuing a purpose in a resolute and independent manner Here is a youth a boy of sixteen separating himself from his family and determining to maintain himself and that not in the hereditary manner by agricultural pursuits but by the labour of his brain I suppose from what I have heard that mister Tighe became strongly interested in his children s tutor and may have aided him not only in the direction of his studies but in the suggestion of an English university education and in advice as to the mode in which he should obtain entrance there mister Bronte has now no trace of his Irish origin remaining in his speech he never could have shown his Celtic descent in the straight Greek lines and long oval of his face but at five and twenty fresh from the only life he had ever known to present himself at the gates of saint John s proved no little determination of will and scorn of ridicule While at Cambridge he became one of a corps of volunteers who were then being called out all over the country to resist the apprehended invasion by the French I have heard him allude in late years to Lord Palmerston as one who had often been associated with him then in the mimic military duties which they had to perform We take him up now settled as a curate at Hartshead in Yorkshire far removed from his birth place and all his Irish connections with whom indeed he cared little to keep up any intercourse and whom he never I believe revisited after becoming a student at Cambridge Hartshead is a very small village lying to the east of Huddersfield and Halifax and from its high situation on a mound as it were surrounded by a circular basin commanding a magnificent view mister Bronte resided here for five years and while the incumbent of Hartshead he wooed and married Maria Branwell She was the third daughter of mister Thomas Branwell merchant of Penzance Her mother s maiden name was Carne and both on father s and mother s side the Branwell family were sufficiently well descended to enable them to mix in the best society that Penzance then afforded mister and missus Branwell would be living their family of four daughters and one son still children during the existence of that primitive state of society which is well described by doctor Davy in the life of his brother In the same town when the population was about two thousand persons there was only one carpet the floors of rooms were sprinkled with sea sand and there was not a single silver fork At that time when our colonial possessions were very limited our army and navy on a small scale and there was comparatively little demand for intellect the younger sons of gentlemen were often of necessity brought up to some trade or mechanical art to which no discredit or loss of caste as it were was attached The eldest son if not allowed to remain an idle country squire was sent to Oxford or Cambridge preparatory to his engaging in one of the three liberal professions of divinity law or physic the second son was perhaps apprenticed to a surgeon or apothecary or a solicitor the third to a pewterer or watchmaker the fourth to a packer or mercer and so on were there more to be provided for After their apprenticeships were finished the young men almost invariably went to London to perfect themselves in their respective trade or art and on their return into the country when settled in business they were not excluded from what would now be considered genteel society Visiting then was conducted differently from what it is at present Dinner parties were almost unknown excepting at the annual feast time Christmas too was then a season of peculiar indulgence and conviviality and a round of entertainments was given consisting of tea and supper Excepting at these two periods visiting was almost entirely confined to tea parties which assembled at three o clock broke up at nine and the amusement of the evening was commonly some round game at cards as Pope Joan or Commerce The lower class was then extremely ignorant and all classes were very superstitious even the belief in witches maintained its ground and there was an almost unbounded credulity respecting the supernatural and monstrous There was scarcely a parish in the Mount s Bay that was without a haunted house or a spot to which some story of supernatural horror was not attached Even when I was a boy I remember a house in the best street of Penzance which was uninhabited because it was believed to be haunted and which young people walked by at night at a quickened pace and with a beating heart Amongst the middle and higher classes there was little taste for literature and still less for science and their pursuits were rarely of a dignified or intellectual kind Hunting shooting wrestling cock fighting generally ending in drunkenness were what they most delighted in Smuggling was carried on to a great extent and drunkenness and a low state of morals were naturally associated with it Whilst smuggling was the means of acquiring wealth to bold and reckless adventurers drunkenness and dissipation occasioned the ruin of many respectable families I have given this extract because I conceive it bears some reference to the life of Miss Bronte whose strong mind and vivid imagination must have received their first impressions either from the servants in that simple household almost friendly companions during the greater part of the day retailing the traditions or the news of Haworth village or from mister Bronte whose intercourse with his children appears to have been considerably restrained and whose life both in Ireland and at Cambridge had been spent under peculiar circumstances or from her aunt Miss Branwell who came to the parsonage when Charlotte was only six or seven years old to take charge of her dead sister s family This aunt was older than missus Bronte and had lived longer among the Penzance society which doctor Davy describes But in the Branwell family itself the violence and irregularity of nature did not exist They were Methodists and as far as I can gather a gentle and sincere piety gave refinement and purity of character mister Branwell the father according to his descendants account was a man of musical talent He and his wife lived to see all their children grown up and died within a year of each other he in eighteen oh eight she in eighteen oh nine when their daughter Maria was twenty five or twenty six years of age I have been permitted to look over a series of nine letters which were addressed by her to mister Bronte during the brief term of their engagement in eighteen twelve They are full of tender grace of expression and feminine modesty pervaded by the deep piety to which I have alluded as a family characteristic I shall make one or two extracts from them to show what sort of a person was the mother of Charlotte Bronte but first I must state the circumstances under which this Cornish lady met the scholar from Ahaderg near Loughbrickland In the early summer of eighteen twelve when she would be twenty nine she came to visit her uncle the Reverend John Fennel who was at that time a clergyman of the Church of England living near Leeds but who had previously been a Methodist minister mister Bronte was the incumbent of Hartshead and had the reputation in the neighbourhood of being a very handsome fellow full of Irish enthusiasm and with something of an Irishman s capability of falling easily in love Miss Branwell was extremely small in person not pretty but very elegant and always dressed with a quiet simplicity of taste which accorded well with her general character and of which some of the details call to mind the style of dress preferred by her daughter for her favourite heroines mister Bronte was soon captivated by the little gentle creature and this time declared that it was for life In her first letter to him dated August twenty sixth she seems almost surprised to find herself engaged and alludes to the short time which she has known him In the rest there are touches reminding one of Juliet s But trust me gentleman I ll prove more true Than those that have more cunning to be strange There are plans for happy pic nic parties to Kirkstall Abbey in the glowing September days when Uncle Aunt and Cousin Jane the last engaged to a mister Morgan another clergyman were of the party all since dead except mister Bronte There was no opposition on the part of any of her friends to her engagement mister and missus Fennel sanctioned it and her brother and sisters in far away Penzance appear fully to have approved of it In a letter dated September eighteenth she says For some years I have been perfectly my own mistress subject to no control whatever so far from it that my sisters who are many years older than myself and even my dear mother used to consult me on every occasion of importance and scarcely ever doubted the propriety of my opinions and actions perhaps you will be ready to accuse me of vanity in mentioning this but you must consider that I do not boast of it I have many times felt it a disadvantage and although I thank God it has never led me into error yet in circumstances of uncertainty and doubt I have deeply felt the want of a guide and instructor In the same letter she tells mister Bronte that she has informed her sisters of her engagement and that she should not see them again so soon as she had intended mister Fennel her uncle also writes to them by the same post in praise of mister Bronte The journey from Penzance to Leeds in those days was both very long and very expensive the lovers had not much money to spend in unnecessary travelling and as Miss Branwell had neither father nor mother living it appeared both a discreet and seemly arrangement that the marriage should take place from her uncle s house There was no reason either why the engagement should be prolonged They were past their first youth they had means sufficient for their unambitious wants the living of Hartshead is rated in the Clergy List at two hundred two l per annum and she was in the receipt of a small annuity fifty l I have been told by the will of her father So at the end of September the lovers began to talk about taking a house for I suppose that mister Bronte up to that time had been in lodgings and all went smoothly and successfully with a view to their marriage in the ensuing winter until November when a misfortune happened which she thus patiently and prettily describes I suppose you never expected to be much the richer for me but I am sorry to inform you that I am still poorer than I thought myself I mentioned having sent for my books clothes c On Saturday evening about the time when you were writing the description of your imaginary shipwreck I was reading and feeling the effects of a real one having then received a letter from my sister giving me an account of the vessel in which she had sent my box being stranded on the coast of Devonshire in consequence of which the box was dashed to pieces with the violence of the sea and all my little property with the exception of a very few articles being swallowed up in the mighty deep If this should not prove the prelude to something worse I shall think little of it as it is the first disastrous circumstance which has occurred since I left my home The last of these letters is dated December the fifth Miss Branwell and her cousin intended to set about making the wedding cake in the following week so the marriage could not be far off She had been learning by heart a pretty little hymn of mister Bronte s composing and reading Lord Lyttelton s Advice to a Lady on which she makes some pertinent and just remarks showing that she thought as well as read And so Maria Branwell fades out of sight we have no more direct intercourse with her we hear of her as missus Bronte but it is as an invalid not far from death still patient cheerful and pious The writing of these letters is elegant and neat while there are allusions to household occupations such as making the wedding cake there are also allusions to the books she has read or is reading showing a well cultivated mind Without having anything of her daughter s rare talents missus Bronte must have been I imagine that unusual character a well balanced and consistent woman The style of the letters is easy and good as is also that of a paper from the same hand entitled The Advantages of Poverty in Religious Concerns which was written rather later with a view to publication in some periodical She was married from her uncle s house in Yorkshire on the twenty ninth of December eighteen twelve the same day was also the wedding day of her younger sister Charlotte Branwell in distant Penzance I do not think that missus Bronte ever revisited Cornwall but she has left a very pleasant impression on the minds of those relations who yet survive they speak of her as their favourite aunt and one to whom they as well as all the family looked up as a person of talent and great amiability of disposition and again as meek and retiring while possessing more than ordinary talents which she inherited from her father and her piety was genuine and unobtrusive mister Bronte remained for five years at Hartshead in the parish of Dewsbury There he was married and his two children Maria and Elizabeth were born At the expiration of that period he had the living of Thornton in Bradford Parish Some of those great West Riding parishes are almost like bishoprics for their amount of population and number of churches Thornton church is a little episcopal chapel of ease rich in Nonconformist monuments as of Accepted Lister and his friend doctor Hall The neighbourhood is desolate and wild great tracts of bleak land enclosed by stone dykes sweeping up Clayton heights The church itself looks ancient and solitary and as if left behind by the great stone mills of a flourishing Independent firm and the solid square chapel built by the members of that denomination Altogether not so pleasant a place as Hartshead with its ample outlook over cloud shadowed sun flecked plain and hill rising beyond hill to form the distant horizon Here at Thornton Charlotte Bronte was born on the twenty first of April eighteen sixteen Fast on her heels followed Patrick Branwell Emily Jane and Anne After the birth of this last daughter missus Bronte s health began to decline It is hard work to provide for the little tender wants of many young children where the means are but limited The necessaries of food and clothing are much more easily supplied than the almost equal necessaries of attendance care soothing amusement and sympathy Maria Bronte the eldest of six could only have been a few months more than six years old when mister Bronte removed to Haworth on February the twenty fifth eighteen twenty Those who knew her then describe her as grave thoughtful and quiet to a degree far beyond her years Her childhood was no childhood the cases are rare in which the possessors of great gifts have known the blessings of that careless happy time their unusual powers stir within them and instead of the natural life of perception the objective as the Germans call it they begin the deeper life of reflection the subjective Little Maria Bronte was delicate and small in appearance which seemed to give greater effect to her wonderful precocity of intellect She must have been her mother s companion and helpmate in many a household and nursery experience for mister Bronte was of course much engaged in his study and besides he was not naturally fond of children and felt their frequent appearance on the scene as a drag both on his wife s strength and as an interruption to the comfort of the household Haworth Parsonage is as I mentioned in the first chapter an oblong stone house facing down the hill on which the village stands and with the front door right opposite to the western door of the church distant about a hundred yards Of this space twenty yards or so in depth are occupied by the grassy garden which is scarcely wider than the house The graveyard lies on two sides of the house and garden The house consists of four rooms on each floor and is two stories high When the Brontes took possession they made the larger parlour to the left of the entrance the family sitting room while that on the right was appropriated to mister Bronte as a study Behind this was the kitchen behind the former a sort of flagged store room Upstairs were four bed chambers of similar size with the addition of a small apartment over the passage or lobby as we call it in the north This was to the front the staircase going up right opposite to the entrance There is the pleasant old fashion of window seats all through the house and one can see that the parsonage was built in the days when wood was plentiful as the massive stair banisters and the wainscots and the heavy window frames testify This little extra upstairs room was appropriated to the children Small as it was it was not called a nursery indeed it had not the comfort of a fire place in it the servants two affectionate warm hearted sisters who cannot now speak of the family without tears called the room the children s study The age of the eldest student was perhaps by this time seven The people in Haworth were none of them very poor Many of them were employed in the neighbouring worsted mills a few were mill owners and manufacturers in a small way there were also some shopkeepers for the humbler and everyday wants but for medical advice for stationery books law dress or dainties the inhabitants had to go to Keighley There were several Sunday schools the Baptists had taken the lead in instituting them the Wesleyans had followed the Church of England had brought up the rear Good mister Grimshaw Wesley s friend had built a humble Methodist chapel but it stood close to the road leading on to the moor the Baptists then raised a place of worship with the distinction of being a few yards back from the highway and the Methodists have since thought it well to erect another and a larger chapel still more retired from the road mister Bronte was ever on kind and friendly terms with each denomination as a body but from individuals in the village the family stood aloof unless some direct service was required from the first They kept themselves very close is the account given by those who remember mister and missus Bronte s coming amongst them I believe many of the Yorkshiremen would object to the system of parochial visiting their surly independence would revolt from the idea of any one having a right from his office to inquire into their condition to counsel or to admonish them The old hill spirit lingers in them which coined the rhyme inscribed on the under part of one of the seats in the Sedilia of Whalley Abbey not many miles from Haworth Who mells wi what another does Had best go home and shoe his goose I asked an inhabitant of a district close to Haworth what sort of a clergyman they had at the church which he attended A rare good one said he he minds his own business and ne er troubles himself with ours mister Bronte was faithful in visiting the sick and all those who sent for him and diligent in attendance at the schools and so was his daughter Charlotte too but cherishing and valuing privacy themselves they were perhaps over delicate in not intruding upon the privacy of others From their first going to Haworth their walks were directed rather out towards the heathery moors sloping upwards behind the parsonage than towards the long descending village street A good old woman who came to nurse missus Bronte in the illness an internal cancer which grew and gathered upon her not many months after her arrival at Haworth tells me that at that time the six little creatures used to walk out hand in hand towards the glorious wild moors which in after days they loved so passionately the elder ones taking thoughtful care for the toddling wee things They were grave and silent beyond their years subdued probably by the presence of serious illness in the house for at the time which my informant speaks of missus Bronte was confined to the bedroom from which she never came forth alive You would not have known there was a child in the house they were such still noiseless good little creatures Maria would shut herself up Maria but seven in the children s study with a newspaper and be able to tell one everything when she came out debates in Parliament and I don t know what all She was as good as a mother to her sisters and brother But there never were such good children I used to think them spiritless they were so different to any children I had ever seen They were good little creatures Emily was the prettiest missus Bronte was the same patient cheerful person as we have seen her formerly very ill suffering great pain but seldom if ever complaining at her better times begging her nurse to raise her in bed to let her see her clean the grate because she did it as it was done in Cornwall devotedly fond of her husband who warmly repaid her affection and suffered no one else to take the night nursing but according to my informant the mother was not very anxious to see much of her children probably because the sight of them knowing how soon they were to be left motherless would have agitated her too much So the little things clung quietly together for their father was busy in his study and in his parish or with their mother and they took their meals alone sat reading or whispering low in the children s study or wandered out on the hill side hand in hand The ideas of Rousseau and mister Day on education had filtered down through many classes and spread themselves widely out I imagine mister Bronte must have formed some of his opinions on the management of children from these two theorists His practice was not half so wild or extraordinary as that to which an aunt of mine was subjected by a disciple of mister Day s She had been taken by this gentleman and his wife to live with them as their adopted child perhaps about five and twenty years before the time of which I am writing They were wealthy people and kind hearted but her food and clothing were of the very simplest and rudest description on Spartan principles A healthy merry child she did not much care for dress or eating but the treatment which she felt as a real cruelty was this They had a carriage in which she and the favourite dog were taken an airing on alternate days the creature whose turn it was to be left at home being tossed in a blanket an operation which my aunt especially dreaded Her affright at the tossing was probably the reason why it was persevered in Dressed up ghosts had become common and she did not care for them so the blanket exercise was to be the next mode of hardening her nerves It is well known that mister Day broke off his intention of marrying Sabrina the girl whom he had educated for this purpose because within a few weeks of the time fixed for the wedding she was guilty of the frivolity while on a visit from home of wearing thin sleeves Yet mister Day and my aunt s relations were benevolent people only strongly imbued with the crotchet that by a system of training might be educed the hardihood and simplicity of the ideal savage forgetting the terrible isolation of feelings and habits which their pupils would experience in the future life which they must pass among the corruptions and refinements of civilization mister Bronte wished to make his children hardy and indifferent to the pleasures of eating and dress In the latter he succeeded as far as regarded his daughters His strong passionate Irish nature was in general compressed down with resolute stoicism but it was there notwithstanding all his philosophic calm and dignity of demeanour though he did not speak when he was annoyed or displeased missus Bronte whose sweet nature thought invariably of the bright side would say Ought I not to be thankful that he never gave me an angry word mister Bronte was an active walker stretching away over the moors for many miles noting in his mind all natural signs of wind and weather and keenly observing all the wild creatures that came and went in the loneliest sweeps of the hills He has seen eagles stooping low in search of food for their young no eagle is ever seen on those mountain slopes now He fearlessly took whatever side in local or national politics appeared to him right In the days of the Luddites he had been for the peremptory interference of the law at a time when no magistrate could be found to act and all the property of the West Riding was in terrible danger He became unpopular then among the millworkers and he esteemed his life unsafe if he took his long and lonely walks unarmed so he began the habit which has continued to this day of invariably carrying a loaded pistol about with him It lay on his dressing table with his watch with his watch it was put on in the morning with his watch it was taken off at night Many years later during his residence at Haworth there was a strike the hands in the neighbourhood felt themselves aggrieved by the masters and refused to work mister Bronte thought that they had been unjustly and unfairly treated and he assisted them by all the means in his power to keep the wolf from their doors and avoid the incubus of debt Several of the more influential inhabitants of Haworth and the neighbourhood were mill owners they remonstrated pretty sharply with him but he believed that his conduct was right and persevered in it His opinions might be often both wild and erroneous his principles of action eccentric and strange his views of life partial and almost misanthropical but not one opinion that he held could be stirred or modified by any worldly motive he acted up to his principles of action and if any touch of misanthropy mingled with his view of mankind in general his conduct to the individuals who came in personal contact with him did not agree with such view It is true that he had strong and vehement prejudices and was obstinate in maintaining them and that he was not dramatic enough in his perceptions to see how miserable others might be in a life that to him was all sufficient But I do not pretend to be able to harmonize points of character and account for them and bring them all into one consistent and intelligible whole The family with whom I have now to do shot their roots down deeper than I can penetrate I cannot measure them much less is it for me to judge them I have named these instances of eccentricity in the father because I hold the knowledge of them to be necessary for a right understanding of the life of his daughter missus Bronte died in September eighteen twenty one and the lives of those quiet children must have become quieter and lonelier still Charlotte tried hard in after years to recall the remembrance of her mother and could bring back two or three pictures of her One was when sometime in the evening light she had been playing with her little boy Patrick Branwell in the parlour of Haworth Parsonage But the recollections of four or five years old are of a very fragmentary character Owing to some illness of the digestive organs mister Bronte was obliged to be very careful about his diet and in order to avoid temptation and possibly to have the quiet necessary for digestion he had begun before his wife s death to take his dinner alone a habit which he always retained He did not require companionship therefore he did not seek it either in his walks or in his daily life The quiet regularity of his domestic hours was only broken in upon by church wardens and visitors on parochial business and sometimes by a neighbouring clergyman who came down the hills across the moors to mount up again to Haworth Parsonage and spend an evening there But owing to missus Bronte s death so soon after her husband had removed into the district and also to the distances and the bleak country to be traversed the wives of these clerical friends did not accompany their husbands and the daughters grew up out of childhood into girlhood bereft in a singular manner of all such society as would have been natural to their age sex and station But the children did not want society To small infantine gaieties they were unaccustomed They were all in all to each other I do not suppose that there ever was a family more tenderly bound to each other Maria read the newspapers and reported intelligence to her younger sisters which it is wonderful they could take an interest in But I suspect that they had no children s books and that their eager minds browzed undisturbed among the wholesome pasturage of English literature as Charles Lamb expresses it The servants of the household appear to have been much impressed with the little Brontes extraordinary cleverness In a letter which I had from him on this subject their father writes The servants often said that they had never seen such a clever little child as Charlotte and that they were obliged to be on their guard as to what they said and did before her Yet she and the servants always lived on good terms with each other These servants are yet alive elderly women residing in Bradford They retain a faithful and fond recollection of Charlotte and speak of her unvarying kindness from the time when she was ever such a little child when she would not rest till she had got the old disused cradle sent from the parsonage to the house where the parents of one of them lived to serve for a little infant sister They tell of one long series of kind and thoughtful actions from this early period to the last weeks of Charlotte Bronte s life and though she had left her place many years ago one of these former servants went over from Bradford to Haworth on purpose to see mister Bronte and offer him her true sympathy when his last child died I may add a little anecdote as a testimony to the admirable character of the likeness of Miss Bronte prefixed to this volume A gentleman who had kindly interested himself in the preparation of this memoir took the first volume shortly after the publication to the house of this old servant in order to show her the portrait The moment she caught a glimpse of the frontispiece There she is in a minute she exclaimed Come John look to her husband and her daughter was equally struck by the resemblance There might not be many to regard the Brontes with affection but those who once loved them loved them long and well I return to the father s letter He says When mere children as soon as they could read and write Charlotte and her brothers and sisters used to invent and act little plays of their own in which the Duke of Wellington my daughter Charlotte s hero was sure to come off conqueror when a dispute would not unfrequently arise amongst them regarding the comparative merits of him Buonaparte Hannibal and Caesar When the argument got warm and rose to its height as their mother was then dead I had sometimes to come in as arbitrator and settle the dispute according to the best of my judgment Generally in the management of these concerns I frequently thought that I discovered signs of rising talent which I had seldom or never before seen in any of their age A circumstance now occurs to my mind which I may as well mention When my children were very young when as far as I can remember the oldest was about ten years of age and the youngest about four thinking that they knew more than I had yet discovered in order to make them speak with less timidity I deemed that if they were put under a sort of cover I might gain my end and happening to have a mask in the house I told them all to stand and speak boldly from under cover of the mask I began with the youngest Anne afterwards Acton Bell and asked what a child like her most wanted she answered Age and experience I asked the next Emily afterwards Ellis Bell what I had best do with her brother Branwell who was sometimes a naughty boy she answered Reason with him and when he won t listen to reason whip him I asked Branwell what was the best way of knowing the difference between the intellects of man and woman he answered By considering the difference between them as to their bodies I then asked Charlotte what was the best book in the world she answered The Bible And what was the next best she answered The Book of Nature I then asked the next what was the best mode of education for a woman she answered That which would make her rule her house well Lastly I asked the oldest what was the best mode of spending time she answered By laying it out in preparation for a happy eternity I may not have given precisely their words but I have nearly done so as they made a deep and lasting impression on my memory The substance however was exactly what I have stated The strange and quaint simplicity of the mode taken by the father to ascertain the hidden characters of his children and the tone and character of these questions and answers show the curious education which was made by the circumstances surrounding the Brontes They knew no other children They knew no other modes of thought than what were suggested to them by the fragments of clerical conversation which they overheard in the parlour or the subjects of village and local interest which they heard discussed in the kitchen Each had their own strong characteristic flavour They took a vivid interest in the public characters and the local and the foreign as well as home politics discussed in the newspapers Long before Maria Bronte died at the age of eleven her father used to say he could converse with her on any of the leading topics of the day with as much freedom and pleasure as with any grown up person CHAPTER IV About a year after missus Bronte s death an elder sister as I have before mentioned came from Penzance to superintend her brother in law s household and look after his children Miss Branwell was I believe a kindly and conscientious woman with a good deal of character but with the somewhat narrow ideas natural to one who had spent nearly all her life in the same place She had strong prejudices and soon took a distaste to Yorkshire From Penzance where plants which we in the north call greenhouse flowers grow in great profusion and without any shelter even in the winter and where the soft warm climate allows the inhabitants if so disposed to live pretty constantly in the open air it was a great change for a lady considerably past forty to come and take up her abode in a place where neither flowers nor vegetables would flourish and where a tree of even moderate dimensions might be hunted for far and wide where the snow lay long and late on the moors stretching bleakly and barely far up from the dwelling which was henceforward to be her home and where often on autumnal or winter nights the four winds of heaven seemed to meet and rage together tearing round the house as if they were wild beasts striving to find an entrance She missed the small round of cheerful social visiting perpetually going on in a country town she missed the friends she had known from her childhood some of whom had been her parents friends before they were hers she disliked many of the customs of the place and particularly dreaded the cold damp arising from the flag floors in the passages and parlours of Haworth Parsonage The stairs too I believe are made of stone and no wonder when stone quarries are near and trees are far to seek I have heard that Miss Branwell always went about the house in pattens clicking up and down the stairs from her dread of catching cold For the same reason in the latter years of her life she passed nearly all her time and took most of her meals in her bedroom The children respected her and had that sort of affection for her which is generated by esteem but I do not think they ever freely loved her It was a severe trial for any one at her time of life to change neighbourhood and habitation so entirely as she did and the greater her merit I do not know whether Miss Branwell taught her nieces anything besides sewing and the household arts in which Charlotte afterwards was such an adept Their regular lessons were said to their father and they were always in the habit of picking up an immense amount of miscellaneous information for themselves But a year or so before this time a school had been begun in the North of England for the daughters of clergymen The place was Cowan Bridge a small hamlet on the coach road between Leeds and Kendal and thus easy of access from Haworth as the coach ran daily and one of its stages was at Keighley The yearly expense for each pupil according to the entrance rules given in the Report for eighteen forty two and I believe they had not been increased since the establishment of the schools in eighteen twenty three was as follows Rule eleven The terms for clothing lodging boarding and educating are fourteen l a year half to be paid in advance when the pupils are sent and also one l entrance money for the use of books c The system of education comprehends history geography the use of the globes grammar writing and arithmetic all kinds of needlework and the nicer kinds of household work such as getting up fine linen ironing c If accomplishments are required an additional charge of three l a year is made for music or drawing each Rule third requests that the friends will state the line of education desired in the case of every pupil having a regard to her future prospects Rule fourth states the clothing and toilette articles which a girl is expected to bring with her and thus concludes The pupils all appear in the same dress They wear plain straw cottage bonnets in summer white frocks on Sundays and nankeen on other days in winter purple stuff frocks and purple cloth cloaks For the sake of uniformity therefore they are required to bring three l in lieu of frocks pelisse bonnet tippet and frills making the whole sum which each pupil brings with her to the school seven l half year in advance one l entrance for books one l entrance for clothes The eighth rule is All letters and parcels are inspected by the superintendent but this is a very prevalent regulation in all young ladies schools where I think it is generally understood that the schoolmistress may exercise this privilege although it is certainly unwise in her to insist too frequently upon it There is nothing at all remarkable in any of the other regulations a copy of which was doubtless in mister Bronte s hands when he formed the determination to send his daughters to Cowan Bridge School and he accordingly took Maria and Elizabeth thither in July eighteen twenty four I now come to a part of my subject which I find great difficulty in treating because the evidence relating to it on each side is so conflicting that it seems almost impossible to arrive at the truth Miss Bronte more than once said to me that she should not have written what she did of Lowood in Jane Eyre if she had thought the place would have been so immediately identified with Cowan Bridge although there was not a word in her account of the institution but what was true at the time when she knew it she also said that she had not considered it necessary in a work of fiction to state every particular with the impartiality that might be required in a court of justice nor to seek out motives and make allowances for human failings as she might have done if dispassionately analysing the conduct of those who had the superintendence of the institution I believe she herself would have been glad of an opportunity to correct the over strong impression which was made upon the public mind by her vivid picture though even she suffering her whole life long both in heart and body from the consequences of what happened there might have been apt to the last to take her deep belief in facts for the facts themselves her conception of truth for the absolute truth In some of the notices of the previous editions of this work it is assumed that I derived the greater part of my information with regard to her sojourn at Cowan Bridge from Charlotte Bronte herself I never heard her speak of the place but once and that was on the second day of my acquaintance with her A little child on that occasion expressed some reluctance to finish eating his piece of bread at dinner and she stooping down and addressing him in a low voice told him how thankful she should have been at his age for a piece of bread and when we though I am not sure if I myself spoke asked her some question as to the occasion she alluded to she replied with reserve and hesitation evidently shying away from what she imagined might lead to too much conversation on one of her books She spoke of the oat cake at Cowan Bridge the clap bread of Westmorland as being different to the leaven raised oat cake of Yorkshire and of her childish distaste for it Some one present made an allusion to a similar childish dislike in the true tale of The terrible knitters o Dent given in Southey s Common place Book and she smiled faintly but said that the mere difference in food was not all that the food itself was spoilt by the dirty carelessness of the cook so that she and her sisters disliked their meals exceedingly and she named her relief and gladness when the doctor condemned the meat and spoke of having seen him spit it out These are all the details I ever heard from her She so avoided particularizing that I think mister Carus Wilson s name never passed between us I do not doubt the general accuracy of my informants of those who have given and solemnly repeated the details that follow but it is only just to Miss Bronte to say that I have stated above pretty nearly all that I ever heard on the subject from her A clergyman living near Kirby Lonsdale the Reverend William Carus Wilson was the prime mover in the establishment of this school He was an energetic man sparing no labour for the accomplishment of his ends He saw that it was an extremely difficult task for clergymen with limited incomes to provide for the education of their children and he devised a scheme by which a certain sum was raised annually by subscription to complete the amount required to furnish a solid and sufficient English education for which the parent s payment of fourteen l a year would not have been sufficient Indeed that made by the parents was considered to be exclusively appropriated to the expenses of lodging and boarding and the education provided for by the subscriptions Twelve trustees were appointed mister Wilson being not only a trustee but the treasurer and secretary in fact taking most of the business arrangements upon himself a responsibility which appropriately fell to him as he lived nearer the school than any one else who was interested in it So his character for prudence and judgment was to a certain degree implicated in the success or failure of Cowan Bridge School and the working of it was for many years the great object and interest of his life But he was apparently unacquainted with the prime element in good administration seeking out thoroughly competent persons to fill each department and then making them responsible for and judging them by the result without perpetual interference with the details So great was the amount of good which mister Wilson did by his constant unwearied superintendence that I cannot help feeling sorry that in his old age and declining health the errors which he was believed to have committed should have been brought up against him in a form which received such wonderful force from the touch of Miss Bronte s great genius No doubt whatever can be entertained of the deep interest which he felt in the success of the school As I write I have before me his last words on giving up the secretaryship in eighteen fifty he speaks of the withdrawal from declining health of an eye which at all events has loved to watch over the schools with an honest and anxious interest and again he adds that he resigns therefore with a desire to be thankful for all that God has been pleased to accomplish through his instrumentality the infirmities and unworthinesses of which he deeply feels and deplores Cowan Bridge is a cluster of some six or seven cottages gathered together at both ends of a bridge over which the high road from Leeds to Kendal crosses a little stream called the Leck This high road is nearly disused now but formerly when the buyers from the West Riding manufacturing districts had frequent occasion to go up into the North to purchase the wool of the Westmorland and Cumberland farmers it was doubtless much travelled and perhaps the hamlet of Cowan Bridge had a more prosperous look than it bears at present It is prettily situated just where the Leck fells swoop into the plain and by the course of the beck alder trees and willows and hazel bushes grow The current of the stream is interrupted by broken pieces of grey rock and the waters flow over a bed of large round white pebbles which a flood heaves up and moves on either side out of its impetuous way till in some parts they almost form a wall By the side of the little shallow sparkling vigorous Leck run long pasture fields of the fine short grass common in high land for though Cowan Bridge is situated on a plain it is a plain from which there is many a fall and long descent before you and the Leck reach the valley of the Lune I can hardly understand how the school there came to be so unhealthy the air all round about was so sweet and thyme scented when I visited it last summer But at this day every one knows that the site of a building intended for numbers should be chosen with far greater care than that of a private dwelling from the tendency to illness both infectious and otherwise produced by the congregation of people in close proximity The house is still remaining that formed part of that occupied by the school It is a long bow windowed cottage now divided into two dwellings It stands facing the Leck between which and it intervenes a space about seventy yards deep that was once the school garden This original house was an old dwelling of the Picard family which they had inhabited for two generations They sold it for school purposes and an additional building was erected running at right angles from the older part This new part was devoted expressly to schoolrooms dormitories c and after the school was removed to Casterton it was used for a bobbin mill connected with the stream where wooden reels were made out of the alders which grow profusely in such ground as that surrounding Cowan Bridge This mill is now destroyed The present cottage was at the time of which I write occupied by the teachers rooms the dinner room and kitchens and some smaller bedrooms On going into this building I found one part that nearest to the high road converted into a poor kind of public house then to let and having all the squalid appearance of a deserted place which rendered it difficult to judge what it would look like when neatly kept up the broken panes replaced in the windows and the rough cast now cracked and discoloured made white and whole The other end forms a cottage with the low ceilings and stone floors of a hundred years ago the windows do not open freely and widely and the passage upstairs leading to the bedrooms is narrow and tortuous altogether smells would linger about the house and damp cling to it But sanitary matters were little understood thirty years ago and it was a great thing to get a roomy building close to the high road and not too far from the habitation of mister Wilson the originator of the educational scheme There was much need of such an institution numbers of ill paid clergymen hailed the prospect with joy and eagerly put down the names of their children as pupils when the establishment should be ready to receive them mister Wilson was no doubt pleased by the impatience with which the realisation of his idea was anticipated and opened the school with less than a hundred pounds in hand and with pupils the number of whom varies according to different accounts mister W W Carus Wilson the son of the founder giving it as seventy while mister Shepheard the son in law states it to have been only sixteen mister Wilson felt most probably that the responsibility of the whole plan rested upon him The payment made by the parents was barely enough for food and lodging the subscriptions did not flow very freely into an untried scheme and great economy was necessary in all the domestic arrangements He determined to enforce this by frequent personal inspection carried perhaps to an unnecessary extent and leading occasionally to a meddling with little matters which had sometimes the effect of producing irritation of feeling Yet although there was economy in providing for the household there does not appear to have been any parsimony The meat flour milk c were contracted for but were of very fair quality and the dietary which has been shown to me in manuscript was neither bad nor unwholesome nor on the whole was it wanting in variety Oatmeal porridge for breakfast a piece of oat cake for those who required luncheon baked and boiled beef and mutton potato pie and plain homely puddings of different kinds for dinner At five o clock bread and milk for the younger ones and one piece of bread this was the only time at which the food was limited for the elder pupils who sat up till a later meal of the same description mister Wilson himself ordered in the food and was anxious that it should be of good quality But the cook who had much of his confidence and against whom for a long time no one durst utter a complaint was careless dirty and wasteful To some children oatmeal porridge is distasteful and consequently unwholesome even when properly made at Cowan Bridge School it was too often sent up not merely burnt but with offensive fragments of other substances discoverable in it The beef that should have been carefully salted before it was dressed had often become tainted from neglect and girls who were school fellows with the Brontes during the reign of the cook of whom I am speaking tell me that the house seemed to be pervaded morning noon and night by the odour of rancid fat that steamed out of the oven in which much of their food was prepared There was the same carelessness in making the puddings one of those ordered was rice boiled in water and eaten with a sauce of treacle and sugar but it was often uneatable because the water had been taken out of the rain tub and was strongly impregnated with the dust lodging on the roof whence it had trickled down into the old wooden cask which also added its own flavour to that of the original rain water The milk too was often bingy to use a country expression for a kind of taint that is far worse than sourness and suggests the idea that it is caused by want of cleanliness about the milk pans rather than by the heat of the weather On Saturdays a kind of pie or mixture of potatoes and meat was served up which was made of all the fragments accumulated during the week Scraps of meat from a dirty and disorderly larder could never be very appetizing and I believe that this dinner was more loathed than any in the early days of Cowan Bridge School One may fancy how repulsive such fare would be to children whose appetites were small and who had been accustomed to food far simpler perhaps but prepared with a delicate cleanliness that made it both tempting and wholesome At many a meal the little Brontes went without food although craving with hunger They were not strong when they came having only just recovered from a complication of measles and hooping cough indeed I suspect they had scarcely recovered for there was some consultation on the part of the school authorities whether Maria and Elizabeth should be received or not in July eighteen twenty four mister Bronte came again in the September of that year bringing with him Charlotte and Emily to be admitted as pupils It appears strange that mister Wilson should not have been informed by the teachers of the way in which the food was served up but we must remember that the cook had been known for some time to the Wilson family while the teachers were brought together for an entirely different work that of education They were expressly given to understand that such was their department the buying in and management of the provisions rested with mister Wilson and the cook The teachers would of course be unwilling to lay any complaints on the subject before him There was another trial of health common to all the girls The path from Cowan Bridge to Tunstall Church where mister Wilson preached and where they all attended on the Sunday is more than two miles in length and goes sweeping along the rise and fall of the unsheltered country in a way to make it a fresh and exhilarating walk in summer but a bitter cold one in winter especially to children like the delicate little Brontes whose thin blood flowed languidly in consequence of their feeble appetites rejecting the food prepared for them and thus inducing a half starved condition The church was not warmed there being no means for this purpose It stands in the midst of fields and the damp mist must have gathered round the walls and crept in at the windows The girls took their cold dinner with them and ate it between the services in a chamber over the entrance opening out of the former galleries The arrangements for this day were peculiarly trying to delicate children particularly to those who were spiritless and longing for home as poor Maria Bronte must have been for her ill health was increasing and the old cough the remains of the hooping cough lingered about her She was far superior in mind to any of her play fellows and companions and was lonely amongst them from that very cause and yet she had faults so annoying that she was in constant disgrace with her teachers and an object of merciless dislike to one of them who is depicted as Miss Scatcherd in Jane Eyre and whose real name I will be merciful enough not to disclose I need hardly say that Helen Burns is as exact a transcript of Maria Bronte as Charlotte s wonderful power of reproducing character could give Her heart to the latest day on which we met still beat with unavailing indignation at the worrying and the cruelty to which her gentle patient dying sister had been subjected by this woman Not a word of that part of Jane Eyre but is a literal repetition of scenes between the pupil and the teacher Those who had been pupils at the same time knew who must have written the book from the force with which Helen Burns sufferings are described They had before that recognised the description of the sweet dignity and benevolence of Miss Temple as only a just tribute to the merits of one whom all that knew her appear to hold in honour but when Miss Scatcherd was held up to opprobrium they also recognised in the writer of Jane Eyre an unconsciously avenging sister of the sufferer One of their fellow pupils among other statements even worse gives me the following The dormitory in which Maria slept was a long room holding a row of narrow little beds on each side occupied by the pupils and at the end of this dormitory there was a small bed chamber opening out of it appropriated to the use of Miss Scatcherd Maria s bed stood nearest to the door of this room One morning after she had become so seriously unwell as to have had a blister applied to her side the sore from which was not perfectly healed when the getting up bell was heard poor Maria moaned out that she was so ill so very ill she wished she might stop in bed and some of the girls urged her to do so and said they would explain it all to Miss Temple the superintendent But Miss Scatcherd was close at hand and her anger would have to be faced before Miss Temple s kind thoughtfulness could interfere so the sick child began to dress shivering with cold as without leaving her bed she slowly put on her black worsted stockings over her thin white legs my informant spoke as if she saw it yet and her whole face flushed out undying indignation Just then Miss Scatcherd issued from her room and without asking for a word of explanation from the sick and frightened girl she took her by the arm on the side to which the blister had been applied and by one vigorous movement whirled her out into the middle of the floor abusing her all the time for dirty and untidy habits There she left her My informant says Maria hardly spoke except to beg some of the more indignant girls to be calm but in slow trembling movements with many a pause she went down stairs at last and was punished for being late Any one may fancy how such an event as this would rankle in Charlotte s mind I only wonder that she did not remonstrate against her father s decision to send her and Emily back to Cowan Bridge after Maria s and Elizabeth s deaths But frequently children are unconscious of the effect which some of their simple revelations would have in altering the opinions entertained by their friends of the persons placed around them Besides Charlotte s earnest vigorous mind saw at an unusually early age the immense importance of education as furnishing her with tools which she had the strength and the will to wield and she would be aware that the Cowan Bridge education was in many points the best that her father could provide for her Before Maria Bronte s death that low fever broke out in the spring of eighteen twenty five which is spoken of in Jane Eyre mister Wilson was extremely alarmed at the first symptoms of this He went to a kind motherly woman who had had some connection with the school as laundress I believe and asked her to come and tell him what was the matter with them She made herself ready and drove with him in his gig When she entered the schoolroom she saw from twelve to fifteen girls lying about some resting their aching heads on the table others on the ground all heavy eyed flushed indifferent and weary with pains in every limb Some peculiar odour she says made her recognise that they were sickening for the fever and she told mister Wilson so and that she could not stay there for fear of conveying the infection to her own children but he half commanded and half entreated her to remain and nurse them and finally mounted his gig and drove away while she was still urging that she must return to her own house and to her domestic duties for which she had provided no substitute However when she was left in this unceremonious manner she determined to make the best of it and a most efficient nurse she proved although as she says it was a dreary time mister Wilson supplied everything ordered by the doctors of the best quality and in the most liberal manner the invalids were attended by doctor Batty a very clever surgeon in Kirby who had had the medical superintendence of the establishment from the beginning and who afterwards became mister Wilson s brother in law I have heard from two witnesses besides Charlotte Bronte that doctor Batty condemned the preparation of the food by the expressive action of spitting out a portion of it He himself it is but fair to say does not remember this circumstance nor does he speak of the fever itself as either alarming or dangerous About forty of the girls suffered from this but none of them died at Cowan Bridge though one died at her own home sinking under the state of health which followed it None of the Brontes had the fever But the same causes which affected the health of the other pupils through typhus told more slowly but not less surely upon their constitutions The principal of these causes was the food The bad management of the cook was chiefly to be blamed for this she was dismissed and the woman who had been forced against her will to serve as head nurse took the place of housekeeper and henceforward the food was so well prepared that no one could ever reasonably complain of it Of course it cannot be expected that a new institution comprising domestic and educational arrangements for nearly a hundred persons should work quite smoothly at the beginning All this occurred during the first two years of the establishment and in estimating its effect upon the character of Charlotte Bronte we must remember that she was a sensitive thoughtful child capable of reflecting deeply if not of analyzing truly and peculiarly susceptible as are all delicate and sickly children to painful impressions What the healthy suffer from but momentarily and then forget those who are ailing brood over involuntarily and remember long perhaps with no resentment but simply as a piece of suffering that has been stamped into their very life The pictures ideas and conceptions of character received into the mind of the child of eight years old were destined to be reproduced in fiery words a quarter of a century afterwards She saw but one side of mister Wilson s character and many of those who knew him at that time assure me of the fidelity with which this is represented while at the same time they regret that the delineation should have obliterated as it were nearly all that was noble or conscientious And that there were grand and fine qualities in mister Wilson I have received abundant evidence Indeed for several weeks past I have received letters almost daily bearing on the subject of this chapter some vague some definite many full of love and admiration for mister Wilson some as full of dislike and indignation few containing positive facts After giving careful consideration to this mass of conflicting evidence I have made such alterations and omissions in this chapter as seem to me to be required It is but just to state that the major part of the testimony with which I have been favoured from old pupils is in high praise of mister Wilson Among the letters that I have read there is one whose evidence ought to be highly respected It is from the husband of Miss Temple She died in eighteen fifty six but he a clergyman thus wrote in reply to a letter addressed to him on the subject by one of mister Wilson s friends Often have I heard my late dear wife speak of her sojourn at Cowan Bridge always in terms of admiration of mister Carus Wilson his parental love to his pupils and their love for him of the food and general treatment in terms of approval I have heard her allude to an unfortunate cook who used at times to spoil the porridge but who she said was soon dismissed The recollections left of the four Bronte sisters at this period of their lives on the minds of those who associated with them are not very distinct Wild strong hearts and powerful minds were hidden under an enforced propriety and regularity of demeanour and expression just as their faces had been concealed by their father under his stiff unchanging mask Maria was delicate unusually clever and thoughtful for her age gentle and untidy Of her frequent disgrace from this last fault of her sufferings so patiently borne I have already spoken The only glimpse we get of Elizabeth through the few years of her short life is contained in a letter which I have received from Miss Temple The second Elizabeth is the only one of the family of whom I have a vivid recollection from her meeting with a somewhat alarming accident in consequence of which I had her for some days and nights in my bedroom not only for the sake of greater quiet but that I might watch over her myself Her head was severely cut but she bore all the consequent suffering with exemplary patience and by it won much upon my esteem Of the two younger ones if two there were I have very slight recollections save that one a darling child under five years of age was quite the pet nursling of the school This last would be Emily Charlotte was considered the most talkative of the sisters a bright clever little child Her great friend was a certain Mellany Hane so mister Bronte spells the name whose brother paid for her schooling and who had no remarkable talent except for music which her brother s circumstances forbade her to cultivate She was a hungry good natured ordinary girl older than Charlotte and ever ready to protect her from any petty tyranny or encroachments on the part of the elder girls Charlotte always remembered her with affection and gratitude I have quoted the word bright in the account of Charlotte I suspect that this year of eighteen twenty five was the last time it could ever be applied to her In the spring of it Maria became so rapidly worse that mister Bronte was sent for He had not previously been aware of her illness and the condition in which he found her was a terrible shock to him He took her home by the Leeds coach the girls crowding out into the road to follow her with their eyes over the bridge past the cottages and then out of sight for ever She died a very few days after her arrival at home Perhaps the news of her death falling suddenly into the life of which her patient existence had formed a part only a little week or so before made those who remained at Cowan Bridge look with more anxiety on Elizabeth s symptoms which also turned out to be consumptive She was sent home in charge of a confidential servant of the establishment and she too died in the early summer of that year Charlotte was thus suddenly called into the responsibilities of eldest sister in a motherless family She remembered how anxiously her dear sister Maria had striven in her grave earnest way to be a tender helper and a counsellor to them all and the duties that now fell upon her seemed almost like a legacy from the gentle little sufferer so lately dead Both Charlotte and Emily returned to school after the Midsummer holidays in this fatal year But before the next winter it was thought desirable to advise their removal as it was evident that the damp situation of the house at Cowan Bridge did not suit their health CHAPTER V 
3482_170452_000001_000000	train-clean-360	For the reason just stated the little girls were sent home in the autumn of eighteen twenty five when Charlotte was little more than nine years old 
none	none	About this time an elderly woman of the village came to live as servant at the parsonage 
3482_170452_000002_000001	train-clean-360	She remained there as a member of the household for thirty years and from the length of her faithful service and the attachment and respect which she inspired is deserving of mention 
none	none	Tabby was a thorough specimen of a Yorkshire woman of her class in dialect in appearance and in character 
3482_170452_000002_000003	train-clean-360	She abounded in strong practical sense and shrewdness 
3482_170452_000002_000004	train-clean-360	Her words were far from flattery but she would spare no deeds in the cause of those whom she kindly regarded 
none	none	She ruled the children pretty sharply and yet never grudged a little extra trouble to provide them with such small treats as came within her power In return she claimed to be looked upon as a humble friend and many years later Miss Bronte told me that she found it somewhat difficult to manage as Tabby expected to be informed of all the family concerns and yet had grown so deaf that what was repeated to her became known to whoever might be in or about the house To obviate this publication of what it might be desirable to keep secret Miss Bronte used to take her out for a walk on the solitary moors where when both were seated on a tuft of heather in some high lonely place she could acquaint the old woman at leisure with all that she wanted to hear Tabby had lived in Haworth in the days when the pack horses went through once a week with their tinkling bells and gay worsted adornment carrying the produce of the country from Keighley over the hills to Colne and Burnley 
3482_170452_000003_000001	train-clean-360	What is more she had known the bottom or valley in those primitive days when the fairies frequented the margin of the beck on moonlight nights and had known folk who had seen them 
none	none	But that was when there were no mills in the valleys and when all the wool spinning was done by hand in the farm houses round It wur the factories as had driven em away she said No doubt she had many a tale to tell of by gone days of the country side old ways of living former inhabitants decayed gentry who had melted away and whose places knew them no more family tragedies and dark superstitious dooms and in telling these things without the least consciousness that there might ever be anything requiring to be softened down would give at full length the bare and simple details 
3482_170452_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Miss Branwell instructed the children at regular hours in all she could teach making her bed chamber into their schoolroom 
3482_170452_000004_000001	train-clean-360	Their father was in the habit of relating to them any public news in which he felt an interest and from the opinions of his strong and independent mind they would gather much food for thought but I do not know whether he gave them any direct instruction 
none	none	Charlotte s deep thoughtful spirit appears to have felt almost painfully the tender responsibility which rested upon her with reference to her remaining sisters She was only eighteen months older than Emily but Emily and Anne were simply companions and playmates while Charlotte was motherly friend and guardian to both and this loving assumption of duties beyond her years made her feel considerably older than she really was 
3482_170452_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Patrick Branwell their only brother was a boy of remarkable promise and in some ways of extraordinary precocity of talent 
none	none	mister Bronte s friends advised him to send his son to school but remembering both the strength of will of his own youth and his mode of employing it he believed that Patrick was better at home and that he himself could teach him well as he had taught others before So Patrick or as his family called him Branwell remained at Haworth working hard for some hours a day with his father but when the time of the latter was taken up with his parochial duties the boy was thrown into chance companionship with the lads of the village for youth will to youth and boys will to boys Still he was associated in many of his sisters plays and amusements These were mostly of a sedentary and intellectual nature 
3482_170452_000006_000001	train-clean-360	I have had a curious packet confided to me containing an immense amount of manuscript in an inconceivably small space tales dramas poems romances written principally by Charlotte in a hand which it is almost impossible to decipher without the aid of a magnifying glass 
3482_170452_000006_000002	train-clean-360	No description will give so good an idea of the extreme minuteness of the writing as the annexed facsimile of a page 
none	none	Among these papers there is a list of her works which I copy as a curious proof how early the rage for literary composition had seized upon her

3482_170452_000023_000000	train-clean-360	As each volume contains from sixty to a hundred pages and the size of the page lithographed is rather less than the average the amount of the whole seems very great if we remember that it was all written in about fifteen months 
3482_170452_000023_000001	train-clean-360	So much for the quantity the quality strikes me as of singular merit for a girl of thirteen or fourteen 
none	none	Both as a specimen of her prose style at this time and also as revealing something of the quiet domestic life led by these children I take an extract from the introduction to Tales of the Islanders the title of one of their Little Magazines June the thirty first eighteen twenty nine The play of the Islanders was formed in December eighteen twenty seven in the following manner 
3482_170452_000025_000001	train-clean-360	One night about the time when the cold sleet and stormy fogs of November are succeeded by the snow storms and high piercing night winds of confirmed winter we were all sitting round the warm blazing kitchen fire having just concluded a quarrel with Tabby concerning the propriety of lighting a candle from which she came off victorious no candle having been produced 
3482_170452_000025_000002	train-clean-360	A long pause succeeded which was at last broken by Branwell saying in a lazy manner I don t know what to do This was echoed by Emily and Anne 
none	none	Tabby Wha ya may go t bed Branwell
3482_170452_000027_000001	train-clean-360	 I d rather do anything than that 
none	none	Charlotte Why are you so glum to night Tabby 
3482_170452_000028_000002	train-clean-360	Oh suppose we had each an island of our own 
none	none	Branwell
3482_170452_000029_000001	train-clean-360	 If we had I would choose the Island of Man 
none	none	Charlotte And I would choose the Isle of Wight Emily The Isle of Arran for me Anne
3482_170452_000032_000001	train-clean-360	 And mine shall be Guernsey 
none	none	We then chose who should be chief men in our islands Branwell chose John Bull Astley Cooper and Leigh Hunt Emily Walter Scott mister Lockhart Johnny Lockhart Anne Michael Sadler Lord Bentinck Sir Henry Halford 
3482_170452_000033_000002	train-clean-360	I chose the Duke of Wellington and two sons Christopher North and company and mister Abernethy 
3482_170452_000033_000003	train-clean-360	Here our conversation was interrupted by the to us dismal sound of the clock striking seven and we were summoned off to bed 
3482_170452_000033_000004	train-clean-360	The next day we added many others to our list of men till we got almost all the chief men of the kingdom 
3482_170452_000033_000005	train-clean-360	After this for a long time nothing worth noticing occurred 
3482_170452_000033_000006	train-clean-360	In June eighteen twenty eight we erected a school on a fictitious island which was to contain one thousand children 
3482_170452_000033_000007	train-clean-360	The manner of the building was as follows 
none	none	The Island was fifty miles in circumference and certainly appeared more like the work of enchantment than anything real c Two or three things strike me much in this fragment one is the graphic vividness with which the time of the year the hour of the evening the feeling of cold and darkness outside the sound of the night winds sweeping over the desolate snow covered moors coming nearer and nearer and at last shaking the very door of the room where they were sitting for it opened out directly on that bleak wide expanse is contrasted with the glow and busy brightness of the cheerful kitchen where these remarkable children are grouped 
3482_170452_000034_000001	train-clean-360	Tabby moves about in her quaint country dress frugal peremptory prone to find fault pretty sharply yet allowing no one else to blame her children we may feel sure 
none	none	Another noticeable fact is the intelligent partisanship with which they choose their great men who are almost all stanch Tories of the time 
3482_170452_000034_000003	train-clean-360	Moreover they do not confine themselves to local heroes their range of choice has been widened by hearing much of what is not usually considered to interest children 
3482_170452_000034_000004	train-clean-360	Little Anne aged scarcely eight picks out the politicians of the day for her chief men 
3482_170452_000035_000000	train-clean-360	There is another scrap of paper in this all but illegible handwriting written about this time and which gives some idea of the sources of their opinions 
3482_170452_000036_000000	train-clean-360	THE HISTORY OF THE YEAR eighteen twenty nine 
3482_170452_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Once Papa lent my sister Maria a book 
3482_170452_000037_000001	train-clean-360	It was an old geography book she wrote on its blank leaf Papa lent me this book This book is a hundred and twenty years old it is at this moment lying before me 
none	none	While I write this I am in the kitchen of the Parsonage Haworth Tabby the servant is washing up the breakfast things and Anne my youngest sister Maria was my eldest is kneeling on a chair looking at some cakes which Tabby has been baking for us Emily is in the parlour brushing the carpet 
3482_170452_000037_000004	train-clean-360	Papa and Branwell are gone to Keighley 
none	none	Aunt is upstairs in her room and I am sitting by the table writing this in the kitchen Keighley is a small town four miles from here Papa and Branwell are gone for the newspaper the Leeds Intelligencer a most excellent Tory newspaper edited by mister Wood and the proprietor mister Henneman 
3482_170452_000037_000007	train-clean-360	We take two and see three newspapers a week 
3482_170452_000037_000008	train-clean-360	We take the Leeds Intelligencer Tory and the Leeds Mercury Whig edited by mister Baines and his brother son in law and his two sons Edward and Talbot 
3482_170452_000037_000009	train-clean-360	We see the John Bull it is a high Tory very violent 
none	none	mister Driver lends us it as likewise Blackwood s Magazine the most able periodical there is 
3482_170452_000037_000011	train-clean-360	The Editor is mister Christopher North an old man seventy four years of age the first of April is his birth day his company are Timothy Tickler Morgan O Doherty Macrabin Mordecai Mullion Warnell and James Hogg a man of most extraordinary genius a Scottish shepherd 
none	none	Our plays were established Young Men June eighteen twenty six Our Fellows July eighteen twenty seven Islanders December eighteen twenty seven These are our three great plays that are not kept secret Emily s and my best plays were established the first of December eighteen twenty seven the others March eighteen twenty eight 
3482_170452_000037_000015	train-clean-360	Best plays mean secret plays they are very nice ones 
3482_170452_000037_000016	train-clean-360	All our plays are very strange ones 
3482_170452_000037_000017	train-clean-360	Their nature I need not write on paper for I think I shall always remember them 
none	none	The Young Men s play took its rise from some wooden soldiers Branwell had Our Fellows from AEsop s Fables and the Islanders from several events which happened 
3482_170452_000037_000019	train-clean-360	I will sketch out the origin of our plays more explicitly if I can 
none	none	First Young Men Papa bought Branwell some wooden soldiers at Leeds when Papa came home it was night and we were in bed so next morning Branwell came to our door with a box of soldiers 
3482_170452_000037_000021	train-clean-360	Emily and I jumped out of bed and I snatched up one and exclaimed This is the Duke of Wellington 
3482_170452_000037_000022	train-clean-360	This shall be the Duke When I had said this Emily likewise took up one and said it should be hers when Anne came down she said one should be hers

none	none	Here is this little girl in a remote Yorkshire parsonage who has probably never seen anything worthy the name of a painting in her life studying the names and characteristics of the great old Italian and Flemish masters whose works she longs to see some time in the dim future that lies before her There is a paper remaining which contains minute studies of and criticisms upon the engravings in Friendship s Offering for eighteen twenty nine showing how she had early formed those habits of close observation and patient analysis of cause and effect which served so well in after life as handmaids to her genius The way in which mister Bronte made his children sympathise with him in his great interest in politics must have done much to lift them above the chances of their minds being limited or tainted by petty local gossip I take the only other remaining personal fragment out of Tales of the Islanders it is a sort of apology contained in the introduction to the second volume for their not having been continued before the writers had been for a long time too busy and latterly too much absorbed in politics Parliament was opened and the great Catholic question was brought forward and the Duke s measures were disclosed and all was slander violence party spirit and confusion 
3482_170452_000042_000001	train-clean-360	Oh those six months from the time of the King s speech to the end 
3482_170452_000042_000002	train-clean-360	Nobody could write think or speak on any subject but the Catholic question and the Duke of Wellington and mister Peel 
3482_170452_000042_000003	train-clean-360	I remember the day when the Intelligence Extraordinary came with mister Peel s speech in it containing the terms on which the Catholics were to be let in 
none	none	With what eagerness Papa tore off the cover and how we all gathered round him and with what breathless anxiety we listened as one by one they were disclosed and explained and argued upon so ably and so well and then when it was all out how aunt said that she thought it was excellent and that the Catholics could do no harm with such good security I remember also the doubts as to whether it would pass the House of Lords and the prophecies that it would not and when the paper came which was to decide the question the anxiety was almost dreadful with which we listened to the whole affair the opening of the doors the hush the royal dukes in their robes and the great duke in green sash and waistcoat the rising of all the peeresses when he rose the reading of his speech Papa saying that his words were like precious gold and lastly the majority of one to four sic in favour of the Bill But this is a digression c c This must have been written when she was between thirteen and fourteen 
3482_170452_000044_000000	train-clean-360	It will be interesting to some of my readers to know what was the character of her purely imaginative writing at this period 
3482_170452_000044_000001	train-clean-360	While her description of any real occurrence is as we have seen homely graphic and forcible when she gives way to her powers of creation her fancy and her language alike run riot sometimes to the very borders of apparent delirium 
3482_170452_000044_000002	train-clean-360	Of this wild weird writing a single example will suffice 
3482_170452_000044_000003	train-clean-360	It is a letter to the editor of one of the Little Magazines 
none	none	Sir It is well known that the Genii have declared that unless they perform certain arduous duties every year of a mysterious nature all the worlds in the firmament will be burnt up and gathered together in one mighty globe which will roll in solitary grandeur through the vast wilderness of space inhabited only by the four high princes of the Genii till time shall be succeeded by Eternity and the impudence of this is only to be paralleled by another of their assertions namely that by their magic might they can reduce the world to a desert the purest waters to streams of livid poison and the clearest lakes to stagnant waters the pestilential vapours of which shall slay all living creatures except the blood thirsty beast of the forest and the ravenous bird of the rock But that in the midst of this desolation the palace of the Chief Genii shall rise sparkling in the wilderness and the horrible howl of their war cry shall spread over the land at morning at noontide and night but that they shall have their annual feast over the bones of the dead and shall yearly rejoice with the joy of victors I think sir that the horrible wickedness of this needs no remark and therefore I haste to subscribe myself c July fourteen eighteen twenty nine It is not unlikely that the foregoing letter may have had some allegorical or political reference invisible to our eyes but very clear to the bright little minds for whom it was intended 
3482_170452_000047_000001	train-clean-360	Politics were evidently their grand interest the Duke of Wellington their demi god All that related to him belonged to the heroic age 
3482_170452_000047_000002	train-clean-360	Did Charlotte want a knight errant or a devoted lover the Marquis of Douro or Lord Charles Wellesley came ready to her hand 
none	none	There is hardly one of her prose writings at this time in which they are not the principal personages and in which their august father does not appear as a sort of Jupiter Tonans or Deus ex Machina 
3482_170452_000048_000000	train-clean-360	As one evidence how Wellesley haunted her imagination I copy out a few of the titles to her papers in the various magazines

3482_170452_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 Strange Events by Lord C A F Wellesley 
3482_170452_000054_000000	train-clean-360	Life in an isolated village or a lonely country house presents many little occurrences which sink into the mind of childhood there to be brooded over 
none	none	No other event may have happened or be likely to happen for days to push one of these aside before it has assumed a vague and mysterious importance Thus children leading a secluded life are often thoughtful and dreamy the impressions made upon them by the world without the unusual sights of earth and sky the accidental meetings with strange faces and figures rare occurrences in those out of the way places are sometimes magnified by them into things so deeply significant as to be almost supernatural 
3482_170452_000054_000003	train-clean-360	This peculiarity I perceive very strongly in Charlotte s writings at this time 
3482_170452_000054_000004	train-clean-360	Indeed under the circumstances it is no peculiarity 
none	none	It has been common to all from the Chaldean shepherds the lonely herdsman stretched on the soft grass through half a summer s day the solitary monk to all whose impressions from without have had time to grow and vivify in the imagination till they have been received as actual personifications or supernatural visions to doubt which would be blasphemy 
3482_170452_000055_000000	train-clean-360	To counterbalance this tendency in Charlotte was the strong common sense natural to her and daily called into exercise by the requirements of her practical life 
none	none	Her duties were not merely to learn her lessons to read a certain quantity to gain certain ideas she had besides to brush rooms to run errands up and down stairs to help in the simpler forms of cooking to be by turns play fellow and monitress to her younger sisters and brother to make and to mend and to study economy under her careful aunt 
3482_170452_000055_000002	train-clean-360	Thus we see that while her imagination received vivid impressions her excellent understanding had full power to rectify them before her fancies became realities 
3482_170452_000055_000003	train-clean-360	On a scrap of paper she has written down the following relation 
3482_170452_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 June twenty two eighteen thirty six o clock p m Haworth near Bradford 
3482_170452_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 The following strange occurrence happened on the twenty second of June eighteen thirty At the time Papa was very ill confined to his bed and so weak that he could not rise without assistance 
3482_170452_000057_000001	train-clean-360	Tabby and I were alone in the kitchen about half past nine ante meridian 
3482_170452_000057_000002	train-clean-360	Suddenly we heard a knock at the door Tabby rose and opened it 
3482_170452_000057_000003	train-clean-360	An old man appeared standing without who accosted her thus 
none	none	Old Man Does the parson live here Tabby Yes Old Man I wish to see him Tabby He is poorly in bed Old Man I have a message for him Tabby Who from Old Man From the Lord Tabby Who Old Man The Lord 
3482_170452_000066_000001	train-clean-360	He desires me to say that the Bridegroom is coming and that we must prepare to meet him that the cords are about to be loosed and the golden bowl broken the pitcher broken at the fountain 
none	none	Here he concluded his discourse and abruptly went his way 
3482_170452_000067_000001	train-clean-360	As Tabby closed the door I asked her if she knew him 
3482_170452_000067_000002	train-clean-360	Her reply was that she had never seen him before nor any one like him 
3482_170452_000067_000003	train-clean-360	Though I am fully persuaded that he was some fanatical enthusiast well meaning perhaps but utterly ignorant of true piety yet I could not forbear weeping at his words spoken so unexpectedly at that particular period 
3482_170452_000068_000000	train-clean-360	Though the date of the following poem is a little uncertain it may be most convenient to introduce it here 
3482_170452_000068_000001	train-clean-360	It must have been written before eighteen thirty three but how much earlier there are no means of determining 
3482_170452_000068_000002	train-clean-360	I give it as a specimen of the remarkable poetical talent shown in the various diminutive writings of this time at least in all of them which I have been able to read 
3482_170452_000069_000000	train-clean-360	THE WOUNDED STAG 
3482_170452_000070_000000	train-clean-360	Passing amid the deepest shade Of the wood s sombre heart Last night I saw a wounded deer Laid lonely and apart 
3482_170452_000071_000000	train-clean-360	Such light as pierced the crowded boughs Light scattered scant and dim Passed through the fern that formed his couch And centred full on him 
none	none	Pain trembled in his weary limbs Pain filled his patient eye Pain crushed amid the shadowy fern His branchy crown did lie Where were his comrades where his mate All from his death bed gone And he thus struck and desolate Suffered and bled alone Did he feel what a man might feel Friend left and sore distrest Did Pain s keen dart and Grief s sharp sting Strive in his mangled breast Did longing for affection lost Barb every deadly dart Love unrepaid and Faith betrayed Did these torment his heart No leave to man his proper doom These are the pangs that rise Around the bed of state and gloom Where Adam s offspring dies CHAPTER VI 
3482_170453_000009_000000	train-clean-360	This is perhaps a fitting time to give some personal description of Miss Bronte 
none	none	In eighteen thirty one she was a quiet thoughtful girl of nearly fifteen years of age very small in figure stunted was the word she applied to herself but as her limbs and head were in just proportion to the slight fragile body no word in ever so slight a degree suggestive of deformity could properly be applied to her with soft thick brown hair and peculiar eyes of which I find it difficult to give a description as they appeared to me in her later life 
3482_170453_000009_000002	train-clean-360	They were large and well shaped their colour a reddish brown but if the iris was closely examined it appeared to be composed of a great variety of tints 
3482_170453_000009_000003	train-clean-360	The usual expression was of quiet listening intelligence but now and then on some just occasion for vivid interest or wholesome indignation a light would shine out as if some spiritual lamp had been kindled which glowed behind those expressive orbs 
3482_170453_000009_000004	train-clean-360	I never saw the like in any other human creature 
none	none	As for the rest of her features they were plain large and ill set but unless you began to catalogue them you were hardly aware of the fact for the eyes and power of the countenance over balanced every physical defect the crooked mouth and the large nose were forgotten and the whole face arrested the attention and presently attracted all those whom she herself would have cared to attract 
3482_170453_000009_000006	train-clean-360	Her hands and feet were the smallest I ever saw when one of the former was placed in mine it was like the soft touch of a bird in the middle of my palm 
3482_170453_000009_000007	train-clean-360	The delicate long fingers had a peculiar fineness of sensation which was one reason why all her handiwork of whatever kind writing sewing knitting was so clear in its minuteness 
3482_170453_000009_000008	train-clean-360	She was remarkably neat in her whole personal attire but she was dainty as to the fit of her shoes and gloves 
3482_170453_000010_000000	train-clean-360	I can well imagine that the grave serious composure which when I knew her gave her face the dignity of an old Venetian portrait was no acquisition of later years but dated from that early age when she found herself in the position of an elder sister to motherless children 
none	none	But in a girl only just entered on her teens such an expression would be called to use a country phrase old fashioned and in eighteen thirty one the period of which I now write we must think of her as a little set antiquated girl very quiet in manners and very quaint in dress for besides the influence exerted by her father s ideas concerning the simplicity of attire befitting the wife and daughters of a country clergyman her aunt on whom the duty of dressing her nieces principally devolved had never been in society since she left Penzance eight or nine years before and the Penzance fashions of that day were still dear to her heart In January eighteen thirty one Charlotte was sent to school again This time she went as a pupil to Miss W who lived at Roe Head a cheerful roomy country house standing a little apart in a field on the right of the road from Leeds to Huddersfield Three tiers of old fashioned semicircular bow windows run from basement to roof and look down upon a long green slope of pasture land ending in the pleasant woods of Kirklees Sir George Armitage s park Although Roe Head and Haworth are not twenty miles apart the aspect of the country is as totally dissimilar as if they enjoyed a different climate The soft curving and heaving landscape round the former gives a stranger the idea of cheerful airiness on the heights and of sunny warmth in the broad green valleys below 
3482_170453_000011_000005	train-clean-360	It is just such a neighbourhood as the monks loved and traces of the old Plantagenet times are to be met with everywhere side by side with the manufacturing interests of the West Riding of to day 
none	none	There is the park of Kirklees full of sunny glades speckled with black shadows of immemorial yew trees the grey pile of building formerly a House of professed Ladies the mouldering stone in the depth of the wood under which Robin Hood is said to lie close outside the park an old stone gabled house now a roadside inn but which bears the name of the Three Nuns and has a pictured sign to correspond And this quaint old inn is frequented by fustian dressed mill hands from the neighbouring worsted factories which strew the high road from Leeds to Huddersfield and form the centres round which future villages gather Such are the contrasts of modes of living and of times and seasons brought before the traveller on the great roads that traverse the West Riding In no other part of England I fancy are the centuries brought into such close strange contact as in the district in which Roe Head is situated 
3482_170453_000011_000010	train-clean-360	Within six miles of Miss W s house on the left of the road coming from Leeds lie the remains of Howley Hall now the property of Lord Cardigan but formerly belonging to a branch of the Saviles 
none	none	Near to it is Lady Anne s well Lady Anne according to tradition having been worried and eaten by wolves as she sat at the well to which the indigo dyed factory people from Birstall and Batley woollen mills would formerly repair on Palm Sunday when the waters possess remarkable medicinal efficacy and it is still believed by some that they assume a strange variety of colours at six o clock on the morning of that day All round the lands held by the farmer who lives in the remains of Howley Hall are stone houses of to day occupied by the people who are making their living and their fortunes by the woollen mills that encroach upon and shoulder out the proprietors of the ancient halls 
3482_170453_000012_000001	train-clean-360	These are to be seen in every direction picturesque many gabled with heavy stone carvings of coats of arms for heraldic ornament belonging to decayed families from whose ancestral lands field after field has been shorn away by the urgency of rich manufacturers pressing hard upon necessity 
none	none	A smoky atmosphere surrounds these old dwellings of former Yorkshire squires and blights and blackens the ancient trees that overshadow them cinder paths lead up to them the ground round about is sold for building upon but still the neighbours though they subsist by a different state of things remember that their forefathers lived in agricultural dependence upon the owners of these halls and treasure up the traditions connected with the stately households that existed centuries ago 
3482_170453_000013_000001	train-clean-360	Take Oakwell Hall for instance 
3482_170453_000013_000002	train-clean-360	It stands in a pasture field about a quarter of a mile from the high road 
none	none	It is but that distance from the busy whirr of the steam engines employed in the woollen mills at Birstall and if you walk to it from Birstall Station about meal time you encounter strings of mill hands blue with woollen dye and cranching in hungry haste over the cinder paths bordering the high road Turning off from this to the right you ascend through an old pasture field and enter a short by road called the Bloody Lane a walk haunted by the ghost of a certain Captain Batt the reprobate proprietor of an old hall close by in the days of the Stuarts 
3482_170453_000013_000005	train-clean-360	From the Bloody Lane overshadowed by trees you come into the field in which Oakwell Hall is situated 
3482_170453_000013_000006	train-clean-360	It is known in the neighbourhood to be the place described as Field Head Shirley s residence 
none	none	The enclosure in front half court half garden the panelled hall with the gallery opening into the bed chambers running round the barbarous peach coloured drawing room the bright look out through the garden door upon the grassy lawns and terraces behind where the soft hued pigeons still love to coo and strut in the sun are described in Shirley The scenery of that fiction lies close around the real events which suggested it took place in the immediate neighbourhood 
3482_170453_000014_000000	train-clean-360	They show a bloody footprint in a bed chamber of Oakwell Hall and tell a story connected with it and with the lane by which the house is approached 
none	none	Captain Batt was believed to be far away his family was at Oakwell when in the dusk one winter evening he came stalking along the lane and through the hall and up the stairs into his own room where he vanished He had been killed in a duel in London that very same afternoon of December ninth sixteen eighty four The stones of the Hall formed part of the more ancient vicarage which an ancestor of Captain Batt s had seized in the troublous times for property which succeeded the Reformation This Henry Batt possessed himself of houses and money without scruple and at last stole the great bell of Birstall Church for which sacrilegious theft a fine was imposed on the land and has to be paid by the owner of the Hall to this day 
3482_170453_000016_000000	train-clean-360	But the Oakwell property passed out of the hands of the Batts at the beginning of the last century collateral descendants succeeded and left this picturesque trace of their having been 
none	none	In the great hall hangs a mighty pair of stag s horns and dependent from them a printed card recording the fact that on the first of September seventeen sixty three there was a great hunting match when this stag was slain and that fourteen gentlemen shared in the chase and dined on the spoil in that hall along with Fairfax Fearneley esquire the owner The fourteen names are given doubtless mighty men of yore but among them all Sir Fletcher Norton Attorney General and Major General Birch were the only ones with which I had any association in eighteen fifty five Passing on from Oakwell there lie houses right and left which were well known to Miss Bronte when she lived at Roe Head as the hospitable homes of some of her school fellows 
3482_170453_000016_000004	train-clean-360	Lanes branch off for three or four miles to heaths and commons on the higher ground which formed pleasant walks on holidays and then comes the white gate into the field path leading to Roe Head itself 
none	none	One of the bow windowed rooms on the ground floor with the pleasant look out I have described was the drawing room the other was the schoolroom The dining room was on one side of the door and faced the road The number of pupils during the year and a half Miss Bronte was there ranged from seven to ten and as they did not require the whole of the house for their accommodation the third story was unoccupied except by the ghostly idea of a lady whose rustling silk gown was sometimes heard by the listeners at the foot of the second flight of stairs 
3482_170453_000019_000000	train-clean-360	The kind motherly nature of Miss W and the small number of the girls made the establishment more like a private family than a school Moreover she was a native of the district immediately surrounding Roe Head as were the majority of her pupils 
none	none	Most likely Charlotte Bronte in coming from Haworth came the greatest distance of all E s home was five miles away two other dear friends the Rose and Jessie Yorke of Shirley lived still nearer two or three came from Huddersfield one or two from Leeds I shall now quote from a valuable letter which I have received from Mary one of these early friends distinct and graphic in expression as becomes a cherished associate of Charlotte Bronte s 
3482_170453_000020_000001	train-clean-360	The time referred to is her first appearance at Roe Head on January nineteenth eighteen thirty one 
3482_170453_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 I first saw her coming out of a covered cart in very old fashioned clothes and looking very cold and miserable 
3482_170453_000021_000001	train-clean-360	She was coming to school at Miss W s 
3482_170453_000021_000002	train-clean-360	When she appeared in the schoolroom her dress was changed but just as old 
3482_170453_000021_000003	train-clean-360	She looked a little old woman so short sighted that she always appeared to be seeking something and moving her head from side to side to catch a sight of it 
3482_170453_000021_000004	train-clean-360	She was very shy and nervous and spoke with a strong Irish accent 
none	none	When a book was given her she dropped her head over it till her nose nearly touched it and when she was told to hold her head up up went the book after it still close to her nose so that it was not possible to help laughing This was the first impression she made upon one of those whose dear and valued friend she was to become in after life Another of the girls recalls her first sight of Charlotte on the day she came standing by the schoolroom window looking out on the snowy landscape and crying while all the rest were at play
3482_170453_000022_000002	train-clean-360	 E was younger than she and her tender heart was touched by the apparently desolate condition in which she found the oddly dressed odd looking little girl that winter morning as sick for home she stood in tears in a new strange place among new strange people 
none	none	Any over demonstrative kindness would have scared the wild little maiden from Haworth but E who is shadowed forth in the Caroline Helstone of Shirley managed to win confidence and was allowed to give sympathy 
3482_170453_000023_000000	train-clean-360	To quote again from Mary s letter 
3482_170453_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 We thought her very ignorant for she had never learnt grammar at all and very little geography 
3482_170453_000025_000000	train-clean-360	This account of her partial ignorance is confirmed by her other school fellows 
3482_170453_000025_000001	train-clean-360	But Miss W was a lady of remarkable intelligence and of delicate tender sympathy 
3482_170453_000025_000002	train-clean-360	She gave a proof of this in her first treatment of Charlotte 
3482_170453_000025_000003	train-clean-360	The little girl was well read but not well grounded 
none	none	Miss W took her aside and told her she was afraid that she must place her in the second class for some time till she could overtake the girls of her own age in the knowledge of grammar c but poor Charlotte received this announcement with so sad a fit of crying that Miss W s kind heart was softened and she wisely perceived that with such a girl it would be better to place her in the first class and allow her to make up by private study in those branches where she was deficient
3482_170453_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 She would confound us by knowing things that were out of our range altogether 
none	none	She was acquainted with most of the short pieces of poetry that we had to learn by heart would tell us the authors the poems they were taken from and sometimes repeat a page or two and tell us the plot 
3482_170453_000026_000002	train-clean-360	She had a habit of writing in italics printing characters and said she had learnt it by writing in their magazine 
none	none	They brought out a magazine once a month and wished it to look as like print as possible She told us a tale out of it 
3482_170453_000026_000004	train-clean-360	No one wrote in it and no one read it but herself her brother and two sisters 
3482_170453_000026_000005	train-clean-360	She promised to show me some of these magazines but retracted it afterwards and would never be persuaded to do so 
3482_170453_000026_000006	train-clean-360	In our play hours she sate or stood still with a book if possible 
none	none	Some of us once urged her to be on our side in a game at ball 
3482_170453_000026_000008	train-clean-360	She said she had never played and could not play 
3482_170453_000026_000009	train-clean-360	We made her try but soon found that she could not see the ball so we put her out She took all our proceedings with pliable indifference and always seemed to need a previous resolution to say No to anything 
none	none	She used to go and stand under the trees in the play ground and say it was pleasanter She endeavoured to explain this pointing out the shadows the peeps of sky c 
3482_170453_000026_000011	train-clean-360	We understood but little of it 
3482_170453_000026_000012	train-clean-360	She said that at Cowan Bridge she used to stand in the burn on a stone to watch the water flow by 
none	none	I told her she should have gone fishing she said she never wanted 
3482_170453_000026_000014	train-clean-360	She always showed physical feebleness in everything 
3482_170453_000026_000015	train-clean-360	She ate no animal food at school

3482_170453_000035_000001	train-clean-360	She was an indefatigable student constantly reading and learning with a strong conviction of the necessity and value of education very unusual in a girl of fifteen 
3482_170453_000035_000002	train-clean-360	She never lost a moment of time and seemed almost to grudge the necessary leisure for relaxation and play hours which might be partly accounted for by the awkwardness in all games occasioned by her shortness of sight

none	none	She was always ready to try and do what they wished though not sorry when they called her awkward and left her out of their sports Then at night she was an invaluable story teller frightening them almost out of their wits as they lay in bed On one occasion the effect was such that she was led to scream out aloud and Miss W coming up stairs found that one of the listeners had been seized with violent palpitations in consequence of the excitement produced by Charlotte s story Her indefatigable craving for knowledge tempted Miss W on into setting her longer and longer tasks of reading for examination and towards the end of the year and a half that she remained as a pupil at Roe Head she received her first bad mark for an imperfect lesson She had had a great quantity of Blair s Lectures on Belles Lettres to read and she could not answer some of the questions upon it Charlotte Bronte had a bad mark Miss W was sorry and regretted that she had set Charlotte so long a task Charlotte cried bitterly But her school fellows were more than sorry they were indignant They declared that the infliction of ever so slight a punishment on Charlotte Bronte was unjust for who had tried to do her duty like her and testified their feeling in a variety of ways until Miss W who was in reality only too willing to pass over her good pupil s first fault withdrew the bad mark and the girls all returned to their allegiance except Mary who took her own way during the week or two that remained of the half year choosing to consider that Miss W in giving Charlotte Bronte so long a task had forfeited her claim to obedience of the school regulations The number of pupils was so small that the attendance to certain subjects at particular hours common in larger schools was not rigidly enforced When the girls were ready with their lessons they came to Miss W to say them She had a remarkable knack of making them feel interested in whatever they had to learn They set to their studies not as to tasks or duties to be got through but with a healthy desire and thirst for knowledge of which she had managed to make them perceive the relishing savour They did not leave off reading and learning as soon as the compulsory pressure of school was taken away They had been taught to think to analyse to reject to appreciate Charlotte Bronte was happy in the choice made for her of the second school to which she was sent There was a robust freedom in the out of doors life of her companions They played at merry games in the fields round the house on Saturday half holidays they went long scrambling walks down mysterious shady lanes then climbing the uplands and thus gaining extensive views over the country about which so much had to be told both of its past and present history Miss W must have had in great perfection the French art conter to judge from her pupil s recollections of the tales she related during these long walks of this old house or that new mill and of the states of society consequent on the changes involved by the suggestive dates of either building She remembered the times when watchers or wakeners in the night heard the distant word of command and the measured tramp of thousands of sad desperate men receiving a surreptitious military training in preparation for some great day which they saw in their visions when right should struggle with might and come off victorious when the people of England represented by the workers of Yorkshire Lancashire and Nottinghamshire should make their voice heard in a terrible slogan since their true and pitiful complaints could find no hearing in parliament We forget now a days so rapid have been the changes for the better how cruel was the condition of numbers of labourers at the close of the great Peninsular war The half ludicrous nature of some of their grievances has lingered on in tradition the real intensity of their sufferings has become forgotten They were maddened and desperate and the country in the opinion of many seemed to be on the verge of a precipice from which it was only saved by the prompt and resolute decision of a few in authority Miss W spoke of those times of the mysterious nightly drillings of thousands on lonely moors of the muttered threats of individuals too closely pressed upon by necessity to be prudent of the overt acts in which the burning of Cartwright s mill took a prominent place and these things sank deep into the mind of one at least among her hearers mister Cartwright was the owner of a factory called Rawfolds in Liversedge not beyond the distance of a walk from Roe Head He had dared to employ machinery for the dressing of woollen cloth which was an unpopular measure in eighteen twelve when many other circumstances conspired to make the condition of the mill hands unbearable from the pressure of starvation and misery mister Cartwright was a very remarkable man having as I have been told some foreign blood in him the traces of which were very apparent in his tall figure dark eyes and complexion and singular though gentlemanly bearing At any rate he had been much abroad and spoke French well of itself a suspicious circumstance to the bigoted nationality of those days Altogether he was an unpopular man even before he took the last step of employing shears instead of hands to dress his wool He was quite aware of his unpopularity and of the probable consequences He had his mill prepared for an assault He took up his lodgings in it and the doors were strongly barricaded at night On every step of the stairs there was placed a roller spiked with barbed points all round so as to impede the ascent of the rioters if they succeeded in forcing the doors On the night of Saturday the eleventh of April eighteen twelve the assault was made Some hundreds of starving cloth dressers assembled in the very field near Kirklees that sloped down from the house which Miss W afterwards inhabited and were armed by their leaders with pistols hatchets and bludgeons many of which had been extorted by the nightly bands that prowled about the country from such inhabitants of lonely houses as had provided themselves with these means of self defence The silent sullen multitude marched in the dead of that spring night to Rawfolds and giving tongue with a great shout roused mister Cartwright up to the knowledge that the long expected attack was come He was within walls it is true but against the fury of hundreds he had only four of his own workmen and five soldiers to assist him These ten men however managed to keep up such a vigorous and well directed fire of musketry that they defeated all the desperate attempts of the multitude outside to break down the doors and force a way into the mill and after a conflict of twenty minutes during which two of the assailants were killed and several wounded they withdrew in confusion leaving mister Cartwright master of the field but so dizzy and exhausted now the peril was past that he forgot the nature of his defences and injured his leg rather seriously by one of the spiked rollers in attempting to go up his own staircase His dwelling was near the factory Some of the rioters vowed that if he did not give in they would leave this and go to his house and murder his wife and children This was a terrible threat for he had been obliged to leave his family with only one or two soldiers to defend them missus Cartwright knew what they had threatened and on that dreadful night hearing as she thought steps approaching she snatched up her two infant children and put them in a basket up the great chimney common in old fashioned Yorkshire houses One of the two children who had been thus stowed away used to point out with pride after she had grown up to woman s estate the marks of musket shot and the traces of gunpowder on the walls of her father s mill He was the first that had offered any resistance to the progress of the Luddites who had become by this time so numerous as almost to assume the character of an insurrectionary army mister Cartwright s conduct was so much admired by the neighbouring mill owners that they entered into a subscription for his benefit which amounted in the end to three thousand l Not much more than a fortnight after this attack on Rawfolds another manufacturer who employed the obnoxious machinery was shot down in broad daylight as he was passing over Crossland Moor which was skirted by a small plantation in which the murderers lay hidden The readers of Shirley will recognise these circumstances which were related to Miss Bronte years after they occurred but on the very spots where they took place and by persons who remembered full well those terrible times of insecurity to life and property on the one hand and of bitter starvation and blind ignorant despair on the other mister Bronte himself had been living amongst these very people in eighteen twelve as he was then clergyman at Hartshead not three miles from Rawfolds and as I have mentioned it was in these perilous times that he began his custom of carrying a loaded pistol continually about with him For not only his Tory politics but his love and regard for the authority of the law made him despise the cowardice of the surrounding magistrates who in their dread of the Luddites refused to interfere so as to prevent the destruction of property The clergy of the district were the bravest men by far There was a mister Roberson of Heald s Hall a friend of mister Bronte s who has left a deep impression of himself on the public mind He lived near Heckmondwike a large straggling dirty village not two miles from Roe Head It was principally inhabited by blanket weavers who worked in their own cottages and Heald s Hall is the largest house in the village of which mister Roberson was the vicar At his own cost he built a handsome church at Liversedge on a hill opposite the one on which his house stood which was the first attempt in the West Riding to meet the wants of the overgrown population and made many personal sacrifices for his opinions both religious and political which were of the true old fashioned Tory stamp He hated everything which he fancied had a tendency towards anarchy He was loyal in every fibre to Church and King and would have proudly laid down his life any day for what he believed to be right and true But he was a man of an imperial will and by it he bore down opposition till tradition represents him as having something grimly demoniac about him He was intimate with Cartwright and aware of the attack likely to be made on his mill accordingly it is said he armed himself and his household and was prepared to come to the rescue in the event of a signal being given that aid was needed Thus far is likely enough mister Roberson had plenty of warlike spirit in him man of peace though he was But in consequence of his having taken the unpopular side exaggerations of his character linger as truth in the minds of the people and a fabulous story is told of his forbidding any one to give water to the wounded Luddites left in the mill yard when he rode in the next morning to congratulate his friend Cartwright on his successful defence Moreover this stern fearless clergyman had the soldiers that were sent to defend the neighbourhood billeted at his house and this deeply displeased the workpeople who were to be intimidated by the red coats Although not a magistrate he spared no pains to track out the Luddites concerned in the assassination I have mentioned and was so successful in his acute unflinching energy that it was believed he had been supernaturally aided and the country people stealing into the fields surrounding Heald s Hall on dusky winter evenings years after this time declared that through the windows they saw Parson Roberson dancing in a strange red light with black demons all whirling and eddying round him He kept a large boys school and made himself both respected and dreaded by his pupils He added a grim kind of humour to his strength of will and the former quality suggested to his fancy strange out of the way kinds of punishment for any refractory pupils for instance he made them stand on one leg in a corner of the schoolroom holding a heavy book in each hand and once when a boy had run away home he followed him on horseback reclaimed him from his parents and tying him by a rope to the stirrup of his saddle made him run alongside of his horse for the many miles they had to traverse before reaching Heald s Hall One other illustration of his character may be given He discovered that his servant Betty had a follower and watching his time till Richard was found in the kitchen he ordered him into the dining room where the pupils were all assembled He then questioned Richard whether he had come after Betty and on his confessing the truth mister Roberson gave the word Off with him lads to the pump The poor lover was dragged to the court yard and the pump set to play upon him and between every drenching the question was put to him Will you promise not to come after Betty again For a long time Richard bravely refused to give in when Pump again lads was the order But at last the poor soaked follower was forced to yield and renounce his Betty The Yorkshire character of mister Roberson would be incomplete if I did not mention his fondness for horses He lived to be a very old man dying some time nearer to eighteen forty than eighteen thirty and even after he was eighty years of age he took great delight in breaking refractory steeds if necessary he would sit motionless on their backs for half an hour or more to bring them to There is a story current that once in a passion he shot his wife s favourite horse and buried it near a quarry where the ground some years after miraculously opened and displayed the skeleton but the real fact is that it was an act of humanity to put a poor old horse out of misery and that to spare it pain he shot it with his own hands and buried it where the ground sinking afterwards by the working of a coal pit the bones came to light The traditional colouring shows the animus with which his memory is regarded by one set of people By another the neighbouring clergy who remember him riding in his old age down the hill on which his house stood upon his strong white horse his bearing proud and dignified his shovel hat bent over and shadowing his keen eagle eyes going to his Sunday duty like a faithful soldier that dies in harness who can appreciate his loyalty to conscience his sacrifices to duty and his stand by his religion his memory is venerated In his extreme old age a rubric meeting was held at which his clerical brethren gladly subscribed to present him with a testimonial of their deep respect and regard This is a specimen of the strong character not seldom manifested by the Yorkshire clergy of the Established Church mister Roberson was a friend of Charlotte Bronte s father lived within a couple of miles of Roe Head while she was at school there and was deeply engaged in transactions the memory of which was yet recent when she heard of them and of the part which he had had in them I may now say a little on the character of the Dissenting population immediately surrounding Roe Head for the Tory and clergyman s daughter taking interest in politics ever since she was five years old and holding frequent discussions with such of the girls as were Dissenters and Radicals was sure to have made herself as much acquainted as she could with the condition of those to whom she was opposed in opinion The bulk of the population were Dissenters principally Independents In the village of Heckmondwike at one end of which Roe Head is situated there were two large chapels belonging to that denomination and one to the Methodists all of which were well filled two or three times on a Sunday besides having various prayer meetings fully attended on week days The inhabitants were a chapel going people very critical about the doctrine of their sermons tyrannical to their ministers and violent Radicals in politics A friend well acquainted with the place when Charlotte Bronte was at school has described some events which occurred then among them A scene which took place at the Lower Chapel at Heckmondwike will give you some idea of the people at that time When a newly married couple made their appearance at chapel it was the custom to sing the Wedding Anthem just after the last prayer and as the congregation was quitting the chapel The band of singers who performed this ceremony expected to have money given them and often passed the following night in drinking at least so said the minister of the place and he determined to put an end to this custom In this he was supported by many members of the chapel and congregation but so strong was the democratic element that he met with the most violent opposition and was often insulted when he went into the street A bride was expected to make her first appearance and the minister told the singers not to perform the anthem On their declaring they would he had the large pew which they usually occupied locked they broke it open from the pulpit he told the congregation that instead of their singing a hymn he would read a chapter hardly had he uttered the first word before up rose the singers headed by a tall fierce looking weaver who gave out a hymn and all sang it at the very top of their voices aided by those of their friends who were in the chapel Those who disapproved of the conduct of the singers and sided with the minister remained seated till the hymn was finished Then he gave out the chapter again read it and preached He was just about to conclude with prayer when up started the singers and screamed forth another hymn These disgraceful scenes were continued for many weeks and so violent was the feeling that the different parties could hardly keep from blows as they came through the chapel yard The minister at last left the place and along with him went many of the most temperate and respectable part of the congregation and the singers remained triumphant I believe that there was such a violent contest respecting the choice of a pastor about this time in the Upper Chapel at Heckmondwike that the Riot Act had to be read at a church meeting Certainly the soi disant Christians who forcibly ejected mister Redhead at Haworth ten or twelve years before held a very heathen brotherhood with the soi disant Christians of Heckmondwike though the one set might be called members of the Church of England and the other Dissenters The letter from which I have taken the above extract relates throughout to the immediate neighbourhood of the place where Charlotte Bronte spent her school days and describes things as they existed at that very time The writer says Having been accustomed to the respectful manners of the lower orders in the agricultural districts I was at first much disgusted and somewhat alarmed at the great freedom displayed by the working classes of Heckmondwike and Gomersall to those in a station above them The term lass was as freely applied to any young lady as the word wench is in Lancashire The extremely untidy appearance of the villagers shocked me not a little though I must do the housewives the justice to say that the cottages themselves were not dirty and had an air of rough plenty about them except when trade was bad that I had not been accustomed to see in the farming districts The heap of coals on one side of the house door and the brewing tubs on the other and the frequent perfume of malt and hops as you walked along proved that fire and home brewed were to be found at almost every man s hearth Nor was hospitality one of the main virtues of Yorkshire wanting Oat cake cheese and beer were freely pressed upon the visitor There used to be a yearly festival half religious half social held at Heckmondwike called The Lecture I fancy it had come down from the times of the Nonconformists A sermon was preached by some stranger at the Lower Chapel on a week day evening and the next day two sermons in succession were delivered at the Upper Chapel Of course the service was a very long one and as the time was June and the weather often hot it used to be regarded by myself and my companions as no pleasurable way of passing the morning The rest of the day was spent in social enjoyment great numbers of strangers flocked to the place booths were erected for the sale of toys and gingerbread a sort of Holy Fair and the cottages having had a little extra paint and white washing assumed quite a holiday look The village of Gomersall where Charlotte Bronte s friend Mary lived with her family which was a much prettier place than Heckmondwike contained a strange looking cottage built of rough unhewn stones many of them projecting considerably with uncouth heads and grinning faces carved upon them and upon a stone above the door was cut in large letters SPITE HALL It was erected by a man in the village opposite to the house of his enemy who had just finished for himself a good house commanding a beautiful view down the valley which this hideous building quite shut out Fearless because this people were quite familiar to all of them amidst such a population lived and walked the gentle Miss W s eight or nine pupils She herself was born and bred among this rough strong fierce set and knew the depth of goodness and loyalty that lay beneath their wild manners and insubordinate ways And the girls talked of the little world around them as if it were the only world that was and had their opinions and their parties and their fierce discussions like their elders possibly their betters And among them beloved and respected by all laughed at occasionally by a few but always to her face lived for a year and a half the plain short sighted oddly dressed studious little girl they called Charlotte Bronte CHAPTER VII Miss Bronte left Roe Head in eighteen thirty two having won the affectionate regard both of her teacher and her school fellows and having formed there the two fast friendships which lasted her whole life long the one with Mary who has not kept her letters the other with E who has kindly entrusted me with a large portion of Miss Bronte s correspondence with her This she has been induced to do by her knowledge of the urgent desire on the part of mister Bronte that the life of his daughter should be written and in compliance with a request from her husband that I should be permitted to have the use of these letters without which such a task could be but very imperfectly executed In order to shield this friend however from any blame or misconstruction it is only right to state that before granting me this privilege she throughout most carefully and completely effaced the names of the persons and places which occurred in them and also that such information as I have obtained from her bears reference solely to Miss Bronte and her sisters and not to any other individuals whom I may find it necessary to allude to in connection with them In looking over the earlier portion of this correspondence I am struck afresh by the absence of hope which formed such a strong characteristic in Charlotte At an age when girls in general look forward to an eternal duration of such feelings as they or their friends entertain and can therefore see no hindrance to the fulfilment of any engagements dependent on the future state of the affections she is surprised that E keeps her promise to write In after life I was painfully impressed with the fact that Miss Bronte never dared to allow herself to look forward with hope that she had no confidence in the future and I thought when I heard of the sorrowful years she had passed through that it had been this this pressure of grief which had crushed all buoyancy of expectation out of her But it appears from the letters that it must have been so to speak constitutional or perhaps the deep pang of losing her two elder sisters combined with a permanent state of bodily weakness in producing her hopelessness If her trust in God had been less strong she would have given way to unbounded anxiety at many a period of her life As it was we shall see she made a great and successful effort to leave her times in His hands After her return home she employed herself in teaching her sisters over whom she had had superior advantages She writes thus July twenty first eighteen thirty two of her course of life at the parsonage An account of one day is an account of all In the morning from nine o clock till half past twelve I instruct my sisters and draw then we walk till dinner time After dinner I sew till tea time and after tea I either write read or do a little fancy work or draw as I please Thus in one delightful though somewhat monotonous course my life is passed I have been only out twice to tea since I came home We are expecting company this afternoon and on Tuesday next we shall have all the female teachers of the Sunday school to tea I may here introduce a quotation from a letter which I have received from Mary since the publication of the previous editions of this memoir Soon after leaving school she admitted reading something of Cobbett s She did not like him she said but all was fish that came to her net At this time she wrote to me that reading and drawing were the only amusements she had and that her supply of books was very small in proportion to her wants She never spoke of her aunt When I saw Miss Branwell she was a very precise person and looked very odd because her dress c was so utterly out of fashion She corrected one of us once for using the word spit or spitting She made a great favourite of Branwell She made her nieces sew with purpose or without and as far as possible discouraged any other culture She used to keep the girls sewing charity clothing and maintained to me that it was not for the good of the recipients but of the sewers It was proper for them to do it she said Charlotte never was in wild excitement that I know of When in health she used to talk better and indeed when in low spirits never spoke at all She needed her best spirits to say what was in her heart for at other times she had not courage She never gave decided opinions at such times Charlotte said she could get on with any one who had a bump at the top of their heads meaning conscientiousness I found that I seldom differed from her except that she was far too tolerant of stupid people if they had a grain of kindness in them It was about this time that mister Bronte provided his children with a teacher in drawing who turned out to be a man of considerable talent but very little principle Although they never attained to anything like proficiency they took great interest in acquiring this art evidently from an instinctive desire to express their powerful imaginations in visible forms Charlotte told me that at this period of her life drawing and walking out with her sisters formed the two great pleasures and relaxations of her day The three girls used to walk upwards toward the purple black moors the sweeping surface of which was broken by here and there a stone quarry and if they had strength and time to go far enough they reached a waterfall where the beck fell over some rocks into the bottom They seldom went downwards through the village They were shy of meeting even familiar faces and were scrupulous about entering the house of the very poorest uninvited They were steady teachers at the Sunday School a habit which Charlotte kept up very faithfully even after she was left alone but they never faced their kind voluntary and always preferred the solitude and freedom of the moors In the September of this year Charlotte went to pay her first visit to her friend E It took her into the neighbourhood of Roe Head and brought her into pleasant contact with many of her old school fellows After this visit she and her friend seem to have agreed to correspond in French for the sake of improvement in the language But this improvement could not be great when it could only amount to a greater familiarity with dictionary words and when there was no one to explain to them that a verbal translation of English idioms hardly constituted French composition but the effort was laudable and of itself shows how willing they both were to carry on the education which they had begun under Miss W I will give an extract which whatever may be thought of the language is graphic enough and presents us with a happy little family picture the eldest sister returning home to the two younger after a fortnight s absence J arrivait a Haworth en parfaite sauvete sans le moindre accident ou malheur Mes petites soeurs couraient hors de la maison pour me rencontrer aussitot que la voiture se fit voir et elles m embrassaient avec autant d empressement et de plaisir comme si j avais ete absente pour plus d an Mon Papa ma Tante et le monsieur dent men frere avoit parle furent tous assembles dans le Salon et en peu de temps je m y rendis aussi C est souvent l ordre du Ciel que quand on a perdu un plaisir il y en a un autre pret a prendre sa place Ainsi je venois de partir de tres chers amis mais tout a l heure je revins a des parens aussi chers et bon dans le moment Meme que vous me perdiez ose je croire que mon depart vous etait un chagrin vous attendites l arrivee de votre frere et de votre soeur J ai donne a mes soeurs les pommes que vous leur envoyiez avec tant de bonte elles disent qu elles sont sur que Mademoiselle E est tres aimable et bonne l une et l autre sont extremement impatientes de vous voir j espere qu en peu de mois elles auront ce plaisir But it was some time yet before the friends could meet and meanwhile they agreed to correspond once a month There were no events to chronicle in the Haworth letters Quiet days occupied in reaching and feminine occupations in the house did not present much to write about and Charlotte was naturally driven to criticise books Of these there were many in different plights and according to their plight kept in different places The well bound were ranged in the sanctuary of mister Bronte s study but the purchase of books was a necessary luxury to him but as it was often a choice between binding an old one or buying a new one the familiar volume which had been hungrily read by all the members of the family was sometimes in such a condition that the bedroom shelf was considered its fitting place Up and down the house were to be found many standard works of a solid kind Sir Walter Scott s writings Wordsworth s and Southey s poems were among the lighter literature while as having a character of their own earnest wild and occasionally fanatical may be named some of the books which came from the Branwell side of the family from the Cornish followers of the saintly John Wesley and which are touched on in the account of the works to which Caroline Helstone had access in Shirley Some venerable Lady s Magazines that had once performed a voyage with their owner and undergone a storm possibly part of the relics of missus Bronte s possessions contained in the ship wrecked on the coast of Cornwall and whose pages were stained with salt water some mad Methodist Magazines full of miracles and apparitions and preternatural warnings ominous dreams and frenzied fanaticisms and the equally mad letters of missus Elizabeth Rowe from the Dead to the Living mister Bronte encouraged a taste for reading in his girls and though Miss Branwell kept it in due bounds by the variety of household occupations in which she expected them not merely to take a part but to become proficients thereby occupying regularly a good portion of every day they were allowed to get books from the circulating library at Keighley and many a happy walk up those long four miles must they have had burdened with some new book into which they peeped as they hurried home Not that the books were what would generally be called new in the beginning of eighteen thirty three the two friends seem almost simultaneously to have fallen upon Kenilworth and Charlotte writes as follows about it I am glad you like Kenilworth it is certainly more resembling a romance than a novel in my opinion one of the most interesting works that ever emanated from the great Sir Walter s pen Varney is certainly the personification of consummate villainy and in the delineation of his dark and profoundly artful mind Scott exhibits a wonderful knowledge of human nature as well as a surprising skill in embodying his perceptions so as to enable others to become participators in that knowledge Commonplace as this extract may seem it is noteworthy on two or three accounts in the first place instead of discussing the plot or story she analyses the character of Varney and next she knowing nothing of the world both from her youth and her isolated position has yet been so accustomed to hear human nature distrusted as to receive the notion of intense and artful villainy without surprise What was formal and set in her way of writing to E diminished as their personal acquaintance increased and as each came to know the home of the other so that small details concerning people and places had their interest and their significance In the summer of eighteen thirty three she wrote to invite her friend to come and pay her a visit Aunt thought it would be better she says to defer it until about the middle of summer as the winter and even the spring seasons are remarkably cold and bleak among our mountains The first impression made on the visitor by the sisters of her school friend was that Emily was a tall long armed girl more fully grown than her elder sister extremely reserved in manner I distinguish reserve from shyness because I imagine shyness would please if it knew how whereas reserve is indifferent whether it pleases or not Anne like her eldest sister was shy Emily was reserved Branwell was rather a handsome boy with tawny hair to use Miss Bronte s phrase for a more obnoxious colour All were very clever original and utterly different to any people or family E had ever seen before But on the whole it was a happy visit to all parties Charlotte says in writing to E just after her return home Were I to tell you of the impression you have made on every one here you would accuse me of flattery Papa and aunt are continually adducing you as an example for me to shape my actions and behaviour by Emily and Anne say they never saw any one they liked so well as you And Tabby whom you have absolutely fascinated talks a great deal more nonsense about your ladyship than I care to repeat It is now so dark that notwithstanding the singular property of seeing in the night time which the young ladies at Roe Head used to attribute to me I can scribble no longer To a visitor at the parsonage it was a great thing to have Tabby s good word She had a Yorkshire keenness of perception into character and it was not everybody she liked Haworth is built with an utter disregard of all sanitary conditions the great old churchyard lies above all the houses and it is terrible to think how the very water springs of the pumps below must be poisoned But this winter of eighteen thirty three four was particularly wet and rainy and there were an unusual number of deaths in the village A dreary season it was to the family in the parsonage their usual walks obstructed by the spongy state of the moors the passing and funeral bells so frequently tolling and filling the heavy air with their mournful sound and when they were still the chip chip of the mason as he cut the grave stones in a shed close by In many living as it were in a churchyard and with all the sights and sounds connected with the last offices to the dead things of everyday occurrence the very familiarity would have bred indifference But it was otherwise with Charlotte Bronte One of her friends says I have seen her turn pale and feel faint when in Hartshead church some one accidentally remarked that we were walking over graves Charlotte was certainly afraid of death Not only of dead bodies or dying people She dreaded it as something horrible She thought we did not know how long the moment of dissolution might really be or how terrible This was just such a terror as only hypochondriacs can provide for themselves She told me long ago that a misfortune was often preceded by the dream frequently repeated which she gives to Jane Eyre of carrying a little wailing child and being unable to still it She described herself as having the most painful sense of pity for the little thing lying inert as sick children do while she walked about in some gloomy place with it such as the aisle of Haworth Church The misfortunes she mentioned were not always to herself She thought such sensitiveness to omens was like the cholera present to susceptible people some feeling more some less About the beginning of eighteen thirty four E went to London for the first time The idea of her friend s visit seems to have stirred Charlotte strangely She appears to have formed her notions of its probable consequences from some of the papers in the British Essayists The Rambler The Mirror or The Lounger which may have been among the English classics on the parsonage bookshelves for she evidently imagines that an entire change of character for the worse is the usual effect of a visit to the great metropolis and is delighted to find that E is E still And as her faith in her friend s stability is restored her own imagination is deeply moved by the idea of what great wonders are to be seen in that vast and famous city Haworth February twentieth eighteen thirty four Your letter gave me real and heartfelt pleasure mingled with no small share of astonishment Mary had previously informed me of your departure for London and I had not ventured to calculate on any communication from you while surrounded by the splendours and novelties of that great city which has been called the mercantile metropolis of Europe Judging from human nature I thought that a little country girl for the first time in a situation so well calculated to excite curiosity and to distract attention would lose all remembrance for a time at least of distant and familiar objects and give herself up entirely to the fascination of those scenes which were then presented to her view Your kind interesting and most welcome epistle showed me however that I had been both mistaken and uncharitable in these suppositions I was greatly amused at the tone of nonchalance which you assumed while treating of London and its wonders Did you not feel awed while gazing at saint Paul s and Westminster Abbey Had you no feeling of intense and ardent interest when in saint James s you saw the palace where so many of England s kings have held their courts and beheld the representations of their persons on the walls You should not be too much afraid of appearing country bred the magnificence of London has drawn exclamations of astonishment from travelled men experienced in the world its wonders and beauties Have you yet seen anything of the great personages whom the sitting of Parliament now detains in London the Duke of Wellington Sir Robert Peel Earl Grey mister Stanley mister O Connell If I were you I would not be too anxious to spend my time in reading whilst in town Make use of your own eyes for the purposes of observation now and for a time at least lay aside the spectacles with which authors would furnish us In a postscript she adds Will you be kind enough to inform me of the number of performers in the King s military band And in something of the same strain she writes on June nineteenth My own Dear E I may rightfully and truly call you so now You have returned or are returning from London from the great city which is to me as apocryphal as Babylon or Nineveh or ancient Rome You are withdrawing from the world as it is called and bringing with you if your letters enable me to form a correct judgment a heart as unsophisticated as natural as true as that you carried there I am slow very slow to believe the protestations of another I know my own sentiments I can read my own mind but the minds of the rest of man and woman kind are to me sealed volumes hieroglyphical scrolls which I cannot easily either unseal or decipher Yet time careful study long acquaintance overcome most difficulties and in your case I think they have succeeded well in bringing to light and construing that hidden language whose turnings windings inconsistencies and obscurities so frequently baffle the researches of the honest observer of human nature I am truly grateful for your mindfulness of so obscure a person as myself and I hope the pleasure is not altogether selfish I trust it is partly derived from the consciousness that my friend s character is of a higher a more steadfast order than I was once perfectly aware of Few girls would have done as you have done would have beheld the glare and glitter and dazzling display of London with dispositions so unchanged heart so uncontaminated I see no affectation in your letters no trifling no frivolous contempt of plain and weak admiration of showy persons and things In these days of cheap railway trips we may smile at the idea of a short visit to London having any great effect upon the character whatever it may have upon the intellect But her London her great apocryphal city was the town of a century before to which giddy daughters dragged unwilling papas or went with injudicious friends to the detriment of all their better qualities and sometimes to the ruin of their fortunes it was the Vanity Fair of the Pilgrim s Progress to her But see the just and admirable sense with which she can treat a subject of which she is able to overlook all the bearings Haworth July fourth eighteen thirty four In your last you request me to tell you of your faults Now really how can you be so foolish I won t tell you of your faults because I don t know them What a creature would that be who after receiving an affectionate and kind letter from a beloved friend should sit down and write a catalogue of defects by way of answer Imagine me doing so and then consider what epithets you would bestow on me Conceited dogmatical hypocritical little humbug I should think would be the mildest Why child I ve neither time nor inclination to reflect on your faults when you are so far from me and when besides kind letters and presents and so forth are continually bringing forth your goodness in the most prominent light Then too there are judicious relations always round you who can much better discharge that unpleasant office I have no doubt their advice is completely at your service why then should I intrude mine If you will not hear them it will be vain though one should rise from the dead to instruct you Let us have no more nonsense if you love me mister is going to be married is he Well his wife elect appeared to me to be a clever and amiable lady as far as I could judge from the little I saw of her and from your account Now to that flattering sentence must I tack on a list of her faults You say it is in contemplation for you to leave I am sorry for it is a pleasant spot one of the old family halls of England surrounded by lawn and woodland speaking of past times and suggesting to me at least happy feelings M thought you grown less did she I am not grown a bit but as short and dumpy as ever You ask me to recommend you some books for your perusal I will do so in as few words as I can If you like poetry let it be first rate Milton Shakspeare Thomson Goldsmith Pope if you will though I don t admire him Scott Byron Campbell Wordsworth and Southey Now don t be startled at the names of Shakspeare and Byron Both these were great men and their works are like themselves You will know how to choose the good and to avoid the evil the finest passages are always the purest the bad are invariably revolting you will never wish to read them over twice Omit the comedies of Shakspeare and the Don Juan perhaps the Cain of Byron though the latter is a magnificent poem and read the rest fearlessly that must indeed be a depraved mind which can gather evil from Henry VIII from Richard III from Macbeth and Hamlet and Julius Caesar Scott s sweet wild romantic poetry can do you no harm Nor can Wordsworth s nor Campbell s nor Southey s the greatest part at least of his some is certainly objectionable For history read Hume Rollin and the Universal History if you can I never did For fiction read Scott alone all novels after his are worthless For biography read Johnson s Lives of the Poets Boswell s Life of Johnson Southey s Life of Nelson Lockhart s Life of Burns Moore s Life of Sheridan Moore s Life of Byron Wolfe s Remains For natural history read Bewick and Audubon and Goldsmith and White s history of Selborne For divinity your brother will advise you there I can only say adhere to standard authors and avoid novelty From this list we see that she must have had a good range of books from which to choose her own reading It is evident that the womanly consciences of these two correspondents were anxiously alive to many questions discussed among the stricter religionists The morality of Shakspeare needed the confirmation of Charlotte s opinion to the sensitive E and a little later she inquired whether dancing was objectionable when indulged in for an hour or two in parties of boys and girls Charlotte replies I should hesitate to express a difference of opinion from mister or from your excellent sister but really the matter seems to me to stand thus It is allowed on all hands that the sin of dancing consists not in the mere action of shaking the shanks as the Scotch say but in the consequences that usually attend it namely frivolity and waste of time when it is used only as in the case you state for the exercise and amusement of an hour among young people who surely may without any breach of God s commandments be allowed a little light heartedness these consequences cannot follow Ergo according to my manner of arguing the amusement is at such times perfectly innocent Although the distance between Haworth and B was but seventeen miles it was difficult to go straight from the one to the other without hiring a gig or vehicle of some kind for the journey Hence a visit from Charlotte required a good deal of pre arrangement The Haworth gig was not always to be had and mister Bronte was often unwilling to fall into any arrangement for meeting at Bradford or other places which would occasion trouble to others The whole family had an ample share of that sensitive pride which led them to dread incurring obligations and to fear outstaying their welcome when on any visit I am not sure whether mister Bronte did not consider distrust of others as a part of that knowledge of human nature on which he piqued himself His precepts to this effect combined with Charlotte s lack of hope made her always fearful of loving too much of wearying the objects of her affection and thus she was often trying to restrain her warm feelings and was ever chary of that presence so invariably welcome to her true friends According to this mode of acting when she was invited for a month she stayed but a fortnight amidst E s family to whom every visit only endeared her the more and by whom she was received with that kind of quiet gladness with which they would have greeted a sister She still kept up her childish interest in politics In March eighteen thirty five she writes What do you think of the course politics are taking I make this enquiry because I now think you take a wholesome interest in the matter formerly you did not care greatly about it B you see is triumphant Wretch I am a hearty hater and if there is any one I thoroughly abhor it is that man But the Opposition is divided Red hots and Luke warms and the Duke par excellence the Duke and Sir Robert Peel show no signs of insecurity though they have been twice beat so Courage mon amie as the old chevaliers used to say before they joined battle In the middle of the summer of eighteen thirty five a great family plan was mooted at the parsonage The question was to what trade or profession should Branwell be brought up He was now nearly eighteen it was time to decide He was very clever no doubt perhaps to begin with the greatest genius in this rare family The sisters hardly recognised their own or each others powers but they knew his The father ignorant of many failings in moral conduct did proud homage to the great gifts of his son for Branwell s talents were readily and willingly brought out for the entertainment of others Popular admiration was sweet to him And this led to his presence being sought at arvills and all the great village gatherings for the Yorkshiremen have a keen relish for intellect and it likewise procured him the undesirable distinction of having his company recommended by the landlord of the Black Bull to any chance traveller who might happen to feel solitary or dull over his liquor Do you want some one to help you with your bottle sir If you do I ll send up for Patrick so the villagers called him till the day of his death though in his own family he was always Branwell And while the messenger went the landlord entertained his guest with accounts of the wonderful talents of the boy whose precocious cleverness and great conversational powers were the pride of the village The attacks of ill health to which mister Bronte had been subject of late years rendered it not only necessary that he should take his dinner alone for the sake of avoiding temptations to unwholesome diet but made it also desirable that he should pass the time directly succeeding his meals in perfect quiet And this necessity combined with due attention to his parochial duties made him partially ignorant how his son employed himself out of lesson time His own youth had been spent among people of the same conventional rank as those into whose companionship Branwell was now thrown but he had had a strong will and an earnest and persevering ambition and a resoluteness of purpose which his weaker son wanted It is singular how strong a yearning the whole family had towards the art of drawing mister Bronte had been very solicitous to get them good instruction the girls themselves loved everything connected with it all descriptions or engravings of great pictures and in default of good ones they would take and analyse any print or drawing which came in their way and find out how much thought had gone to its composition what ideas it was intended to suggest and what it did suggest In the same spirit they laboured to design imaginations of their own they lacked the power of execution not of conception At one time Charlotte had the notion of making her living as an artist and wearied her eyes in drawing with pre Raphaelite minuteness but not with pre Raphaelite accuracy for she drew from fancy rather than from nature But they all thought there could be no doubt about Branwell s talent for drawing I have seen an oil painting of his done I know not when but probably about this time It was a group of his sisters life size three quarters length not much better than sign painting as to manipulation but the likenesses were I should think admirable I could only judge of the fidelity with which the other two were depicted from the striking resemblance which Charlotte upholding the great frame of canvas and consequently standing right behind it bore to her own representation though it must have been ten years and more since the portraits were taken The picture was divided almost in the middle by a great pillar On the side of the column which was lighted by the sun stood Charlotte in the womanly dress of that day of gigot sleeves and large collars On the deeply shadowed side was Emily with Anne s gentle face resting on her shoulder Emily s countenance struck me as full of power Charlotte s of solicitude Anne s of tenderness The two younger seemed hardly to have attained their full growth though Emily was taller than Charlotte they had cropped hair and a more girlish dress I remember looking on those two sad earnest shadowed faces and wondering whether I could trace the mysterious expression which is said to foretell an early death I had some fond superstitious hope that the column divided their fates from hers who stood apart in the canvas as in life she survived I liked to see that the bright side of the pillar was towards her that the light in the picture fell on her I might more truly have sought in her presentment nay in her living face for the sign of death in her prime They were good likenesses however badly executed From thence I should guess his family augured truly that if Branwell had but the opportunity and alas had but the moral qualities he might turn out a great painter The best way of preparing him to become so appeared to be to send him as a pupil to the Royal Academy I dare say he longed and yearned to follow this path principally because it would lead him to that mysterious London that Babylon the great which seems to have filled the imaginations and haunted the minds of all the younger members of this recluse family To Branwell it was more than a vivid imagination it was an impressed reality By dint of studying maps he was as well acquainted with it even down to its by ways as if he had lived there Poor misguided fellow this craving to see and know London and that stronger craving after fame were never to be satisfied He was to die at the end of a short and blighted life But in this year of eighteen thirty five all his home kindred were thinking how they could best forward his views and how help him up to the pinnacle where he desired to be What their plans were let Charlotte explain These are not the first sisters who have laid their lives as a sacrifice before their brother s idolized wish Would to God they might be the last who met with such a miserable return Haworth July sixth eighteen thirty five I had hoped to have had the extreme pleasure of seeing you at Haworth this summer but human affairs are mutable and human resolutions must bend to the course of events We are all about to divide break up separate Emily is going to school Branwell is going to London and I am going to be a governess This last determination I formed myself knowing that I should have to take the step sometime and better sune as syne to use the Scotch proverb and knowing well that papa would have enough to do with his limited income should Branwell be placed at the Royal Academy and Emily at Roe Head Where am I going to reside you will ask Within four miles of you at a place neither of us is unacquainted with being no other than the identical Roe Head mentioned above Yes I am going to teach in the very school where I was myself taught Miss W made me the offer and I preferred it to one or two proposals of private governess ship which I had before received I am sad very sad at the thoughts of leaving home but duty necessity these are stern mistresses who will not be disobeyed Did I not once say you ought to be thankful for your independence I felt what I said at the time and I repeat it now with double earnestness if anything would cheer me it is the idea of being so near you Surely you and Polly will come and see me it would be wrong in me to doubt it you were never unkind yet Emily and I leave home on the twenty seventh of this month the idea of being together consoles us both somewhat and truth since I must enter a situation My lines have fallen in pleasant places I both love and respect Miss W CHAPTER VIII On the twenty ninth of July eighteen thirty five Charlotte now a little more than nineteen years old went as teacher to Miss W s Emily accompanied her as a pupil but she became literally ill from home sickness and could not settle to anything and after passing only three months at Roe Head returned to the parsonage and the beloved moors Miss Bronte gives the following reasons as those which prevented Emily s remaining at school and caused the substitution of her younger sister in her place at Miss W s My sister Emily loved the moors Flowers brighter than the rose bloomed in the blackest of the heath for her out of a sullen hollow in a livid hill side her mind could make an Eden She found in the bleak solitude many and dear delights and not the least and best loved was liberty Liberty was the breath of Emily s nostrils without it she perished The change from her own home to a school and from her own very noiseless very secluded but unrestricted and unartificial mode of life to one of disciplined routine though under the kindest auspices was what she failed in enduring Her nature proved here too strong for her fortitude Every morning when she woke the vision of home and the moors rushed on her and darkened and saddened the day that lay before her Nobody knew what ailed her but me I knew only too well In this struggle her health was quickly broken her white face attenuated form and failing strength threatened rapid decline I felt in my heart she would die if she did not go home and with this conviction obtained her recall She had only been three months at school and it was some years before the experiment of sending her from home was again ventured on This physical suffering on Emily s part when absent from Haworth after recurring several times under similar circumstances became at length so much an acknowledged fact that whichever was obliged to leave home the sisters decided that Emily must remain there where alone she could enjoy anything like good health She left it twice again in her life once going as teacher to a school in Halifax for six months and afterwards accompanying Charlotte to Brussels for ten When at home she took the principal part of the cooking upon herself and did all the household ironing and after Tabby grew old and infirm it was Emily who made all the bread for the family and any one passing by the kitchen door might have seen her studying German out of an open book propped up before her as she kneaded the dough but no study however interesting interfered with the goodness of the bread which was always light and excellent Books were indeed a very common sight in that kitchen the girls were taught by their father theoretically and by their aunt practically that to take an active part in all household work was in their position woman s simple duty but in their careful employment of time they found many an odd five minutes for reading while watching the cakes and managed the union of two kinds of employment better than King Alfred Charlotte s life at Miss W s was a very happy one until her health failed She sincerely loved and respected the former schoolmistress to whom she was now become both companion and friend The girls were hardly strangers to her some of them being younger sisters of those who had been her own playmates Though the duties of the day might be tedious and monotonous there were always two or three happy hours to look forward to in the evening when she and Miss W sat together sometimes late into the night and had quiet pleasant conversations or pauses of silence as agreeable because each felt that as soon as a thought or remark occurred which they wished to express there was an intelligent companion ready to sympathise and yet they were not compelled to make talk Miss W was always anxious to afford Miss Bronte every opportunity of recreation in her power but the difficulty often was to persuade her to avail herself of the invitations which came urging her to spend Saturday and Sunday with E and Mary in their respective homes that lay within the distance of a walk She was too apt to consider that allowing herself a holiday was a dereliction of duty and to refuse herself the necessary change from something of an over ascetic spirit betokening a loss of healthy balance in either body or mind Indeed it is clear that such was the case from a passage referring to this time in the letter of Mary from which I have before given extracts Three years after the period when they were at school together I heard that she had gone as teacher to Miss W s I went to see her and asked how she could give so much for so little money when she could live without it She owned that after clothing herself and Anne there was nothing left though she had hoped to be able to save something She confessed it was not brilliant but what could she do I had nothing to answer She seemed to have no interest or pleasure beyond the feeling of duty and when she could get used to sit alone and make out She told me afterwards that one evening she had sat in the dressing room until it was quite dark and then observing it all at once had taken sudden fright No doubt she remembered this well when she described a similar terror getting hold upon Jane Eyre She says in the story I sat looking at the white bed and overshadowed walls occasionally turning a fascinated eye towards the gleaming mirror I began to recall what I had heard of dead men troubled in their graves I endeavoured to be firm shaking my hair from my eyes I lifted my head and tried to look boldly through the dark room at this moment a ray from the moon penetrated some aperture in the blind No moon light was still and this stirred prepared as my mind was for horror shaken as my nerves were by agitation I thought the swift darting beam was a herald of some coming vision from another world My heart beat thick my head grew hot a sound filled my ears which I deemed the rustling of wings something seemed near me From that time Mary adds her imaginations became gloomy or frightful she could not help it nor help thinking She could not forget the gloom could not sleep at night nor attend in the day She told me that one night sitting alone about this time she heard a voice repeat these lines Come thou high and holy feeling Shine o er mountain flit o er wave Gleam like light o er dome and shielding There were eight or ten more lines which I forget She insisted that she had not made them that she had heard a voice repeat them It is possible that she had read them and unconsciously recalled them They are not in the volume of poems which the sisters published She repeated a verse of Isaiah which she said had inspired them and which I have forgotten Whether the lines were recollected or invented the tale proves such habits of sedentary monotonous solitude of thought as would have shaken a feebler mind Of course the state of health thus described came on gradually and is not to be taken as a picture of her condition in eighteen thirty six Yet even then there is a despondency in some of her expressions that too sadly reminds one of some of Cowper s letters And it is remarkable how deeply his poems impressed her His words his verses came more frequently to her memory I imagine than those of any other poet Mary says Cowper s poem The Castaway was known to them all and they all at times appreciated or almost appropriated it Charlotte told me once that Branwell had done so and though his depression was the result of his faults it was in no other respect different from hers Both were not mental but physical illnesses She was well aware of this and would ask how that mended matters as the feeling was there all the same and was not removed by knowing the cause She had a larger religious toleration than a person would have who had never questioned and the manner of recommending religion was always that of offering comfort not fiercely enforcing a duty One time I mentioned that some one had asked me what religion I was of with the view of getting me for a partizan and that I had said that that was between God and me Emily who was lying on the hearth rug exclaimed That s right This was all I ever heard Emily say on religious subjects Charlotte was free from religious depression when in tolerable health when that failed her depression returned You have probably seen such instances They don t get over their difficulties they forget them when their stomach or whatever organ it is that inflicts such misery on sedentary people will let them I have heard her condemn Socinianism Calvinism and many other isms inconsistent with Church of Englandism I used to wonder at her acquaintance with such subjects May tenth eighteen thirty six I was struck with the note you sent me with the umbrella it showed a degree of interest in my concerns which I have no right to expect from any earthly creature I won t play the hypocrite I won t answer your kind gentle friendly questions in the way you wish me to Don t deceive yourself by imagining I have a bit of real goodness about me My darling if I were like you I should have my face Zion ward though prejudice and error might occasionally fling a mist over the glorious vision before me but I am not like you If you knew my thoughts the dreams that absorb me and the fiery imagination that at times eats me up and makes me feel society as it is wretchedly insipid you would pity and I dare say despise me But I know the treasures of the Bible I love and adore them I can see the Well of Life in all its clearness and brightness but when I stoop down to drink of the pure waters they fly from my lips as if I were Tantalus You are far too kind and frequent in your invitations You puzzle me I hardly know how to refuse and it is still more embarrassing to accept At any rate I cannot come this week for we are in the very thickest melee of the Repetitions I was hearing the terrible fifth section when your note arrived But Miss Wooler says I must go to Mary next Friday as she promised for me on Whit Sunday and on Sunday morning I will join you at church if it be convenient and stay till Monday There s a free and easy proposal Miss W has driven me to it She says her character is implicated Good kind Miss W however monotonous and trying were the duties Charlotte had to perform under her roof there was always a genial and thoughtful friend watching over her and urging her to partake of any little piece of innocent recreation that might come in her way And in those Midsummer holidays of eighteen thirty six her friend E came to stay with her at Haworth so there was one happy time secured Here follows a series of letters not dated but belonging to the latter portion of this year and again we think of the gentle and melancholy Cowper My dear dear E I am at this moment trembling all over with excitement after reading your note it is what I never received before it is the unrestrained pouring out of a warm gentle generous heart I thank you with energy for this kindness I will no longer shrink from answering your questions I do wish to be better than I am I pray fervently sometimes to be made so I have stings of conscience visitings of remorse glimpses of holy of inexpressible things which formerly I used to be a stranger to it may all die away and I may be in utter midnight but I implore a merciful Redeemer that if this be the dawn of the gospel it may still brighten to perfect day Do not mistake me do not think I am good I only wish to be so I only hate my former flippancy and forwardness Oh I am no better than ever I was I am in that state of horrid gloomy uncertainty that at this moment I would submit to be old grey haired to have passed all my youthful days of enjoyment and to be settling on the verge of the grave if I could only thereby ensure the prospect of reconciliation to God and redemption through his Son s merits I never was exactly careless of these matters but I have always taken a clouded and repulsive view of them and now if possible the clouds are gathering darker and a more oppressive despondency weighs on my spirits You have cheered me my darling for one moment for an atom of time I thought I might call you my own sister in the spirit but the excitement is past and I am now as wretched and hopeless as ever This very night I will pray as you wish me May the Almighty hear me compassionately and I humbly hope he will for you will strengthen my polluted petitions with your own pure requests All is bustle and confusion round me the ladies pressing with their sums and their lessons If you love me do do do come on Friday I shall watch and wait for you and if you disappoint me I shall weep I wish you could know the thrill of delight which I experienced when as I stood at the dining room window I saw as he whirled past toss your little packet over the wall Huddersfield market day was still the great period for events at Roe Head Then girls running round the corner of the house and peeping between tree stems and up a shadowy lane could catch a glimpse of a father or brother driving to market in his gig might perhaps exchange a wave of the hand or see as Charlotte Bronte did from the window a white packet tossed over the avail by come swift strong motion of an arm the rest of the traveller s body unseen Weary with a day s hard work I am sitting down to write a few lines to my dear E Excuse me if I say nothing but nonsense for my mind is exhausted and dispirited It is a stormy evening and the wind is uttering a continual moaning sound that makes me feel very melancholy At such times in such moods as these it is my nature to seek repose in some calm tranquil idea and I have now summoned up your image to give me rest There you sit upright and still in your black dress and white scarf and pale marble like face just like reality I wish you would speak to me If we should be separated if it should be our lot to live at a great distance and never to see each other again in old age how I should conjure up the memory of my youthful days and what a melancholy pleasure I should feel in dwelling on the recollection of my early friend I have some qualities that make me very miserable some feelings that you can have no participation in that few very few people in the world can at all understand I don t pride myself on these peculiarities I strive to conceal and suppress them as much as I can but they burst out sometimes and then those who see the explosion despise me and I hate myself for days afterwards I have just received your epistle and what accompanied it I can t tell what should induce you and your sisters to waste your kindness on such a one as me I m obliged to them and I hope you ll tell them so I m obliged to you also more for your note than for your present The first gave me pleasure the last something like pain The nervous disturbance which is stated to have troubled her while she was at Miss W s seems to have begun to distress her about this time at least she herself speaks of her irritable condition which was certainly only a temporary ailment You have been very kind to me of late and have spared me all those little sallies of ridicule which owing to my miserable and wretched touchiness of character used formerly to make me wince as if I had been touched with a hot iron things that nobody else cares for enter into my mind and rankle there like venom I know these feelings are absurd and therefore I try to hide them but they only sting the deeper for concealment Compare this state of mind with the gentle resignation with which she had submitted to be put aside as useless or told of her ugliness by her school fellows only three years before My life since I saw you has passed as monotonously and unbroken as ever nothing but teach teach teach from morning till night The greatest variety I ever have is afforded by a letter from you or by meeting with a pleasant new book The Life of Oberlin and Leigh Richmond s Domestic Portraiture are the last of this description The latter work strongly attracted and strangely fascinated my attention Beg borrow or steal it without delay and read the Memoir of Wilberforce that short record of a brief uneventful life I shall never forget it it is beautiful not on account of the language in which it is written not on account of the incidents it details but because of the simple narrative it gives of a young talented sincere Christian About this time Miss W removed her school from the fine open breezy situation of Roe Head to Dewsbury Moor only two or three miles distant Her new residence was on a lower site and the air was less exhilarating to one bred in the wild hill village of Haworth Emily had gone as teacher to a school at Halifax where there were nearly forty pupils I have had one letter from her since her departure writes Charlotte on October second eighteen thirty six it gives an appalling account of her duties hard labour from six in the morning to eleven at night with only one half hour of exercise between This is slavery I fear she can never stand it When the sisters met at home in the Christmas holidays they talked over their lives and the prospect which they afforded of employment and remuneration They felt that it was a duty to relieve their father of the burden of their support if not entirely or that of all three at least that of one or two and naturally the lot devolved upon the elder ones to find some occupation which would enable them to do this They knew that they were never likely to inherit much money mister Bronte had but a small stipend and was both charitable and liberal Their aunt had an annuity of fifty l but it reverted to others at her death and her nieces had no right and were the last persons in the world to reckon upon her savings What could they do Charlotte and Emily were trying teaching and as it seemed without much success The former it is true had the happiness of having a friend for her employer and of being surrounded by those who knew her and loved her but her salary was too small for her to save out of it and her education did not entitle her to a larger The sedentary and monotonous nature of the life too was preying upon her health and spirits although with necessity as her mistress she might hardly like to acknowledge this even to herself But Emily that free wild untameable spirit never happy nor well but on the sweeping moors that gathered round her home that hater of strangers doomed to live amongst them and not merely to live but to slave in their service what Charlotte could have borne patiently for herself she could not bear for her sister And yet what to do She had once hoped that she herself might become an artist and so earn her livelihood but her eyes had failed her in the minute and useless labour which she had imposed upon herself with a view to this end It was the household custom among these girls to sew till nine o clock at night At that hour Miss Branwell generally went to bed and her nieces duties for the day were accounted done They put away their work and began to pace the room backwards and forwards up and down as often with the candles extinguished for economy s sake as not their figures glancing into the fire light and out into the shadow perpetually At this time they talked over past cares and troubles they planned for the future and consulted each other as to their plans In after years this was the time for discussing together the plots of their novels And again still later this was the time for the last surviving sister to walk alone from old accustomed habit round and round the desolate room thinking sadly upon the days that were no more But this Christmas of eighteen thirty six was not without its hopes and daring aspirations They had tried their hands at story writing in their miniature magazine long ago they all of them made out perpetually They had likewise attempted to write poetry and had a modest confidence that they had achieved a tolerable success But they knew that they might deceive themselves and that sisters judgments of each other s productions were likely to be too partial to be depended upon So Charlotte as the eldest resolved to write to Southey I believe from an expression in a letter to be noticed hereafter that she also consulted Coleridge but I have not met with any part of that correspondence On December twenty ninth her letter to Southey was despatched and from an excitement not unnatural in a girl who has worked herself up to the pitch of writing to a Poet Laureate and asking his opinion of her poems she used some high flown expressions which probably gave him the idea that she was a romantic young lady unacquainted with the realities of life This most likely was the first of those adventurous letters that passed through the little post office of Haworth Morning after morning of the holidays slipped away and there was no answer the sisters had to leave home and Emily to return to her distasteful duties without knowing even whether Charlotte s letter had ever reached its destination Not dispirited however by the delay Branwell determined to try a similar venture and addressed the following letter to Wordsworth It was given by the poet to mister Quillinan in eighteen fifty after the name of Bronte had become known and famous I have no means of ascertaining what answer was returned by mister Wordsworth but that he considered the letter remarkable may I think be inferred both from its preservation and its recurrence to his memory when the real name of Currer Bell was made known to the public Haworth near Bradford Yorkshire January nineteen eighteen thirty seven Sir I most earnestly entreat you to read and pass your judgment upon what I have sent you because from the day of my birth to this the nineteenth year of my life I have lived among secluded hills where I could neither know what I was or what I could do I read for the same reason that I ate or drank because it was a real craving of nature I wrote on the same principle as I spoke out of the impulse and feelings of the mind nor could I help it for what came came out and there was the end of it For as to self conceit that could not receive food from flattery since to this hour not half a dozen people in the world know that I have ever penned a line But a change has taken place now sir and I am arrived at an age wherein I must do something for myself the powers I possess must be exercised to a definite end and as I don t know them myself I must ask of others what they are worth Yet there is not one here to tell me and still if they are worthless time will henceforth be too precious to be wasted on them Do pardon me sir that I have ventured to come before one whose works I have most loved in our literature and who most has been with me a divinity of the mind laying before him one of my writings and asking of him a judgment of its contents I must come before some one from whose sentence there is no appeal and such a one is he who has developed the theory of poetry as well as its practice and both in such a way as to claim a place in the memory of a thousand years to come My aim sir is to push out into the open world and for this I trust not poetry alone that might launch the vessel but could not bear her on sensible and scientific prose bold and vigorous efforts in my walk in life would give a farther title to the notice of the world and then again poetry ought to brighten and crown that name with glory but nothing of all this can be ever begun without means and as I don t possess these I must in every shape strive to gain them Surely in this day when there is not a writing poet worth a sixpence the field must be open if a better man can step forward What I send you is the Prefatory Scene of a much longer subject in which I have striven to develop strong passions and weak principles struggling with a high imagination and acute feelings till as youth hardens towards age evil deeds and short enjoyments end in mental misery and bodily ruin Now to send you the whole of this would be a mock upon your patience what you see does not even pretend to be more than the description of an imaginative child But read it sir and as you would hold a light to one in utter darkness as you value your own kindheartedness return me an answer if but one word telling me whether I should write on or write no more Forgive undue warmth because my feelings in this matter cannot be cool and believe me sir with deep respect Your really humble servant P B Bronte The poetry enclosed seems to me by no means equal to parts of the letter but as every one likes to judge for himself I copy the six opening stanzas about a third of the whole and certainly not the worst So where he reigns in glory bright Above those starry skies of night Amid his Paradise of light Oh why may I not be Oft when awake on Christmas morn In sleepless twilight laid forlorn Strange thoughts have o er my mind been borne How he has died for me And oft within my chamber lying Have I awaked myself with crying From dreams where I beheld Him dying Upon the accursed Tree And often has my mother said While on her lap I laid my head She feared for time I was not made But for Eternity So I can read my title clear To mansions in the skies And let me bid farewell to fear And wipe my weeping eyes I ll lay me down on this marble stone And set the world aside To see upon her ebon throne The Moon in glory ride Soon after Charlotte returned to Dewsbury Moor she was distressed by hearing that her friend E was likely to leave the neighbourhood for a considerable length of time Feb twentieth What shall I do without you How long are we likely to be separated Why are we to be denied each other s society It is an inscrutable fatality I long to be with you because it seems as if two or three days or weeks spent in your company would beyond measure strengthen me in the enjoyment of those feelings which I have so lately begun to cherish You first pointed out to me that way in which I am so feebly endeavouring to travel and now I cannot keep you by my side I must proceed sorrowfully alone Why are we to be divided Surely it must be because we are in danger of loving each other too well of losing sight of the Creator in idolatry of the creature At first I could not say Thy will be done I felt rebellious but I knew it was wrong to feel so Being left a moment alone this morning I prayed fervently to be enabled to resign myself to every decree of God s will though it should be dealt forth by a far severer hand than the present disappointment since then I have felt calmer and humbler and consequently happier Last Sunday I took up my Bible in a gloomy state of mind I began to read a feeling stole over me such as I have not known for many long years a sweet placid sensation like those I remember which used to visit me when I was a little child and on Sunday evenings in summer stood by the open window reading the life of a certain French nobleman who attained a purer and higher degree of sanctity than has been known since the days of the early martyrs E s residence was equally within a walk from Dewsbury Moor as it had been from Roe Head and on Saturday afternoons both Mary and she used to call upon Charlotte and often endeavoured to persuade her to return with them and be the guest of one of them till Monday morning but this was comparatively seldom Mary says She visited us twice or thrice when she was at Miss W s We used to dispute about politics and religion She a Tory and clergyman s daughter was always in a minority of one in our house of violent Dissent and Radicalism She used to hear over again delivered with authority all the lectures I had been used to give her at school on despotic aristocracy mercenary priesthood c She had not energy to defend herself sometimes she owned to a little truth in it but generally said nothing Her feeble health gave her her yielding manner for she could never oppose any one without gathering up all her strength for the struggle Thus she would let me advise and patronise most imperiously sometimes picking out any grain of sense there might be in what I said but never allowing any one materially to interfere with her independence of thought and action Though her silence sometimes left one under the impression that she agreed when she did not she never gave a flattering opinion and thus her words were golden whether for praise or blame Mary s father was a man of remarkable intelligence but of strong not to say violent prejudices all running in favour of Republicanism and Dissent No other county but Yorkshire could have produced such a man His brother had been a detenu in France and had afterwards voluntarily taken up his residence there mister T himself had been much abroad both on business and to see the great continental galleries of paintings He spoke French perfectly I have been told when need was but delighted usually in talking the broadest Yorkshire He bought splendid engravings of the pictures which he particularly admired and his house was full of works of art and of books but he rather liked to present his rough side to any stranger or new comer he would speak his broadest bring out his opinions on Church and State in their most startling forms and by and by if he found his hearer could stand the shock he would involuntarily show his warm kind heart and his true taste and real refinement His family of four sons and two daughters were brought up on Republican principles independence of thought and action was encouraged no shams tolerated They are scattered far and wide Martha the younger daughter sleeps in the Protestant cemetery at Brussels Mary is in New Zealand mister T is dead And so life and death have dispersed the circle of violent Radicals and Dissenters into which twenty years ago the little quiet resolute clergyman s daughter was received and by whom she was truly loved and honoured January and February of eighteen thirty seven had passed away and still there was no reply from Southey Probably she had lost expectation and almost hope when at length in the beginning of March she received the letter inserted in mister C C Southey s life of his Father vol iv p three hundred twenty seven After accounting for his delay in replying to hers by the fact of a long absence from home during which his letters had accumulated whence it has lain unanswered till the last of a numerous file not from disrespect or indifference to its contents but because in truth it is not an easy task to answer it nor a pleasant one to cast a damp over the high spirits and the generous desires of youth he goes on to say What you are I can only infer from your letter which appears to be written in sincerity though I may suspect that you have used a fictitious signature Be that as it may the letter and the verses bear the same stamp and I can well understand the state of mind they indicate It is not my advice that you have asked as to the direction of your talents but my opinion of them and yet the opinion may be worth little and the advice much You evidently possess and in no inconsiderable degree what Wordsworth calls the faculty of verse I am not depreciating it when I say that in these times it is not rare Many volumes of poems are now published every year without attracting public attention any one of which if it had appeared half a century ago would have obtained a high reputation for its author Whoever therefore is ambitious of distinction in this way ought to be prepared for disappointment But it is not with a view to distinction that you should cultivate this talent if you consult your own happiness I who have made literature my profession and devoted my life to it and have never for a moment repented of the deliberate choice think myself nevertheless bound in duty to caution every young man who applies as an aspirant to me for encouragement and advice against taking so perilous a course You will say that a woman has no need of such a caution there can be no peril in it for her In a certain sense this is true but there is a danger of which I would with all kindness and all earnestness warn you The day dreams in which you habitually indulge are likely to induce a distempered state of mind and in proportion as all the ordinary uses of the world seem to you flat and unprofitable you will be unfitted for them without becoming fitted for anything else Literature cannot be the business of a woman s life and it ought not to be The more she is engaged in her proper duties the less leisure will she have for it even as an accomplishment and a recreation To those duties you have not yet been called and when you are you will be less eager for celebrity You will not seek in imagination for excitement of which the vicissitudes of this life and the anxieties from which you must not hope to be exempted be your state what it may will bring with them but too much But do not suppose that I disparage the gift which you possess nor that I would discourage you from exercising it I only exhort you so to think of it and so to use it as to render it conducive to your own permanent good Write poetry for its own sake not in a spirit of emulation and not with a view to celebrity the less you aim at that the more likely you will be to deserve and finally to obtain it So written it is wholesome both for the heart and soul it may be made the surest means next to religion of soothing the mind and elevating it You may embody in it your best thoughts and your wisest feelings and in so doing discipline and strengthen them Farewell madam It is not because I have forgotten that I was once young myself that I write to you in this strain but because I remember it You will neither doubt my sincerity nor my good will and however ill what has here been said may accord with your present views and temper the longer you live the more reasonable it will appear to you Though I may be but an ungracious adviser you will allow me therefore to subscribe myself with the best wishes for your happiness here and hereafter your true friend ROBERT SOUTHEY I was with Miss Bronte when she received mister Cuthbert Southey s note requesting her permission to insert the foregoing letter in his father s life She said to me mister Southey s letter was kind and admirable a little stringent but it did me good It is partly because I think it so admirable and partly because it tends to bring out her character as shown in the following reply that I have taken the liberty of inserting the foregoing extracts from it Sir March sixteenth I cannot rest till I have answered your letter even though by addressing you a second time I should appear a little intrusive but I must thank you for the kind and wise advice you have condescended to give me I had not ventured to hope for such a reply so considerate in its tone so noble in its spirit I must suppress what I feel or you will think me foolishly enthusiastic At the first perusal of your letter I felt only shame and regret that I had ever ventured to trouble you with my crude rhapsody I felt a painful heat rise to my face when I thought of the quires of paper I had covered with what once gave me so much delight but which now was only a source of confusion but after I had thought a little and read it again and again the prospect seemed to clear You do not forbid me to write you do not say that what I write is utterly destitute of merit You only warn me against the folly of neglecting real duties for the sake of imaginative pleasures of writing for the love of fame for the selfish excitement of emulation You kindly allow me to write poetry for its own sake provided I leave undone nothing which I ought to do in order to pursue that single absorbing exquisite gratification I am afraid sir you think me very foolish I know the first letter I wrote to you was all senseless trash from beginning to end but I am not altogether the idle dreaming being it would seem to denote My father is a clergyman of limited though competent income and I am the eldest of his children He expended quite as much in my education as he could afford in justice to the rest I thought it therefore my duty when I left school to become a governess In that capacity I find enough to occupy my thoughts all day long and my head and hands too without having a moment s time for one dream of the imagination In the evenings I confess I do think but I never trouble any one else with my thoughts I carefully avoid any appearance of preoccupation and eccentricity which might lead those I live amongst to suspect the nature of my pursuits Following my father s advice who from my childhood has counselled me just in the wise and friendly tone of your letter I have endeavoured not only attentively to observe all the duties a woman ought to fulfil but to feel deeply interested in them I don t always succeed for sometimes when I m teaching or sewing I would rather be reading or writing but I try to deny myself and my father s approbation amply rewarded me for the privation Once more allow me to thank you with sincere gratitude I trust I shall never more feel ambitious to see my name in print if the wish should rise I ll look at Southey s letter and suppress it It is honour enough for me that I have written to him and received an answer That letter is consecrated no one shall ever see it but papa and my brother and sisters Again I thank you This incident I suppose will be renewed no more if I live to be an old woman I shall remember it thirty years hence as a bright dream The signature which you suspected of being fictitious is my real name Again therefore I must sign myself C Bronte P S Pray sir excuse me for writing to you a second time I could not help writing partly to tell you how thankful I am for your kindness and partly to let you know that your advice shall not be wasted however sorrowfully and reluctantly it may be at first followed C B I cannot deny myself the gratification of inserting Southey s reply Keswick March twenty two eighteen thirty seven Dear Madam Your letter has given me great pleasure and I should not forgive myself if I did not tell you so You have received admonition as considerately and as kindly as it was given Let me now request that if you ever should come to these Lakes while I am living here you will let me see you You would then think of me afterwards with the more good will because you would perceive that there is neither severity nor moroseness in the state of mind to which years and observation have brought me It is by God s mercy in our power to attain a degree of self government which is essential to our own happiness and contributes greatly to that of those around us Take care of over excitement and endeavour to keep a quiet mind even for your health it is the best advice that can be given you your moral and spiritual improvement will then keep pace with the culture of your intellectual powers And now madam God bless you Farewell and believe me to be your sincere friend ROBERT SOUTHEY Of this second letter also she spoke and told me that it contained an invitation for her to go and see the poet if ever she visited the Lakes But there was no money to spare said she nor any prospect of my ever earning money enough to have the chance of so great a pleasure so I gave up thinking of it At the time we conversed together on the subject we were at the Lakes But Southey was dead This stringent letter made her put aside for a time all idea of literary enterprise She bent her whole energy towards the fulfilment of the duties in hand but her occupation was not sufficient food for her great forces of intellect and they cried out perpetually Give give while the comparatively less breezy air of Dewsbury Moor told upon her health and spirits more and more On August twenty seven eighteen thirty seven she writes I am again at Dewsbury engaged in the old business teach teach teach When will you come home Make haste You have been at Bath long enough for all purposes by this time you have acquired polish enough I am sure if the varnish is laid on much thicker I am afraid the good wood underneath will be quite concealed and your Yorkshire friends won t stand that Come come I am getting really tired of your absence Saturday after Saturday comes round and I can have no hope of hearing your knock at the door and then being told that Miss E is come Oh dear in this monotonous life of mine that was a pleasant event I wish it would recur again but it will take two or three interviews before the stiffness the estrangement of this long separation will wear away About this time she forgot to return a work bag she had borrowed by a messenger and in repairing her error she says These aberrations of memory warn me pretty intelligibly that I am getting past my prime AEtat twenty one And the same tone of despondency runs through the following letter I wish exceedingly that I could come to you before Christmas but it is impossible another three weeks must elapse before I shall again have my comforter beside me under the roof of my own dear quiet home If I could always live with you and daily read the Bible with you if your lips and mine could at the same time drink the same draught from the same pure fountain of mercy I hope I trust I might one day become better far better than my evil wandering thoughts my corrupt heart cold to the spirit and warm to the flesh will now permit me to be I often plan the pleasant life which we might lead together strengthening each other in that power of self denial that hallowed and glowing devotion which the first saints of God often attained to My eyes fill with tears when I contrast the bliss of such a state brightened by hopes of the future with the melancholy state I now live in uncertain that I ever felt true contrition wandering in thought and deed longing for holiness which I shall never never obtain smitten at times to the heart with the conviction that ghastly Calvinistic doctrines are true darkened in short by the very shadows of spiritual death If Christian perfection be necessary to salvation I shall never be saved my heart is a very hotbed for sinful thoughts and when I decide on an action I scarcely remember to look to my Redeemer for direction I know not how to pray I cannot bend my life to the grand end of doing good I go on constantly seeking my own pleasure pursuing the gratification of my own desires I forget God and will not God forget me And meantime I know the greatness of Jehovah I acknowledge the perfection of His word I adore the purity of the Christian faith my theory is right my practice horribly wrong The Christmas holidays came and she and Anne returned to the parsonage and to that happy home circle in which alone their natures expanded amongst all other people they shrivelled up more or less Indeed there were only one or two strangers who could be admitted among the sisters without producing the same result Emily and Anne were bound up in their lives and interests like twins The former from reserve the latter from timidity avoided all friendships and intimacies beyond their family Emily was impervious to influence she never came in contact with public opinion and her own decision of what was right and fitting was a law for her conduct and appearance with which she allowed no one to interfere Her love was poured out on Anne as Charlotte s was on her But the affection among all the three was stronger than either death or life E was eagerly welcomed by Charlotte freely admitted by Emily and kindly received by Anne whenever she could visit them and this Christmas she had promised to do so but her coming had to be delayed on account of a little domestic accident detailed in the following letter Dec twenty nine eighteen thirty seven I am sure you will have thought me very remiss in not sending my promised letter long before now but I have a sufficient and very melancholy excuse in an accident that befell our old faithful Tabby a few days after my return home She was gone out into the village on some errand when as she was descending the steep street her foot slipped on the ice and she fell it was dark and no one saw her mischance till after a time her groans attracted the attention of a passer by She was lifted up and carried into the druggist s near and after the examination it was discovered that she had completely shattered and dislocated one leg Unfortunately the fracture could not be set till six o clock the next morning as no surgeon was to be had before that time and she now lies at our house in a very doubtful and dangerous state Of course we are all exceedingly distressed at the circumstance for she was like one of our own family Since the event we have been almost without assistance a person has dropped in now and then to do the drudgery but we have as yet been able to procure no regular servant and consequently the whole work of the house as well as the additional duty of nursing Tabby falls on ourselves Under these circumstances I dare not press your visit here at least until she is pronounced out of danger it would be too selfish of me Aunt wished me to give you this information before but papa and all the rest were anxious I should delay until we saw whether matters took a more settled aspect and I myself kept putting it off from day to day most bitterly reluctant to give up all the pleasure I had anticipated so long However remembering what you told me namely that you had commended the matter to a higher decision than ours and that you were resolved to submit with resignation to that decision whatever it might be I hold it my duty to yield also and to be silent it may be all for the best I fear if you had been here during this severe weather your visit would have been of no advantage to you for the moors are blockaded with snow and you would never have been able to get out After this disappointment I never dare reckon with certainty on the enjoyment of a pleasure again it seems as if some fatality stood between you and me I am not good enough for you and you must be kept from the contamination of too intimate society I would urge your visit yet I would entreat and press it but the thought comes across me should Tabby die while you are in the house I should never forgive myself No it must not be and in a thousand ways the consciousness of that mortifies and disappoints me most keenly and I am not the only one who is disappointed All in the house were looking to your visit with eagerness Papa says he highly approves of my friendship with you and he wishes me to continue it through life A good neighbour of the Brontes a clever intelligent Yorkshire woman who keeps a druggist s shop in Haworth and from her occupation her experience and excellent sense holds the position of village doctress and nurse and as such has been a friend in many a time of trial and sickness and death in the households round told me a characteristic little incident connected with Tabby s fractured leg mister Bronte is truly generous and regardful of all deserving claims Tabby had lived with them for ten or twelve years and was as Charlotte expressed it one of the family But on the other hand she was past the age for any very active service being nearer seventy than sixty at the time of the accident she had a sister living in the village and the savings she had accumulated during many years service formed a competency for one in her rank of life Or if in this time of sickness she fell short of any comforts which her state rendered necessary the parsonage could supply them So reasoned Miss Branwell the prudent not to say anxious aunt looking to the limited contents of mister Bronte s purse and the unprovided for future of her nieces who were moreover losing the relaxation of the holidays in close attendance upon Tabby Miss Branwell urged her views upon mister Bronte as soon as the immediate danger to the old servant s life was over He refused at first to listen to the careful advice it was repugnant to his liberal nature But Miss Branwell persevered urged economical motives pressed on his love for his daughters He gave way Tabby was to be removed to her sister s and there nursed and cared for mister Bronte coming in with his aid when her own resources fell short This decision was communicated to the girls There were symptoms of a quiet but sturdy rebellion that winter afternoon in the small precincts of Haworth parsonage They made one unanimous and stiff remonstrance Tabby had tended them in their childhood they and none other should tend her in her infirmity and age At tea time they were sad and silent and the meal went away untouched by any of the three So it was at breakfast they did not waste many words on the subject but each word they did utter was weighty They struck eating till the resolution was rescinded and Tabby was allowed to remain a helpless invalid entirely dependent upon them Herein was the strong feeling of Duty being paramount to pleasure which lay at the foundation of Charlotte s character made most apparent for we have seen how she yearned for her friend s company but it was to be obtained only by shrinking from what she esteemed right and that she never did whatever might be the sacrifice She had another weight on her mind this Christmas I have said that the air of Dewsbury Moor did not agree with her though she herself was hardly aware how much her life there was affecting her health But Anne had begun to suffer just before the holidays and Charlotte watched over her younger sisters with the jealous vigilance of some wild creature that changes her very nature if danger threatens her young Anne had a slight cough a pain at her side a difficulty of breathing Miss W considered it as little more than a common cold but Charlotte felt every indication of incipient consumption as a stab at her heart remembering Maria and Elizabeth whose places once knew them and should know them no more Stung by anxiety for this little sister she upbraided Miss W for her fancied indifference to Anne s state of health Miss W felt these reproaches keenly and wrote to mister Bronte about them He immediately replied most kindly expressing his fear that Charlotte s apprehensions and anxieties respecting her sister had led her to give utterance to over excited expressions of alarm Through Miss W s kind consideration Anne was a year longer at school than her friends intended At the close of the half year Miss W sought for the opportunity of an explanation of each other s words and the issue proved that the falling out of faithful friends renewing is of love And so ended the first last and only difference Charlotte ever had with good kind Miss W Still her heart had received a shock in the perception of Anne s delicacy and all these holidays she watched over her with the longing fond anxiety which is so full of sudden pangs of fear Emily had given up her situation in the Halifax school at the expiration of six months of arduous trial on account of her health which could only be re established by the bracing moorland air and free life of home Tabby s illness had preyed on the family resources I doubt whether Branwell was maintaining himself at this time For some unexplained reason he had given up the idea of becoming a student of painting at the Royal Academy and his prospects in life were uncertain and had yet to be settled So Charlotte had quietly to take up her burden of teaching again and return to her previous monotonous life Brave heart ready to die in harness She went back to her work and made no complaint hoping to subdue the weakness that was gaining ground upon her About this time she would turn sick and trembling at any sudden noise and could hardly repress her screams when startled This showed a fearful degree of physical weakness in one who was generally so self controlled and the medical man whom at length through Miss W s entreaty she was led to consult insisted on her return to the parsonage She had led too sedentary a life he said and the soft summer air blowing round her home the sweet company of those she loved the release the freedom of life in her own family were needed to save either reason or life So as One higher than she had over ruled that for a time she might relax her strain she returned to Haworth and after a season of utter quiet her father sought for her the enlivening society of her two friends Mary and Martha T At the conclusion of the following letter written to the then absent E there is I think as pretty a glimpse of a merry group of young people as need be and like all descriptions of doing as distinct from thinking or feeling in letters it saddens one in proportion to the vivacity of the picture of what was once and is now utterly swept away Haworth June nine eighteen thirty eight I received your packet of despatches on Wednesday it was brought me by Mary and Martha who have been staying at Haworth for a few days they leave us to day You will be surprised at the date of this letter I ought to be at Dewsbury Moor you know but I stayed as long as I was able and at length I neither could nor dared stay any longer My health and spirits had utterly failed me and the medical man whom I consulted enjoined me as I valued my life to go home So home I went and the change has at once roused and soothed me and I am now I trust fairly in the way to be myself again A calm and even mind like yours cannot conceive the feelings of the shattered wretch who is now writing to you when after weeks of mental and bodily anguish not to be described something like peace began to dawn again Mary is far from well She breathes short has a pain in her chest and frequent flushings of fever I cannot tell you what agony these symptoms give me they remind me too strongly of my two sisters whom no power of medicine could save Martha is now very well she has kept in a continual flow of good humour during her stay here and has consequently been very fascinating They are making such a noise about me I cannot write any more Mary is playing on the piano Martha is chattering as fast as her little tongue can run and Branwell is standing before her laughing at her vivacity Charlotte grew much stronger in this quiet happy period at home She paid occasional visits to her two great friends and they in return came to Haworth At one of their houses I suspect she met with the person to whom the following letter refers some one having a slight resemblance to the character of saint John in the last volume of Jane Eyre and like him in holy orders March twelve eighteen thirty nine I had a kindly leaning towards him because he is an amiable and well disposed man Yet I had not and could not have that intense attachment which would make me willing to die for him and if ever I marry it must be in that light of adoration that I will regard my husband Ten to one I shall never have the chance again but n importe Moreover I was aware that he knew so little of me he could hardly be conscious to whom he was writing Why it would startle him to see me in my natural home character he would think I was a wild romantic enthusiast indeed I could not sit all day long making a grave face before my husband I would laugh and satirize and say whatever came into my head first And if he were a clever man and loved me the whole world weighed in the balance against his smallest wish should be light as air So that her first proposal of marriage was quietly declined and put on one side Matrimony did not enter into the scheme of her life but good sound earnest labour did the question however was as yet undecided in what direction she should employ her forces She had been discouraged in literature her eyes failed her in the minute kind of drawing which she practised when she wanted to express an idea teaching seemed to her at this time as it does to most women at all times the only way of earning an independent livelihood But neither she nor her sisters were naturally fond of children The hieroglyphics of childhood were an unknown language to them for they had never been much with those younger than themselves I am inclined to think too that they had not the happy knack of imparting information which seems to be a separate gift from the faculty of acquiring it a kind of sympathetic tact which instinctively perceives the difficulties that impede comprehension in a child s mind and that yet are too vague and unformed for it with its half developed powers of expression to explain by words Consequently teaching very young children was anything but a delightful task to the three Bronte sisters With older girls verging on womanhood they might have done better especially if these had any desire for improvement But the education which the village clergyman s daughters had received did not as yet qualify them to undertake the charge of advanced pupils They knew but little French and were not proficients in music I doubt whether Charlotte could play at all But they were all strong again and at any rate Charlotte and Anne must put their shoulders to the wheel One daughter was needed at home to stay with mister Bronte and Miss Branwell to be the young and active member in a household of four whereof three the father the aunt and faithful Tabby were past middle age And Emily who suffered and drooped more than her sisters when away from Haworth was the one appointed to remain Anne was the first to meet with a situation April fifteenth eighteen thirty nine I could not write to you in the week you requested as about that time we were very busy in preparing for Anne s departure Poor child she left us last Monday no one went with her it was her own wish that she might be allowed to go alone as she thought she could manage better and summon more courage if thrown entirely upon her own resources We have had one letter from her since she went She expresses herself very well satisfied and says that missus is extremely kind the two eldest children alone are under her care the rest are confined to the nursery with which and its occupants she has nothing to do I hope she ll do You would be astonished what a sensible clever letter she writes it is only the talking part that I fear But I do seriously apprehend that missus will sometimes conclude that she has a natural impediment in her speech For my own part I am as yet wanting a situation like a housemaid out of place By the way I have lately discovered I have quite a talent for cleaning sweeping up hearths dusting rooms making beds c so if everything else fails I can turn my hand to that if anybody will give me good wages for little labour I won t be a cook I hate soothing I won t be a nurserymaid nor a lady s maid far less a lady s companion or a mantua maker or a straw bonnet maker or a taker in of plain work I won t be anything but a housemaid With regard to my visit to G I have as yet received no invitation but if I should be asked though I should feel it a great act of self denial to refuse yet I have almost made up my mind to do so though the society of the T s is one of the most rousing pleasures I have ever known Good bye my darling E c P S Strike out that word darling it is humbug Where s the use of protestations We ve known each other and liked each other a good while that s enough Not many weeks after this was written Charlotte also became engaged as a governess I intend carefully to abstain from introducing the names of any living people respecting whom I may have to tell unpleasant truths or to quote severe remarks from Miss Bronte s letters but it is necessary that the difficulties she had to encounter in her various phases of life should be fairly and frankly made known before the force of what was resisted can be at all understood I was once speaking to her about Agnes Grey the novel in which her sister Anne pretty literally describes her own experience as a governess and alluding more particularly to the account of the stoning of the little nestlings in the presence of the parent birds She said that none but those who had been in the position of a governess could ever realise the dark side of respectable human nature under no great temptation to crime but daily giving way to selfishness and ill temper till its conduct towards those dependent on it sometimes amounts to a tyranny of which one would rather be the victim than the inflicter We can only trust in such cases that the employers err rather from a density of perception and an absence of sympathy than from any natural cruelty of disposition Among several things of the same kind which I well remember she told me what had once occurred to herself She had been entrusted with the care of a little boy three or four years old during the absence of his parents on a day s excursion and particularly enjoined to keep him out of the stable yard His elder brother a lad of eight or nine and not a pupil of Miss Bronte s tempted the little fellow into the forbidden place She followed and tried to induce him to come away but instigated by his brother he began throwing stones at her and one of them hit her so severe a blow on the temple that the lads were alarmed into obedience The next day in full family conclave the mother asked Miss Bronte what occasioned the mark on her forehead She simply replied An accident ma am and no further inquiry was made but the children both brothers and sisters had been present and honoured her for not telling tales From that time she began to obtain influence over all more or less according to their different characters and as she insensibly gained their affection her own interest in them was increasing But one day at the children s dinner the small truant of the stable yard in a little demonstrative gush said putting his hand in hers I love ou Miss Bronte Whereupon the mother exclaimed before all the children Love the governess my dear The family into which she first entered was I believe that of a wealthy Yorkshire manufacturer The following extracts from her correspondence at this time will show how painfully the restraint of her new mode of life pressed upon her The first is from a letter to Emily beginning with one of the tender expressions in which in spite of humbug she indulged herself Mine dear love Mine bonnie love are her terms of address to this beloved sister June eighth eighteen thirty nine I have striven hard to be pleased with my new situation The country the house and the grounds are as I have said divine but alack a day there is such a thing as seeing all beautiful around you pleasant woods white paths green lawns and blue sunshiny sky and not having a free moment or a free thought left to enjoy them The children are constantly with me As for correcting them I quickly found that was out of the question they are to do as they like A complaint to the mother only brings black looks on myself and unjust partial excuses to screen the children I have tried that plan once and succeeded so notably I shall try no more I said in my last letter that missus did not know me I now begin to find she does not intend to know me that she cares nothing about me except to contrive how the greatest possible quantity of labour may be got out of me and to that end she overwhelms me with oceans of needle work yards of cambric to hem muslin nightcaps to make and above all things dolls to dress I do not think she likes me at all because I can t help being shy in such an entirely novel scene surrounded as I have hitherto been by strange and constantly changing faces I used to think I should like to be in the stir of grand folks society but I have had enough of it it is dreary work to look on and listen I see more clearly than I have ever done before that a private governess has no existence is not considered as a living rational being except as connected with the wearisome duties she has to fulfil One of the pleasantest afternoons I have spent here indeed the only one at all pleasant was when mister walked out with his children and I had orders to follow a little behind As he strolled on through his fields with his magnificent Newfoundland dog at his side he looked very like what a frank wealthy Conservative gentleman ought to be He spoke freely and unaffectedly to the people he met and though he indulged his children and allowed them to tease himself far too much he would not suffer them grossly to insult others WRITTEN IN PENCIL TO A FRIEND July eighteen thirty nine I cannot procure ink without going into the drawing room where I do not wish to go I should have written to you long since and told you every detail of the utterly new scene into which I have lately been cast had I not been daily expecting a letter from yourself and wondering and lamenting that you did not write for you will remember it was your turn I must not bother you too much with my sorrows of which I fear you have heard an exaggerated account If you were near me perhaps I might be tempted to tell you all to grow egotistical and pour out the long history of a private governess s trials and crosses in her first situation As it is I will only ask you to imagine the miseries of a reserved wretch like me thrown at once into the midst of a large family at a time when they were particularly gay when the house was filled with company all strangers people whose faces I had never seen before In this state I had charge given me of a set of pampered spoilt turbulent children whom I was expected constantly to amuse as well as to instruct I soon found that the constant demand on my stock of animal spirits reduced them to the lowest state of exhaustion at times I felt and I suppose seemed depressed To my astonishment I was taken to task on the subject by missus with a sternness of manner and a harshness of language scarcely credible like a fool I cried most bitterly I could not help it my spirits quite failed me at first I thought I had done my best strained every nerve to please her and to be treated in that way merely because I was shy and sometimes melancholy was too bad At first I was for giving all up and going home But after a little reflection I determined to summon what energy I had and to weather the storm I said to myself I have never yet quitted a place without gaining a friend adversity is a good school the poor are born to labour and the dependent to endure I resolved to be patient to command my feelings and to take what came the ordeal I reflected would not last many weeks and I trusted it would do me good I recollected the fable of the willow and the oak I bent quietly and now I trust the storm is blowing over me missus is generally considered an agreeable woman so she is I doubt not in general society She behaves somewhat more civilly to me now than she did at first and the children are a little more manageable but she does not know my character and she does not wish to know it I have never had five minutes conversation with her since I came except while she was scolding me I have no wish to be pitied except by yourself if I were talking to you I could tell you much more TO EMILY ABOUT THIS TIME Mine bonnie love I was as glad of your letter as tongue can express it is a real genuine pleasure to hear from home a thing to be saved till bedtime when one has a moment s quiet and rest to enjoy it thoroughly Write whenever you can I could like to be at home I could like to work in a mill I could like to feel some mental liberty I could like this weight of restraint to be taken off But the holidays will come Coraggio Her temporary engagement in this uncongenial family ended in the July of this year not before the constant strain upon her spirits and strength had again affected her health but when this delicacy became apparent in palpitations and shortness of breathing it was treated as affectation as a phase of imaginary indisposition which could be dissipated by a good scolding She had been brought up rather in a school of Spartan endurance than in one of maudlin self indulgence and could bear many a pain and relinquish many a hope in silence After she had been at home about a week her friend proposed that she should accompany her in some little excursion having pleasure alone for its object She caught at the idea most eagerly at first but her hope stood still waned and had almost disappeared before after many delays it was realised In its fulfilment at last it was a favourable specimen of many a similar air bubble dancing before her eyes in her brief career in which stern realities rather than pleasures formed the leading incidents July twenty sixth eighteen thirty nine Your proposal has almost driven me clean daft if you don t understand that ladylike expression you must ask me what it means when I see you The fact is an excursion with you anywhere whether to Cleathorpe or Canada just by ourselves would be to me most delightful I should indeed like to go but I can t get leave of absence for longer than a week and I m afraid that would not suit you must I then give it up entirely I feel as if I could not I never had such a chance of enjoyment before I do want to see you and talk to you and be with you When do you wish to go Could I meet you at Leeds To take a gig from Haworth to B would be to me a very serious increase of expense and I happen to be very low in cash Oh rich people seem to have many pleasures at their command which we are debarred from However no repining Say when you go and I shall be able in my answer to say decidedly whether I can accompany you or not I must I will I m set upon it I ll be obstinate and bear down all opposition P S Since writing the above I find that aunt and papa have determined to go to Liverpool for a fortnight and take us all with them It is stipulated however that I should give up the Cleathorpe scheme I yield reluctantly I fancy that about this time mister Bronte found it necessary either from failing health or the increased populousness of the parish to engage the assistance of a curate At least it is in a letter written this summer that I find mention of the first of a succession of curates who henceforward revolved round Haworth Parsonage and made an impression on the mind of one of its inmates which she has conveyed pretty distinctly to the world The Haworth curate brought his clerical friends and neighbours about the place and for a time the incursions of these near the parsonage tea time formed occurrences by which the quietness of the life there was varied sometimes pleasantly sometimes disagreeably The little adventure recorded at the end of the following letter is uncommon in the lot of most women and is a testimony in this case to the unusual power of attraction though so plain in feature which Charlotte possessed when she let herself go in the happiness and freedom of home August fourth eighteen thirty nine The Liverpool journey is yet a matter of talk a sort of castle in the air but between you and me I fancy it is very doubtful whether it will ever assume a more solid shape Aunt like many other elderly people likes to talk of such things but when it comes to putting them into actual execution she rather falls off Such being the case I think you and I had better adhere to our first plan of going somewhere together independently of other people I have got leave to accompany you for a week at the utmost a fortnight but no more Where do you wish to go Burlington I should think from what M says would be as eligible a place as any When do you set off Arrange all these things according to your convenience I shall start no objections The idea of seeing the sea of being near it watching its changes by sunrise sunset moonlight and noon day in calm perhaps in storm fills and satisfies my mind I shall be discontented at nothing And then I am not to be with a set of people with whom I have nothing in common who would be nuisances and bores but with you whom I like and know and who knows me I have an odd circumstance to relate to you prepare for a hearty laugh The other day mister a vicar came to spend the day with us bringing with him his own curate The latter gentleman by name mister B is a young Irish clergyman fresh from Dublin University It was the first time we had any of us seen him but however after the manner of his countrymen he soon made himself at home His character quickly appeared in his conversation witty lively ardent clever too but deficient in the dignity and discretion of an Englishman At home you know I talk with ease and am never shy never weighed down and oppressed by that miserable mauvaise honte which torments and constrains me elsewhere So I conversed with this Irishman and laughed at his jests and though I saw faults in his character excused them because of the amusement his originality afforded I cooled a little indeed and drew in towards the latter part of the evening because he began to season his conversation with something of Hibernian flattery which I did not quite relish However they went away and no more was thought about them A few days after I got a letter the direction of which puzzled me it being in a hand I was not accustomed to see Evidently it was neither from you nor Mary my only correspondents Having opened and read it it proved to be a declaration of attachment and proposal of matrimony expressed in the ardent language of the sapient young Irishman I hope you are laughing heartily This is not like one of my adventures is it It more nearly resembles Martha s I am certainly doomed to be an old maid Never mind I made up my mind to that fate ever since I was twelve years old Well thought I I have heard of love at first sight but this beats all I leave you to guess what my answer would be convinced that you will not do me the injustice of guessing wrong On the fourteenth of August she still writes from Haworth I have in vain packed my box and prepared everything for our anticipated journey It so happens that I can get no conveyance this week or the next The only gig let out to hire in Haworth is at Harrowgate and likely to remain there for aught I can hear Papa decidedly objects to my going by the coach and walking to B though I am sure I could manage it Aunt exclaims against the weather and the roads and the four winds of heaven so I am in a fix and what is worse so are you On reading over for the second or third time your last letter which by the by was written in such hieroglyphics that at the first hasty perusal I could hardly make out two consecutive words I find you intimate that if I leave this journey till Thursday I shall be too late I grieve that I should have so inconvenienced you but I need not talk of either Friday or Saturday now for I rather imagine there is small chance of my ever going at all The elders of the house have never cordially acquiesced in the measure and now that impediments seem to start up at every step opposition grows more open Papa indeed would willingly indulge me but this very kindness of his makes me doubt whether I ought to draw upon it so though I could battle out aunt s discontent I yield to papa s indulgence He does not say so but I know he would rather I stayed at home and aunt meant well too I dare say but I am provoked that she reserved the expression of her decided disapproval till all was settled between you and myself Reckon on me no more leave me out in your calculations perhaps I ought in the beginning to have had prudence sufficient to shut my eyes against such a prospect of pleasure so as to deny myself the hope of it Be as angry as you please with me for disappointing you I did not intend it and have only one thing more to say if you do not go immediately to the sea will you come to see us at Haworth This invitation is not mine only but papa s and aunt s However a little more patience a little more delay and she enjoyed the pleasure she had wished for so much She and her friend went to Easton for a fortnight in the latter part of September It was here she received her first impressions of the sea Oct twenty fourth Have you forgotten the sea by this time E Is it grown dim in your mind Or can you still see it dark blue and green and foam white and hear it roaring roughly when the wind is high or rushing softly when it is calm I am as well as need be and very fat I think of Easton very often and of worthy mister H and his kind hearted helpmate and of our pleasant walks to H Wood and to Boynton our merry evenings our romps with little Hancheon c c If we both live this period of our lives will long be a theme for pleasant recollection Did you chance in your letter to mister H to mention my spectacles I am sadly inconvenienced by the want of them I can neither read write nor draw with comfort in their absence I hope Madame won t refuse to give them up Excuse the brevity of this letter for I have been drawing all day and my eyes are so tired it is quite a labour to write But as the vivid remembrance of this pleasure died away an accident occurred to make the actual duties of life press somewhat heavily for a time December twenty first eighteen thirty nine We are at present and have been during the last month rather busy as for that space of time we have been without a servant except a little girl to run errands Poor Tabby became so lame that she was at length obliged to leave us She is residing with her sister in a little house of her own which she bought with her savings a year or two since She is very comfortable and wants nothing as she is near we see her very often In the meantime Emily and I are sufficiently busy as you may suppose I manage the ironing and keep the rooms clean Emily does the baking and attends to the kitchen We are such odd animals that we prefer this mode of contrivance to having a new face amongst us Besides we do not despair of Tabby s return and she shall not be supplanted by a stranger in her absence I excited aunt s wrath very much by burning the clothes the first time I attempted to iron but I do better now Human feelings are queer things I am much happier black leading the stoves making the beds and sweeping the floors at home than I should be living like a fine lady anywhere else I must indeed drop my subscription to the Jews because I have no money to keep it up I ought to have announced this intention to you before but I quite forgot I was a subscriber I intend to force myself to take another situation when I can get one though I hate and abhor the very thoughts of governess ship But I must do it and therefore I heartily wish I could hear of a family where they need such a commodity as a governess CHAPTER IX The year eighteen forty found all the Brontes living at home except Anne As I have already intimated for some reason with which I am unacquainted the plan of sending Branwell to study at the Royal Academy had been relinquished probably it was found on inquiry that the expenses of such a life were greater than his father s slender finances could afford even with the help which Charlotte s labours at Miss W s gave by providing for Anne s board and education I gather from what I have heard that Branwell must have been severely disappointed when the plan fell through His talents were certainly very brilliant and of this he was fully conscious and fervently desired by their use either in writing or drawing to make himself a name At the same time he would probably have found his strong love of pleasure and irregular habits a great impediment in his path to fame but these blemishes in his character were only additional reasons why he yearned after a London life in which he imagined he could obtain every stimulant to his already vigorous intellect while at the same time he would have a license of action to be found only in crowded cities Thus his whole nature was attracted towards the metropolis and many an hour must he have spent poring over the map of London to judge from an anecdote which has been told me Some traveller for a London house of business came to Haworth for a night and according to the unfortunate habit of the place the brilliant Patrick was sent for to the inn to beguile the evening by his intellectual conversation and his flashes of wit They began to talk of London of the habits and ways of life there of the places of amusement and Branwell informed the Londoner of one or two short cuts from point to point up narrow lanes or back streets and it was only towards the end of the evening that the traveller discovered from his companion s voluntary confession that he had never set foot in London at all At this time the young man seemed to have his fate in his own hands He was full of noble impulses as well as of extraordinary gifts not accustomed to resist temptation it is true from any higher motive than strong family affection but showing so much power of attachment to all about him that they took pleasure in believing that after a time he would right himself and that they should have pride and delight in the use he would then make of his splendid talents His aunt especially made him her great favourite There are always peculiar trials in the life of an only boy in a family of girls He is expected to act a part in life to do while they are only to be and the necessity of their giving way to him in some things is too often exaggerated into their giving way to him in all and thus rendering him utterly selfish In the family about whom I am writing while the rest were almost ascetic in their habits Branwell was allowed to grow up self indulgent but in early youth his power of attracting and attaching people was so great that few came in contact with him who were not so much dazzled by him as to be desirous of gratifying whatever wishes he expressed Of course he was careful enough not to reveal anything before his father and sisters of the pleasures he indulged in but his tone of thought and conversation became gradually coarser and for a time his sisters tried to persuade themselves that such coarseness was a part of manliness and to blind themselves by love to the fact that Branwell was worse than other young men At present though he had they were aware fallen into some errors the exact nature of which they avoided knowing still he was their hope and their darling their pride who should some time bring great glory to the name of Bronte He and his sister Charlotte were both slight and small of stature while the other two were of taller and larger make I have seen Branwell s profile it is what would be generally esteemed very handsome the forehead is massive the eye well set and the expression of it fine and intellectual the nose too is good but there are coarse lines about the mouth and the lips though of handsome shape are loose and thick indicating self indulgence while the slightly retreating chin conveys an idea of weakness of will His hair and complexion were sandy He had enough of Irish blood in him to make his manners frank and genial with a kind of natural gallantry about them In a fragment of one of his manuscripts which I have read there is a justness and felicity of expression which is very striking It is the beginning of a tale and the actors in it are drawn with much of the grace of characteristic portrait painting in perfectly pure and simple language which distinguishes so many of Addison s papers in the Spectator The fragment is too short to afford the means of judging whether he had much dramatic talent as the persons of the story are not thrown into conversation But altogether the elegance and composure of style are such as one would not have expected from this vehement and ill fated young man He had a stronger desire for literary fame burning in his heart than even that which occasionally flashed up in his sisters He tried various outlets for his talents He wrote and sent poems to Wordsworth and Coleridge who both expressed kind and laudatory opinions and he frequently contributed verses to the Leeds Mercury In eighteen forty he was living at home employing himself in occasional composition of various kinds and waiting till some occupation for which he might be fitted without any expensive course of preliminary training should turn up waiting not impatiently for he saw society of one kind probably what he called life at the Black Bull and at home he was as yet the cherished favourite Miss Branwell was unaware of the fermentation of unoccupied talent going on around her She was not her nieces confidante perhaps no one so much older could have been but their father from whom they derived not a little of their adventurous spirit was silently cognisant of much of which she took no note Next to her nephew the docile pensive Anne was her favourite Of her she had taken charge from her infancy she was always patient and tractable and would submit quietly to occasional oppression even when she felt it keenly Not so her two elder sisters they made their opinions known when roused by any injustice At such times Emily would express herself as strongly as Charlotte although perhaps less frequently But in general notwithstanding that Miss Branwell might be occasionally unreasonable she and her nieces went on smoothly enough and though they might now and then be annoyed by petty tyranny she still inspired them with sincere respect and not a little affection They were moreover grateful to her for many habits she had enforced upon them and which in time had become second nature order method neatness in everything a perfect knowledge of all kinds of household work an exact punctuality and obedience to the laws of time and place of which no one but themselves I have heard Charlotte say could tell the value in after life with their impulsive natures it was positive repose to have learnt implicit obedience to external laws People in Haworth have assured me that according to the hour of day nay the very minute could they have told what the inhabitants of the parsonage were about At certain times the girls would be sewing in their aunt s bedroom the chamber which in former days before they had outstripped her in their learning had served them as a schoolroom at certain early hours they had their meals from six to eight Miss Branwell read aloud to mister Bronte at punctual eight the household assembled to evening prayers in his study and by nine he the aunt and Tabby were all in bed the girls free to pace up and down like restless wild animals in the parlour talking over plans and projects and thoughts of what was to be their future life At the time of which I write the favourite idea was that of keeping a school They thought that by a little contrivance and a very little additional building a small number of pupils four or six might be accommodated in the parsonage As teaching seemed the only profession open to them and as it appeared that Emily at least could not live away from home while the others also suffered much from the same cause this plan of school keeping presented itself as most desirable But it involved some outlay and to this their aunt was averse Yet there was no one to whom they could apply for a loan of the requisite means except Miss Branwell who had made a small store out of her savings which she intended for her nephew and nieces eventually but which she did not like to risk Still this plan of school keeping remained uppermost and in the evenings of this winter of eighteen thirty nine forty the alterations that would be necessary in the house and the best way of convincing their aunt of the wisdom of their project formed the principal subject of their conversation This anxiety weighed upon their minds rather heavily during the months of dark and dreary weather Nor were external events among the circle of their friends of a cheerful character In January eighteen forty Charlotte heard of the death of a young girl who had been a pupil of hers and a schoolfellow of Anne s at the time when the sisters were together at Roe Head and had attached herself very strongly to the latter who in return bestowed upon her much quiet affection It was a sad day when the intelligence of this young creature s death arrived Charlotte wrote thus on January twelfth eighteen forty Your letter which I received this morning was one of painful interest Anne C it seems is dead when I saw her last she was a young beautiful and happy girl and now life s fitful fever is over with her and she sleeps well I shall never see her again It is a sorrowful thought for she was a warm hearted affectionate being and I cared for her Wherever I seek for her now in this world she cannot be found no more than a flower or a leaf which withered twenty years ago A bereavement of this kind gives one a glimpse of the feeling those must have who have seen all drop round them friend after friend and are left to end their pilgrimage alone But tears are fruitless and I try not to repine During this winter Charlotte employed her leisure hours in writing a story Some fragments of the manuscript yet remain but it is in too small a hand to be read without great fatigue to the eyes and one cares the less to read it as she herself condemned it in the preface to the Professor by saying that in this story she had got over such taste as she might once have had for the ornamental and redundant in composition The beginning too as she acknowledges was on a scale commensurate with one of Richardson s novels of seven or eight volumes I gather some of these particulars from a copy of a letter apparently in reply to one from Wordsworth to whom she had sent the commencement of the story sometime in the summer of eighteen forty Authors are generally very tenacious of their productions but I am not so much attached to this but that I can give it up without much distress No doubt if I had gone on I should have made quite a Richardsonian concern of it I had materials in my head for half a dozen volumes Of course it is with considerable regret I relinquish any scheme so charming as the one I have sketched It is very edifying and profitable to create a world out of your own brains and people it with inhabitants who are so many Melchisedecs and have no father nor mother but your own imagination I am sorry I did not exist fifty or sixty years ago when the Ladies Magazine was flourishing like a green bay tree In that case I make no doubt my aspirations after literary fame would have met with due encouragement and I should have had the pleasure of introducing Messrs Percy and West into the very best society and recording all their sayings and doings in double columned close printed pages I recollect when I was a child getting hold of some antiquated volumes and reading them by stealth with the most exquisite pleasure You give a correct description of the patient Grisels of those days My aunt was one of them and to this day she thinks the tales of the Ladies Magazine infinitely superior to any trash of modern literature So do I for I read them in childhood and childhood has a very strong faculty of admiration but a very weak one of criticism I am pleased that you cannot quite decide whether I am an attorney s clerk or a novel reading dress maker I will not help you at all in the discovery and as to my handwriting or the ladylike touches in my style and imagery you must not draw any conclusion from that I may employ an amanuensis Seriously sir I am very much obliged to you for your kind and candid letter I almost wonder you took the trouble to read and notice the novelette of an anonymous scribe who had not even the manners to tell you whether he was a man or a woman or whether his C T meant Charles Timms or Charlotte Tomkins There are two or three things noticeable in the letter from which these extracts are taken The first is the initials with which she had evidently signed the former one to which she alludes About this time to her more familiar correspondents she occasionally calls herself Charles Thunder making a kind of pseudonym for herself out of her Christian name and the meaning of her Greek surname In the next place there is a touch of assumed smartness very different from the simple womanly dignified letter which she had written to Southey under nearly similar circumstances three years before I imagine the cause of this difference to be twofold Southey in his reply to her first letter had appealed to the higher parts of her nature in calling her to consider whether literature was or was not the best course for a woman to pursue But the person to whom she addressed this one had evidently confined himself to purely literary criticisms besides which her sense of humour was tickled by the perplexity which her correspondent felt as to whether he was addressing a man or a woman She rather wished to encourage the former idea and in consequence possibly assumed something of the flippancy which very probably existed in her brother s style of conversation from whom she would derive her notions of young manhood not likely as far as refinement was concerned to be improved by the other specimens she had seen such as the curates whom she afterwards represented in Shirley These curates were full of strong High Church feeling Belligerent by nature it was well for their professional character that they had as clergymen sufficient scope for the exercise of their warlike propensities mister Bronte with all his warm regard for Church and State had a great respect for mental freedom and though he was the last man in the world to conceal his opinions he lived in perfect amity with all the respectable part of those who differed from him Not so the curates Dissent was schism and schism was condemned in the Bible In default of turbaned Saracens they entered on a crusade against Methodists in broadcloth and the consequence was that the Methodists and Baptists refused to pay the church rates Miss Bronte thus describes the state of things at this time Little Haworth has been all in a bustle about church rates since you were here We had a stirring meeting in the schoolroom Papa took the chair and mister C and mister W acted as his supporters one on each side There was violent opposition which set mister C s Irish blood in a ferment and if papa had not kept him quiet partly by persuasion and partly by compulsion he would have given the Dissenters their kale through the reek a Scotch proverb which I will explain to you another time He and mister W both bottled up their wrath for that time but it was only to explode with redoubled force at a future period We had two sermons on dissent and its consequences preached last Sunday one in the afternoon by mister W and one in the evening by mister C All the Dissenters were invited to come and hear and they actually shut up their chapels and came in a body of course the church was crowded mister W delivered a noble eloquent High Church Apostolical Succession discourse in which he banged the Dissenters most fearlessly and unflinchingly I thought they had got enough for one while but it was nothing to the dose that was thrust down their throats in the evening A keener cleverer bolder and more heart stirring harangue than that which mister C delivered from Haworth pulpit last Sunday evening I never heard He did not rant he did not cant he did not whine he did not sniggle he just got up and spoke with the boldness of a man who was impressed with the truth of what he was saying who has no fear of his enemies and no dread of consequences His sermon lasted an hour yet I was sorry when it was done I do not say that I agree either with him or with mister W either in all or in half their opinions I consider them bigoted intolerant and wholly unjustifiable on the ground of common sense My conscience will not let me be either a Puseyite or a Hookist mais if I were a Dissenter I would have taken the first opportunity of kicking or of horse whipping both the gentlemen for their stern bitter attack on my religion and its teachers But in spite of all this I admired the noble integrity which could dictate so fearless an opposition against so strong an antagonist P S mister W has given another lecture at the Keighley Mechanics Institution and papa has also given a lecture both are spoken of very highly in the newspapers and it is mentioned as a matter of wonder that such displays of intellect should emanate from the village of Haworth situated among the bogs and mountains and until very lately supposed to be in a state of semi barbarism Such are the words of the newspaper To fill up the account of this outwardly eventless year I may add a few more extracts from the letters entrusted to me May fifteenth eighteen forty Do not be over persuaded to marry a man you can never respect I do not say love because I think if you can respect a person before marriage moderate love at least will come after and as to intense passion I am convinced that that is no desirable feeling In the first place it seldom or never meets with a requital and in the second place if it did the feeling would be only temporary it would last the honeymoon and then perhaps give place to disgust or indifference worse perhaps than disgust Certainly this would be the case on the man s part and on the woman s God help her if she is left to love passionately and alone I am tolerably well convinced that I shall never marry at all Reason tells me so and I am not so utterly the slave of feeling but that I can occasionally hear her voice June second eighteen forty M is not yet come to Haworth but she is to come on the condition that I first go and stay a few days there If all be well I shall go next Wednesday I may stay at G until Friday or Saturday and the early part of the following week I shall pass with you if you will have me which last sentence indeed is nonsense for as I shall be glad to see you so I know you will be glad to see me This arrangement will not allow much time but it is the only practicable one which considering all the circumstances I can effect Do not urge me to stay more than two or three days because I shall be obliged to refuse you I intend to walk to Keighley there to take the coach as far as B then to get some one to carry my box and to walk the rest of the way to G If I manage this I think I shall contrive very well I shall reach B by about five o clock and then I shall have the cool of the evening for the walk I have communicated the whole arrangement to M I desire exceedingly to see both her and you Good bye C B C B C B C B If you have any better plan to suggest I am open to conviction provided your plan is practicable August twentieth eighteen forty Have you seen anything of Miss H lately I wish they or somebody else would get me a situation I have answered advertisements without number but my applications have met with no success I have got another bale of French books from G containing upwards of forty volumes I have read about half They are like the rest clever wicked sophistical and immoral The best of it is they give one a thorough idea of France and Paris and are the best substitute for French conversation that I have met with I positively have nothing more to say to you for I am in a stupid humour You must excuse this letter not being quite as long as your own I have written to you soon that you might not look after the postman in vain Preserve this writing as a curiosity in caligraphy I think it is exquisite all brilliant black blots and utterly illegible letters CALIBAN The wind bloweth where it listeth Thou hearest the sound thereof but canst not tell whence it cometh nor whither it goeth That I believe is Scripture though in what chapter or book or whether it be correctly quoted I can t possibly say However it behoves me to write a letter to a young woman of the name of E with whom I was once acquainted in life s morning march when my spirit was young This young woman wished me to write to her some time since though I have nothing to say I e en put it off day by day till at last fearing that she will curse me by her gods I feel constrained to sit down and tack a few lines together which she may call a letter or not as she pleases Now if the young woman expects sense in this production she will find herself miserably disappointed I shall dress her a dish of salmagundi I shall cook a hash compound a stew toss up an omelette soufflee a la Francaise and send it her with my respects The wind which is very high up in our hills of Judea though I suppose down in the Philistine flats of B parish it is nothing to speak of has produced the same effects on the contents of my knowledge box that a quaigh of usquebaugh does upon those of most other bipeds I see everything couleur de rose and am strongly inclined to dance a jig if I knew how I think I must partake of the nature of a pig or an ass both which animals are strongly affected by a high wind From what quarter the wind blows I cannot tell for I never could in my life but I should very much like to know how the great brewing tub of Bridlington Bay works and what sort of yeasty froth rises just now on the waves A woman of the name of missus B it seems wants a teacher I wish she would have me and I have written to Miss W to tell her so Verily it is a delightful thing to live here at home at full liberty to do just what one pleases But I recollect some scrubby old fable about grasshoppers and ants by a scrubby old knave yclept AEsop the grasshoppers sang all the summer and starved all the winter A distant relation of mine one Patrick Branwell has set off to seek his fortune in the wild wandering adventurous romantic knight errant like capacity of clerk on the Leeds and Manchester Railroad Leeds and Manchester where are they Cities in the wilderness like Tadmor alias Palmyra are they not There is one little trait respecting mister W which lately came to my knowledge which gives a glimpse of the better side of his character Last Saturday night he had been sitting an hour in the parlour with Papa and as he went away I heard Papa say to him What is the matter with you You seem in very low spirits to night Oh I don t know I ve been to see a poor young girl who I m afraid is dying Indeed what is her name Susan Bland the daughter of John Bland the superintendent Now Susan Bland is my oldest and best scholar in the Sunday school and when I heard that I thought I would go as soon as I could to see her I did go on Monday afternoon and found her on her way to that bourn whence no traveller returns After sitting with her some time I happened to ask her mother if she thought a little port wine would do her good She replied that the doctor had recommended it and that when mister W was last there he had brought them a bottle of wine and jar of preserves She added that he was always good natured to poor folks and seemed to have a deal of feeling and kindheartedness about him No doubt there are defects in his character but there are also good qualities God bless him I wonder who with his advantages would be without his faults I know many of his faulty actions many of his weak points yet where I am he shall always find rather a defender than an accuser To be sure my opinion will go but a very little way to decide his character what of that People should do right as far as their ability extends You are not to suppose from all this that mister W and I are on very amiable terms we are not at all We are distant cold and reserved We seldom speak and when we do it is only to exchange the most trivial and common place remarks The missus B alluded to in this letter as in want of a governess entered into a correspondence with Miss Bronte and expressed herself much pleased with the letters she received from her with the style and candour of the application in which Charlotte had taken care to tell her that if she wanted a showy elegant or fashionable person her correspondent was not fitted for such a situation But missus B required her governess to give instructions in music and singing for which Charlotte was not qualified and accordingly the negotiation fell through But Miss Bronte was not one to sit down in despair after disappointment Much as she disliked the life of a private governess it was her duty to relieve her father of the burden of her support and this was the only way open to her So she set to advertising and inquiring with fresh vigour In the meantime a little occurrence took place described in one of her letters which I shall give as it shows her instinctive aversion to a particular class of men whose vices some have supposed she looked upon with indulgence The extract tells all that need be known for the purpose I have in view of the miserable pair to whom it relates You remember mister and missus missus came here the other day with a most melancholy tale of her wretched husband s drunken extravagant profligate habits She asked Papa s advice there was nothing she said but ruin before them They owed debts which they could never pay She expected mister s instant dismissal from his curacy she knew from bitter experience that his vices were utterly hopeless He treated her and her child savagely with much more to the same effect Papa advised her to leave him for ever and go home if she had a home to go to She said this was what she had long resolved to do and she would leave him directly as soon as mister B dismissed him She expressed great disgust and contempt towards him and did not affect to have the shadow of regard in any way I do not wonder at this but I do wonder she should ever marry a man towards whom her feelings must always have been pretty much the same as they are now I am morally certain no decent woman could experience anything but aversion towards such a man as mister Before I knew or suspected his character and when I rather wondered at his versatile talents I felt it in an uncontrollable degree I hated to talk with him hated to look at him though as I was not certain that there was substantial reason for such a dislike and thought it absurd to trust to mere instinct I both concealed and repressed the feeling as much as I could and on all occasions treated him with as much civility as I was mistress of I was struck with Mary s expression of a similar feeling at first sight she said when we left him That is a hideous man Charlotte I thought He is indeed CHAPTER X Early in March eighteen forty one Miss Bronte obtained her second and last situation as a governess This time she esteemed herself fortunate in becoming a member of a kind hearted and friendly household The master of it she especially regarded as a valuable friend whose advice helped to guide her in one very important step of her life But as her definite acquirements were few she had to eke them out by employing her leisure time in needlework and altogether her position was that of bonne or nursery governess liable to repeated and never ending calls upon her time This description of uncertain yet perpetual employment subject to the exercise of another person s will at all hours of the day was peculiarly trying to one whose life at home had been full of abundant leisure Idle she never was in any place but of the multitude of small talks plans duties pleasures c that make up most people s days her home life was nearly destitute This made it possible for her to go through long and deep histories of feeling and imagination for which others odd as it sounds have rarely time This made it inevitable that later on in her too short career the intensity of her feeling should wear out her physical health The habit of making out which had grown with her growth and strengthened with her strength had become a part of her nature Yet all exercise of her strongest and most characteristic faculties was now out of the question She could not as while she was at Miss W s feel amidst the occupations of the day that when evening came she might employ herself in more congenial ways No doubt all who enter upon the career of a governess have to relinquish much no doubt it must ever be a life of sacrifice but to Charlotte Bronte it was a perpetual attempt to force all her faculties into a direction for which the whole of her previous life had unfitted them Moreover the little Brontes had been brought up motherless and from knowing nothing of the gaiety and the sportiveness of childhood from never having experienced caresses or fond attentions themselves they were ignorant of the very nature of infancy or how to call out its engaging qualities Children were to them the troublesome necessities of humanity they had never been drawn into contact with them in any other way Years afterwards when Miss Bronte came to stay with us she watched our little girls perpetually and I could not persuade her that they were only average specimens of well brought up children She was surprised and touched by any sign of thoughtfulness for others of kindness to animals or of unselfishness on their part and constantly maintained that she was in the right and I in the wrong when we differed on the point of their unusual excellence All this must be borne in mind while reading the following letters And it must likewise be borne in mind by those who surviving her look back upon her life from their mount of observation how no distaste no suffering ever made her shrink from any course which she believed it to be her duty to engage in March third eighteen forty one I told some time since that I meant to get a situation and when I said so my resolution was quite fixed I felt that however often I was disappointed I had no intention of relinquishing my efforts After being severely baffled two or three times after a world of trouble in the way of correspondence and interviews I have at length succeeded and am fairly established in my new place The house is not very large but exceedingly comfortable and well regulated the grounds are fine and extensive In taking the place I have made a large sacrifice in the way of salary in the hope of securing comfort by which word I do not mean to express good eating and drinking or warm fire or a soft bed but the society of cheerful faces and minds and hearts not dug out of a lead mine or cut from a marble quarry My salary is not really more than sixteen l per annum though it is nominally twenty l but the expense of washing will be deducted therefrom My pupils are two in number a girl of eight and a boy of six As to my employers you will not expect me to say much about their characters when I tell you that I only arrived here yesterday I have not the faculty of telling an individual s disposition at first sight Before I can venture to pronounce on a character I must see it first under various lights and from various points of view All I can say therefore is both mister and missus seem to me good sort of people I have as yet had no cause to complain of want of considerateness or civility My pupils are wild and unbroken but apparently well disposed I wish I may be able to say as much next time I write to you My earnest wish and endeavour will be to please them If I can but feel that I am giving satisfaction and if at the same time I can keep my health I shall I hope be moderately happy But no one but myself can tell how hard a governess s work is to me for no one but myself is aware how utterly averse my whole mind and nature are for the employment Do not think that I fail to blame myself for this or that I leave any means unemployed to conquer this feeling Some of my greatest difficulties lie in things that would appear to you comparatively trivial I find it so hard to repel the rude familiarity of children I find it so difficult to ask either servants or mistress for anything I want however much I want it It is less pain for me to endure the greatest inconvenience than to go into the kitchen to request its removal I am a fool Heaven knows I cannot help it Now can you tell me whether it is considered improper for governesses to ask their friends to come and see them I do not mean of course to stay but just for a call of an hour or two If it is not absolute treason I do fervently request that you will contrive in some way or other to let me have a sight of your face Yet I feel at the same time that I am making a very foolish and almost impracticable demand yet this is only four miles from B March twenty first You must excuse a very short answer to your most welcome letter for my time is entirely occupied missus expected a good deal of sewing from me I cannot sew much during the day on account of the children who require the utmost attention I am obliged therefore to devote the evenings to this business Write to me often very long letters It will do both of us good This place is far better than but God knows I have enough to do to keep a good heart in the matter What you said has cheered me a little I wish I could always act according to your advice Home sickness affects me sorely I like mister extremely The children are over indulged and consequently hard at times to manage Do do do come and see me if it be a breach of etiquette never mind If you can only stop an hour come Talk no more about my forsaking you my darling I could not afford to do it I find it is not in my nature to get on in this weary world without sympathy and attachment in some quarter and seldom indeed do we find it It is too great a treasure to be ever wantonly thrown away when once secured Miss Bronte had not been many weeks in her new situation before she had a proof of the kind hearted hospitality of her employers mister wrote to her father and urgently invited him to come and make acquaintance with his daughter s new home by spending a week with her in it and missus expressed great regret when one of Miss Bronte s friends drove up to the house to leave a letter or parcel without entering So she found that all her friends might freely visit her and that her father would be received with especial gladness She thankfully acknowledged this kindness in writing to urge her friend afresh to come and see her which she accordingly did June eighteen forty one You can hardly fancy it possible I dare say that I cannot find a quarter of an hour to scribble a note in but so it is and when a note is written it has to be carried a mile to the post and that consumes nearly an hour which is a large portion of the day mister and missus have been gone a week I heard from them this morning No time is fixed for their return but I hope it will not be delayed long or I shall miss the chance of seeing Anne this vacation She came home I understand last Wednesday and is only to be allowed three weeks vacation because the family she is with are going to Scarborough I should like to see her to judge for myself of the state of her health I dare not trust any other person s report no one seems minute enough in their observations I should very much have liked you to have seen her I have got on very well with the servants and children so far yet it is dreary solitary work You can tell as well as me the lonely feeling of being without a companion Soon after this was written mister and missus returned in time to allow Charlotte to go and look after Anne s health which as she found to her intense anxiety was far from strong What could she do to nurse and cherish up this little sister the youngest of them all Apprehension about her brought up once more the idea of keeping a school If by this means they three could live together and maintain themselves all might go well They would have some time of their own in which to try again and yet again at that literary career which in spite of all baffling difficulties was never quite set aside as an ultimate object but far the strongest motive with Charlotte was the conviction that Anne s health was so delicate that it required a degree of tending which none but her sister could give Thus she wrote during those midsummer holidays Haworth July eighteenth eighteen forty one We waited long and anxiously for you on the Thursday that you promised to come I quite wearied my eyes with watching from the window eye glass in hand and sometimes spectacles on nose However you are not to blame and as to disappointment why all must suffer disappointment at some period or other of their lives But a hundred things I had to say to you will now be forgotten and never said There is a project hatching in this house which both Emily and I anxiously wished to discuss with you The project is yet in its infancy hardly peeping from its shell and whether it will ever come out a fine full fledged chicken or will turn addle and die before it cheeps is one of those considerations that are but dimly revealed by the oracles of futurity Now don t be nonplussed by all this metaphorical mystery I talk of a plain and everyday occurrence though in Delphic style I wrap up the information in figures of speech concerning eggs chickens etceatera etcaeterorum To come to the point Papa and aunt talk by fits and starts of our id est Emily Anne and myself commencing a school I have often you know said how much I wished such a thing but I never could conceive where the capital was to come from for making such a speculation I was well aware indeed that aunt had money but I always considered that she was the last person who would offer a loan for the purpose in question A loan however she has offered or rather intimates that she perhaps will offer in case pupils can be secured an eligible situation obtained c This sounds very fair but still there are matters to be considered which throw something of a damp upon the scheme I do not expect that aunt will sink more than one hundred fifty l in such a venture and would it be possible to establish a respectable not by any means a showy school and to commence housekeeping with a capital of only that amount Propound the question to your sister if you think she can answer it if not don t say a word on the subject As to getting into debt that is a thing we could none of us reconcile our mind to for a moment We do not care how modest how humble our commencement be so it be made on sure grounds and have a safe foundation In thinking of all possible and impossible places where we could establish a school I have thought of Burlington or rather of the neighbourhood of Burlington Do you remember whether there was any other school there besides that of Miss This is of course a perfectly crude and random idea There are a hundred reasons why it should be an impracticable one We have no connections no acquaintances there it is far from home c Still I fancy the ground in the East Riding is less fully occupied than in the West Much inquiry and consideration will be necessary of course before any place is decided on and I fear much time will elapse before any plan is executed Write as soon as you can I shall not leave my present situation till my future prospects assume a more fixed and definite aspect A fortnight afterwards we see that the seed has been sown which was to grow up into a plan materially influencing her future life August seventh eighteen forty one This is Saturday evening I have put the children to bed now I am going to sit down and answer your letter I am again by myself housekeeper and governess for mister and missus are staying at To speak truth though I am solitary while they are away it is still by far the happiest part of my time The children are under decent control the servants are very observant and attentive to me and the occasional absence of the master and mistress relieves me from the duty of always endeavouring to seem cheerful and conversable Martha it appears is in the way of enjoying great advantages so is Mary for you will be surprised to hear that she is returning immediately to the Continent with her brother not however to stay there but to take a month s tour and recreation I have had a long letter from Mary and a packet containing a present of a very handsome black silk scarf and a pair of beautiful kid gloves bought at Brussels Of course I was in one sense pleased with the gift pleased that they should think of me so far off amidst the excitements of one of the most splendid capitals of Europe and yet it felt irksome to accept it I should think Mary and Martha have not more than sufficient pocket money to supply themselves I wish they had testified their regard by a less expensive token Mary s letters spoke of some of the pictures and cathedrals she had seen pictures the most exquisite cathedrals the most venerable I hardly know what swelled to my throat as I read her letter such a vehement impatience of restraint and steady work such a strong wish for wings wings such as wealth can furnish such an urgent thirst to see to know to learn something internal seemed to expand bodily for a minute I was tantalised by the consciousness of faculties unexercised then all collapsed and I despaired My dear I would hardly make that confession to any one but yourself and to you rather in a letter than viva voce These rebellious and absurd emotions were only momentary I quelled them in five minutes I hope they will not revive for they were acutely painful No further steps have been taken about the project I mentioned to you nor probably will be for the present but Emily and Anne and I keep it in view It is our polar star and we look to it in all circumstances of despondency I begin to suspect I am writing in a strain which will make you think I am unhappy This is far from being the case on the contrary I know my place is a favourable one for a governess What dismays and haunts me sometimes is a conviction that I have no natural knack for my vocation If teaching only were requisite it would be smooth and easy but it is the living in other people s houses the estrangement from one s real character the adoption of a cold rigid apathetic exterior that is painful You will not mention our school project at present A project not actually commenced is always uncertain Write to me often my dear Nell you know your letters are valued Your loving child as you choose to call me so C B P S I am well in health don t fancy I am not but I have one aching feeling at my heart I must allude to it though I had resolved not to It is about Anne she has so much to endure far far more than I ever had When my thoughts turn to her they always see her as a patient persecuted stranger I know what concealed susceptibility is in her nature when her feelings are wounded I wish I could be with her to administer a little balm She is more lonely less gifted with the power of making friends even than I am Drop the subject She could bear much for herself but she could not patiently bear the sorrows of others especially of her sisters and again of the two sisters the idea of the little gentle youngest suffering in lonely patience was insupportable to her Something must be done No matter if the desired end were far away all time was lost in which she was not making progress however slow towards it To have a school was to have some portion of daily leisure uncontrolled but by her own sense of duty it was for the three sisters loving each other with so passionate an affection to be together under one roof and yet earning their own subsistence above all it was to have the power of watching over these two whose life and happiness were ever to Charlotte far more than her own But no trembling impatience should lead her to take an unwise step in haste She inquired in every direction she could as to the chances which a new school might have of success In all there seemed more establishments like the one which the sisters wished to set up than could be supported What was to be done Superior advantages must be offered But how They themselves abounded in thought power and information but these are qualifications scarcely fit to be inserted in a prospectus Of French they knew something enough to read it fluently but hardly enough to teach it in competition with natives or professional masters Emily and Anne had some knowledge of music but here again it was doubtful whether without more instruction they could engage to give lessons in it Just about this time Miss W was thinking of relinquishing her school at Dewsbury Moor and offered to give it up in favour of her old pupils the Brontes A sister of hers had taken the active management since the time when Charlotte was a teacher but the number of pupils had diminished and if the Brontes undertook it they would have to try and work it up to its former state of prosperity This again would require advantages on their part which they did not at present possess but which Charlotte caught a glimpse of She resolved to follow the clue and never to rest till she had reached a successful issue With the forced calm of a suppressed eagerness that sends a glow of desire through every word of the following letter she wrote to her aunt thus Dear Aunt Sept twenty ninth eighteen forty one I have heard nothing of Miss W yet since I wrote to her intimating that I would accept her offer I cannot conjecture the reason of this long silence unless some unforeseen impediment has occurred in concluding the bargain Meantime a plan has been suggested and approved by mister and missus the father and mother of her pupils and others which I wish now to impart to you My friends recommend me if I desire to secure permanent success to delay commencing the school for six months longer and by all means to contrive by hook or by crook to spend the intervening time in some school on the continent They say schools in England are so numerous competition so great that without some such step towards attaining superiority we shall probably have a very hard struggle and may fail in the end They say moreover that the loan of one hundred l which you have been so kind as to offer us will perhaps not be all required now as Miss W will lend us the furniture and that if the speculation is intended to be a good and successful one half the sum at least ought to be laid out in the manner I have mentioned thereby insuring a more speedy repayment both of interest and principal I would not go to France or to Paris I would go to Brussels in Belgium The cost of the journey there at the dearest rate of travelling would be five l living is there little more than half as dear as it is in England and the facilities for education are equal or superior to any other place in Europe In half a year I could acquire a thorough familiarity with French I could improve greatly in Italian and even get a dash of German i e providing my health continued as good as it is now Mary is now staying at Brussels at a first rate establishment there I should not think of going to the Chateau de Kokleberg where she is resident as the terms are much too high but if I wrote to her she with the assistance of missus Jenkins the wife of the British Chaplain would be able to secure me a cheap decent residence and respectable protection I should have the opportunity of seeing her frequently she would make me acquainted with the city and with the assistance of her cousins I should probably be introduced to connections far more improving polished and cultivated than any I have yet known These are advantages which would turn to real account when we actually commenced a school and if Emily could share them with me we could take a footing in the world afterwards which we can never do now I say Emily instead of Anne for Anne might take her turn at some future period if our school answered I feel certain while I am writing that you will see the propriety of what I say You always like to use your money to the best advantage You are not fond of making shabby purchases when you do confer a favour it is often done in style and depend upon it fifty l or one hundred l thus laid out would be well employed Of course I know no other friend in the world to whom I could apply on this subject except yourself I feel an absolute conviction that if this advantage were allowed us it would be the making of us for life Papa will perhaps think it a wild and ambitious scheme but who ever rose in the world without ambition When he left Ireland to go to Cambridge University he was as ambitious as I am now I want us all to get on I know we have talents and I want them to be turned to account I look to you aunt to help us I think you will not refuse I know if you consent it shall not be my fault if you ever repent your kindness This letter was written from the house in which she was residing as governess It was some little time before an answer came Much had to be talked over between the father and aunt in Haworth Parsonage At last consent was given Then and not till then she confided her plan to an intimate friend She was not one to talk over much about any project while it remained uncertain to speak about her labour in any direction while its result was doubtful Nov second eighteen forty one Now let us begin to quarrel In the first place I must consider whether I will commence operations on the defensive or the offensive The defensive I think You say and I see plainly that your feelings have been hurt by an apparent want of confidence on my part You heard from others of Miss W s overtures before I communicated them to you myself This is true I was deliberating on plans important to my future prospects I never exchanged a letter with you on the subject True again This appears strange conduct to a friend near and dear long known and never found wanting Most true I cannot give you my excuses for this behaviour this word excuse implies confession of a fault and I do not feel that I have been in fault The plain fact is I was not I am not now certain of my destiny On the contrary I have been most uncertain perplexed with contradictory schemes and proposals My time as I have often told you is fully occupied yet I had many letters to write which it was absolutely necessary should be written I knew it would avail nothing to write to you then to say I was in doubt and uncertainty hoping this fearing that anxious eagerly desirous to do what seemed impossible to be done When I thought of you in that busy interval it was to resolve that you should know all when my way was clear and my grand end attained If I could I would always work in silence and obscurity and let my efforts be known by their results Miss W did most kindly propose that I should come to Dewsbury Moor and attempt to revive the school her sister had relinquished She offered me the use of her furniture At first I received the proposal cordially and prepared to do my utmost to bring about success but a fire was kindled in my very heart which I could not quench I so longed to increase my attainments to become something better than I am a glimpse of what I felt I showed to you in one of my former letters only a glimpse Mary cast oil upon the flames encouraged me and in her own strong energetic language heartened me on I longed to go to Brussels but how could I get there I wished for one at least of my sisters to share the advantage with me I fixed on Emily She deserved the reward I knew How could the point be managed In extreme excitement I wrote a letter home which carried the day I made an appeal to aunt for assistance which was answered by consent Things are not settled yet it is sufficient to say we have a chance of going for half a year Dewsbury Moor is relinquished Perhaps fortunately so In my secret soul I believe there is no cause to regret it My plans for the future are bounded to this intention if I once get to Brussels and if my health is spared I will do my best to make the utmost of every advantage that shall come within my reach When the half year is expired I will do what I can Believe me though I was born in April the month of cloud and sunshine I am not changeful My spirits are unequal and sometimes I speak vehemently and sometimes I say nothing at all but I have a steady regard for you and if you will let the cloud and shower pass by be sure the sun is always behind obscured but still existing At Christmas she left her situation after a parting with her employers which seems to have affected and touched her greatly They only made too much of me was her remark after leaving this family I did not deserve it All four children hoped to meet together at their father s house this December Branwell expected to have a short leave of absence from his employment as a clerk on the Leeds and Manchester Railway in which he had been engaged for five months Anne arrived before Christmas day She had rendered herself so valuable in her difficult situation that her employers vehemently urged her to return although she had announced her resolution to leave them partly on account of the harsh treatment she had received and partly because her stay at home during her sisters absence in Belgium seemed desirable when the age of the three remaining inhabitants of the parsonage was taken into consideration After some correspondence and much talking over plans at home it seemed better in consequence of letters which they received from Brussels giving a discouraging account of the schools there that Charlotte and Emily should go to an institution at Lille in the north of France which was highly recommended by Baptist Noel and other clergymen Indeed at the end of January it was arranged that they were to set off for this place in three weeks under the escort of a French lady then visiting in London The terms were fifty l each pupil for board and French alone but a separate room was to be allowed for this sum without this indulgence it was lower Charlotte writes January twentieth eighteen forty two I consider it kind in aunt to consent to an extra sum for a separate room We shall find it a great privilege in many ways I regret the change from Brussels to Lille on many accounts chiefly that I shall not see Martha Mary has been indefatigably kind in providing me with information She has grudged no labour and scarcely any expense to that end Mary s price is above rubies I have in fact two friends you and her staunch and true in whose faith and sincerity I have as strong a belief as I have in the Bible I have bothered you both you especially but you always get the tongs and heap coals of fire upon my head I have had letters to write lately to Brussels to Lille and to London I have lots of chemises nightgowns pocket handkerchiefs and pockets to make besides clothes to repair I have been every week since I came home expecting to see Branwell and he has never been able to get over yet We fully expect him however next Saturday Under these circumstances how can I go visiting You tantalize me to death with talking of conversations by the fireside Depend upon it we are not to have any such for many a long month to come I get an interesting impression of old age upon my face and when you see me next I shall certainly wear caps and spectacles CHAPTER XI I am not aware of all the circumstances which led to the relinquishment of the Lille plan Brussels had had from the first a strong attraction for Charlotte and the idea of going there in preference to any other place had only been given up in consequence of the information received of the second rate character of its schools In one of her letters reference has been made to missus Jenkins the wife of the chaplain of the British Embassy At the request of his brother a clergyman living not many miles from Haworth and an acquaintance of mister Bronte s she made much inquiry and at length after some discouragement in her search heard of a school which seemed in every respect desirable There was an English lady who had long lived in the Orleans family amidst the various fluctuations of their fortunes and who when the Princess Louise was married to King Leopold accompanied her to Brussels in the capacity of reader This lady s granddaughter was receiving her education at the pensionnat of Madame Heger and so satisfied was the grandmother with the kind of instruction given that she named the establishment with high encomiums to missus Jerkins and in consequence it was decided that if the terms suited Miss Bronte and Emily should proceed thither M Heger informs me that on receipt of a letter from Charlotte making very particular inquiries as to the possible amount of what are usually termed extras he and his wife were so much struck by the simple earnest tone of the letter that they said to each other These are the daughters of an English pastor of moderate means anxious to learn with an ulterior view of instructing others and to whom the risk of additional expense is of great consequence Let us name a specific sum within which all expenses shall be included This was accordingly done the agreement was concluded and the Brontes prepared to leave their native county for the first time if we except the melancholy and memorable residence at Cowan Bridge mister Bronte determined to accompany his daughters Mary and her brother who were experienced in foreign travelling were also of the party Charlotte first saw London in the day or two they now stopped there and from an expression in one of her subsequent letters they all I believe stayed at the Chapter Coffee House Paternoster Row a strange old fashioned tavern of which I shall have more to say hereafter Mary s account of their journey is thus given In passing through London she seemed to think our business was and ought to be to see all the pictures and statues we could She knew the artists and know where other productions of theirs were to be found I don t remember what we saw except saint Paul s Emily was like her in these habits of mind but certainly never took her opinion but always had one to offer I don t know what Charlotte thought of Brussels We arrived in the dark and went next morning to our respective schools to see them We were of course much preoccupied and our prospects gloomy Charlotte used to like the country round Brussels At the top of every hill you see something She took long solitary walks on the occasional holidays mister Bronte took his daughters to the Rue d Isabelle Brussels remained one night at mister Jenkins and straight returned to his wild Yorkshire village What a contrast to that must the Belgian capital have presented to those two young women thus left behind Suffering acutely from every strange and unaccustomed contact far away from their beloved home and the dear moors beyond their indomitable will was their great support Charlotte s own words with regard to Emily are After the age of twenty having meantime studied alone with diligence and perseverance she went with me to an establishment on the continent The same suffering and conflict ensued heightened by the strong recoil of her upright heretic and English spirit from the gentle Jesuitry of the foreign and Romish system Once more she seemed sinking but this time she rallied through the mere force of resolution with inward remorse and shame she looked back on her former failure and resolved to conquer but the victory cost her dear She was never happy till she carried her hard won knowledge back to the remote English village the old parsonage house and desolate Yorkshire hills They wanted learning They came for learning They would learn Where they had a distinct purpose to be achieved in intercourse with their fellows they forgot themselves at all other times they were miserably shy missus Jenkins told me that she used to ask them to spend Sundays and holidays with her until she found that they felt more pain than pleasure from such visits Emily hardly ever uttered more than a monosyllable Charlotte was sometimes excited sufficiently to speak eloquently and well on certain subjects but before her tongue was thus loosened she had a habit of gradually wheeling round on her chair so as almost to conceal her face from the person to whom she was speaking And yet there was much in Brussels to strike a responsive chord in her powerful imagination At length she was seeing somewhat of that grand old world of which she had dreamed As the gay crowds passed by her so had gay crowds paced those streets for centuries in all their varying costumes Every spot told an historic tale extending back into the fabulous ages when Jan and Jannika the aboriginal giant and giantess looked over the wall forty feet high of what is now the Rue Villa Hermosa and peered down upon the new settlers who were to turn them out of the country in which they had lived since the deluge The great solemn Cathedral of saint Gudule the religious paintings the striking forms and ceremonies of the Romish Church all made a deep impression on the girls fresh from the bare walls and simple worship of Haworth Church And then they were indignant with themselves for having been susceptible of this impression and their stout Protestant hearts arrayed themselves against the false Duessa that had thus imposed upon them The very building they occupied as pupils in Madame Heger s pensionnat had its own ghostly train of splendid associations marching for ever in shadowy procession through and through the ancient rooms and shaded alleys of the gardens From the splendour of to day in the Rue Royale if you turn aside near the statue of the General Beliard you look down four flights of broad stone steps upon the Rue d Isabelle The chimneys of the houses in it are below your feet Opposite to the lowest flight of steps there is a large old mansion facing you with a spacious walled garden behind and to the right of it In front of this garden on the same side as the mansion and with great boughs of trees sweeping over their lowly roofs is a row of small picturesque old fashioned cottages not unlike in degree and uniformity to the almshouses so often seen in an English country town The Rue d Isabelle looks as though it had been untouched by the innovations of the builder for the last three centuries and yet any one might drop a stone into it from the back windows of the grand modern hotels in the Rue Royale built and furnished in the newest Parisian fashion In the thirteenth century the Rue d Isabelle was called the Fosse aux Chiens and the kennels for the ducal hounds occupied the place where Madame Heger s pensionnat now stands A hospital in the ancient large meaning of the word succeeded to the kennel The houseless and the poor perhaps the leprous were received by the brethren of a religious order in a building on this sheltered site and what had been a fosse for defence was filled up with herb gardens and orchards for upwards of a hundred years Then came the aristocratic guild of the cross bow men that company the members whereof were required to prove their noble descent untainted for so many generations before they could be admitted into the guild and being admitted were required to swear a solemn oath that no other pastime or exercise should take up any part of their leisure the whole of which was to be devoted to the practice of the noble art of shooting with the cross bow Once a year a grand match was held under the patronage of some saint to whose church steeple was affixed the bird or semblance of a bird to be hit by the victor The conqueror in the game was Roi des Arbaletriers for the coming year and received a jewelled decoration accordingly which he was entitled to wear for twelve months after which he restored it to the guild to be again striven for The family of him who died during the year that he was king were bound to present the decoration to the church of the patron saint of the guild and to furnish a similar prize to be contended for afresh These noble cross bow men of the middle ages formed a sort of armed guard to the powers in existence and almost invariably took the aristocratic in preference to the democratic side in the numerous civil dissensions of the Flemish towns Hence they were protected by the authorities and easily obtained favourable and sheltered sites for their exercise ground And thus they came to occupy the old fosse and took possession of the great orchard of the hospital lying tranquil and sunny in the hollow below the rampart But in the sixteenth century it became necessary to construct a street through the exercise ground of the Arbaletriers du Grand Serment and after much delay the company were induced by the beloved Infanta Isabella to give up the requisite plot of ground In recompense for this Isabella who herself was a member of the guild and had even shot down the bird and been queen in sixteen fifteen made many presents to the arbaletriers and in return the grateful city which had long wanted a nearer road to saint Gudule but been baffled by the noble archers called the street after her name She as a sort of indemnification to the arbaletriers caused a great mansion to be built for their accommodation in the new Rue d Isabelle This mansion was placed in front of their exercise ground and was of a square shape On a remote part of the walls may still be read PHILLIPPO IIII HISPAN REGE ISABELLA CLARA EUGENIA HISPAN INFANS MAGNAE GULDAE REGINA GULDAE FRATRIBUS POSUIT In that mansion were held all the splendid feasts of the Grand Serment des Arbaletriers The master archer lived there constantly in order to be ever at hand to render his services to the guild The great saloon was also used for the court balls and festivals when the archers were not admitted The Infanta caused other and smaller houses to be built in her new street to serve as residences for her garde noble and for her garde bourgeoise a small habitation each some of which still remain to remind us of English almshouses The great mansion with its quadrangular form the spacious saloon once used for the archducal balls where the dark grave Spaniards mixed with the blond nobility of Brabant and Flanders now a schoolroom for Belgian girls the cross bow men s archery ground all are there the pensionnat of Madame Heger This lady was assisted in the work of instruction by her husband a kindly wise good and religious man whose acquaintance I am glad to have made and who has furnished me with some interesting details from his wife s recollections and his own of the two Miss Brontes during their residence in Brussels He had the better opportunities of watching them from his giving lessons in the French language and literature in the school A short extract from a letter written to me by a French lady resident in Brussels and well qualified to judge will help to show the estimation in which he is held Je ne connais pas personnellement M Heger mais je sais qu il est peu de caracteres aussi nobles aussi admirables que le sien Il est un des membres les plus zeles de cette Societe de S Vincent de Paul dont je t ai deja parle et ne se contente pas de servir les pauvres et les malades mais leur consacre encore les soirees Apres des journees absorbees tout entieres par les devoirs que sa place lui impose il reunit les pauvres les ouvriers leur donne des cours gratuits et trouve encore le moyen de les amuser en les instruisant Ce devouement te dira assez que M Heger est profondement et ouvertement religieux Il a des manieres franches et avenantes il se fait aimer de tous ceux qui l approchent et surtout des enfants Il a la parole facile et possde a un haut degre l eloquence du bon sens et du coeur Il n est point auteur Homme de zele et de conscience il vient de se demettre des fonctions elevees et lucratives qu il exercait a l Athenee celles de Prefet des Etudes parce qu il ne peut y realiser le bien qu il avait espere introduire l enseignement religieux dans le programme des etudes J ai vu une fois Madame Heger qui a quelque chose de froid et de compasse dans son maintien et qui previent peu en sa faveur Je la crois pourtant aimee et appreciee par ses eleves There were from eighty to a hundred pupils in the pensionnat when Charlotte and Emily Bronte entered in February eighteen forty two M Heger s account is that they knew nothing of French I suspect they knew as much or as little for all conversational purposes as any English girls do who have never been abroad and have only learnt the idioms and pronunciation from an Englishwoman The two sisters clung together and kept apart from the herd of happy boisterous well befriended Belgian girls who in their turn thought the new English pupils wild and scared looking with strange odd insular ideas about dress for Emily had taken a fancy to the fashion ugly and preposterous even during its reign of gigot sleves and persisted in wearing them long after they were gone out Her petticoats too had not a curve or a wave in them but hung down straight and long clinging to her lank figure The sisters spoke to no one but from necessity They were too full of earnest thought and of the exile s sick yearning to be ready for careless conversation or merry game M Heger who had done little but observe during the few first weeks of their residence in the Rue d Isabelle perceived that with their unusual characters and extraordinary talents a different mode must be adopted from that in which he generally taught French to English girls He seems to have rated Emily s genius as something even higher than Charlotte s and her estimation of their relative powers was the same Emily had a head for logic and a capability of argument unusual in a man and rare indeed in a woman according to M Heger Impairing the force of this gift was a stubborn tenacity of will which rendered her obtuse to all reasoning where her own wishes or her own sense of right was concerned She should have been a man a great navigator said M Heger in speaking of her Her powerful reason would have deduced new spheres of discovery from the knowledge of the old and her strong imperious will would never have been daunted by opposition or difficulty never have given way but with life And yet moreover her faculty of imagination was such that if she had written a history her view of scenes and characters would have been so vivid and so powerfully expressed and supported by such a show of argument that it would have dominated over the reader whatever might have been his previous opinions or his cooler perceptions of its truth But she appeared egotistical and exacting compared to Charlotte who was always unselfish this is M Heger s testimony and in the anxiety of the elder to make her younger sister contented she allowed her to exercise a kind of unconscious tyranny over her After consulting with his wife M Heger told them that he meant to dispense with the old method of grounding in grammar vocabulary c and to proceed on a new plan something similar to what he had occasionally adopted with the elder among his French and Belgian pupils He proposed to read to them some of the master pieces of the most celebrated French authors such as Casimir de la Vigne s poem on the Death of Joan of Arc parts of Bossuet the admirable translation of the noble letter of saint Ignatius to the Roman Christians in the Bibliotheque Choisie des Peres de l Eglise c and after having thus impressed the complete effect of the whole to analyse the parts with them pointing out in what such or such an author excelled and where were the blemishes He believed that he had to do with pupils capable from their ready sympathy with the intellectual the refined the polished or the noble of catching the echo of a style and so reproducing their own thoughts in a somewhat similar manner After explaining his plan to them he awaited their reply Emily spoke first and said that she saw no good to be derived from it and that by adopting it they should lose all originality of thought and expression She would have entered into an argument on the subject but for this M Heger had no time Charlotte then spoke she also doubted the success of the plan but she would follow out M Heger s advice because she was bound to obey him while she was his pupil Before speaking of the results it may be desirable to give an extract from one of her letters which shows some of her first impressions of her new life Brussels eighteen forty two May I was twenty six years old a week or two since and at this ripe time of life I am a school girl and on the whole very happy in that capacity It felt very strange at first to submit to authority instead of exercising it to obey orders instead of giving them but I like that state of things I returned to it with the same avidity that a cow that has long been kept on dry hay returns to fresh grass Don t laugh at my simile It is natural to me to submit and very unnatural to command This is a large school in which there are about forty externes or day pupils and twelve pensionnaires or boarders Madame Heger the head is a lady of precisely the same cast of mind degree of cultivation and quality of intellect as Miss I think the severe points are a little softened because she has not been disappointed and consequently soured In a word she is a married instead of a maiden lady There are three teachers in the school Mademoiselle Blanche Mademoiselle Sophie and Mademoiselle Marie The two first have no particular character One is an old maid and the other will be one Mademoiselle Marie is talented and original but of repulsive and arbitrary manners which have made the whole school except myself and Emily her bitter enemies No less than seven masters attend to teach the different branches of education French Drawing Music Singing Writing Arithmetic and German All in the house are Catholics except ourselves one other girl and the gouvernante of Madame s children an Englishwoman in rank something between a lady s maid and a nursery governess The difference in country and religion makes a broad line of demarcation between us and all the rest We are completely isolated in the midst of numbers Yet I think I am never unhappy my present life is so delightful so congenial to my own nature compared to that of a governess My time constantly occupied passes too rapidly Hitherto both Emily and I have had good health and therefore we have been able to work well There is one individual of whom I have not yet spoken M Heger the husband of Madame He is professor of rhetoric a man of power as to mind but very choleric and irritable in temperament He is very angry with me just at present because I have written a translation which he chose to stigmatize as peu correct He did not tell me so but wrote the word on the margin of my book and asked in brief stern phrase how it happened that my compositions were always better than my translations adding that the thing seemed to him inexplicable The fact is some weeks ago in a high flown humour he forbade me to use either dictionary or grammar in translating the most difficult English compositions into French This makes the task rather arduous and compels me every now and then to introduce an English word which nearly plucks the eyes out of his head when he sees it Emily and he don t draw well together at all Emily works like a horse and she has had great difficulties to contend with far greater than I have had Indeed those who come to a French school for instruction ought previously to have acquired a considerable knowledge of the French language otherwise they will lose a great deal of time for the course of instruction is adapted to natives and not to foreigners and in these large establishments they will not change their ordinary course for one or two strangers The few private lessons that M Heger has vouchsafed to give us are I suppose to be considered a great favour and I can perceive they have already excited much spite and jealousy in the school You will abuse this letter for being short and dreary and there are a hundred things which I want to tell you but I have not time Brussels is a beautiful city The Belgians hate the English Their external morality is more rigid than ours To lace the stays without a handkerchief on the neck is considered a disgusting piece of indelicacy The passage in this letter where M Heger is represented as prohibiting the use of dictionary or grammar refers I imagine to the time I have mentioned when he determined to adopt a new method of instruction in the French language of which they were to catch the spirit and rhythm rather from the ear and the heart as its noblest accents fell upon them than by over careful and anxious study of its grammatical rules It seems to me a daring experiment on the part of their teacher but doubtless he knew his ground and that it answered is evident in the composition of some of Charlotte s devoirs written about this time I am tempted in illustration of this season of mental culture to recur to a conversation which I had with M Heger on the manner in which he formed his pupils style and to give a proof of his success by copying a devoir of Charlotte s with his remarks upon it He told me that one day this summer when the Brontes had been for about four months receiving instruction from him he read to them Victor Hugo s celebrated portrait of Mirabeau mais dans ma lecon je me bornais a ce qui concerne Mirabeau orateur C est apres l analyse de ce morceau considere surtout du point de vue du fond de la disposition de ce qu on pourrait appeler la charpente qu ont ete faits les deux portraits que je vous donne He went on to say that he had pointed out to them the fault in Victor Hugo s style as being exaggeration in conception and at the same time he had made them notice the extreme beauty of his nuances of expression They were then dismissed to choose the subject of a similar kind of portrait This selection M Heger always left to them for it is necessary he observed before sitting down to write on a subject to have thoughts and feelings about it I cannot tell on what subject your heart and mind have been excited I must leave that to you The marginal comments I need hardly say are M Heger s the words in italics are Charlotte s for which he substitutes a better form of expression which is placed between brackets IMITATION Le thirty one Juillet eighteen forty two PORTRAIT DE PIERRE L HERMITE CHARLOTTE BRONTE De temps en temps il parait sur la terre des hommes destines a etre les instruments predestines de grands changements moraux ou politiques Quelquefois c est un conquerant un Alexandre ou un Attila qui passe comme un ouragan et purifie l atmosphere moral comme l orage purifie l atmosphere physique quelquefois c est un revolutionnaire un Cromwell ou un Robespierre qui fait expier par un roi les vices de toute une dynastie quelquefois c est un enthousiaste religieux comme Mahomet ou Pierre l Hermite qui avec le seul levier de la pensee souleve des nations entieres les deracine et les transplante dans des climats nouveaux peuplant l Asie avec les habitants de l Europe Pierre l Hermite etait gentilhomme de Picardie en France pourquoi donc n a t il passe sa vie comma les autres gentilhommes ses contemporains ont passe la leur a table a la chasse dans son lit sans s inquieter de Saladin ou de ses Sarrasins N est ce pas parce qu il y a dans certaines natures une ardour un foyer d activite indomptable qui ne leur permet pas de rester inactives qui les force a se remuer afin d exercer les facultes puissantes qui meme en dormant sont pretes comme Sampson a briser les noeuds qui les retiennent Pierre prit la profession des armes si son ardeur avait ete de cette espece s il n avait eu que cette ardeur vulgaire qui provient d une robuste sante il aurait c eut ete un brave militaire et rien de plus mais son ardeur etait celle de l ame sa flamme etait pure et elle s elevait vers le ciel Sans doute Il est vrai que la jeunesse de Pierre etait fet troublee par passions orageuses les natures puissantes sont extremes en tout elles ne connaissent la tiedeur ni dans le bien ni dans le mal Pierre donc chercha d abord avidement la gloire qui se fletrit et les plaisirs qui trompent mais il fit bientot la decouverte bientot il s apercut que ce qu il poursuivait n etait qe une illusion a laquelle il ne pourrait jamais atteindre il retourna donc sur ses pas il recommenca le voyage de la vie mais cette fois il evita le chemin spacieux qui mene a la perdition et il prit le chemin etroit qui mene a la vie puisque comme le trajet etait long et difficile il jeta la casque et les armes du soldat et se vetit de l habit simple du moine A la vie militaire succeda la vie monastique car les extremes se touchent et chez l homme sincere la sincerite du repentir amene necessairement a la suite avec lui la rigueur de la penitence Voila donc Pierre devenu moine Mais Pierre il avait en lui un principe qui l empechait de rester long temps inactif ses idees sur quel sujet qu il soit que ce fut ne pouvaient pas etre bornees il ne lui suffisait pas que lui meme fut religieux que lui meme fut convaincu de la realite de Christianisme sic il fallait que toute l Europe que toute l Asie partageat sa conviction et professat la croyance de la Croix La Piete fervente elevee par la Genie nourrie par la Solitude fit naitre une espece d inspiration exalta son ame jusqu a l inspiration dans son ame et lorsqu il quitta sa cellule et reparut dans le monde il portait comme Moise l empreinte de la Divinite sur son front et tout tous reconnurent en lui la veritable apotre de la Croix Mahomet n avait jamais remue les molles nations de l Orient comme alors Pierre remua les peuples austeres de l Occident il fallait que cette eloquence fut d une force presque miraculeuse qui pouvait presqu elle persuad er ait aux rois de vendre leurs royaumes afin de procurer pour avoir des armes et des soldats pour aider a offrir a Pierre dans la guerre sainte qu il voulait livrer aux infideles La puissance de Pierre l Hermite n etait nullement une puissance physique car la nature ou pour mieux dire Dieu est impartial dans la distribution de ses dons il accorde a l un de ses enfants la grace la beaute les perfections corporelles a l autre l esprit la grandeur morale Pierre donc etait un homme petit d une physionomie peu agreable mais il avait ce courage cette constance cet enthousiasme cette energie de sentiment qui ecrase toute opposition et qui fait que la volonte d un seul homme devient la loi de toute une nation Pour se former une juste idee de l influence qu exerca cet homme sur les caracteres choses et les idees de son temps il faut se le representer au milieu de l armee des croisees dans son double role de prophete et de guerrier le pauvre hermite vetu du pauvre de l humble habit gris est la plus puissant qieun roi il est entoure d une de la multitude avide une multitude qui ne voit que lui tandis qui lui il ne voit que le ciel ses yeux leves semblent dire Je vois Dieu et les anges et j ai perdu de vue la terre Dans ce moment le mais ce pauvre habit froc gris est pour lui comme le manteau d Elijah il l enveloppe d inspiration il Pierre lit dans l avenir il voit Jerusalem delivree il voit le saint sepulcre libre il voit le Croissant argent est arrache du Temple et l Oriflamme et la Croix rouge sont etabli a sa place non seulement Pierre voit ces merveilles mais il les fait voir a tous ceux qui l entourent il ravive l esperance et le courage dans tous ces corps epuises de fatigues et de privations La bataille ne sera livree que demain mais la victoire est decidee ce soir Pierre a promis et les Croises se fient a sa parole comme les Israelites se fiaient a celle de Moise et de Josue As a companion portrait to this Emily chose to depict Harold on the eve of the battle of Hastings It appears to me that her devoir is superior to Charlotte s in power and in imagination and fully equal to it in language and that this in both cases considering how little practical knowledge of French they had when they arrived at Brussels in February and that they wrote without the aid of dictionary or grammar is unusual and remarkable We shall see the progress Charlotte had made in ease and grace of style a year later In the choice of subjects left to her selection she frequently took characters and scenes from the Old Testament with which all her writings show that she was especially familiar The picturesqueness and colour if I may so express it the grandeur and breadth of its narrations impressed her deeply To use M Heger s expression Elle etait nourrie de la Bible After he had read De la Vigne s poem on Joan of Arc she chose the Vision and Death of Moses on Mount Nebo to write about and in looking over this devoir I was much struck with one or two of M Heger s remarks After describing in a quiet and simple manner the circumstances under which Moses took leave of the Israelites her imagination becomes warmed and she launches out into a noble strain depicting the glorious futurity of the Chosen People as looking down upon the Promised Land he sees their prosperity in prophetic vision But before reaching the middle of this glowing description she interrupts herself to discuss for a moment the doubts that have been thrown on the miraculous relations of the Old Testament M Heger remarks When you are writing place your argument first in cool prosaic language but when you have thrown the reins on the neck of your imagination do not pull her up to reason Again in the vision of Moses he sees the maidens leading forth their flocks to the wells at eventide and they are described as wearing flowery garlands Here the writer is reminded of the necessity of preserving a certain verisimilitude Moses might from his elevation see mountains and plains groups of maidens and herds of cattle but could hardly perceive the details of dress or the ornaments of the head When they had made further progress M Heger took up a more advanced plan that of synthetical teaching He would read to them various accounts of the same person or event and make them notice the points of agreement and disagreement Where they were different he would make them seek the origin of that difference by causing them to examine well into the character and position of each separate writer and how they would be likely to affect his conception of truth For instance take Cromwell He would read Bossuet s description of him in the Oraison Funebre de la Reine d Angleterre and show how in this he was considered entirely from the religious point of view as an instrument in the hands of God preordained to His work Then he would make them read Guizot and see how in this view Cromwell was endowed with the utmost power of free will but governed by no higher motive than that of expediency while Carlyle regarded him as a character regulated by a strong and conscientious desire to do the will of the Lord Then he would desire them to remember that the Royalist and Commonwealth men had each their different opinions of the great Protector And from these conflicting characters he would require them to sift and collect the elements of truth and try to unite them into a perfect whole This kind of exercise delighted Charlotte It called into play her powers of analysis which were extraordinary and she very soon excelled in it Wherever the Brontes could be national they were so with the same tenacity of attachment which made them suffer as they did whenever they left Haworth They were Protestant to the backbone in other things beside their religion but pre eminently so in that Touched as Charlotte was by the letter of saint Ignatius before alluded to she claimed equal self devotion and from as high a motive for some of the missionaries of the English Church sent out to toil and to perish on the poisonous African coast and wrote as an imitation Lettre d un Missionnaire Sierra Leone Afrique Something of her feeling too appears in the following letter Brussels eighteen forty two I consider it doubtful whether I shall come home in September or not Madame Heger has made a proposal for both me and Emily to stay another half year offering to dismiss her English master and take me as English teacher also to employ Emily some part of each day in teaching music to a certain number of the pupils For these services we are to be allowed to continue our studies in French and German and to have board c without paying for it no salaries however are offered The proposal is kind and in a great selfish city like Brussels and a great selfish school containing nearly ninety pupils boarders and day pupils included implies a degree of interest which demands gratitude in return I am inclined to accept it What think you I don t deny I sometimes wish to be in England or that I have brief attacks of home sickness but on the whole I have borne a very valiant heart so far and I have been happy in Brussels because I have always been fully occupied with the employments that I like Emily is making rapid progress in French German music and drawing Monsieur and Madame Heger begin to recognise the valuable parts of her character under her singularities If the national character of the Belgians is to be measured by the character of most of the girls is this school it in a character singularly cold selfish animal and inferior They are very mutinous and difficult for the teachers to manage and their principles are rotten to the core We avoid them which it is not difficult to do as we have the brand of Protestantism and Anglicism upon us People talk of the danger which Protestants expose themselves to in going to reside in Catholic countries and thereby running the chance of changing their faith My advice to all Protestants who are tempted to do anything so besotted as turn Catholics is to walk over the sea on to the Continent to attend mass sedulously for a time to note well the mummeries thereof also the idiotic mercenary aspect of all the priests and then if they are still disposed to consider Papistry in any other light than a most feeble childish piece of humbug let them turn Papists at once that s all I consider Methodism Quakerism and the extremes of High and Low Churchism foolish but Roman Catholicism beats them all At the same time allow me to tell you that there are some Catholics who are as good as any Christians can be to whom the Bible is a sealed book and much better than many Protestants When the Brontes first went to Brussels it was with the intention of remaining there for six months or until the grandes vacances began in September The duties of the school were then suspended for six weeks or two months and it seemed a desirable period for their return But the proposal mentioned in the foregoing letter altered their plans Besides they were happy in the feeling that they were making progress in all the knowledge they had so long been yearning to acquire They were happy too in possessing friends whose society had been for years congenial to them and in occasional meetings with these they could have the inexpressible solace to residents in a foreign country and peculiarly such to the Brontes of talking over the intelligence received from their respective homes referring to past or planning for future days Mary and her sister the bright dancing laughing Martha were parlour boarders in an establishment just beyond the barriers of Brussels Again the cousins of these friends were resident in the town and at their house Charlotte and Emily were always welcome though their overpowering shyness prevented their more valuable qualities from being known and generally kept them silent They spent their weekly holiday with this family for many months but at the end of the time Emily was as impenetrable to friendly advances as at the beginning while Charlotte was too physically weak as Mary has expressed it to gather up her forces sufficiently to express any difference or opposition of opinion and had consequently an assenting and deferential manner strangely at variance with what they knew of her remarkable talents and decided character At this house the T s and the Brontes could look forward to meeting each other pretty frequently There was another English family where Charlotte soon became a welcome guest and where I suspect she felt herself more at her ease than either at missus Jenkins or the friends whom I have first mentioned An English physician with a large family of daughters went to reside at Brussels for the sake of their education He placed them at Madame Heger s school in July eighteen forty two not a month before the beginning of the grandes vacances on August fifteenth In order to make the most of their time and become accustomed to the language these English sisters went daily through the holidays to the pensionnat in the Rue d Isabelle Six or eight boarders remained besides the Miss Brontes They were there during the whole time never even having the break to their monotonous life which passing an occasional day with a friend would have afforded them but devoting themselves with indefatigable diligence to the different studies in which they were engaged Their position in the school appeared to these new comers analogous to what is often called that of a parlour boarder They prepared their French drawing German and literature for their various masters and to these occupations Emily added that of music in which she was somewhat of a proficient so much so as to be qualified to give instruction in it to the three younger sisters of my informant The school was divided into three classes In the first were from fifteen to twenty pupils in the second sixty was about the average number all foreigners excepting the two Brontes and one other in the third there were from twenty to thirty pupils The first and second classes occupied a long room divided by a wooden partition in each division were four long ranges of desks and at the end was the estrade or platform for the presiding instructor On the last row in the quietest corner sat Charlotte and Emily side by side so deeply absorbed in their studies as to be insensible to any noise or movement around them The school hours were from nine to twelve the luncheon hour when the boarders and half boarders perhaps two and thirty girls went to the refectoire a room with two long tables having an oil lamp suspended over each to partake of bread and fruit the externes or morning pupils who had brought their own refreshment with them adjourning to eat it in the garden From one to two there was fancy work a pupil reading aloud some light literature in each room from two to four lessons again At four the externes left and the remaining girls dined in the refectoire M and Madame Heger presiding From five to six there was recreation from six to seven preparation for lessons and after that succeeded the lecture pieuse Charlotte s nightmare On rare occasions M Heger himself would come in and substitute a book of a different and more interesting kind At eight there was a slight meal of water and pistolets the delicious little Brussels rolls which was immediately followed by prayers and then to bed The principal bedroom was over the long classe or schoolroom There were six or eight narrow beds on each side of the apartment every one enveloped in its white draping curtain a long drawer beneath each served for a wardrobe and between each was a stand for ewer basin and looking glass The beds of the two Miss Brontes were at the extreme end of the room almost as private and retired as if they had been in a separate apartment During the hours of recreation which were always spent in the garden they invariably walked together and generally kept a profound silence Emily though so much the taller leaning on her sister Charlotte would always answer when spoken to taking the lead in replying to any remark addressed to both Emily rarely spoke to any one Charlotte s quiet gentle manner never changed She was never seen out of temper for a moment and occasionally when she herself had assumed the post of English teacher and the impertinence or inattention of her pupils was most irritating a slight increase of colour a momentary sparkling of the eye and more decided energy of manner were the only outward tokens she gave of being conscious of the annoyance to which she was subjected But this dignified endurance of hers subdued her pupils in the long run far more than the voluble tirades of the other mistresses My informant adds The effect of this manner was singular I can speak from personal experience I was at that time high spirited and impetuous not respecting the French mistresses yet to my own astonishment at one word from her I was perfectly tractable so much so that at length M and Madame Heger invariably preferred all their wishes to me through her the other pupils did not perhaps love her as I did she was so quiet and silent but all respected her With the exception of that part which describes Charlotte s manner as English teacher an office which she did not assume for some months later all this description of the school life of the two Brontes refers to the commencement of the new scholastic year in October eighteen forty two and the extracts I have given convey the first impression which the life at a foreign school and the position of the two Miss Brontes therein made upon an intelligent English girl of sixteen I will make a quotation from Mary s letter referring to this time The first part of her time at Brussels was not uninteresting She spoke of new people and characters and foreign ways of the pupils and teachers She knew the hopes and prospects of the teachers and mentioned one who was very anxious to marry she was getting so old She used to get her father or brother I forget which to be the bearer of letters to different single men who she thought might be persuaded to do her the favour saying that her only resource was to become a sister of charity if her present employment failed and that she hated the idea Charlotte naturally looked with curiosity to people of her own condition This woman almost frightened her She declares there is nothing she can turn to and laughs at the idea of delicacy and she is only ten years older than I am I did not see the connection till she said Well Polly I should hate being a sister of charity I suppose that would shock some people but I should I thought she would have as much feeling as a nurse as most people and more than some She said she did not know how people could bear the constant pressure of misery and never to change except to a new form of it It would be impossible to keep one s natural feelings I promised her a better destiny than to go begging any one to marry her or to lose her natural feelings as a sister of charity She said My youth is leaving me I can never do better than I have done and I have done nothing yet At such times she seemed to think that most human beings were destined by the pressure of worldly interests to lose one faculty and feeling after another till they went dead altogether I hope I shall be put in my grave as soon as I m dead I don t want to walk about so Here we always differed I thought the degradation of nature she feared was a consequence of poverty and that she should give her attention to earning money Sometimes she admitted this but could find no means of earning money At others she seemed afraid of letting her thoughts dwell on the subject saying it brought on the worst palsy of all Indeed in her position nothing less than entire constant absorption in petty money matters could have scraped together a provision Of course artists and authors stood high with Charlotte and the best thing after their works would have been their company She used very inconsistently to rail at money and money getting and then wish she was able to visit all the large towns in Europe see all the sights and know all the celebrities This was her notion of literary fame a passport to the society of clever people When she had become acquainted with the people and ways at Brussels her life became monotonous and she fell into the same hopeless state as at Miss W s though in a less degree I wrote to her urging her to go home or elsewhere she had got what she wanted French and there was at least novelty in a new place if no improvement That if she sank into deeper gloom she would soon not have energy to go and she was too far from home for her friends to hear of her condition and order her home as they had done from Miss W s She wrote that I had done her a great service that she should certainly follow my advice and was much obliged to me I have often wondered at this letter Though she patiently tolerated advice she could always quietly put it aside and do as she thought fit More than once afterwards she mentioned the service I had done her She sent me ten l to New Zealand on hearing some exaggerated accounts of my circumstances and told me she hoped it would come in seasonably it was a debt she owed me for the service I had done her I should think ten l was a quarter of her income The service was mentioned as an apology but kindness was the real motive The first break in this life of regular duties and employments came heavily and sadly Martha pretty winning mischievous tricksome Martha was taken ill suddenly at the Chateau de Koekelberg Her sister tended her with devoted love but it was all in vain in a few days she died Charlotte s own short account of this event is as follows Martha T s illness was unknown to me till the day before she died I hastened to Koekelberg the next morning unconscious that she was in great danger and was told that it was finished She had died in the night Mary was taken away to Bruxelles I have seen Mary frequently since She is in no ways crushed by the event but while Martha was ill she was to her more than a mother more than a sister watching nursing cherishing her so tenderly so unweariedly She appears calm and serious now no bursts of violent emotion no exaggeration of distress I have seen Martha s grave the place where her ashes lie in a foreign country Who that has read Shirley does not remember the few lines perhaps half a page of sad recollection He has no idea that little Jessy will die young she is so gay and chattering and arch original even now passionate when provoked but most affectionate if caressed by turns gentle and rattling exacting yet generous fearless yet reliant on any who will help her Jessy with her little piquant face engaging prattle and winning ways is made to be a pet Do you know this place No you never saw it but you recognise the nature of these trees this foliage the cypress the willow the yew Stone crosses like these are not unfamiliar to you nor are these dim garlands of everlasting flowers Here is the place green sod and a grey marble head stone Jessy sleeps below She lived through an April day much loved was she much loving She often in her brief life shed tears she had frequent sorrows she smiled between gladdening whatever saw her Her death was tranquil and happy in Rose s guardian arms for Rose had been her stay and defence through many trials the dying and the watching English girls were at that hour alone in a foreign country and the soil of that country gave Jessy a grave But Jessy I will write about you no more This is an autumn evening wet and wild There is only one cloud in the sky but it curtains it from pole to pole The wind cannot rest it hurries sobbing over hills of sullen outline colourless with twilight and mist Rain has beat all day on that church tower Haworth it rises dark from the stony enclosure of its graveyard the nettles the long grass and the tombs all drip with wet This evening reminds me too forcibly of another evening some years ago a howling rainy autumn evening too when certain who had that day performed a pilgrimage to a grave new made in a heretic cemetery sat near a wood fire on the hearth of a foreign dwelling They were merry and social but they each knew that a gap never to be filled had been made in their circle They knew they had lost something whose absence could never be quite atoned for so long as they lived and they knew that heavy falling rain was soaking into the wet earth which covered their lost darling and that the sad sighing gale was mourning above her buried head The fire warmed them Life and Friendship yet blessed them but Jessy lay cold coffined solitary only the sod screening her from the storm This was the first death that had occurred in the small circle of Charlotte s immediate and intimate friends since the loss of her two sisters long ago She was still in the midst of her deep sympathy with Mary when word came from home that her aunt Miss Branwell was ailing was very ill Emily and Charlotte immediately resolved to go home straight and hastily packed up for England doubtful whether they should ever return to Brussels or not leaving all their relations with M and Madame Heger and the pensionnat uprooted and uncertain of any future existence Even before their departure on the morning after they received the first intelligence of illness when they were on the very point of starting came a second letter telling them of their aunt s death It could not hasten their movements for every arrangement had been made for speed They sailed from Antwerp they travelled night and day and got home on a Tuesday morning The funeral and all was over and mister Bronte and Anne were sitting together in quiet grief for the loss of one who had done her part well in their household for nearly twenty years and earned the regard and respect of many who never knew how much they should miss her till she was gone The small property which she had accumulated by dint of personal frugality and self denial was bequeathed to her nieces Branwell her darling was to have had his share but his reckless expenditure had distressed the good old lady and his name was omitted in her will When the first shock was over the three sisters began to enjoy the full relish of meeting again after the longest separation they had had in their lives They had much to tell of the past and much to settle for the future Anne had been for some little time in a situation to which she was to return at the end of the Christmas holidays For another year or so they were again to be all three apart and after that the happy vision of being together and opening a school was to be realised Of course they did not now look forward to settling at Burlington or any other place which would take them away from their father but the small sum which they each independently possessed would enable them to effect such alterations in the parsonage house at Haworth as would adapt it to the reception of pupils Anne s plans for the interval were fixed Emily quickly decided to be the daughter to remain at home About Charlotte there was much deliberation and some discussion Even in all the haste of their sudden departure from Brussels M Heger had found time to write a letter of sympathy to mister Bronte on the loss which he had just sustained a letter containing such a graceful appreciation of the daughters characters under the form of a tribute of respect to their father that I should have been tempted to copy it even had there not also been a proposal made in it respecting Charlotte which deserves a place in the record of her life Au Reverend Monsieur Bronte Pasteur Evangelique c c Samedi five Obre MONSIEUR Un evenement bien triste decide mesdemoiselles vas filles a retourner brusquement en Angleterre ce depart qui nous

affection bien desinteressee et qui s affligerait beaucoup de devoir deja se resigner a n etre plus utile a vos chers enfants Agreez je vous prie Monsieur l expression respectueuse de mes sentiments de haute consideration C HEGER There was so much truth as well as so much kindness in this letter it was so obvious that a second year of instruction would be far more valuable than the first that there was no long hesitation before it was decided that Charlotte should return to Brussels Meanwhile they enjoyed their Christmas all together inexpressibly Branwell was with them that was always a pleasure at this time whatever might be his faults or even his vices his sisters yet held him up as their family hope as they trusted that he would some day be their family pride They blinded themselves to the magnitude of the failings of which they were now and then told by persuading themselves that such failings were common to all men of any strength of character for till sad experience taught them better they fell into the usual error of confounding strong passions with strong character Charlotte s friend came over to see her and she returned the visit Her Brussels life must have seemed like a dream so completely in this short space of time did she fall back into the old household ways with more of household independence than she could ever have had during her aunt s lifetime Winter though it was the sisters took their accustomed walks on the snow covered moors or went often down the long road to Keighley for such books as had been added to the library there during their absence from England CHAPTER XII Towards the end of January the time came for Charlotte to return to Brussels Her journey thither was rather disastrous She had to make her way alone and the train from Leeds to London which should have reached Euston square early in the afternoon was so much delayed that it did not get in till ten at night She had intended to seek out the Chapter Coffee house where she had stayed before and which would have been near the place where the steam boats lay but she appears to have been frightened by the idea of arriving at an hour which to Yorkshire notions was so late and unseemly and taking a cab therefore at the station she drove straight to the London Bridge Wharf and desired a waterman to row her to the Ostend packet which was to sail the next morning She described to me pretty much as she has since described it in Villette her sense of loneliness and yet her strange pleasure in the excitement of the situation as in the dead of that winter s night she went swiftly over the dark river to the black hull s side and was at first refused leave to ascend to the deck No passengers might sleep on board they said with some appearance of disrespect She looked back to the lights and subdued noises of London that Mighty Heart in which she had no place and standing up in the rocking boat she asked to speak to some one in authority on board the packet He came and her quiet simple statement of her wish and her reason for it quelled the feeling of sneering distrust in those who had first heard her request and impressed the authority so favourably that he allowed her to come on board and take possession of a berth The next morning she sailed and at seven on Sunday evening she reached the Rue d Isabelle once more having only left Haworth on Friday morning at an early hour Her salary was sixteen l a year out of which she had to pay for her German lessons for which she was charged as much the lessons being probably rated by time as when Emily learnt with her and divided the expense viz ten francs a month By Miss Bronte s own desire she gave her English lessons in the classe or schoolroom without the supervision of Madame or M Heger They offered to be present with a view to maintain order among the unruly Belgian girls but she declined this saying that she would rather enforce discipline by her own manner and character than be indebted for obedience to the presence of a gendarme She ruled over a new schoolroom which had been built on the space in the play ground adjoining the house Over that First Class she was surveillante at all hours and henceforward she was called Mademoiselle Charlotte by M Heger s orders She continued her own studies principally attending to German and to Literature and every Sunday she went alone to the German and English chapels Her walks too were solitary and principally taken in the allee defendue where she was secure from intrusion This solitude was a perilous luxury to one of her temperament so liable as she was to morbid and acute mental suffering On March sixth eighteen forty three she writes thus I am settled by this time of course I am not too much overloaded with occupation and besides teaching English I have time to improve myself in German I ought to consider myself well off and to be thankful for my good fortunes I hope I am thankful and if I could always keep up my spirits and never feel lonely or long for companionship or friendship or whatever they call it I should do very well As I told you before M and Madame Heger are the only two persons in the house for whom I really experience regard and esteem and of course I cannot be always with them nor even very often They told me when I first returned that I was to consider their sitting room my sitting room also and to go there whenever I was not engaged in the schoolroom This however I cannot do In the daytime it is a public room where music masters and mistresses are constantly passing in and out and in the evening I will not and ought not to intrude on M and Madame Heger and their children Thus I am a good deal by myself out of school hours but that does not signify I now regularly give English lessons to M Heger and his brother in law They get on with wonderful rapidity especially the first He already begins to speak English very decently If you could see and hear the efforts I make to teach them to pronounce like Englishmen and their unavailing attempts to imitate you would laugh to all eternity The Carnival is just over and we have entered upon the gloom and abstinence of Lent The first day of Lent we had coffee without milk for breakfast vinegar and vegetables with a very little salt fish for dinner and bread for supper The Carnival was nothing but masking and mummery M Heger took me and one of the pupils into the town to see the masks It was animating to see the immense crowds and the general gaiety but the masks were nothing I have been twice to the D s those cousins of Mary s of whom I have before made mention When she leaves Bruxelles I shall have nowhere to go to I have had two letters from Mary She does not tell me she has been ill and she does not complain but her letters are not the letters of a person in the enjoyment of great happiness She has nobody to be as good to her as M Heger is to me to lend her books to converse with her sometimes c Good bye When I say so it seems to me that you will hardly hear me all the waves of the Channel heaving and roaring between must deaden the sound From the tone of this letter it may easily be perceived that the Brussels of eighteen forty three was a different place from that of eighteen forty two Then she had Emily for a daily and nightly solace and companion She had the weekly variety of a visit to the family of the D s and she had the frequent happiness of seeing Mary and Martha Now Emily was far away in Haworth where she or any other loved one might die before Charlotte with her utmost speed could reach them as experience in her aunt s case had taught her The D s were leaving Brussels so henceforth her weekly holiday would have to be passed in the Rue d Isabelle or so she thought Mary was gone off on her own independent course Martha alone remained still and quiet for ever in the cemetery beyond the Porte de Louvain The weather too for the first few weeks after Charlotte s return had been piercingly cold and her feeble constitution was always painfully sensitive to an inclement season Mere bodily pain however acute she could always put aside but too often ill health assailed her in a part far more to be dreaded Her depression of spirits when she was not well was pitiful in its extremity She was aware that it was constitutional and could reason about it but no reasoning prevented her suffering mental agony while the bodily cause remained in force The Hegers have discovered since the publication of Villette that at this beginning of her career as English teacher in their school the conduct of her pupils was often impertinent and mutinous in the highest degree But of this they were unaware at the time as she had declined their presence and never made any complaint Still it must have been a depressing thought to her at this period that her joyous healthy obtuse pupils were so little answerable to the powers she could bring to bear upon them and though from their own testimony her patience firmness and resolution at length obtained their just reward yet with one so weak in health and spirits the reaction after such struggles as she frequently had with her pupils must have been very sad and painful She thus writes to her friend E April eighteen forty three Is there any talk of your coming to Brussels During the bitter cold weather we had through February and the principal part of March I did not regret that you had not accompanied me If I had seen you shivering as I shivered myself if I had seen your hands and feet as red and swelled as mine were my discomfort would just have been doubled I can do very well under this sort of thing it does not fret me it only makes me numb and silent but if you were to pass a winter in Belgium you would be ill However more genial weather is coming now and I wish you were here Yet I never have pressed you and never would press you too warmly to come There are privations and humiliations to submit to there is monotony and uniformity of life and above all there is a constant sense of solitude in the midst of numbers The Protestant the foreigner is a solitary being whether as teacher or pupil I do not say this by way of complaining of my own lot for though I acknowledge that there are certain disadvantages in my present position what position on earth is without them And whenever I turn back to compare what I am with what I was my place here with my place at missus s for instance I am thankful There was an observation in your last letter which excited for a moment my wrath At first I thought it would be folly to reply to it and I would let it die Afterwards I determined to give one answer once for all Three or four people it seems have the idea that the future epoux of Mademoiselle Bronte is on the Continent These people are wiser than I am They could not believe that I crossed the sea merely to return as teacher to Madame Hegers I must have some more powerful motive than respect for my master and mistress gratitude for their kindness c to induce me to refuse a salary of fifty l in England and accept one of sixteen l in Belgium I must forsooth have some remote hope of entrapping a husband somehow or somewhere If these charitable people knew the total seclusion of the life I lead that I never exchange a word with any other man than Monsieur Heger and seldom indeed with him they would perhaps cease to suppose that any such chimerical and groundless notion had influenced my proceedings Have I said enough to clear myself of so silly an imputation Not that it is a crime to marry or a crime to wish to be married but it is an imbecility which I reject with contempt for women who have neither fortune nor beauty to make marriage the principal object of their wishes and hopes and the aim of all their actions not to be able to convince themselves that they are unattractive and that they had better be quiet and think of other things than wedlock The following is an extract from one of the few letters which have been preserved of her correspondence with her sister Emily May twenty nine eighteen forty three I get on here from day to day in a Robinson Crusoe like sort of way very lonely but that does not signify In other respects I have nothing substantial to complain of nor is this a cause for complaint I hope you are well Walk out often on the moors My love to Tabby I hope she keeps well And about this time she wrote to her father June second eighteen eighteen I was very glad to hear from home I had begun to get low spirited at not receiving any news and to entertain indefinite fears that something was wrong You do not say anything about your own health but I hope you are well and Emily also I am afraid she will have a good deal of hard work to do now that Hannah a servant girl who had been assisting Tabby is gone I am exceedingly glad to hear that you still keep Tabby considerably upwards of seventy It is an act of great charity to her and I do not think it will be unrewarded for she is very faithful and will always serve you when she has occasion to the best of her abilities besides she will be company for Emily who without her would be very lonely I gave a devoir written after she had been four months under M Heger s tuition I will now copy out another written nearly a year later during which the progress made appears to me very great thirty one Mai eighteen forty three SUR LA MORT DE NAPOLEON Napoleon naquit en Corse et mourut a Ste Helene Entre ces deux iles rien qu un vaste et brulant desert et l ocean immense Il naquit fils d un simple gentilhomme et mourut empereur mais sans couronne et dans les fers Entre son berceau et sa tombe qu y a t il la carriere d un soldat parvenu des champs de bataille une mer de sang un trone puis du sang encore et des fers Sa vie c est l arc en ciel les deux points extremes touchent la terre la comble lumi neuse mesure les cieux Sur Napoleon au berceau une mere brillait dans la maison paternelle il avait des freres et des soeurs plus tard dans son palais il eut une femme qui l aimait Mais sur son lit de mort Napoleon est seul plus de mere ni de frere ni de soeur ni de femme ni d enfant D autres ont dit et rediront ses exploits moi je m arrete a contempler l abandonnement de sa derniere heure Il est la exile et captif enchaine sur un ecueil Nouveau Promethee il subit le chatiment de son orgueil Promethee avait voulu etre Dieu et Createur il deroba le feu du Ciel pour animer le corps qu il avait forme Et lui Buonaparte il a voulu creer non pas un homme mais un empire et pour donner une existence une ame a son oeuvre gigantesque il n a pas hesite a arracher la vie a des nations entieres Jupiter indigne de l impiete de Promethee le riva vivant a la cime du Caucase Ainsi pour punir l ambition rapace de Buonaparte la Providence l a enchaine jusqu a ce que la mort s en suivit sur un roc isole de l Atlantique Peut etre la aussi a t il senti lui fouillant le flanc cet insatiable vautour dont parle la fable peut etre a t il souffert aussi cette soif du coeur cette faim de l ame qui torturent l exile loin de sa famille et de sa patrie Mais parler ainsi n est ce pas attribuer gratuitement a Napoleon une humaine faiblesse qu il n eprouva jamais Quand donc s est il laisse enchainer par un lien d affection Sans doute d autres conquerants ont hesite dans leur carriere de gloire arretes par un obstacle d amour ou d amitie retenus par la main d une femme rappeles par la voix d un ami lui jamais Il n eut pas besoin comme Ulysse de se lier au mat du navire ni de se boucher les oreilles avec de la cire il ne redoutait pas le chant des Sirenes il le dedaignait il se fit marbre et fer pour executer ses grands projets Napoleon ne se regardait pas comme un homme mais comme l incarnation d un peuple Il n aimait pas il ne considerait ses amis et ses proches que comme des instruments auxquels il tint tant qu ils furent utiles et qu il jeta de cote quand ils cesserent de l etre Qu on ne se permette donc pas d approcher du sepulcre du Corse avec sentiments de pitie ou de souiller de larmes la pierre qui couvre ses restes son ame repudierait tout cela On a dit je le sais qu elle fut cruelle la main qui le separa de sa femme et de son enfant Non c etait une main qui comme la sienne ne tremblait ni de passion ni de crainte c etait la main d un homme froid convaincu qui avait su deviner Buonaparte et voici ce que disait cet homme que la defaite n a pu humilier ni la victoire enorgueiller Marie Louise n est pas la femme de Napoleon c est la France que Napoleon a epousee c est la France qu il aime leur union enfante la perte de l Europe voila la divorce que je veux voila l union qu il faut briser La voix des timides et des traitres protesta contre cette sentence C est abuser de droit de la victoire C est fouler aux pieds le vaincu Que l Angleterre se montre clemente qu elle ouvre ses bras pour recevoir comme hote son ennemi desarme L Angleterre aurait peut etre ecoute ce conseii car partout et toujours il y a des ames faibles et timorees bientot seduites par la flatterie ou effrayees par le reproche Mais la Providence permit qu un homme se trouvat qui n a jamais su ce que c est que la crainte qui aima sa patrie mieux que sa renommee impenetrable devant les menaces inaccessible aux louanges il se presenta devant le conseil de la nation et levant son front tranquille en haut il osa dire Que la trahison se taise car c est trahir que de conseiller de temporiser avec Buonaparte Moi je sais ce que sont ces guerres dont l Europe saigne encore comme une victime sous le couteau du boucher Il faut en finir avec Napoleon Buonaparte Vous vous effrayez a tort d un mot si dur Je n ai pas de magnanimite dit on Soit que m importe ce qu on dit de moi Je n ai pas ici a me faire une reputation de heros magnanime mais a guerir si la cure est possible l Europe qui se meurt epuisee de ressources et de sang l Europe dont vous negligez les vrais interets pre occupes que vous etes d une vaine renommee de clemence Vous etes faibles Eh bien je viens vous aider Envoyez Buonaparte a Ste Helene n hesitez pas ne cherchez pas un autre endroit c est le seul convenable Je vous le dis j ai reflechi pour vous c est la qu il doit etre et non pas ailleurs Quant a Napoleon homme soldat je n ai rien contre lui c est un lion royal aupres de qui vous n etes que des chacals Mais Napoleon Empereur c est autre chose je l extirperai du sol de l Europe Et celui qui parla ainsi toujours sut garder sa promesse celle la comme toutes les autres Je l ai dit et je le repete cet homme est l egal de Napoleon par le genie comme trempe de caractere comme droiture comme elevation de pensee et de but il est d une tout autre espece Napoleon Buonaparte etait avide de renommee et de gloire Arthur Wellesley ne se soucie ni de l une ni de l autre l opinion publique la popularite etaient choses de grand valeur aux yeux de Napoleon pour Wellington l opinion publique est une rumeur un rien que le souffle de son inflexible volonte fait disparaitre comme une bulle de savon Napoleon flattait le peuple Wellington le brusqne l un cherchait les applau dissements l autre ne se soucie que du temoignage de sa conscience quand elle approuve c est assez toute autre louange l obsede Aussi ce peuple qui adorait Buonaparte s irritait s insurgeait contre la morgue de Wellington parfois il lui temoigna sa colere et sa haine par des grognements par des hurlements de betes fauves et alors avec une impassibilite de senateur romain le moderne Coriolan toisait du regard l emeute furieuse il croisait ses bras nerveux sur sa large poitrine et seul debout sur son seuil il attendait il bravait cette tempete populaire dont les flots venaient mourir a quelques pas de lui et quand la foule honteuse de sa rebellion venait lecher les pieds du maitre le hautain patricien meprisait l hommage d aujourd hui comme la haine d hier et dans les rues de Londres et devant son palais ducal d Apsley il repoussait d un genre plein de froid dedain l incommode empressement du peuple enthousiaste Cette fierte neanmoins n excluait pas en lui une rare modestie partout il se soustrait a l eloge se derobe au panegyrique jamais il ne parle de ses exploits et jamais il ne souffre qu un autre lui en parle en sa presence Son caractere egale en grandeur et surpasse en verite celui de tout autre heros ancien ou moderne La gloire de Napoleon crut en une nuit comme la vigne de Jonas et il suffit d un jour pour la fletrir la gloire de Wellington est comme les vieux chenes qui ombragent le chateau de ses peres sur les rives du Shannon le chene croit lentement il lui faut du temps pour pousser vers le ciel ses branches noueuses et pour enfoncer dans le sol ces racines profondes qui s enchevetrent dans les fondements solides de la terre mais alors l arbre seculaire inebranlable comme le roc ou il a sa base brave et la faux du temps et l effort des vents et des tempetes Il faudra peut etre un siecle a l Angleterre pour qu elle connaise la valeur de son heros Dans un siecle l Europe entiere saura combien Wellington a des droits a sa reconnaissance How often in writing this paper in a strange land must Miss Bronte have thought of the old childish disputes in the kitchen of Haworth parsonage touching the respective merits of Wellington and Buonaparte Although the title given to her devoir is On the Death of Napoleon she seems yet to have considered it a point of honour rather to sing praises to an English hero than to dwell on the character of a foreigner placed as she was among those who cared little either for an England or for Wellington She now felt that she had made great progress towards obtaining proficiency in the French language which had been her main object in coming to Brussels But to the zealous learner Alps on Alps arise No sooner is one difficulty surmounted than some other desirable attainment appears and must be laboured after A knowledge of German now became her object and she resolved to compel herself to remain in Brussels till that was gained The strong yearning to go home came upon her the stronger self denying will forbade There was a great internal struggle every fibre of her heart quivered in the strain to master her will and when she conquered herself she remained not like a victor calm and supreme on the throne but like a panting torn and suffering victim Her nerves and her spirits gave way Her health became much shaken Brussels August first eighteen forty three If I complain in this letter have mercy and don t blame me for I forewarn you I am in low spirits and that earth and heaven are dreary and empty to me at this moment In a few days our vacation will begin everybody is joyous and animated at the prospect because everybody is to go home I know that I am to stay here during the five weeks that the holidays last and that I shall be much alone during that time and consequently get downcast and find both days and nights of a weary length It is the first time in my life that I have really dreaded the vacation Alas I can hardly write I have such a dreary weight at my heart and I do so wish to go home Is not this childish Pardon me for I cannot help it However though I am not strong enough to bear up cheerfully I can still bear up and I will continue to stay D V some months longer till I have acquired German and then I hope to see all your faces again Would that the vacation were well over it will pass so slowly Do have the Christian charity to write me a long long letter fill it with the minutest details nothing will be uninteresting Do not think it is because people are unkind to me that I wish to leave Belgium nothing of the sort Everybody is abundantly civil but home sickness keeps creeping over me I cannot shake it off Believe me very merrily vivaciously gaily yours C B The grandes vacances began soon after the date of this letter when she was left in the great deserted pensionnat with only one teacher for a companion This teacher a Frenchwoman had always been uncongenial to her but left to each other s sole companionship Charlotte soon discovered that her associate was more profligate more steeped in a kind of cold systematic sensuality than she had before imagined it possible for a human being to be and her whole nature revolted from this woman s society A low nervous fever was gaining upon Miss Bronte She had never been a good sleeper but now she could not sleep at all Whatever had been disagreeable or obnoxious to her during the day was presented when it was over with exaggerated vividness to her disordered fancy There were causes for distress and anxiety in the news from home particularly as regarded Branwell In the dead of the night lying awake at the end of the long deserted dormitory in the vast and silent house every fear respecting those whom she loved and who were so far off in another country became a terrible reality oppressing her and choking up the very life blood in her heart Those nights were times of sick dreary wakeful misery precursors of many such in after years In the daytime driven abroad by loathing of her companion and by the weak restlessness of fever she tried to walk herself into such a state of bodily fatigue as would induce sleep So she went out and with weary steps would traverse the Boulevards and the streets sometimes for hours together faltering and resting occasionally on some of the many benches placed for the repose of happy groups or for solitary wanderers like herself Then up again anywhere but to the pensionnat out to the cemetery where Martha lay out beyond it to the hills whence there is nothing to be seen but fields as far as the horizon The shades of evening made her retrace her footsteps sick for want of food but not hungry fatigued with long continued exercise yet restless still and doomed to another weary haunted night of sleeplessness She would thread the streets in the neighbourhood of the Rue d Isabelle and yet avoid it and its occupant till as late an hour as she dared be out At last she was compelled to keep her bed for some days and this compulsory rest did her good She was weak but less depressed in spirits than she had been when the school re opened and her positive practical duties recommenced She writes thus October thirteenth eighteen forty three Mary is getting on well as she deserves to do I often hear from her Her letters and yours are one of my few pleasures She urges me very much to leave Brussels and go to her but at present however tempted to take such a step I should not feel justified in doing so To leave a certainty for a complete uncertainty would be to the last degree imprudent Notwithstanding that Brussels is indeed desolate to me now Since the D s left I have had no friend I had indeed some very kind acquaintances in the family of a doctor but they too are gone now They left in the latter part of August and I am completely alone I cannot count the Belgians anything It is a curious position to be so utterly solitary in the midst of numbers Sometimes the solitude oppresses me to an excess One day lately I felt as if I could bear it no longer and I went to Madame Heger and gave her notice If it had depended on her I should certainly have soon been at liberty but M Heger having heard of what was in agitation sent for me the day after and pronounced with vehemence his decision that I should not leave I could not at that time have persevered in my intention without exciting him to anger so I promised to stay a little while longer How long that will be I do not know I should not like to return to England to do nothing I am too old for that now but if I could hear of a favourable opportunity for commencing a school I think I should embrace it We have as yet no fires here and I suffer much from cold otherwise I am well in health mister will take this letter to England He is a pretty looking and pretty behaved young man apparently constructed without a backbone by which I don t allude to his corporal spine which is all right enough but to his character I get on here after a fashion but now that Mary D has left Brussels I have nobody to speak to for I count the Belgians as nothing Sometimes I ask myself how long shall I stay here but as yet I have only asked the question I have not answered it However when I have acquired as much German as I think fit I think I shall pack up bag and baggage and depart Twinges of home sickness cut me to the heart every now and then To day the weather is glaring and I am stupified with a bad cold and headache I have nothing to tell you One day is like another in this place I know you living in the country can hardly believe it is possible life can be monotonous in the centre of a brilliant capital like Brussels but so it is I feel it most on holidays when all the girls and teachers go out to visit and it sometimes happens that I am left during several hours quite alone with four great desolate schoolrooms at my disposition I try to read I try to write but in vain I then wander about from room to room but the silence and loneliness of all the house weighs down one s spirits like lead You will hardly believe that Madame Heger good and kind as I have described her never comes near me on these occasions I own I was astonished the first time I was left alone thus when everybody else was enjoying the pleasures of a fete day with their friends and she knew I was quite by myself and never took the least notice of me Yet I understand she praises me very much to everybody and says what excellent lessons I give She is not colder to me than she is to the other teachers but they are less dependent on her than I am They have relations and acquaintances in Bruxelles You remember the letter she wrote me when I was in England How kind and affectionate that was is it not odd In the meantime the complaints I make at present are a sort of relief which I permit myself In all other respects I am well satisfied with my position and you may say so to people who inquire after me if any one does Write to me dear whenever you can You do a good deed when you send me a letter for you comfort a very desolate heart One of the reasons for the silent estrangement between Madame Heger and Miss Bronte in the second year of her residence at Brussels is to be found in the fact that the English Protestant s dislike of Romanism increased with her knowledge of it and its effects upon those who professed it and when occasion called for an expression of opinion from Charlotte Bronte she was uncompromising truth Madame Heger on the opposite side was not merely a Roman Catholic she was devote Not of a warm or impulsive temperament she was naturally governed by her conscience rather than by her affections and her conscience was in the hands of her religious guides She considered any slight thrown upon her Church as blasphemy against the Holy Truth and though she was not given to open expression of her thoughts and feelings yet her increasing coolness of behaviour showed how much her most cherished opinions had been wounded Thus although there was never any explanation of Madame Heger s change of manner this may be given as one great reason why about this time Charlotte was made painfully conscious of a silent estrangement between them an estrangement of which perhaps the former was hardly aware I have before alluded to intelligence from home calculated to distress Charlotte exceedingly with fears respecting Branwell which I shall speak of more at large when the realisation of her worst apprehensions came to affect the daily life of herself and her sisters I allude to the subject again here in order that the reader may remember the gnawing private cares which she had to bury in her own heart and the pain of which could only be smothered for a time under the diligent fulfilment of present duty Another dim sorrow was faintly perceived at this time Her father s eyesight began to fail it was not unlikely that he might shortly become blind more of his duty must devolve on a curate and mister Bronte always liberal would have to pay at a higher rate than he had heretofore done for this assistance She wrote thus to Emily Dec first eighteen forty three This is Sunday morning They are at their idolatrous messe and I am here that is in the Refectoire I should like uncommonly to be in the dining room at home or in the kitchen or in the back kitchen I should like even to be cutting up the hash with the clerk and some register people at the other table and you standing by watching that I put enough flour not too much pepper and above all that I save the best pieces of the leg of mutton for Tiger and Keeper the first of which personages would be jumping about the dish and carving knife and the latter standing like a devouring flame on the kitchen floor To complete the picture Tabby blowing the fire in order to boil the potatoes to a sort of vegetable glue How divine are these recollections to me at this moment Yet I have no thought of coming home just now I lack a real pretext for doing so it is true this place is dismal to me but I cannot go home without a fixed prospect when I get there and this prospect must not be a situation that would be jumping out of the frying pan into the fire You call yourself idle absurd absurd Is papa well Are you well and Tabby You ask about Queen Victoria s visit to Brussels I saw her for an instant flashing through the Rue Royale in a carriage and six surrounded by soldiers She was laughing and talking very gaily She looked a little stout vivacious lady very plainly dressed not much dignity or pretension about her The Belgians liked her very well on the whole They said she enlivened the sombre court of King Leopold which is usually as gloomy as a conventicle Write to me again soon Tell me whether papa really wants me very much to come home and whether you do likewise I have an idea that I should be of no use there a sort of aged person upon the parish I pray with heart and soul that all may continue well at Haworth above all in our grey half inhabited house God bless the walls thereof Safety health happiness and prosperity to you papa and Tabby Amen C B Towards the end of this year eighteen forty three various reasons conspired with the causes of anxiety which have been mentioned to make her feel that her presence was absolutely and imperatively required at home while she had acquired all that she proposed to herself in coming to Brussels the second time and was moreover no longer regarded with the former kindliness of feeling by Madame Heger In consequence of this state of things working down with sharp edge into a sensitive mind she suddenly announced to that lady her immediate intention of returning to England Both M and Madame Heger agreed that it would be for the best when they learnt only that part of the case which she could reveal to them namely mister Bronte s increasing blindness But as the inevitable moment of separation from people and places among which she had spent so many happy hours drew near her spirits gave way she had the natural presentiment that she saw them all for the last time and she received but a dead kind of comfort from being reminded by her friends that Brussels and Haworth were not so very far apart that access from one place to the other was not so difficult or impracticable as her tears would seem to predicate nay there was some talk of one of Madame Heger s daughters being sent to her as a pupil if she fulfilled her intention of trying to begin a school To facilitate her success in this plan should she ever engage in it M Heger gave her a kind of diploma dated from and sealed with the seal of the Athenee Royal de Bruxelles certifying that she was perfectly capable of teaching the French language having well studied the grammar and composition thereof and moreover having prepared herself for teaching by studying and practising the best methods of instruction This certificate is dated December twenty ninth eighteen forty three and on the second of January eighteen forty four she arrived at Haworth On the twenty third of the month she writes as follows Every one asks me what I am going to do now that I am returned home and every one seems to expect that I should immediately commence a school In truth it is what I should wish to do I desire it above all things I have sufficient money for the undertaking and I hope now sufficient qualifications to give me a fair chance of success yet I cannot yet permit myself to enter upon life to touch the object which seems now within my reach and which I have been so long straining to attain You will ask me why It is on papa s account he is now as you know getting old and it grieves me to tell you that he is losing his sight I have felt for some months that I ought not to be away from him and I feel now that it would be too selfish to leave him at least as long as Branwell and Anne are absent in order to pursue selfish interests of my own With the help of God I will try to deny myself in this matter and to wait I suffered much before I left Brussels I think however long I live I shall not forget what the parting with M Heger cost me It grieved me so much to grieve him who has been so true kind and disinterested a friend At parting he gave me a kind of diploma certifying my abilities as a teacher sealed with the seal of the Athenee Royal of which he is professor I was surprised also at the degree of regret expressed by my Belgian pupils when they knew I was going to leave I did not think it had been in their phlegmatic nature I do not know whether you feel as I do but there are times now when it appears to me as if all my ideas and feelings except a few friendships and affections are changed from what they used to be something in me which used to be enthusiasm is tamed down and broken I have fewer illusions what I wish for now is active exertion a stake in life Haworth seems such a lonely quiet spot buried away from the world I no longer regard myself as young indeed I shall soon be twenty eight and it seems as if I ought to be working and braving the rough realities of the world as other people do It is however my duty to restrain this feeling at present and I will endeavour to do so Of course her absent sister and brother obtained a holiday to welcome her return home and in a few weeks she was spared to pay a visit to her friend at B But she was far from well or strong and the short journey of fourteen miles seems to have fatigued her greatly Soon after she came back to Haworth in a letter to one of the household in which she had been staying there occurs this passage Our poor little cat has been ill two days and is just dead It is piteous to see even an animal lying lifeless Emily is sorry These few words relate to points in the characters of the two sisters which I must dwell upon a little Charlotte was more than commonly tender in her treatment of all dumb creatures and they with that fine instinct so often noticed were invariably attracted towards her The deep and exaggerated consciousness of her personal defects the constitutional absence of hope which made her slow to trust in human affection and consequently slow to respond to any manifestation of it made her manner shy and constrained to men and women and even to children We have seen something of this trembling distrust of her own capability of inspiring affection in the grateful surprise she expresses at the regret felt by her Belgian pupils at her departure But not merely were her actions kind her words and tones were ever gentle and caressing towards animals and she quickly noticed the least want of care or tenderness on the part of others towards any poor brute creature The readers of Shirley may remember that it is one of the tests which the heroine applies to her lover Do you know what soothsayers I would consult The little Irish beggar that comes barefoot to my door the mouse that steals out of the cranny in my wainscot the bird in frost and snow that pecks at my window for a crumb the dog that licks my hand and sits beside my knee I know somebody to whose knee the black cat loves to climb against whose shoulder and cheek it likes to purr The old dog always comes out of his kennel and wags his tail and whines affectionately when somebody passes For somebody and he read Charlotte Bronte and she He quietly strokes the cat and lets her sit while he conveniently can and when he must disturb her by rising he puts her softly down and never flings her from him roughly he always whistles to the dog and gives him a caress The feeling which in Charlotte partook of something of the nature of an affection was with Emily more of a passion Some one speaking of her to me in a careless kind of strength of expression said she never showed regard to any human creature all her love was reserved for animals The helplessness of an animal was its passport to Charlotte s heart the fierce wild intractability of its nature was what often recommended it to Emily Speaking of her dead sister the former told me that from her many traits in Shirley s character were taken her way of sitting on the rug reading with her arm round her rough bull dog s neck her calling to a strange dog running past with hanging head and lolling tongue to give it a merciful draught of water its maddened snap at her her nobly stern presence of mind going right into the kitchen and taking up one of Tabby s red hot Italian irons to sear the bitten place and telling no one till the danger was well nigh over for fear of the terrors that might beset their weaker minds All this looked upon as a well invented fiction in Shirley was written down by Charlotte with streaming eyes it was the literal true account of what Emily had done The same tawny bull dog with his strangled whistle called Tartar in Shirley was Keeper in Haworth parsonage a gift to Emily With the gift came a warning Keeper was faithful to the depths of his nature as long as he was with friends but he who struck him with a stick or whip roused the relentless nature of the brute who flew at his throat forthwith and held him there till one or the other was at the point of death Now Keeper s household fault was this He loved to steal upstairs and stretch his square tawny limbs on the comfortable beds covered over with delicate white counterpanes But the cleanliness of the parsonage arrangements was perfect and this habit of Keeper s was so objectionable that Emily in reply to Tabby s remonstrances declared that if he was found again transgressing she herself in defiance of warning and his well known ferocity of nature would beat him so severely that he would never offend again In the gathering dusk of an autumn evening Tabby came half triumphantly half tremblingly but in great wrath to tell Emily that Keeper was lying on the best bed in drowsy voluptuousness Charlotte saw Emily s whitening face and set mouth but dared not speak to interfere no one dared when Emily s eyes glowed in that manner out of the paleness of her face and when her lips were so compressed into stone She went upstairs and Tabby and Charlotte stood in the gloomy passage below full of the dark shadows of coming night Down stairs came Emily dragging after her the unwilling Keeper his hind legs set in a heavy attitude of resistance held by the scuft of his neck but growling low and savagely all the time The watchers would fain have spoken but durst not for fear of taking off Emily s attention and causing her to avert her head for a moment from the enraged brute She let him go planted in a dark corner at the bottom of the stairs no time was there to fetch stick or rod for fear of the strangling clutch at her throat her bare clenched fist struck against his red fierce eyes before he had time to make his spring and in the language of the turf she punished him till his eyes were swelled up and the half blind stupified beast was led to his accustomed lair to have his swollen head fomented and cared for by the very Emily herself The generous dog owed her no grudge he loved her dearly ever after he walked first among the mourners to her funeral he slept moaning for nights at the door of her empty room and never so to speak rejoiced dog fashion after her death He in his turn was mourned over by the surviving sister Let us somehow hope in half Red Indian creed that he follows Emily now and when he rests sleeps on some soft white bed of dreams unpunished when he awakens to the life of the land of shadows Now we can understand the force of the words Our poor little cat is dead Emily is sorry CHAPTER XIII The moors were a great resource this spring Emily and Charlotte walked out on them perpetually to the great damage of our shoes but I hope to the benefit of our health The old plan of school keeping was often discussed in these rambles but in doors they set with vigour to shirt making for the absent Branwell and pondered in silence over their past and future life At last they came to a determination I have seriously entered into the enterprise of keeping a school or rather taking a limited number of pupils at home That is I have begun in good earnest to seek for pupils I wrote to missus the lady with whom she had lived as governess just before going to Brussels not asking her for her daughter I cannot do that but informing her of my intention I received an answer from mister expressive of I believe sincere regret that I had not informed them a month sooner in which case he said they would gladly have sent me their own daughter and also Colonel S s but that now both were promised to Miss C I was partly disappointed by this answer and partly gratified indeed I derived quite an impulse of encouragement from the warm assurance that if I had but applied a little sooner they would certainly have sent me their daughter I own I had misgivings that nobody would be willing to send a child for education to Haworth These misgivings are partly done away with I have written also to missus B and have enclosed the diploma which M Heger gave me before I left Brussels I have not yet received her answer but I wait for it with some anxiety I do not expect that she will send me any of her children but if she would I dare say she could recommend me other pupils Unfortunately she knows us only very slightly As soon as I can get an assurance of only one pupil I will have cards of terms printed and will commence the repairs necessary in the house I wish all that to be done before winter I think of fixing the board and English education at twenty five l per annum Again at a later date July twenty fourth in the same year she writes I am driving on with my small matter as well as I can I have written to all the friends on whom I have the slightest claim and to some on whom I have no claim missus B for example On her also I have actually made bold to call She was exceedingly polite regretted that her children were already at school at Liverpool thought the undertaking a most praiseworthy one but feared I should have some difficulty in making it succeed on account of the situation Such is the answer I receive from almost every one I tell them the retired situation is in some points of view an advantage that were it in the midst of a large town I could not pretend to take pupils on terms so moderate missus B remarked that she thought the terms very moderate but that as it is not having house rent to pay we can offer the same privileges of education that are to be had in expensive seminaries at little more than half their price and as our number must be limited we can devote a large share of time and pains to each pupil Thank you for the very pretty little purse you have sent me I make to you a curious return in the shape of half a dozen cards of terms Make such use of them as your judgment shall dictate You will see that I have fixed the sum at thirty five l which I think is the just medium considering advantages and disadvantages This was written in July August September and October passed away and no pupils were to be heard of Day after day there was a little hope felt by the sisters until the post came in But Haworth village was wild and lonely and the Brontes but little known owing to their want of connections Charlotte writes on the subject in the early winter months to this effect I Emily and Anne are truly obliged to you for the efforts you have made in our behalf and if you have not been successful you are only like ourselves Every one wishes us well but there are no pupils to be had We have no present intention however of breaking our hearts on the subject still less of feeling mortified at defeat The effort must be beneficial whatever the result may be because it teaches us experience and an additional knowledge of this world I send you two more circulars A month later she says We have made no alterations yet in our house It would be folly to do so while there is so little likelihood of our ever getting pupils I fear you are giving yourself too much trouble on our account Depend upon it if you were to persuade a mamma to bring her child to Haworth the aspect of the place would frighten her and she would probably take the dear girl back with her instanter We are glad that we have made the attempt and we will not be cast down because it has not succeeded There were probably growing up in each sister s heart secret unacknowledged feelings of relief that their plan had not succeeded Yes a dull sense of relief that their cherished project had been tried and had failed For that house which was to be regarded as an occasional home for their brother could hardly be a fitting residence for the children of strangers They had in all likelihood become silently aware that his habits were such as to render his society at times most undesirable Possibly too they had by this time heard distressing rumours concerning the cause of that remorse and agony of mind which at times made him restless and unnaturally merry at times rendered him moody and irritable In January eighteen forty five Charlotte says Branwell has been quieter and less irritable on the whole this time than he was in summer Anne is as usual always good mild and patient The deep seated pain which he was to occasion to his relations had now taken a decided form and pressed heavily on Charlotte s health and spirits Early in this year she went to H to bid good bye to her dear friend Mary who was leaving England for Australia Branwell I have mentioned had obtained the situation of a private tutor Anne was also engaged as governess in the same family and was thus a miserable witness to her brother s deterioration of character at this period Of the causes of this deterioration I cannot speak but the consequences were these He went home for his holidays reluctantly stayed there as short a time as possible perplexing and distressing them all by his extraordinary conduct at one time in the highest spirits at another in the deepest depression accusing himself of blackest guilt and treachery without specifying what they were and altogether evincing an irritability of disposition bordering on insanity Charlotte and Emily suffered acutely from his mysterious behaviour He expressed himself more than satisfied with his situation he was remaining in it for a longer time than he had ever done in any kind of employment before so that for some time they could not conjecture that anything there made him so wilful and restless and full of both levity and misery But a sense of something wrong connected with him sickened and oppressed them They began to lose all hope in his future career He was no longer the family pride an indistinct dread caused partly by his own conduct partly by expressions of agonising suspicion in Anne s letters home was creeping over their minds that he might turn out their deep disgrace But I believe they shrank from any attempt to define their fears and spoke of him to each other as little as possible They could not help but think and mourn and wonder Feb twentieth eighteen forty five I spent a week at H not very pleasantly headache sickliness and flatness of spirits made me a poor companion a sad drag on the vivacious and loquacious gaiety of all the other inmates of the house I never was fortunate enough to be able to rally for as much as a single hour while I was there I am sure all with the exception perhaps of Mary were very glad when I took my departure I begin to perceive that I have too little life in me now a days to be fit company for any except very quiet people Is it age or what else that changes me so Alas she hardly needed to have asked this question How could she be otherwise than flat spirited a poor companion and a sad drag on the gaiety of those who were light hearted and happy Her honest plan for earning her own livelihood had fallen away crumbled to ashes after all her preparations not a pupil had offered herself and instead of being sorry that this wish of many years could not be realised she had reason to be glad Her poor father nearly sightless depended upon her cares in his blind helplessness but this was a sacred pious charge the duties of which she was blessed in fulfilling The black gloom hung over what had once been the brightest hope of the family over Branwell and the mystery in which his wayward conduct was enveloped Somehow and sometime he would have to turn to his home as a hiding place for shame such was the sad foreboding of his sisters Then how could she be cheerful when she was losing her dear and noble Mary for such a length of time and distance of space that her heart might well prophesy that it was for ever Long before she had written of Mary T that she was full of feelings noble warm generous devoted and profound God bless her I never hope to see in this world a character more truly noble She would die willingly for one she loved Her intellect and attainments are of the very highest standard And this was the friend whom she was to lose Hear that friend s account of their final interview When I last saw Charlotte Jan eighteen forty five she told me she had quite decided to stay at home She owned she did not like it Her health was weak She said she should like any change at first as she had liked Brussels at first and she thought that there must be some possibility for some people of having a life of more variety and more communion with human kind but she saw none for her I told her very warmly that she ought not to stay at home that to spend the next five years at home in solitude and weak health would ruin her that she would never recover it Such a dark shadow came over her face when I said Think of what you ll be five years hence that I stopped and said Don t cry Charlotte She did not cry but went on walking up and down the room and said in a little while But I intend to stay Polly A few weeks after she parted from Mary she gives this account of her days at Haworth March twenty fourth eighteen forty five I can hardly tell you how time gets on at Haworth There is no event whatever to mark its progress One day resembles another and all have heavy lifeless physiognomies Sunday baking day and Saturday are the only ones that have any distinctive mark Meantime life wears away I shall soon be thirty and I have done nothing yet Sometimes I get melancholy at the prospect before and behind me Yet it is wrong and foolish to repine Undoubtedly my duty directs me to stay at home for the present There was a time when Haworth was a very pleasant place to me it is not so now I feel as if we were all buried here I long to travel to work to live a life of action Excuse me dear for troubling you with my fruitless wishes I will put by the rest and not trouble you with them You must write to me If you knew how welcome your letters are you would write very often Your letters and the French newspapers are the only messengers that come to me from the outer world beyond our moors and very welcome messengers they are One of her daily employments was to read to her father and it required a little gentle diplomacy on her part to effect this duty for there were times when the offer of another to do what he had been so long accustomed to do for himself only reminded him too painfully of the deprivation under which he was suffering And in secret she too dreaded a similar loss for herself Long continued ill health a deranged condition of the liver her close application to minute drawing and writing in her younger days her now habitual sleeplessness at nights the many bitter noiseless tears she had shed over Branwell s mysterious and distressing conduct all these causes were telling on her poor eyes and about this time she thus writes to M Heger Il n y a rien que je crains comme le desoeuvrement l inertie la lethargie des facultes Quand le corps est paresseux l esprit souffre cruellement je ne connaitrais pas cette lethargie si je pouvais ecrire Autrefois je passais des journees des semaines des mois entiers a ecrire et pas tout a fait sans fruit puisque Southey et Coleridge deux de nos meilleurs auteurs a qui j ai envoye certains manuscrits en ont bien voulu temoigner leur approbation mais a present j ai la vue trop faible si j ecrivais beaueoup je deviendrais aveugle Cette faiblesse de vue est pour moi une terrible privation sans cela savez vous ce que je ferais Monsieur J ecrirais un livre et je le dedierais a mon maitre de litterature au seul maitre que j aie jamais eu a vous Monsieur Je vous ai dit souvent en francais combien je vous respecte combien je suis redevable a votre bonte a vos conseils Je voudrais le dire une fois en anglais Cela ne se peut pas il ne faut pas y penser La carriere des lettres m est fermee N oubliez pas de me dire comment vous vous portez comment Madame et les enfants se portent Je compte bientot avoir de vos nouvelles cette idee me souris car le souvenir de vos bontes ne s effacera jamais de ma memoire et tant que ce souvenir durera le respect que vous m avez inspire durera aussi Agreez Monsieur c It is probable that even her sisters and most intimate friends did not know of this dread of ultimate blindness which beset her at this period What eyesight she had to spare she reserved for the use of her father She did but little plain sewing not more writing than could be avoided and employed herself principally in knitting April second eighteen forty five I see plainly it is proved to us that there is scarcely a draught of unmingled happiness to be had in this world s illness comes with s marriage Mary T finds herself free and on that path to adventure and exertion to which she has so long been seeking admission Sickness hardship danger are her fellow travellers her inseparable companions She may have been out of the reach of these S W N W gales before they began to blow or they may have spent their fury on land and not ruffled the sea much If it has been otherwise she has been sorely tossed while we have been sleeping in our beds or lying awake thinking about her Yet these real material dangers when once past leave in the mind the satisfaction of having struggled with difficulty and overcome it Strength courage and experience are their invariable results whereas I doubt whether suffering purely mental has any good result unless it be to make us by comparison less sensitive to physical suffering Ten years ago I should have laughed at your account of the blunder you made in mistaking the bachelor doctor for a married man I should have certainly thought you scrupulous over much and wondered how you could possibly regret being civil to a decent individual merely because he happened to be single instead of double Now however I can perceive that your scruples are founded on common sense I know that if women wish to escape the stigma of husband seeking they must act and look like marble or clay cold expressionless bloodless for every appearance of feeling of joy sorrow friendliness antipathy admiration disgust are alike construed by the world into the attempt to hook a husband Never mind well meaning women have their own consciences to comfort them after all Do not therefore be too much afraid of showing yourself as you are affectionate and good hearted do not too harshly repress sentiments and feelings excellent in themselves because you fear that some puppy may fancy that you are letting them come out to fascinate him do not condemn yourself to live only by halves because if you showed too much animation some pragmatical thing in breeches might take it into his pate to imagine that you designed to dedicate your life to his inanity Still a composed decent equable deportment is a capital treasure to a woman and that you possess Write again soon for I feel rather fierce and want stroking down June thirteenth eighteen forty five As to the missus who you say is like me I somehow feel no leaning to her at all I never do to people who are said to be like me because I have always a notion that they are only like me in the disagreeable outside first acquaintance part of my character in those points which are obvious to the ordinary run of people and which I know are not pleasing You say she is clever a clever person How I dislike the term It means rather a shrewd very ugly meddling talking woman I feel reluctant to leave papa for a single day His sight diminishes weekly and can it be wondered at that as he sees the most precious of his faculties leaving him his spirits sometimes sink It is so hard to feel that his few and scanty pleasures must all soon go He has now the greatest difficulty in either reading or writing and then he dreads the state of dependence to which blindness will inevitably reduce him He fears that he will be nothing in his parish I try to cheer him sometimes I succeed temporarily but no consolation can restore his sight or atone for the want of it Still he is never peevish never impatient only anxious and dejected For the reason just given Charlotte declined an invitation to the only house to which she was now ever asked to come In answer to her correspondent s reply to this letter she says You thought I refused you coldly did you It was a queer sort of coldness when I would have given my ears to say Yes and was obliged to say No Matters however are now a little changed Anne is come home and her presence certainly makes me feel more at liberty Then if all be well I will come and see you Tell me only when I must come Mention the week and the day Have the kindness also to answer the following queries if you can How far is it from Leeds to Sheffield Can you give me a notion of the cost Of course when I come you will let me enjoy your own company in peace and not drag me out a visiting I have no desire at all to see your curate I think he must be like all the other curates I have seen and they seem to me a self seeking vain empty race At this blessed moment we have no less than three of them in Haworth parish and there is not one to mend another The other day they all three accompanied by mister S dropped or rather rushed in unexpectedly to tea It was Monday baking day and I was hot and tired still if they had behaved quietly and decently I would have served them out their tea in peace but they began glorifying themselves and abusing Dissenters in such a manner that my temper lost its balance and I pronounced a few sentences sharply and rapidly which struck them all dumb Papa was greatly horrified also but I don t regret it On her return from this short visit to her friend she travelled with a gentleman in the railway carriage whose features and bearing betrayed him in a moment to be a Frenchman She ventured to ask him if such was not the case and on his admitting it she further inquired if he had not passed a considerable time in Germany and was answered that he had her quick ear detected something of the thick guttural pronunciation which Frenchmen say they are able to discover even in the grandchildren of their countrymen who have lived any time beyond the Rhine Charlotte had retained her skill in the language by the habit of which she thus speaks to M Heger Je crains beaucoup d oublier le francais j apprends tous les jours une demie page de francais par coeur et j ai grand plaisir a apprendre cette lecon Veuillez presenter a Madame l assurance de mon estime je crains que Maria Louise et Claire ne m aient deja oubliees mais je vous reverrai un jour aussitot que j aurais gagne assez d argent pour alter a Bruxelles j y irai And so her journey back to Haworth after the rare pleasure of this visit to her friend was pleasantly beguiled by conversation with the French gentleman and she arrived at home refreshed and happy What to find there It was ten o clock when she reached the parsonage Branwell was there unexpectedly very ill He had come home a day or two before apparently for a holiday in reality I imagine because some discovery had been made which rendered his absence imperatively desirable The day of Charlotte s return he had received a letter from mister sternly dismissing him intimating that his proceedings were discovered characterising them as bad beyond expression and charging him on pain of exposure to break off immediately and for ever all communication with every member of the family Whatever may have been the nature and depth of Branwell s sins whatever may have been his temptation whatever his guilt there is no doubt of the suffering which his conduct entailed upon his poor father and his innocent sisters The hopes and plans they had cherished long and laboured hard to fulfil were cruelly frustrated henceforward their days were embittered and the natural rest of their nights destroyed by his paroxysms of remorse Let us read of the misery caused to his poor sisters in Charlotte s own affecting words We have had sad work with Branwell He thought of nothing but stunning or drowning his agony of mind No one in this house could have rest and at last we have been obliged to send him from home for a week with some one to look after him He has written to me this morning expressing some sense of contrition but as long as he remains at home I scarce dare hope for peace in the house We must all I fear prepare for a season of distress and disquietude When I left you I was strongly impressed with the feeling that I was going back to sorrow August eighteen forty five Things here at home are much as usual not very bright as it regards Branwell though his health and consequently his temper have been somewhat better this last day or two because he is now forced to abstain August eighteenth eighteen forty five I have delayed writing because I have no good news to communicate My hopes ebb low indeed about Branwell I sometimes fear he will never be fit for much The late blow to his prospects and feelings has quite made him reckless It is only absolute want of means that acts as any check to him One ought indeed to hope to the very last and I try to do so but occasionally hope in his case seems so fallacious Nov fourth eighteen forty five I hoped to be able to ask you to come to Haworth It almost seemed as if Branwell had a chance of getting employment and I waited to know the result of his efforts in order to say dear come and see us But the place a secretaryship to a railway committee is given to another person Branwell still remains at home and while he is here you shall not come I am more confirmed in that resolution the more I see of him I wish I could say one word to you in his favour but I cannot I will hold my tongue We are all obliged to you for your kind suggestion about Leeds but I think our school schemes are for the present at rest Dec thirty first eighteen forty five You say well in speaking of that no sufferings are so awful as those brought on by dissipation alas I see the truth of this observation daily proved and must have as weary and burdensome a life of it in waiting upon their unhappy brother It seems grievous indeed that those who have not sinned should suffer so largely In fact all their latter days blighted with the presence of cruel shameful suffering the premature deaths of two at least of the sisters all the great possibilities of their earthly lives snapped short may be dated from Midsummer eighteen forty five For the last three years of Branwell s life he took opium habitually by way of stunning conscience he drank moreover whenever he could get the opportunity The reader may say that I have mentioned his tendency to intemperance long before It is true but it did not become habitual as far as I can learn until after he was dismissed from his tutorship He took opium because it made him forget for a time more effectually than drink and besides it was more portable In procuring it he showed all the cunning of the opium eater He would steal out while the family were at church to which he had professed himself too ill to go and manage to cajole the village druggist out of a lump or it might be the carrier had unsuspiciously brought him some in a packet from a distance For some time before his death he had attacks of delirium tremens of the most frightful character he slept in his father s room and he would sometimes declare that either he or his father should be dead before the morning The trembling sisters sick with fright would implore their father not to expose himself to this danger but mister Bronte is no timid man and perhaps he felt that he could possibly influence his son to some self restraint more by showing trust in him than by showing fear The sisters often listened for the report of a pistol in the dead of the night till watchful eye and hearkening ear grew heavy and dull with the perpetual strain upon their nerves In the mornings young Bronte would saunter out saying with a drunkard s incontinence of speech The poor old man and I have had a terrible night of it he does his best the poor old man but it s all over with me CHAPTER XIV In the course of this sad autumn of eighteen forty five a new interest came up faint indeed and often lost sight of in the vivid pain and constant pressure of anxiety respecting their brother In the biographical notice of her sisters which Charlotte prefixed to the edition of Wuthering Heights and Agnes Grey published in eighteen fifty a piece of writing unique as far as I know in its pathos and its power she says One day in the autumn of eighteen forty five I accidentally lighted on a MS volume of verse in my sister Emily s handwriting Of course I was not surprised knowing that she could and did write verse I looked it over and something more than surprise seized me a deep conviction that these were not common effusions nor at all like the poetry women generally write I thought them condensed and terse vigorous and genuine To my ear they had also a peculiar music wild melancholy and elevating My sister Emily was not a person of demonstrative character nor one on the recesses of whose mind and feelings even those nearest and dearest to her could with impunity intrude unlicensed it took hours to reconcile her to the discovery I had made and days to persuade her that such poems merited publication Meantime my younger sister quietly produced some of her own compositions intimating that since Emily s had given me pleasure I might like to look at hers I could not but be a partial judge yet I thought that these verses too had a sweet sincere pathos of their own We had very early cherished the dream of one day being authors We agreed to arrange a small selection of our poems and if possible get them printed Averse to personal publicity we veiled our own names under those of Currer Ellis and Acton Bell the ambiguous choice being dictated by a sort of conscientious scruple at assuming Christian names positively masculine while we did not like to declare ourselves women because without at the time suspecting that our mode of writing and thinking was not what is called feminine we had a vague impression that authoresses are liable to be looked on with prejudice we noticed how critics sometimes use for their chastisement the weapon of personality and for their reward a flattery which is not true praise The bringing out of our little book was hard work As was to be expected neither we nor our poems were at all wanted but for this we had been prepared at the outset though inexperienced ourselves we had read the experience of others The great puzzle lay in the difficulty of getting answers of any kind from the publishers to whom we applied Being greatly harassed by this obstacle I ventured to apply to the Messrs Chambers of Edinburgh for a word of advice they may have forgotten the circumstance but I have not for from them I received a brief and business like but civil and sensible reply on which we acted and at last made way I inquired from mister Robert Chambers and found as Miss Bronte conjectured that he had entirely forgotten the application which had been made to him and his brother for advice nor had they any copy or memorandum of the correspondence There is an intelligent man living in Haworth who has given me some interesting particulars relating to the sisters about this period He says I have known Miss Bronte as Miss Bronte a long time indeed ever since they came to Haworth in eighteen nineteen But I had not much acquaintance with the family till about eighteen forty three when I began to do a little in the stationery line Nothing of that kind could be had nearer than Keighley before I began They used to buy a great deal of writing paper and I used to wonder whatever they did with so much I sometimes thought they contributed to the Magazines When I was out of stock I was always afraid of their coming they seemed so distressed about it if I had none I have walked to Halifax a distance of ten miles many a time for half a ream of paper for fear of being without it when they came I could not buy more at a time for want of capital I was always short of that I did so like them to come when I had anything for them they were so much different to anybody else so gentle and kind and so very quiet They never talked much Charlotte sometimes would sit and inquire about our circumstances so kindly and feelingly Though I am a poor working man which I have never felt to be any degradation I could talk with her with the greatest freedom I always felt quite at home with her Though I never had any school education I never felt the want of it in her company The publishers to whom she finally made a successful application for the production of Currer Ellis and Acton Bell s poems were Messrs Aylott and Jones Paternoster Row mister Aylott has kindly placed the letters which she wrote to them on the subject at my disposal The first is dated January twenty eighth eighteen forty six and in it she inquires if they will publish one volume octavo of poems if not at their own risk on the author s account It is signed C Bronte They must have replied pretty speedily for on January thirty first she writes again GENTLEMEN Since you agree to undertake the publication of the work respecting which I applied to you I should wish now to know as soon as possible the cost of paper and printing I will then send the necessary remittance together with the manuscript I should like it to be printed in one octavo volume of the same quality of paper and size of type as Moxon s last edition of Wordsworth The poems will occupy I should think from two hundred to two hundred fifty pages They are not the production of a clergyman nor are they exclusively of a religious character but I presume these circumstances will be immaterial It will perhaps be necessary that you should see the manuscript in order to calculate accurately the expense of publication in that case I will send it immediately I should like however previously to have some idea of the probable cost and if from what I have said you can make a rough calculation on the subject I should be greatly obliged to you In her next letter February sixth she says You will perceive that the poems are the work of three persons relatives their separate pieces are distinguished by their respective signatures She writes again on February fifteenth and on the sixteenth she says The MS will certainly form a thinner volume than I had anticipated I cannot name another model which I should like it precisely to resemble yet I think a duodecimo form and a somewhat reduced though still clear type would be preferable I only stipulate for clear type not too small and good paper On February twenty first she selects the long primer type for the poems and will remit thirty one l ten s in a few days Minute as the details conveyed in these notes are they are not trivial because they afford such strong indications of character If the volume was to be published at their own risk it was necessary that the sister conducting the negotiation should make herself acquainted with the different kinds of type and the various sizes of books Accordingly she bought a small volume from which to learn all she could on the subject of preparation for the press No half knowledge no trusting to other people for decisions which she could make for herself and yet a generous and full confidence not misplaced in the thorough probity of Messrs Aylott and Jones The caution in ascertaining the risk before embarking in the enterprise and the prompt payment of the money required even before it could be said to have assumed the shape of a debt were both parts of a self reliant and independent character Self contained also was she During the whole time that the volume of poems was in the course of preparation and publication no word was written telling anyone out of the household circle what was in progress I have had some of the letters placed in my hands which she addressed to her old schoolmistress Miss W They begin a little before this time Acting on the conviction which I have all along entertained that where Charlotte Bronte s own words could be used no others ought to take their place I shall make extracts from this series according to their dates Jan thirtieth eighteen forty six MY DEAR MISS W I have not yet paid my visit to it is indeed more than a year since I was there but I frequently hear from E and she did not fail to tell me that you were gone into Worcestershire she was unable however to give me your exact address Had I known it I should have written to you long since I thought you would wonder how we were getting on when you heard of the railway panic and you may be sure that I am very glad to be able to answer your kind inquiries by the assurance that our small capital is as yet undiminished The York and Midland is as you say a very good line yet I confess to you I should wish for my own part to be wise in time I cannot think that even the very best lines will continue for many years at their present premiums and I have been most anxious for us to sell our shares ere it be too late and to secure the proceeds in some safer if for the present less profitable investment I cannot however persuade my sisters to regard the affair precisely from my point of view and I feel as if I would rather run the risk of loss than hurt Emily s feelings by acting in direct opposition to her opinion She managed in a most handsome and able manner for me when I was in Brussels and prevented by distance from looking after my own interests therefore I will let her manage still and take the consequences Disinterested and energetic she certainly is and if she be not quite so tractable or open to conviction as I could wish I must remember perfection is not the lot of humanity and as long as we can regard those we love and to whom we are closely allied with profound and never shaken esteem it is a small thing that they should vex us occasionally by what appear to us unreasonable and headstrong notions You my dear Miss W know full as well as I do the value of sisters affection to each other there is nothing like it in this world I believe when they are nearly equal in age and similar in education tastes and sentiments You ask about Branwell he never thinks of seeking employment and I begin to fear that he has rendered himself incapable of filling any respectable station in life besides if money were at his disposal he would use it only to his own injury the faculty of self government is I fear almost destroyed in him You ask me if I do not think that men are strange beings I do indeed I have often thought so and I think too that the mode of bringing them up is strange they are not sufficiently guarded from temptation Girls are protected as if they were something very frail or silly indeed while boys are turned loose on the world as if they of all beings in existence were the wisest and least liable to be led astray I am glad you like Broomsgrove though I dare say there are few places you would not like with missus M for a companion I always feel a peculiar satisfaction when I hear of your enjoying yourself because it proves that there really is such a thing as retributive justice even in this world You worked hard you denied yourself all pleasure almost all relaxation in your youth and in the prime of life now you are free and that while you have still I hope many years of vigour and health in which you can enjoy freedom Besides I have another and very egotistical motive for being pleased it seems that even a lone woman can be happy as well as cherished wives and proud mothers I am glad of that I speculate much on the existence of unmarried and never to be married women now a days and I have already got to the point of considering that there is no more respectable character on this earth than an unmarried woman who makes her own way through life quietly perseveringly without support of husband or brother and who having attained the age of forty five or upwards retains in her possession a well regulated mind a disposition to enjoy simple pleasures and fortitude to support inevitably pains sympathy with the sufferings of others and willingness to relieve want as far as her means extend During the time that the negotiation with Messrs Aylott and company was going on Charlotte went to visit her old school friend with whom she was in such habits of confidential intimacy but neither then nor afterwards did she ever speak to her of the publication of the poems nevertheless this young lady suspected that the sisters wrote for Magazines and in this idea she was confirmed when on one of her visits to Haworth she saw Anne with a number of Chambers s Journal and a gentle smile of pleasure stealing over her placid face as she read What is the matter asked the friend Why do you smile Only because I see they have inserted one of my poems was the quiet reply and not a word more was said on the subject To this friend Charlotte addressed the following letters March third eighteen forty six I reached home a little after two o clock all safe and right yesterday I found papa very well his sight much the same Emily and Anne were going to Keighley to meet me unfortunately I had returned by the old road while they were gone by the new and we missed each other They did not get home till half past four and were caught in the heavy shower of rain which fell in the afternoon I am sorry to say Anne has taken a little cold in consequence but I hope she will soon be well Papa was much cheered by my report of mister C s opinion and of old missus E s experience but I could perceive he caught gladly at the idea of deferring the operation a few months longer I went into the room where Branwell was to speak to him about an hour after I got home it was very forced work to address him I might have spared myself the trouble as he took no notice and made no reply he was stupified My fears were not in vain I hear that he got a sovereign while I have been away under pretence of paying a pressing debt he went immediately and changed it at a public house and has employed it as was to be expected concluded her account by saying he was a hopeless being it is too true In his present state it is scarcely possible to stay in the room where he is What the future has in store I do not know March thirty first eighteen forty six Our poor old servant Tabby had a sort of fit a fortnight since but is nearly recovered now Martha the girl they had to assist poor old Tabby and who remains still the faithful servant at the parsonage is ill with a swelling in her knee and obliged to go home I fear it will be long before she is in working condition again I received the number of the Record you sent I read D Aubigne s letter It is clever and in what he says about Catholicism very good The Evangelical Alliance part is not very practicable yet certainly it is more in accordance with the spirit of the Gospel to preach unity among Christians than to inculcate mutual intolerance and hatred I am very glad I went to when I did for the changed weather has somewhat changed my health and strength since How do you get on I long for mild south and west winds I am thankful papa continues pretty well though often made very miserable by Branwell s wretched conduct There there is no change but for the worse Meanwhile the printing of the volume of poems was quietly proceeding After some consultation and deliberation the sisters had determined to correct the proofs themselves Up to March twenty eighth the publishers had addressed their correspondent as C Bronte esquire but at this time some little mistake occurred and she desired Messrs Aylott and company in future to direct to her real address Miss Bronte c She had however evidently left it to be implied that she was not acting on her own behalf but as agent for the real authors since in a note dated April sixth she makes a proposal on behalf of C E and A Bell which is to the following effect that they are preparing for the press a work of fiction consisting of three distinct and unconnected tales which may be published either together as a work of three volumes of the ordinary novel size or separately as single volumes as may be deemed most advisable She states in addition that it is not their intention to publish these tales on their own account but that the authors direct her to ask Messrs Aylott and company whether they would be disposed to undertake the work after having of course by due inspection of the MS ascertained that its contents are such as to warrant an expectation of success To this letter of inquiry the publishers replied speedily and the tenor of their answer may be gathered from Charlotte s dated April eleventh I beg to thank you in the name of C E and A Bell for your obliging offer of advice I will avail myself of it to request information on two or three points It is evident that unknown authors have great difficulties to contend with before they can succeed in bringing their works before the public Can you give me any hint as to the way in which these difficulties are best met For instance in the present case where a work of fiction is in question in what form would a publisher be most likely to accept the MS Whether offered as a work of three vols or as tales which might be published in numbers or as contributions to a periodical What publishers would be most likely to receive favourably a proposal of this nature Would it suffice to write to a publisher on the subject or would it be necessary to have recourse to a personal interview Your opinion and advice on these three points or on any other which your experience may suggest as important would be esteemed by us as a favour It is evident from the whole tenor of this correspondence that the truthfulness and probity of the firm of publishers with whom she had to deal in this her first literary venture were strongly impressed upon her mind and was followed by the inevitable consequence of reliance on their suggestions And the progress of the poems was not unreasonably lengthy or long drawn out On April twentieth she writes to desire that three copies may be sent to her and that Messrs Aylott will advise her as to the reviewers to whom copies ought to be sent I give the next letter as illustrating the ideas of these girls as to what periodical reviews or notices led public opinion The poems to be neatly done up in cloth Have the goodness to send copies and advertisements as early as possible to each of the undermentioned periodicals Colburn s New Monthly Magazine Bentley s Magazine Hood s Magazine Jerrold s Shilling Magazine Blackwood s Magazine The Edinburgh Review Tait s Edinburgh Magazine The Dublin University Magazine Also to the Daily News and to the Britannia papers If there are any other periodicals to which you have been in the habit of sending copies of works let them be supplied also with copies I think those I have mentioned will suffice for advertising In compliance with this latter request Messrs Aylott suggest that copies and advertisements of the work should be sent to the Athenaeum Literary Gazette Critic and Times but in her reply Miss Bronte says that she thinks the periodicals she first mentioned will be sufficient for advertising in at present as the authors do not wish to lay out a larger sum than two pounds in advertising esteeming the success of a work dependent more on the notice it receives from periodicals than on the quantity of advertisements In case of any notice of the poems appearing whether favourable or otherwise Messrs Aylott and company are requested to send her the name and number of those periodicals in which such notices appear as otherwise since she has not the opportunity of seeing periodicals regularly she may miss reading the critique Should the poems be remarked upon favourably it is my intention to appropriate a further sum for advertisements If on the other hand they should pass unnoticed or be condemned I consider it would be quite useless to advertise as there is nothing either in the title of the work or the names of the authors to attract attention from a single individual I suppose the little volume of poems was published some time about the end of May eighteen forty six It stole into life some weeks passed over without the mighty murmuring public discovering that three more voices were uttering their speech And meanwhile the course of existence moved drearily along from day to day with the anxious sisters who must have forgotten their sense of authorship in the vital care gnawing at their hearts On June seventeenth Charlotte writes Branwell declares that he neither can nor will do anything for himself good situations have been offered him for which by a fortnight s work he might have qualified himself but he will do nothing except drink and make us all wretched In the Athenaeum of July fourth under the head of poetry for the million came a short review of the poems of C E and A Bell The reviewer assigns to Ellis the highest rank of the three brothers as he supposes them to be he calls Ellis a fine quaint spirit and speaks of an evident power of wing that may reach heights not here attempted Again with some degree of penetration the reviewer says that the poems of Ellis convey an impression of originality beyond what his contributions to these volumes embody Currer is placed midway between Ellis and Acton But there is little in the review to strain out at this distance of time as worth preserving Still we can fancy with what interest it was read at Haworth Parsonage and how the sisters would endeavour to find out reasons for opinions or hints for the future guidance of their talents I call particular attention to the following letter of Charlotte s dated July tenth eighteen forty six To whom it was written matters not but the wholesome sense of duty in it the sense of the supremacy of that duty which God in placing us in families has laid out for us seems to deserve especial regard in these days I see you are in a dilemma and one of a peculiar and difficult nature Two paths lie before you you conscientiously wish to choose the right one even though it be the most steep strait and rugged but you do not know which is the right one you cannot decide whether duty and religion command you to go out into the cold and friendless world and there to earn your living by governess drudgery or whether they enjoin your continued stay with your aged mother neglecting for the present every prospect of independency for yourself and putting up with daily inconvenience sometimes even with privations I can well imagine that it is next to impossible for you to decide for yourself in this matter so I will decide it for you At least I will tell you what is my earnest conviction on the subject I will show you candidly how the question strikes me The right path is that which necessitates the greatest sacrifice of self interest which implies the greatest good to others and this path steadily followed will lead I believe in time to prosperity and to happiness though it may seem at the outset to tend quite in a contrary direction Your mother is both old and infirm old and infirm people have but few sources of happiness fewer almost than the comparatively young and healthy can conceive to deprive them of one of these is cruel If your mother is more composed when you are with her stay with her If she would be unhappy in case you left her stay with her It will not apparently as far as short sighted humanity can see be for your advantage to remain at nor will you be praised and admired for remaining at home to comfort your mother yet probably your own conscience will approve and if it does stay with her I recommend you to do what I am trying to do myself The remainder of this letter is only interesting to the reader as it conveys a peremptory disclaimer of the report that the writer was engaged to be married to her father s curate the very same gentleman to whom eight years afterwards she was united and who probably even now although she was unconscious of the fact had begun his service to her in the same tender and faithful spirit as that in which Jacob served for Rachel Others may have noticed this though she did not A few more notes remain of her correspondence on behalf of the Messrs Bell with mister Aylott On July fifteenth she says I suppose as you have not written no other notices have yet appeared nor has the demand for the work increased Will you favour me with a line stating whether any or how many copies have yet been sold But few I fear for three days later she wrote the following The Messrs Bell desire me to thank you for your suggestion respecting the advertisements They agree with you that since the season is unfavourable advertising had better be deferred They are obliged to you for the information respecting the number of copies sold On July twenty third she writes to the Messrs Aylott The Messrs Bell would be obliged to you to post the enclosed note in London It is an answer to the letter you forwarded which contained an application for their autographs from a person who professed to have read and admired their poems I think I before intimated that the Messrs Bell are desirous for the present of remaining unknown for which reason they prefer having the note posted in London to sending it direct in order to avoid giving any clue to residence or identity by post mark c Once more in September she writes As the work has received no further notice from any periodical I presume the demand for it has not greatly increased In the biographical notice of her sisters she thus speaks of the failure of the modest hopes vested in this publication The book was printed it is scarcely known and all of it that merits to be known are the poems of Ellis Bell The fixed conviction I held and hold of the worth of these poems has not indeed received the confirmation of much favourable criticism but I must retain it notwithstanding FOOTNOTES A reviewer pointed out the discrepancy between the age twenty seven years assigned on the mural tablet to Anne Bronte at the time of her death in eighteen forty nine and the alleged fact that she was born at Thornton from which place mister Bronte removed on February twenty fifth eighteen twenty I was aware of the discrepancy but I did not think it of sufficient consequence to be rectified by an examination of the register of births mister Bronte s own words on which I grounded my statement as to the time of Anne Bronte s birth are as follows In Thornton Charlotte Patrick Branwell Emily Jane and Anne were born And such of the inhabitants of Haworth as have spoken on the subject say that all the children of mister and missus Bronte were born before they removed to Haworth There is probably some mistake in the inscription on the tablet In the month of April eighteen fifty eight a neat mural tablet was erected within the Communion railing of the Church at Haworth to the memory of the deceased members of the Bronte family The tablet is of white Carrara marble on a ground of dove coloured marble with a cornice surmounted by an ornamental pediment of chaste design Between the brackets which support the tablet is inscribed the sacred monogram I H S in old English letters In Memory of Maria wife of the reverend P Bronte A B Minister of Haworth She died Sept fifteenth eighteen twenty one in the thirty ninth year of her age Also of Maria their daughter who died May sixth eighteen twenty five in the twelfth year of her age Also of

fifty six fifty seven With regard to my own opinion of the present school I can only give it as formed after what was merely a cursory and superficial inspection as I do not believe that I was in the house above half an hour but it was and is this that the house at Casterton seemed thoroughly healthy and well kept and is situated in a lovely spot that the pupils looked bright happy and well and that the lady superintendent was a most prepossessing looking person who on my making some inquiry as to the accomplishments taught to the pupils said that the scheme of education was materially changed since the school had been opened I would have inserted this testimony in the first edition had I believed that any weight could be attached to an opinion formed on such slight and superficial
