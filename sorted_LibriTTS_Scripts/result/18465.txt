Once on a Time there were Two Men each of whom decided to build for himself a Fine New House One Man being of an Arrogant and Conceited Nature took counsel of Nobody but declared that he would build his House to suit himself For said he since it is My House and I am to Live in It why should I ask the Advice of my Neighbors as to its Construction While the House was Building the Neighbors came often and Looked at it and went away Whispering and Wagging their Heads in Derision But the Man paid no Heed and continued to build his House as he Would The Result was that when completed his House was lacking in Symmetry and Utility and in a Hundred ways it was Unsatisfactory and for each Defect there was a Neighbor who said Had you asked Me I would have Warned you against that Error The Other Man who was of a Humble and Docile Mind went to Each of his Neighbors in Turn and asked Advice about the Building of his House His Friends willingly and at Great Length gave him the Benefit of their Experiences and Opinions and the Grateful Man undertook to Follow Out all their Directions The Result was that his House when finished was a Hodge Podge of Varying Styles and Contradictory Effects and Exceedingly Uncomfortable and Inconvenient to Live In MORALS This Fable teaches that In a Multitude of Counselors there is Safety and that Too Many Cooks Spoil the Broth YES BY JOHN BOYLE O REILLY The

Persistent and Persevering Nature managed to be Continually in the Young Lady s Company He would pay her a visit in the Morning Drop In to Tea in the Afternoon and Call on her Again in the Evening He took her Driving and he Escorted her to the Theater He would take her to a Party and then he would Dance or Sit on the Stairs or Flit into the Conservatory with her The Young Lady admired this man but she Wearied of his never ceasing Presence and she Said to Herself If he were not Always at my Elbow I should Better Appreciate his Good Qualities The Other Suitor who considered himself a Man of Deep and Penetrating Cleverness said to himself I will Go Away for a Time and then my Fair One will Realize my Worth and Call Me Back to Her With a sad Visage he made his Adieus and he Exacted her Pledge to Write to him Occasionally But after he had Gone she Forgot her Promise and Soon she Forgot his Very Existence MORALS This Fable teaches that Absence Makes the Heart Grow Fonder and that Out of

Beecher well aware Of what was done in Delaware Of that unwholesome smell aware She d make all heaven and hell aware And ask John Brown to tell her where Henceforth she best might sell her ware OUR BEST SOCIETY BY GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS If gilt were only gold or sugar candy common sense what a fine thing our society would be If to lavish money upon objets de vertu to wear the most costly dresses and always to have them cut in the height of the fashion to build houses thirty feet broad as if they were palaces to furnish them with all the luxurious devices of Parisian genius to give superb banquets at which your guests laugh and which make you miserable to drive a fine carriage and ape European liveries and crests and coats of arms to resent the friendly advances of your baker s wife and the lady of your butcher you being yourself a cobbler s daughter to talk much of the old families and of your aristocratic foreign friends to despise labor to prate of good society to travesty and parody in every conceivable way a society which we know only in books and by the superficial observation of foreign travel which arises out of a social organization entirely unknown to us and which is opposed to our fundamental and essential principles if all this were fine what a prodigiously fine society would ours be This occurred to us upon lately receiving a card of invitation to a brilliant ball We were quietly ruminating over our evening fire with Disraeli s Wellington speech all tears in our hands with the account of a great man s burial and a little man s triumph across the channel So many great men gone we mused and such great crises impending This democratic movement in Europe Kossuth and Mazzini waiting for the moment to give the word the Russian bear watchfully sucking his paws the Napoleonic empire redivivus Cuba and annexation and Slavery California and Australia and the consequent considerations of political economy dear me exclaimed we putting on a fresh hodful of coal we must look a little into the state of parties As we put down the coal scuttle there was a knock at the door We said come in and in came a neat Alhambra watered envelope containing the announcement that the queen of fashion was at home that evening week Later in the evening came a friend to smoke a cigar The card was lying upon the table and he read it with eagerness You ll go of course said he for you will meet all the best society Shall we truly Shall we really see the best society of the city the picked flower of its genius character and beauty What makes the best society of men and women The noblest specimens of each of course The men who mould the time who refresh our faith in heroism and virtue who make Plato and Zeno and Shakespeare and all Shakespeare s gentlemen possible again The women whose beauty and sweetness and dignity and high accomplishment and grace make us understand the Greek mythology and weaken our desire to have some glimpse of the most famous women of history The best society is that in which the virtues are most shining which is the most charitable forgiving long suffering modest and innocent The best society is by its very name that in which there is the least hypocrisy and insincerity of all kinds which recoils from and blasts artificiality which is anxious to be all that it is possible to be and which sternly reprobates all shallow pretense all coxcombry and foppery and insists upon simplicity as the infallible characteristic of true worth That is the best society which comprises the best men and women Had we recently arrived from the moon we might upon hearing that we were to meet the best society have fancied that we were about to enjoy an opportunity not to be overvalued But unfortunately we were not so freshly arrived We had received other cards and had perfected our toilette many times to meet this same society so magnificently described and had found it the least best of all Who compose it Whom shall we meet if we go to this ball We shall meet three classes of persons first those who are rich and who have all that money can buy second those who belong to what are technically called the good old families because some ancestor was a man of mark in the state or country or was very rich and has kept the fortune in the family and thirdly a swarm of youths who can dance dexterously and who are invited for that purpose Now these are all arbitrary and factitious distinctions upon which to found so profound a social difference as that which exists in American or at least in New York society First as a general rule the rich men of every community who make their own money are not the most generally intelligent and cultivated They have a shrewd talent which secures a fortune and which keeps them closely at the work of amassing from their youngest years until they are old They are sturdy men of simple tastes often Sometimes though rarely very generous but necessarily with an altogether false and exaggerated idea of the importance of money They are a rather rough unsympathetic and perhaps selfish class who themselves despise purple and fine linen and still prefer a cot bed and a bare room although they may be worth millions But they are married to scheming or ambitious or disappointed women whose life is a prolonged pageant and they are dragged hither and thither in it are bled of their golden blood and forced into a position they do not covet and which they despise Then there are the inheritors of wealth How many of them inherit the valiant genius and hard frugality which built up their fortunes how many acknowledge the stern and heavy responsibility of their opportunities how many refuse to dream their lives away in a Sybarite luxury how many are smitten with the lofty ambition of achieving an enduring name by works of a permanent value how many do not dwindle into dainty dilettanti and dilute their manhood with factitious sentimentality instead of a hearty human sympathy how many are not satisfied with having the fastest horses and the crackest carriages and an unlimited wardrobe and a weak affectation and puerile imitation of foreign life And who are these of our secondly these old families The spirit of our time and of our country knows no such thing but the habitue of society hears constantly of a good family It means simply the collective mass of children grand children nephews nieces and descendants of some man who deserved well of his country and whom his country honors But sad is the heritage of a great name The son of Burke will inevitably be measured by Burke The niece of Pope must show some superiority to other women so to speak or her equality is inferiority The feeling of men attributes some magical charm to blood and we look to see the daughter of Helen as fair as her mother and the son of Shakespeare musical as his sire If they are not so if they are merely names and common persons if there is no Burke nor Shakespeare nor Washington nor Bacon in their words or actions or lives then we must pity them and pass gently on not upbraiding them but regretting that it is one of the laws of greatness that it dwindles all things in its vicinity which would otherwise show large enough Nay in our regard for the great man we may even admit to a compassionate honor as pensioners upon our charity those who bear and transmit his name But if these heirs should presume upon that fame and claim any precedence of living men and women because their dead grandfather was a hero they must be shown the door directly We should dread to be born a Percy or a Colonna or a Bonaparte We should not like to be the second Duke of Wellington nor Charles Dickens junior It is a terrible thing one would say to a mind of honorable feeling to be pointed out as somebody s son or uncle or granddaughter as if the excellence were all derived It must be a little humiliating to reflect that if your great uncle had not been somebody you would be nobody that in fact you are only a name and that if you should consent to change it for the sake of a fortune as is sometimes done you would cease to be anything but a rich man My father was President or Governor of the State some pompous man may say But by Jupiter king of gods and men what are you is the instinctive response Do you not see our pompous friend that you are only pointing your own unimportance If your father was Governor of the State what right have you to use that fact only to fatten your self conceit Take care good care for whether you say it by your lips or by your life that withering response awaits you then what are you If your ancestor was great you are under bonds to greatness If you are small make haste to learn it betimes and thanking heaven that your name has been made illustrious retire into a corner and keep it at least untarnished Our thirdly is a class made by sundry French tailors bootmakers dancing masters and mister Brown They are a corps de ballet for use of private entertainments They are fostered by society for the use of young debutantes and hardier damsels who have dared two or three years of the tight polka They are cultivated for their heels not their heads Their life begins at ten o clock in the evening and lasts until four in the morning They go home and sleep until nine then they reel sleepy to counting houses and offices and doze on desks until dinnertime Or unable to do that they are actively at work all day and their cheeks grow pale and their lips thin and their eyes bloodshot and hollow and they drag themselves home at evening to catch a nap until the ball begins or to dine and smoke at their club and the very manly with punches and coarse stories and then to rush into hot and glittering rooms and seize very decollete girls closely around the waist and dash with them around an area of stretched linen saying in the panting pauses How very hot it is How very pretty Miss Podge looks What a good redowa Are you going to missus Potiphar s Is this the assembled flower of manhood and womanhood called best society and to see which is so envied a privilege If such are the elements can we be long in arriving at the present state and necessary future condition of parties Vanity Fair is peculiarly a picture of modern society It aims at English follies but its mark is universal as the madness is It is called a satire but after much diligent reading we can not discover the satire A state of society not at all superior to that of Vanity Fair is not unknown to our experience and unless truth telling be satire unless the most tragically real portraiture be satire unless scalding tears of sorrow and the bitter regret of a manly mind over the miserable spectacle of artificiality wasted powers misdirected energies and lost opportunities be satirical we do not find satire in that sad story The reader closes it with a grief beyond tears It leaves a vague apprehension in the mind as if we should suspect the air to be poisoned It suggests the terrible thought of the enfeebling of moral power and the deterioration of noble character as a necessary consequence of contact with society Every man looks suddenly and sharply around him and accosts himself and his neighbors to ascertain if they are all parties to this corruption Sentimental youths and maidens upon velvet sofas or in calf bound libraries resolve that it is an insult to human nature are sure that their velvet and calf bound friends are not like the dramatis personae of Vanity Fair and that the drama is therefore hideous and unreal They should remember what they uniformly and universally forget that we are not invited upon the rising of the curtain to behold a cosmorama or picture of the world but a representation of that part of it called Vanity Fair What its just limits are how far its poisonous purlieus reach how much of the world s air is tainted by it is a question which every thoughtful man will ask himself with a shudder and look sadly around to answer If the sentimental objectors rally again to the charge and declare that if we wish to improve the world its virtuous ambition must be piqued and stimulated by making the shining heights of the ideal more radiant we reply that none shall surpass us in honoring the men whose creations of beauty inspire and instruct mankind But if they benefit the world it is no less true that a vivid apprehension of the depths into which we are sunken or may sink nerves the soul s courage quite as much as the alluring mirage of the happy heights we may attain To hold the mirror up to Nature is still the most potent method of shaming sin and strengthening virtue If Vanity Fair be a satire what novel of society is not Are Vivian Grey and Pelham and the long catalogue of books illustrating English or the host of Balzacs Sands Sues and Dumas that paint French society less satires Nay if you should catch any dandy in Broadway or in Pall Mall or upon the Boulevards this very morning and write a coldly true history of his life and actions his doings and undoings would it not be the most scathing and tremendous satire if by satire you mean the consuming melancholy of the conviction that the life of that pendant to a mustache is an insult to the possible life of a man We have read of a hypocrisy so thorough that it was surprised you should think it hypocritical and we have bitterly thought of the saying when hearing one mother say of another mother s child that she had made a good match because the girl was betrothed to a stupid boy whose father was rich The remark was the key of our social feeling Let us look at it a little and first of all let the reader consider the criticism and not the critic We may like very well in our individual capacity to partake of the delicacies prepared by our hostess s chef we may not be averse to pate and myriad objets de gout and if you caught us in a corner at the next ball putting away a fair share of dinde aux truffes we know you would have at us in a tone of great moral indignation and wish to know why we sneaked into great houses eating good suppers and drinking choice wines and then went away with an indigestion to write dyspeptic disgusts at society We might reply that it is necessary to know something of a subject before writing about it and that if a man wished to describe the habits of South Sea Islanders it is useless to go to Greenland we might also confess a partiality for pate and a tenderness for truffes and acknowledge that considering our single absence would not put down extravagant pompous parties we were not strong enough to let the morsels drop into unappreciating mouths or we might say that if a man invited us to see his new house it would not be ungracious nor insulting to his hospitality to point out whatever weak parts we might detect in it nor to declare our candid conviction that it was built upon wrong principles and could not stand He might believe us if we had been in the house but he certainly would not if we had never seen it Nor would it be a very wise reply upon his part that we might build a better if we didn t like that We are not fond of David s pictures but we certainly could never paint half so well nor of Pope s poetry but posterity will never hear of our verses Criticism is not construction it is observation If we could surpass in its own way everything which displeased us we should make short work of it and instead of showing what fatal blemishes deform our present society we should present a specimen of perfection directly We went to the brilliant ball There was too much of everything Too much light and eating and drinking and dancing and flirting and dressing and feigning and smirking and much too many people Good taste insists first upon fitness But why had missus Potiphar given this ball We inquired industriously and learned it was because she did not give one last year Is it then essential to do this thing biennially inquired we with some trepidation Certainly was the bland reply or society will forget you Everybody was unhappy at missus Potiphar s save a few girls and boys who danced violently all the evening Those who did not dance walked up and down the rooms as well as they could squeezing by non dancing ladies causing them to swear in their hearts as the brusque broadcloth carried away the light outworks of gauze and gossamer The dowagers ranged in solid phalanx occupied all the chairs and sofas against the wall and fanned themselves until supper time looking at each other s diamonds and criticizing the toilettes of the younger ladies each narrowly watching her peculiar Polly Jane that she did not betray too much interest in any man who was not of a certain fortune It is the cold vulgar truth madam nor are we in the slightest degree exaggerating Elderly gentlemen twisting single gloves in a very wretched manner came up and bowed to the dowagers and smirked and said it was a pleasant party and a handsome house and then clutched their hands behind them and walked miserably away looking as affable as possible And the dowagers made a little fun of the elderly gentlemen among themselves as they walked away Then came the younger non dancing men a class of the community who wear black cravats and waistcoats and thrust their thumbs and forefingers in their waistcoat pockets and are called talking men Some of them are literary and affect the philosopher have perhaps written a book or two and are a small species of lion to very young ladies Some are of the blase kind men who affect the extremest elegance and are reputed so aristocratic and who care for nothing in particular but wish they had not been born gentlemen in which case they might have escaped ennui These gentlemen stand with hat in hand and their coats and trousers are unexceptionable They are the so gentlemanly persons of whom one hears a great deal but which seems to mean nothing but cleanliness Vivian Grey and Pelham are the models of their ambition and they succeed in being Pendennis They enjoy the reputation of being very clever and very talented fellows and smart chaps but they refrain from proving what is so generously conceded They are often men of a certain cultivation They have traveled many of them spending a year or two in Paris and a month or two in the rest of Europe Consequently they endure society at home with a smile and a shrug and a graceful superciliousness which is very engaging They are perfectly at home and they rather despise Young America which in the next room is diligently earning its invitation They prefer to hover about the ladies who did not come out this season but are a little used to the world with whom they are upon most friendly terms and they criticize together very freely all the great events in the great world of fashion These elegant Pendennises we saw at missus Potiphar s but not without a sadness which can hardly be explained They had been boys once all of them fresh and frank hearted and full of a noble ambition They had read and pondered the histories of great men how they resolved and struggled and achieved In the pure portraiture of genius they had loved and honored noble women and each young heart was sworn to truth and the service of beauty Those feelings were chivalric and fair Those boyish instincts clung to whatever was lovely and rejected the specious snare however graceful and elegant They sailed new knights upon that old and endless crusade against hypocrisy and the devil and they were lost in the luxury of Corinth nor longer seek the difficult shores beyond A present smile was worth a future laurel The ease of the moment was worth immortal tranquillity They renounced the stern worship of the unknown God and acknowledged the deities of Athens But the seal of their shame is their own smile at their early dreams and the high hopes of their boyhood their sneering infidelity of simplicity their skepticism of motives and of men Youths whose younger years were fervid with the resolution to strike and win to deserve at least a gentle remembrance if not a dazzling fame are content to eat and drink and sleep well to go to the opera and all the balls to be known as gentlemanly and aristocratic and dangerous and elegant to cherish a luxurious and enervating indolence and to succeed upon the cheap reputation of having been fast in Paris The end of such men is evident enough from the beginning They are snuffed out by a great match and become an appendage to a rich woman or they dwindle off into old roues men of the world in sad earnest and not with elegant affectation blase and as they began Arthur Pendennises so they end the Major But believe it that old fossil heart is wrung sometimes by a mortal pang as it remembers those squandered opportunities and that lost life From these groups we passed into the dancing room We have seen dancing in other countries and dressing We have certainly never seen gentlemen dance so easily gracefully and well as the American But the style of dancing in its whirl its rush its fury is only equaled by that of the masked balls at the French opera and the balls at the Salle Valentino the Jardin Mabille the Chateau Rouge and other favorite resorts of Parisian grisettes and lorettes We saw a few young men looking upon the dance very soberly and upon inquiry learned that they were engaged to certain ladies of the corps de ballet Nor did we wonder that the spectacle of a young woman whirling in a decollete state and in the embrace of a warm youth around a heated room induced a little sobriety upon her lover s face if not a sadness in his heart Amusement recreation enjoyment There are no more beautiful things But this proceeding falls under another head We watched the various toilettes of these bounding belles They were rich and tasteful But a man at our elbow of experience and shrewd observation said with a sneer for which we called him to account I observe that American ladies are so rich in charms that they are not at all chary of them It is certainly generous to us miserable black coats But do you know it strikes me as a generosity of display that must necessarily leave the donor poorer in maidenly feeling We thought ourselves cynical but this was intolerable and in a very crisp manner we demanded an apology Why responded our friend with more of sadness than of satire in his tone why are you so exasperated Look at this scene Consider that this is really the life of these girls This is what they come out for This is the end of their ambition They think of it dream of it long for it Is it amusement Yes to a few possibly But listen and gather if you can from their remarks when they make any that they have any thought beyond this and going to church very rigidly on Sunday The vigor of polkaing and church going are proportioned as is the one so is the other My young friend I am no ascetic and do not suppose a man is damned because he dances But life is not a ball more s the pity truly for these butterflies nor is its sole duty and delight dancing When I consider this spectacle when I remember what a noble and beautiful woman is what a manly man when I reel dazzled by this glare drunken by these perfumes confused by this alluring music and reflect upon the enormous sums wasted in a pompous profusion that delights no one when I look around upon all this rampant vulgarity in tinsel and Brussels lace and think how fortunes go how men struggle and lose the bloom of their honesty how women hide in a smiling pretense and eye with caustic glances their neighbor s newer house diamonds or porcelain and observe their daughters such as these why I tremble and tremble and this scene to night every crack ball this winter will be not the pleasant society of men and women but even in this young country an orgie such as rotting Corinth saw a frenzied festival of Rome in its decadence There was a sober truth in this bitterness and we turned away to escape the sombre thought of the moment Addressing one of the panting houris who stood melting in a window we spoke and confess how absurdly of the Duesseldorf Gallery It was merely to avoid saying how warm the room was and how pleasant the party was facts upon which we had already enlarged Yes they are pretty pictures but la how long it must have taken mister Duesseldorf to paint them all was the reply By the Farnesian Hercules no Roman sylph in her city s decline would ever have called the sun god mister Apollo We hope that houri melted entirely away in the window but we certainly did not stay to see Passing out toward the supper room we encountered two young men What Hal said one you at missus Potiphar s It seems that Hal was a sprig of one of the old families Well Joe said Hal a little confused it is a little strange The fact is I didn t mean to be here but I concluded to compromise by coming and not being introduced to the host Hal could come eat Potiphar s supper drink his wines spoil his carpets laugh at his fashionable struggles and affect the puppyism of a foreign lord because he disgraced the name of a man who had done some service somewhere while Potiphar was only an honest man who made a fortune The supper room was a pleasant place The table was covered with a chaos of supper Everything sweet and rare and hot and cold solid and liquid was there It was the very apotheosis of gilt gingerbread There was a universal rush and struggle The charge of the guards at Waterloo was nothing to it Jellies custard oyster soup ice cream wine and water gushed in profuse cascades over transparent precipices of tulle muslin gauze silk and satin Clumsy boys tumbled against costly dresses and smeared them with preserves when clean plates failed the contents of plates already used were quietly chucked under the table heel taps of champagne were poured into the oyster tureens or overflowed upon plates to clear the glasses wine of all kinds flowed in torrents particularly down the throats of very young men who evinced their manhood by becoming noisy troublesome and disgusting and were finally either led sick into the hat room or carried out of the way drunk The supper over the young people attended by their matrons descended to the dancing room for the German This is a dance commencing usually at midnight or a little after and continuing indefinitely toward daybreak The young people were attended by their matrons who were there to supervise the morals and manners of their charges To secure the performance of this duty the young people took good care to sit where the matrons could not see them nor did they by any chance look toward the quarter in which the matrons sat In that quarter through all the varying mazes of the prolonged dance to two o clock to three to four sat the bediamonded dowagers the mothers the matrons against nature against common sense They babbled with each other they drowsed they dozed Their fans fell listless into their laps In the adjoining room out of the waking sight even of the then sleeping mamas the daughters whirled in the close embrace of partners who had brought down bottles of champagne from the supper room and put them by the side of their chairs for occasional refreshment during the dance The dizzy hours staggered by Azalia you must come now had been already said a dozen times but only as by the scribes Finally it was declared with authority Azalia went Amelia Arabella The rest followed There was prolonged cloaking there were lingering farewells A few papas were in the supper room sitting among the debris of game A few young non dancing husbands sat beneath gas unnaturally bright reading whatever chance book was at hand and thinking of the young child at home waiting for mama who was dancing the German below A few exhausted matrons sat in the robing room tired sad wishing Jane would come up assailed at intervals by a vague suspicion that it was not quite worth while wondering how it was they used to have such good times at balls yawning and looking at their watches while the regular beat of the music below with sardonic sadness continued At last Jane came up had had the most glorious time and went down with mamma to the carriage and so drove home Even the last Jane went the last noisy youth was expelled and mister and missus Potiphar having duly performed their biennial social duty dismissed the music ordered the servants to count the spoons and an hour or two after daylight went to bed Enviable mister and missus Potiphar We are now prepared for the great moral indignation of the friend who saw us eating our dinde aux truffes in that remarkable supper room We are waiting to hear him say in the most moderate and gentlemanly manner that it is all very well to select flaws and present them as specimens and to learn from him possibly with indignant publicity that the present condition of parties is not what we have intimated Or in his quiet and pointed way he may smile at our fiery assault upon edged flounces and nuga pyramids and the kingdom of Lilliput in general Yet after all and despite the youths who are led out and carried home or who stumble through the German this is a sober matter My friend told us we should see the best society But he is a prodigious wag Who make this country From whom is its character of unparalleled enterprise heroism and success derived Who have given it its place in the respect and the fear of the world Who annually recruit its energies confirm its progress and secure its triumph Who are its characteristic children the pith the sinew the bone of its prosperity Who found and direct and continue its manifold institutions of mercy and education Who are essentially Americans Indignant friend these classes whoever they may be are the best society because they alone are the representatives of its character and cultivation They are the best society of New York of Boston of Baltimore of saint Louis of New Orleans whether they live upon six hundred or sixty thousand dollars a year whether they inhabit princely houses in fashionable streets which they often do or not whether their sons have graduated at Celarius s and the Jardin Mabille or have never been out of their father s shops whether they have air and style and are so gentlemanly and so aristocratic or not Your shoemaker your lawyer your butcher your clergyman if they are simple and steady and whether rich or poor are unseduced by the sirens of extravagance and ruinous display help make up the best society For that mystic communion is not composed of the rich but of the worthy and is best by its virtues and not by its vices When Johnson Burke Goldsmith Garrick Reynolds and their friends met at supper in Goldsmith s rooms where was the best society in England When George the Fourth outraged humanity in his treatment of Queen Caroline who was the first scoundrel in Europe Pause yet a moment indignant friend Whose habits and principles would ruin this country as rapidly as it has been made Who are enamored of a puerile imitation of foreign splendors Who strenuously endeavor to graft the questionable points of Parisian society upon our own Who pass a few years in Europe and return skeptical of republicanism and human improvement longing and sighing for more sharply emphasized social distinctions Who squander with profuse recklessness the hard earned fortunes of their sires Who diligently devote their time to nothing foolishly and wrongly supposing that a young English nobleman has nothing to do Who in fine evince by their collective conduct that they regard their Americanism as a misfortune and are so the most deadly enemies of their country None but what our wag facetiously termed the best society If the reader doubts let him consider its practical results in any great emporiums of best society Marriage is there regarded as a luxury too expensive for any but the sons of rich men or fortunate young men We once heard an eminent divine assert and only half in sport that the rate of living was advancing so incredibly that weddings in his experience were perceptibly diminishing The reasons might have been many and various But we all acknowledge the fact On the other hand and about the same time a lovely damsel ah Clorinda whose father was not wealthy who had no prospective means of support who could do nothing but polka to perfection who literally knew almost nothing and who constantly shocked every fairly intelligent person by the glaring ignorance betrayed in her remarks informed a friend at one of the Saratoga balls whither he had made haste to meet the best society that there were not more than three good matches in society La Dame aux Camelias Marie Duplessis was to our fancy a much more feminine and admirable and moral and human person than the adored Clorinda And yet what she said was the legitimate result of the state of our fashionable society It worships wealth and the pomp which wealth can purchase more than virtue genius or beauty We may be told that it has always been so in every country and that the fine society of all lands is as profuse and flashy as our own We deny it flatly Neither English nor French nor Italian nor German society is so unspeakably barren as that which is technically called society here In London and Paris and Vienna and Rome all the really eminent men and women help make up the mass of society A party is not a mere ball but it is a congress of the wit beauty and fame of the capital It is worth while to dress if you shall meet Macaulay or Hallam or Guizot or Thiers or Landseer or Delaroche missus Norton the Misses Berry Madame Recamier and all the brilliant women and famous foreigners But why should we desert the pleasant pages of those men and the recorded gossip of those women to be squeezed flat against a wall while young Doughface pours oyster gravy down our shirt front and Caroline Pettitoes wonders at mister Duesseldorf s industry If intelligent people decline to go you justly remark it is their own fault Yes but if they stay away it is very certainly their great gain The elderly people are always neglected with us and nothing surprises intelligent strangers more than the tyrannical supremacy of Young America But we are not surprised at this neglect How can we be if we have our eyes open When Caroline Pettitoes retreats from the floor to the sofa and instead of a polker figures at parties as a matron do you suppose that tough old Joes like ourselves are going to desert the young Caroline upon the floor for Madame Pettitoes upon the sofa If the pretty young Caroline with youth health freshness a fine budding form and wreathed in a semi transparent haze of flounced and flowered gauze is so vapid that we prefer to accost her with our eyes alone and not with our tongues is the same Caroline married into a Madame Pettitoes and fanning herself upon a sofa no longer particularly fresh nor young nor pretty and no longer budding but very fully blown likely to be fascinating in conversation We can not wonder that the whole connection of Pettitoes when advanced to the matron state is entirely neglected Proper homage to age we can all pay at home to our parents and grandparents Proper respect for some persons is best preserved by avoiding their neighborhood And what think you is the influence of this extravagant expense and senseless show upon these same young men and women We can easily discover It saps their noble ambition assails their health lowers their estimate of men and their reverence for women cherishes an eager and aimless rivalry weakens true feeling wipes away the bloom of true modesty and induces an ennui a satiety and a kind of dilettante misanthropy which is only the more monstrous because it is undoubtedly real You shall hear young men of intelligence and cultivation to whom the unprecedented circumstances of this country offer opportunities of a great and beneficent career complaining that they were born within this blighted circle regretting that they were not bakers and tallow chandlers and under no obligation to keep up appearances deliberately surrendering all the golden possibilities of that future which this country beyond all others holds before them sighing that they are not rich enough to marry the girls they love and bitterly upbraiding fortune that they are not millionaires suffering the vigor of their years to exhale in idle wishes and pointless regrets disgracing their manhood by lying in wait behind their so gentlemanly and aristocratic manners until they can pounce upon a fortune and ensnare an heiress into matrimony and so having dragged their gifts their horses of the sun into a service which shames all their native pride and power they sink in the mire and their peers and emulators exclaim that they have made a good thing of it Are these the processes by which a noble race is made and perpetuated At missus Potiphar s we heard several Pendennises longing for a similar luxury and announcing their firm purpose never to have wives nor houses until they could have them as splendid as jewelled missus Potiphar and her palace thirty feet front Where were their heads and their hearts and their arms How looks this craven despondency before the stern virtues of the ages we call dark When a man is so voluntarily imbecile as to regret he is not rich if that is what he wants before he has struck a blow for wealth or so dastardly as to renounce the prospect of love because sitting sighing in velvet dressing gown and slippers he does not see his way clear to ten thousand a year when young women coiffed a merveille of unexceptionable style who with or without a prospective penny secretly look down upon honest women who struggle for a livelihood like noble and Christian beings and as such are rewarded in whose society a man must forget that he has ever read thought or felt who destroy in the mind the fair ideal of woman which the genius of art and poetry and love their inspirer has created then it seems to us it is high time that the subject should be regarded not as a matter of breaking butterflies upon the wheel but as a sad and sober question in whose solution all fathers and mothers and the state itself are interested When keen observers and men of the world from Europe are amazed and appalled at the giddy whirl and frenzied rush of our society a society singular in history for the exaggerated prominence it assigns to wealth irrespective of the talents that amassed it they and their possessor being usually hustled out of sight is it not quite time to ponder a little upon the Court of Louis XIV and the merrie days of King Charles II Is it not clear that if what our good wag with caustic irony called best society were really such every thoughtful man would read upon missus Potiphar s softly tinted walls the terrible mene mene of an imminent destruction Venice in her purple prime of luxury when the famous law was passed making all gondolas black that the nobles should not squander fortunes upon them was not more luxurious than New York to day Our hotels have a superficial splendor derived from a profusion of gilt and paint wood and damask Yet in not one of them can the traveler be so quietly comfortable as in an English inn and nowhere in New York can the stranger procure a dinner at once so neat and elegant and economical as at scores of cafes in Paris The fever of display has consumed comfort A gondola plated with gold was no easier than a black wooden one We could well spare a little gilt upon the walls for more cleanliness upon the public table nor is it worth while to cover the walls with mirrors to reflect a want of comfort One prefers a wooden bench to a greasy velvet cushion and a sanded floor to a soiled and threadbare carpet An insipid uniformity is the Procrustes bed upon which society is stretched Every new house is the counterpart of every other with the exception of more gilt if the owner can afford it The interior arrangement instead of being characteristic instead of revealing something of the tastes and feelings of the owner is rigorously conformed to every other interior The same hollow and tame complaisance rules in the intercourse of society Who dares say precisely what he thinks upon a great topic What youth ventures to say sharp things of slavery for instance at a polite dinner table What girl dares wear curls when Martelle prescribes puffs or bandeaux What specimen of Young America dares have his trousers loose or wear straps to them We want individuality heroism and if necessary an uncompromising persistence in difference This is the present state of parties They are wildly extravagant full of senseless display they are avoided by the pleasant and intelligent and swarm with reckless regiments of Brown s men The ends of the earth contribute their choicest products to the supper and there is everything that wealth can purchase and all the spacious splendor that thirty feet front can afford They are hot and crowded and glaring There is a little weak scandal venomous not witty and a stream of weary platitude mortifying to every sensible person Will any of our Pendennis friends intermit their indignation for a moment and consider how many good things they have said or heard during the season If mister Potiphar s eyes should chance to fall here will he reckon the amount of satisfaction and enjoyment he derived from missus Potiphar s ball and will that lady candidly confess what she gained from it beside weariness and disgust What eloquent sermons we remember to have heard in which the sins and the sinners of Babylon Jericho and Gomorrah were scathed with holy indignation The cloth is very hard upon Cain and completely routs the erring kings of Judah The Spanish Inquisition too gets frightful knocks and there is much eloquent exhortation to preach the gospel in the interior of Siam Let it be preached there and God speed the Word But also let us have a text or two in Broadway and the Avenue The best sermon ever preached upon society within our knowledge is Vanity Fair Is the spirit of that story less true of New York than of London Probably we never see Amelia at our parties nor Lieutenant George Osborne nor good gawky Dobbin nor missus Rebecca Sharp Crawley nor old Steyne We are very much pained of course that any author should take such dreary views of human nature We for our parts all go to missus Potiphar s to refresh our faith in men and women Generosity amiability a catholic charity simplicity taste sense high cultivation and intelligence distinguish our parties The statesman seeks their stimulating influence the literary man after the day s labor desires the repose of their elegant conversation the professional man and the merchant hurry up from down town to shuffle off the coil of heavy duty and forget the drudgery of life in the agreeable picture of its amenities and graces presented by missus Potiphar s ball Is this account of the matter or Vanity Fair the satire What are the prospects of any society of which that tale is the true history There is a picture in the Luxembourg gallery at Paris The Decadence of the Romans which made the fame and fortune of Couture the painter It represents an orgie in the court of a temple during the last days of Rome A swarm of revellers occupy the middle of the picture wreathed in elaborate intricacy of luxurious posture men and women intermingled their faces in which the old Roman fire scarcely flickers brutalized with excess of every kind their heads of dishevelled hair bound with coronals of leaves while from goblets of an antique grace they drain the fiery torrent which is destroying them Around the bacchanalian feast stand lofty upon pedestals the statues of old Rome looking with marble calmness and the severity of a rebuke beyond words upon the revellers A youth of boyish grace with a wreath woven in his tangled hair and with red and drowsy eyes sits listless upon one pedestal while upon another stands a boy insane with drunkenness and proffering a dripping goblet to the marble mouth of the statue In the corner of the picture as if just quitting the court Rome finally departing is a group of Romans with care worn brows and hands raised to their faces in melancholy meditation In the foreground of the picture which is painted with all the sumptuous splendor of Venetian art is a stately vase around which hangs a festoon of gorgeous flowers its end dragging upon the pavement In the background between the columns smiles the blue sky of Italy the only thing Italian not deteriorated by time The careful student of this picture if he have been long in Paris is some day startled by detecting especially in the faces of the women represented a surprising likeness to the women of Paris and perceives with a thrill of dismay that the models for this picture of decadent human nature are furnished by the very city in which he lives THE TWO FARMERS BY CAROLYN WELLS Once on a Time there were Two Farmers who wished to Sell their Farms To One came a Buyer who offered a Fair Price but the Farmer refused to Sell saying he had heard rumors of a Railroad which was to be Built in his Vicinity and he hoped The Corporation would buy his Farm at a Large Figure The Buyer therefore went Away and as the Railroad never Materialized the Farmer Sorely Regretted that he lost a Good Chance The Other Farmer Sold his Farm to the First Customer who came Along although he Received but a Small Price for it Soon Afterward a Railroad was Built right through the Same Farm and The Railroad Company paid an Enormous Sum for the Land MORALS This Fable teaches that a Bird In The Hand is worth Two In The Bush and The Patient Waiter Is No Loser SAMUEL BROWN BY PHOEBE CARY It was many and many a year ago In a dwelling down in town That a fellow there lived whom you may know By the name of Samuel Brown And this fellow he lived with no other thought Than to our house to come down I was a child and he was a child In that dwelling down in town But we loved with a love that was more than love I and my Samuel Brown With a love that the ladies coveted Me and Samuel Brown And this was the reason that long ago To that dwelling down in town A girl came out of her carriage courting My beautiful Samuel Brown So that her high bred kinsmen came And bore away Samuel Brown And shut him up in a dwelling house In a street quite up in town The ladies not half so happy up there Went envying me and Brown Yes that was the reason as all men know In this dwelling down in town That the girl came out of the carriage by night Coquetting and getting my Samuel Brown But our love is more artful by far than the love If those who are older than we Of many far wiser than we And neither the girls that are living above Nor the girls that are down in town Can ever dissever my soul from the soul Of the beautiful Samuel Brown For the morn never shines without bringing me lines From my beautiful Samuel Brown And the night s never dark but I sit in the park With my beautiful Samuel Brown And often by day I walk down in Broadway With my darling my darling my life and my stay To our dwelling down in town To our house in the street down town

SCHOOL BY SARAH P McLEAN GREENE Sunday morning nothing arose in Wallencamp save the sun At least that celestial orb had long forgotten all the roseate flaming of his youth in an honest straightforward march through the heavens ere the first signs of smoke came curling lazily up from the Wallencamp chimneys I had retired at night very weary with the delicious consciousness that it wouldn t make any difference when I woke up the next morning or whether indeed I woke at all So I opened my eyes leisurely and lay half dreaming half meditating on a variety of things I deciphered a few of the texts on the scriptural patchwork quilt which covered my couch There were Let not your heart be troubled Remember Lot s wife and Philander Keeler traced in inky hieroglyphics all in close conjunction Finally I reached out for my watch and having ascertained the time of day I got up and proceeded to dress hastily enough wondering to hear no signs of life in the house I went noiselessly down the stairs All was silent below except for the peaceful snoring of missus Philander and the little Keelers which was responded to from some remote western corner of the Ark by the triumphant snores of Grandma and Grandpa Keeler I attempted to kindle a fire in the stove but it sizzled a little while spitefully as much as to say What Sunday morning Not I and went out So I concluded to put on some wraps and go out and warm myself in the sun I climbed the long hill back of the Ark descended and walked along the bank of the river It was a beautiful morning The air was everything that could be desired in the way of air but I felt a desperate need of something more substantial Standing alone with nature on the bank of the lovely river I thought with tears in my eyes of the delicious breakfast already recuperating the exhausted energies of my far away home friends When I got back to the house missus Philander in simple and unaffected attire was bustling busily about the stove The snores from Grandma and Grandpa s quarter had ceased signifying that they also had advanced a stage in the grand processes of Sunday morning The children came teasing me to dress them so I fastened for them a variety of small articles which I flattered myself on having combined in a very ingenious and artistic manner though I believe those infant Keelers went weeping to Grandma afterward and were remodeled by her all comforting hand with much skill and patience In the midst of her preparations for breakfast Madeline abruptly assumed her hat and shawl and was seen from the window walking leisurely across the fields in the direction of the woods She returned in due time bearing an armful of fresh evergreens which she twisted around the family register When the ancient couple made their appearance I remarked silently in regard to Grandma Keeler s hair what proved afterward to be its usual holiday morning arrangement It was confined in six infinitesimal braids which appeared to be sprouting out perpendicularly in all directions from her head The effect of redundancy and expansiveness thus heightened and increased on Grandma s features was striking in the extreme While we were eating breakfast that good soul observed to Grandpa Keeler Wall pa I suppose you ll be all ready when the time comes to take teacher and me over to West Wallen to Sunday school won t ye Grandpa coughed and coughed again and raised his eyes helplessly to the window Looks some like showers said he A hem a hem Looks mightily to me like showers over yonder Thar r aly husband I must say I feel mortified for ye said Grandma Seein as you re a perfessor too and thar ain t been a single Sunday mornin since I ve lived with ye pa summer or winter but what you ve seen showers and it r aly seems to me it s dreadful inconsistent when thar ain t no cloud in the sky and don t look no more like rain than I do And Grandma s face in spite of her reproachful tones was above all blandly sunlike and expressive of anything rather than deluge and watery disaster Grandpa was silent a little while then coughed again I had never seen Grandpa in worse straits A hem a hem Fanny seems to be a little lame this mornin said he I shouldn t wonder She s been goin pretty stiddy this week It does beat all pa continued Grandma Keeler how t all the horses you ve ever had since I ve known ye have always been took lame Sunday mornin Thar was Happy Jack he could go anywhers through the week and never limp a step as nobody could see and Sunday mornin he was always took lame And thar was Tantrum Tantrum was the horse that had run away with Grandma when she was thrown from the wagon and generally smashed to pieces And now Grandma branched off into the thrilling reminiscences connected with this incident of her life which was the third time during the week that the horrible tale had been repeated for my delectation When she had finished Grandpa shook his head with painful earnestness reverting to the former subject of discussion It s a long jaunt said he a long jaunt Thar s a long hill to climb before we reach Zion s mount said Grandma Keeler impressively Wall there s a darned sight harder one on the road to West Wallen burst out the old sea captain desperately say nothin about the devilish stones Thar now said Grandma with calm though awful reproof I think we ve gone fur enough for one day we ve broke the Sabbath and took the name of the Lord in vain and that ought to be enough for perfessors Grandpa replied at length in a greatly subdued tone Wall if you and the teacher want to go over to Sunday school to day I suppose we can go if we get ready a long submissive sigh I suppose we can They have preachin service in the mornin I suppose said Grandma But we don t generally git along to that It makes such an early start We generally try to get around when we go in time for Sunday school They have singin and all It s just about as interestin I think as preachin The old man r aly likes it she observed aside to me when he once gets started but he kind o dreads the gittin started When I beheld the ordeal through which Grandpa Keeler was called to pass at the hands of his faithful consort before he was considered in a fit condition of mind and body to embark for the sanctuary I marveled not at the old man s reluctance nor that he had indeed seen clouds and tempest fringing the horizon Immediately after breakfast he set out for the barn ostensibly to see to the chores really I believe to obtain a few moments respite before worse evil should come upon him Pretty soon Grandma was at the back door calling in firm though persuasive tones Husband husband come in now and get ready No answer Then it was in another key weighty yet expressive of no weak irritation that Grandma called Come pa pa a pa a a Still no answer Then that voice of Grandma s sung out like a trumpet terrible with meaning Bijonah Keeler But Grandpa appeared not Next I saw Grandma slowly but surely gravitating in the direction of the barn and soon she returned bringing with her that ancient delinquent who looked like a lost sheep indeed and a truly unreconciled one Now the first thing said Grandma looking her forlorn captive over is boots Go and get on yer meetin gaiters pa The old gentleman having dutifully invested himself with those sacred relics came pathetically limping into the room I declare ma said he somehow these things phew Somehow they pinch my feet dreadfully I don t know what it is phew They re dreadful oncomf table things somehow Since I ve known ye pa solemnly ejaculated Grandma Keeler you ve never had a pair o meetin boots that set easy on yer feet You d ought to get boots big enough for ye pa she continued looking down disapprovingly on the old gentleman s pedal extremities which resembled two small scows at anchor in black cloth encasements and not be so proud as to go to pinchin yer feet into gaiters a number o sizes too small for ye They re number tens I tell ye roared Grandpa nettled outrageously by this cutting taunt Wall thar now pa said Grandma soothingly if I had sech feet as that I wouldn t go to spreadin it all over town if I was you but it s time we stopped bickerin now husband and got ready for meetin so set down and let me wash yer head I ve washed once this mornin It s clean enough Grandpa protested but in vain He was planted in a chair and Grandma Keeler with rag and soap and a basin of water attacked the old gentleman vigorously much as I have seen cruel mothers wash the faces of their earth begrimed infants He only gave expression to such groans as Thar ma don t tear my ears to pieces Come ma you ve got my eyes so full o soap now ma that I can t see nothin Phew Lordy ain t ye most through with this ma Then came the dyeing process which Grandma Keeler assured me aside made Grandpa look like a man o thirty but to me after it he looked neither old nor young human nor inhuman nor like anything that I had ever seen before under the sun There s the lotion the potion the dye er and the setter said Grandma pointing to four bottles on the table Now whar s the directions Madeline These having been produced from between the leaves of the family Bible Madeline read while Grandma made a vigorous practical application of the various mixtures This admirable lotion in soft ecstatic tones Madeline rehearsed the flowery language of the recipe though not so instantaneously startling in its effect as our inestimable dyer and setter yet forms a most essential part of the whole process opening as it does the dry and lifeless pores of the scalp imparting to them new life and beauty and rendering them more easily susceptible to the applications which follow But we must go deeper than this a tone must be given to the whole system by means of the cleansing and rejuvenating of the very centre of our beings and for this purpose we have prepared our wonderful potion Here Grandpa with a wry face was made to swallow a spoonful of the mixture Our unparalleled dyer Madeline continued restores black hair to a more than original gloss and brilliancy and gives to the faded golden tress the sunny flashes of youth Grandpa was dyed Our world renowned setter completes and perfects the whole process by adding tone and permanency to the efficacious qualities of the lotion potion and dyer et cetera while on Grandpa s head the unutterable dye was set Now read teacher some of the testimonials daughter said Grandma Keeler whose face was one broad generous illustration of that rare and peculiar virtue called faith So Madeline continued missus Hiram Briggs of North Dedham writes I was terribly afflicted with baldness so that for months I was little more than an outcast from society and an object of pity to my most familiar friends I tried every remedy in vain At length I heard of your wonderful restorative After a week s application my hair had already begun to grow in what seemed the most miraculous manner At the end of ten months it had assumed such length and proportions as to be a most luxurious burden and where I had before been regarded with pity and aversion I became the envied and admired of all beholders Just think said Grandma Keeler with rapturous sympathy and gratitude how that poor creetur must a felt Orion Spaulding of Weedsville Vermont Madeline went on but here I had to beg to be excused and went to my room to get ready for the Sunday school When I came down again Grandpa Keeler was seated completely arrayed in his best clothes opposite Grandma who held the big family Bible in her lap and a Sunday school question book in one hand Now pa said she what tribe was it in sacred writ that wore bunnits I was compelled to infer from the tone of Grandpa Keeler s answer that his temper had not undergone a mollifying process during my absence Come ma said he how much longer ye goin to pester me in this way Why pa Grandma rejoined calmly until you git a proper understandin of it What tribe was it in sacred writ that wore bunnits Lordy exclaimed the old man How d ye suppose I know They must a been a tarnal old womanish lookin set anyway The tribe o Judah pa said Grandma gravely Now how good it is husband to have your understandin all freshened up on the scripters Come come ma said Grandpa rising nervously It s time we was startin When I make up my mind to go anywhere I always want to git there in time If I was goin to the Old Harry I should want to git there in time It s my consarn that we shall git thar before time some on us said Grandma with sad meaning unless we larn to use more respec ful language I shall never forget how we set off for church that Sabbath morning way out at one of the sunny back doors of the Ark for there was Madeline s little cottage that fronted the highway or lane and then there was a long backward extension of the Ark only one story in height This belonged peculiarly to Grandma and Grandpa Keeler It contained the parlor and three keepin rooms opening one into the other all of the same size and general bare and gloomy appearance all possessing the same sacredly preserved atmosphere through which we passed with becoming silence and solemnity into the end room the sunny kitchen where Grandma and Grandpa kept house by themselves in the summer time and there at the door her very yellow coat reflecting the rays of the sun stood Fanny presenting about as much appearance of life and animation as a pensive summer squash The carriage I thought was a fac simile of the one in which I had been brought from West Wallen on the night of my arrival One of the most striking peculiarities of this sort of vehicle was the width at which the wheels were set apart The body seemed comparatively narrow It was very long and covered with white canvas It had neither windows nor doors but just the one guarded opening in front There were no steps leading to this and indeed a variety of obstacles before it And the way Grandma effected an entrance was to put a chair on a mound of earth and a cricket on top of the chair and thus having climbed up to Fanny s reposeful back she slipped passively down feet foremost to the whiffle tree from thence she easily gained the plane of the carriage floor Grandpa and I took a less circuitous though perhaps not less difficult route I sat with Grandpa on the front seat it may be remarked that the front seat was very much front and the back seat very much back there was a kind of wooden shelf built outside as a resting place for the feet so that while our heads were under cover our feet were out utterly exposed to the weather and we must either lay them on the shelf or let them hang off into space Madeline and the children stood at the door to see us off All aboard ship ballasted wind fa r go ahead thar Fanny shouted Grandpa who seemed quite restored in spirits and held the reins and wielded the whip with a masterful air He spun sea yarns too all the way marvelous ones and Grandma s reproving voice was mellowed by the distance and so confusedly mingled with the rumbling of the wheels that it seemed hardly to reach him at all Not that Grandma looked discomfited on this account or in bad humor On the contrary as she sat back there in the ghostly shadows with her hands folded and her hair combed out in resplendent waves on either side of her head she appeared conscious that every word she uttered was taking root in some obdurate heart She was in every respect the picture of good will and contentment But the face under Grandpa s antiquated beaver began to give me a fresh shock every time I looked up at him for the light and the air were rapidly turning his rejuvenated locks and his poor thin fringe of whiskers to an unnatural greenish tint while his bushy eyebrows untouched by the hand of art shone as white as ever In spite of the old sea captain s entertaining stories it seemed indeed a long jaunt to West Wallen To say that Fanny was a slow horse would be but a feeble expression of the truth A persevering click click click began to arise from Grandma s quarter This annoyed Grandpa exceedingly Shet up ma he was moved to exclaim at last I m steerin this craft Click click click came perseveringly from behind Dum it ma thar ma cried Grandpa exasperated beyond measure How is this hoss goin to hear anything that I say ef you keep up such a tarnal cacklin Just as we were coming out of the thickest part of the woods about a mile beyond Wallencamp we discovered a man walking in the distance It was the only human being we had seen since we started Hullo there s Lovell exclaimed Grandpa I was wonderin why we hadn t overtook him before We gin ally take him in on the road Yis yis that s Lovell ain t it teacher I put up my glasses helplessly I m sure I said I can t tell positively I have seen mister Barlow but once and at that distance I shouldn t know my own father Must be Lovell said Grandpa Yis I know him Hullo thar Ship ahoy ship ahoy Grandpa s voice suggested something of the fire and vigor it must have had when it rang out across the foam of waves and pierced the tempest s roar The man turned and looked at us and then went on again He don t seem to recognize us said Grandma Ship a hoy Ship a hoy shouted Grandpa The man turned and looked at us again and this time he stopped and kept on looking When we got up to him we saw that it wasn t Lovell Barlow at all but a stranger of trampish appearance drunk and fiery and fixed in an aggressive attitude I was naturally terrified What if he should attack us in that lonely spot Grandpa was so old And moreover Grandpa was so taken aback to find that it wasn t Lovell that he began some blunt and stammering expression of surprise which only served to increase the stranger s ire Grandma imperturbable soul who never failed to come to the rescue even in the most desperate emergencies Grandma climbed over to the front thrust out her benign head and said in that deep calm voice of hers We re a goin to the house of God brother won t you git in and go too No our brother replied doubling up his fists and shaking them menacingly in our faces I won t go to no house o God What d ye mean by overhauling me on the road and askin me to git into yer d d old traveling lunatic asylum Drive on pa said Grandma coldly He ain t in no condition to be labored with now Drive on kind o quick Kind o quick we could not go but Fanny was made to do her best and we did not pause to look behind When we got to the church Sunday school had already begun There was Lovell Barlow looking preternaturally stiff in his best clothes sitting with a class of young men He saw us when we came in and gave me a look of deep meaning It was the same expression as though there was some solemn mutual understanding between us which he had worn on that night when he gave me his picture There s plenty of young folks classes said Grandma but seein as we re late maybe you d jest as soon go right along in with us I said that I should like that best so I went into the old folks class with Grandma and Grandpa Keeler There were three pews of old people in front of us and the teacher who certainly seemed to me the oldest person I had ever seen sat in an otherwise vacant pew in front of all so that his voice being very thin and querulous we could hear very little that he said although we were edified in some faint sense by his pious manner of shaking his head and rolling his eyes toward the ceiling The church was a square wooden edifice of medium size and contained three stoves all burning brightly Against this and the drowsy effect of their long drive in the sun and wind my two companions proved powerless to struggle Grandpa looked furtively up at Grandma then endeavored to put on as a sort of apology for what he felt was inevitably coming a sanctimonious expression which was most unnatural to him and which soon faded away as the sweet unconsciousness of slumber overspread his features His head fell back helplessly his mouth opened wide He snored but not very loudly I looked at Grandma wondering why her vigilance had failed on this occasion and lo her head was falling peacefully from side to side She was fast asleep too She woke up first however and then Grandpa was speedily and adroitly aroused by some means I think it was a pin and Grandma fed him with bits of unsweetened flag root which he munched penitently though evidently without relish until he dropped off to sleep again and she dropped off to sleep again and so they continued But it always happened that Grandma woke up first And whereas Grandpa when the avenging pin pierced his shins recovered himself with a start and an air of guilty confusion Grandma opened her eyes at regular intervals with the utmost calm and placidity as though she had merely been closing them to engage in a few moments of silent prayer VIVE LA BAGATELLE BY GELETT BURGESS Sing a song of foolishness

my fingers wandered wildly Over the consonant keys I know not what I was writing With that thing so like a pen But I struck one word astounding Unknown to the speech of men It flooded the sense of my verses Like the break of a tinker s dam And I felt as one feels when the printer Of your infinite calm makes clam It mixed up s s and x s Like an alphabet coming to strife It seemed the discordant echo Of a row between husband and wife It brought a perplexed meaning Into my perfect piece And set the machinery creaking As though it were scant of grease I have tried but I try it vainly The one last word to divine Which came from the keys of my typewriter And so would pass as mine It may be some other typewriter Will produce that word again It may be but only for others I shall write henceforth with a pen THE DUTCHMAN WHO HAD THE SMALL POX BY HENRY P LELAND Very dry indeed is the drive from Blackberry to Squash Point dry even for New Jersey and when you remember that it s fifty miles between the two towns its division into five drinks seems very natural When you are packed three on one narrow seat in a Jersey stage it is necessary A Jersey stage It is not on record but when Dante winds up his Tenth Canter into the Inferno with Each as his back was laden came indeed Or more or less contracted and it seemed As he who showed most patience in his look Wailing exclaimed I can endure no more the conclusion that he alluded to a crowded Jersey stage load is irresistible A man with long legs on a back seat in one of these vehicles suffers like a snipe shut up in a snuff box For this reason the long legged man should sit on the front seat with the driver there like the hen turkey who tried to sit on a hundred eggs he can spread himself The writer sat alongside the driver one morning just at break of day as the stage drove out of Blackberry he was a through passenger to Squash Point It was a very cold morning In order to break the ice for a conversation he praised the fine points of an off horse The driver thawed Ya as she s a goot hoss und I knows how to trive him It was evidently a case of mixed breed Where is Wood who used to drive this stage He be s lait up mit ter rummatiz sence yesterweek und I trives for him So I went on reading a newspaper a fellow passenger on a back seat not having the fear of murdered English on his hands coaxed the Dutch driver into a long conversation much to the delight of a very pretty Jersey blue belle who laughed so merrily that it was contagious and in a few minutes from being like unto a conventicle we were all as wide awake as one of Christy s audiences By sunrise we were in excellent spirits up to all sorts of fun and when a little later on our stage stopped at the first watering place the driver found himself the center of a group of treaters to the distilled juice of apples It is just as easy to say apple jack and be done with it but the writer being very anxious to form a style cribs from all quarters The so oft repeated expression juice of the grape has been for a long time on his hands and wishing to work it up he would have done it in this case only he fears the skepticism of his readers By courtesy they may wink at the poetical license of a reporter of a public dinner who calls turnip juice and painted whisky juice of the grape but they would not allow the existence for one minute of such application to the liquors of a Jersey tavern It s out of place Here s a package to leave at mister Scudder s the third house on the left hand side after you get into Jericho What do you charge asked a man who seemed to know the driver Pout a leffy answered he Receiving the silver he gathered up the reins and put the square package in the stage box Just as he started the horses he leaned his head out of the stage and looking back to the man who gave him the package shouted out the question Ter fird haus on ter lef hant out of Yeriko The man didn t hear him but the driver was satisfied On we went at a pretty good rate considering how heavy the roads were Another tavern more watering more apple jack Another long stretch of sand and we were coming into Jericho Anypotty know ter Miss Scutter haus asked the driver bracing his feet on the mail bag which lay in front of him and screwing his head round so as to face in There seemed to be a consultation going on inside the stage I don t know nobody o that name in Jericho Do you Lishe asked a weather beaten looking man who evidently went by water of another one who apparently went the same way There wos ole Square Gow s da ter she marri d a Scudder moved up here some two years back Come to think on t guess she lives nigher to Glass house answered Lishe The driver finding he could get no light out of the passengers seeing a tall raw boned woman washing some clothes in front of a house and who flew out of sight as the stage flew in handed me the reins as he jumped from his seat and chased the fugitive hallooing I fe got der small pox I fe got der Here his voice was lost as he dashed into the open door of the house But in a minute he reappeared followed by a broom with an enraged woman annexed and a loud voice shouting out You git out of this Clear yourself quicker I ain t goin to have you diseasin honest folks ef you have got the smallpox I dells you I fe got der small pox Ton t you versteh der SMALL POX This time he shouted it out in capital letters Clear out I ll call the men folks ef you don t clear and at once she shouted in a tip top voice Ike you Ike where air you Ike made his appearance on the full run W w what s the matter mother Miss Scudder his mother I should have been shocked as I was on my first visit to New Jersey if I had not had a key to this That is a very pretty girl I said on that occasion to a Jersey man who is she She s old Miss Perrine s da ter was the reply I looked at the innocent victim of man s criminal conduct with commiseration What a pity I remarked Not such a very great pity said Jersey eying me very severely I reckon old man Perrine s got as big a cedar swamp as you or I either would like to own Her grandfather you speak of No I don t I m talking bout her father he that married Abe Simm s da ter and got a power of land by it and that gal their da ter one of these days will step right into them swamps Oh I replied Mrs Perrine s daughter accenting the Missis Mussus or Miss it s all the same in Jersey he answered Knowing this Ike s appeal was intelligible To proceed with our story the driver very angry by this time shouted I dells you oonst more for der last dime I fe got der small pox unt Mishter Ellis he gifs me a leffy to gif der small pox to Miss Scutter unt if dat vrow is Miss Scutter I bromised to gif her ter small pox It was Miss Scudder and I explained to her that it was a small box he had for her The affair was soon settled as regarded its delivery but not as regards the laughter and shouts of the occupants of the old stage coach as we rolled away from Jericho The driver joined in although he had no earthly idea as to its cause and added not a little to it by saying in a triumphant tone of voice I vos pound to gif ter olt voomans ter small pox WALK BY WILLIAM DEVERE Up the dusty road from Denver town To where the mines their treasures hide The road is long and many miles The golden styre and town divide Along this road one summer s day There toiled a tired man Begrimed with dust the weary way He cussed as some folks can The stranger hailed a passing team That slowly dragged its load along His hail roused up the teamster old And checked his merry song Say y stranger Wal whoap Ken I walk behind your load A spell in this road Wal no yer can t walk but git Up on this seat an ride git up hyer Nop that ain t what I want Fur it s in yer dust that s like a smudge I want to trudge for I desarve it Wal pards I ain t no hog an I don t Own this road afore nor hind So jest git right in the dust An walk if that s the way yer clined Gee up ger lang the driver said The creaking wagon moved amain While close behind the stranger trudged And clouds of dust rose up again The teamster heard the stranger talk As if two trudged behind his van Yet looking round could only spy A single lonely man Yet heard the teamster words like these Come from the dust as from a cloud For the weary traveler spoke his mind His thoughts he uttered loud And this the burden of his talk Walk now you walk Not the way you went to Denver Walk Jest walk Went up in the mines an made yer stake Nuff to take yer back to ther state Whar yer wur born Whar n hell s yer corn Wal walk you walk Dust in yer eyes dust in yer nose Dust down yer throat and thick On yer clothes Can t hardly talk I know it but walk you walk What did yer do with all yer tin Ya s blew every cent of it in Got drunk got sober got drunk agin Wal walk Jest walk What did yer do What didn t yer do Why when ye war thar yer gold dust flew Yer thought it fine to keep op nin wine Now walk you walk Stop to drink What water Why thar Water with you warn t anywhere Twas wine Extra Dry Oh You flew high Now walk you walk Chokes yer this dust Wal that Ain t the wust When yer get back whar the Diggins are No pick no shovel no pan Wal yer a healthy man Walk jest walk The fools don t all go to Denver town Nor do they all from the mines come down Most all of us have in our day In some sort of shape some kind of way Painted the town with the old stuff Dipped in stocks or made some bluff Mixed wines old and new Got caught in wedlock by a shrew Stayed out all night tight Rolled home in the morning light With crumpled tie and torn clawhammer N woke up next day with a katzenjammer And walked oh how we walked Now don t try to yank every bun Don t try to have all the fun Don t think

I Say will she treat me white or throw me down Give me the glassy glare or welcome hand Shovel me dirt or treat me on the grand Knife me or make me think I own the town Will she be on the level do me brown Or will she jolt me lightly on the sand Leaving poor Willie froze to beat the band Limp as your grandma s Mother Hubbard gown I do not know nor do I give a whoop But this I know if she is so inclined She can come play with me on our back stoop Even in office hours I do not mind In fact I know I m nice and good and ready To get an option on her as my steady VIII I sometimes think that I am not so good That there are foxier warmer babes than I That Fate has given me the calm go by And my long suit is sawing mother s wood Then would I duck from under if I could Catch the hog special on the jump and fly To some Goat Island planned by destiny For dubs and has beens and that solemn brood But spite of bug wheels in my cocoa tree The trade in lager beer is still a humming A schooner can be purchased for a V Or even grafted if you re fierce at bumming My finish then less clearly do I see For lo I have another think a coming IX Last night I tumbled off the water cart It was a peacherino of a drunk I put the cocktail market on the punk And tore up all the sidewalks from the start The package that I carried was a tart That beat Vesuvius out for sizz and spunk And when they put me in my little bunk You couldn t tell my jag and me apart Oh would I were the ice man for a space Then might I cool this red hot cocoanut Corral the jim jam bugs that madly race Around the eaves that from my forehead jut Or will a carpenter please come instead And build a picket fence around my head XII Life is a combination hard to buck A proposition difficult to beat E en though you get there Zaza with both feet In forty flickers it s the same hard luck And you are up against it nip and tuck Shanghaied without a steady place to eat Guyed by the very copper on your beat Who lays to jug you when you run amuck O Life you give Yours Truly quite a pain On the T square I do not like your style For you are playing favorites again And you have got me handicapped a mile Avaunt false Life with all your pride and pelf Go take a running jump and chase yourself XIV O mommer wasn t Mame a looty toot Last night when at the Rainbow Social Club She did the bunny hug with every scrub From Hogan s Alley to the Dutchman s Boot While little Willie like a plug eared mute Papered the wall and helped absorb the grub Played nest egg with the benches like a dub When hot society was easy fruit Am I a turnip On the strict Q T Why do my Trilbys get so ossified Why am I minus when it s up to me To brace my Paris Pansy for a glide Once more my hoodoo s thrown the game and scored A flock of zeros on my tally board XXI At noon to day Murphy and Mame were tied A gospel huckster did the referee And all the Drug Clerks Union loped to see The queen of Minnie Street become a bride And that bad actor Murphy by her side Standing where Yours Despondent ought to be I went to hang a smile in front of me But weeps were in my glimmers when I tried The pastor murmured Two and two make one And slipped a sixteen K on Mamie s grab And when the game was tied and all was done The guests shied footwear at the bridal cab And Murphy s little gilt roofed brother Jim Snickered She s left her happy home for him HOW RUBY PLAYED BY GEORGE W BAGBY Jud Brownin when visiting New York goes to hear Rubinstein and gives the following description of his playing Well sir he had the blamedest biggest catty cornerdest pianner you ever laid eyes on somethin like a distracted billiard table on three legs The lid was hoisted and mighty well it was If it hadn t been he d a tore the entire inside clean out and shattered em to the four winds of heaven Played well You bet he did but don t interrupt me When he first sit down he peared to keer mighty little bout playin and wisht he hadn t come He tweedle leedled a little on a treble and twoodle oodled some on the base just foolin and boxin the thing s jaws for bein in his way And I says to a man sittin next to me says I What sort of fool playin is that And he says Heish But presently his hands commenced chasin one another up and down the keys like a passel of rats scamperin through a garret very swift Parts of it was sweet though and reminded me of a sugar squirrel turnin the wheel of a candy cage Now I says to my neighbor he s showin off He thinks he s a doin of it but he ain t got no idee no plan of nothin If he d play me a tune of some kind or other I d But my neighbor says Heish very impatient I was just about to git up and go home bein tired of that foolishness when I heard a little bird waking up away off in the woods and call sleepy like to his mate and I looked up and see that Rubin was beginning to take some interest in his business and I sit down again It was the peep of day The light came faint from the east the breezes blowed gentle and fresh some more birds waked up in the orchard then some more in the trees near the house and all begun singin together People began to stir and the gal opened the shutters Just then the first beam of the sun fell upon the blossoms a leetle more and it techt the roses on the bushes and the next thing it was broad day the sun fairly blazed the birds sung like they d split their little throats all the leaves was movin and flashin diamonds of dew and the whole wide world was bright and happy as a king Seemed to me like there was a good breakfast in every house in the land and not a sick child or woman anywhere It was a fine mornin And I says to my neighbor That s music that is But he glared at me like he d like to cut my throat Presently the wind turned it begun to thicken up and a kind of gray mist came over things I got low spirited directly Then a silver rain began to fall I could see the drops touch the ground some flashed up like long pearl ear rings and the rest rolled away like round rubies It was pretty but melancholy Then the pearls gathered themselves into long strands and necklaces and then they melted into thin silver streams running between golden gravels and then the streams joined each other at the bottom of the hill and made a brook that flowed silent except that you could kinder see the music especially when the bushes on the banks moved as the music went along down the valley I could smell the flowers in the meadow But the sun didn t shine nor the birds sing it was a foggy day but not cold The most curious thing was the little white angel boy like you see in pictures that run ahead of the music brook and led it on and on away out of the world where no man ever was certain I could see the boy just as plain as I see you Then the moonlight came without any sunset and shone on the graveyards where some few ghosts lifted their hands and went over the wall and between the black sharp top trees splendid marble houses rose up with fine ladies in the lit up windows and men that loved em but could never get anigh em who played on guitars under the trees and made me that miserable I could have cried because I wanted to love somebody I don t know who better than the men with the guitars did Then the sun went down it got dark the wind moaned and wept like a lost child for its dead mother and I could a got up then and there and preached a better sermon than any I ever listened to There wasn t a thing in the world left to live for not a blame thing and yet I didn t want the music to stop one bit It was happier to be miserable than to be happy without being miserable I couldn t understand it I hung my head and pulled out my handkerchief and blowed my nose loud to keep me from cryin My eyes is weak anyway I didn t want anybody to be a gazin at me a sniv lin and it s nobody s business what I do with my nose It s mine But some several glared at me mad as blazes Then all of a sudden old Rubin changed his tune He ripped out and he rared he tipped and he tared he pranced and he charged like the grand entry at a circus Peared to me that all the gas in the house was turned on at once things got so bright and I hilt up my head ready to look any man in the face and not afraid of nothin It was a circus and a brass band and a big ball all goin on at the same time He lit into them keys like a thousand of brick he give em no rest day or night he set every livin joint in me a goin and not bein able to stand it no longer I jumped spang onto my seat and jest hollered Go it my Rube Every blame man woman and child in the house riz on me and shouted Put him out put him out Put your great grandmother s grizzly gray greenish cat into the middle of next month I says Tech me if you dare I paid my money and you jest come anigh me With that some several policemen run up and I had to simmer down But I would a fit any fool that laid hands on me for I was bound to hear Ruby out or die He had changed his tune again He hop light ladies and tip toed fine from end to end of the key board He played soft and low and solemn I heard the church bells over the hills The candles of heaven was lit one by one I saw the stars rise The great organ of eternity began to play from the world s end to the world s end and all the angels went to prayers Then the music changed to water full of feeling that couldn t be thought and began to drop drip drop drip drop clear and sweet like tears of joy falling into a lake of glory It was sweeter than that It was as sweet as a sweet heart sweetened with white sugar mixed with powdered silver and seed diamonds It was too sweet I tell you the audience cheered Rubin he kinder bowed like he wanted to say Much obleeged but I d rather you wouldn t interrup me He stopped a moment or two to catch breath Then he got mad He run his fingers through his hair he shoved up his sleeve he opened his coat tails a leetle further he drug up his stool he leaned over and sir he just went for that old pianner He slapped her face he boxed her jaws he pulled her nose he pinched her ears and he scratched her cheeks until she fairly yelled He knocked her down and he stamped on her shameful She bellowed like a bull she bleated like a calf she howled like a hound she squealed like a pig she shrieked like a rat and then he wouldn t let her up He run a quarter stretch down the low grounds of the base till he got clean in the bowels of the earth and you heard thunder galloping after thunder through the hollows and caves of perdition and then he fox chased his right hand with his left till he got way out of the treble into the clouds whar the notes was finer than the p ints of cambric needles and you couldn t hear nothin but the shadders of em And then he wouldn t let the old pianner go He for ard two d he crost over first gentleman he chassade right and left back to your places he all hands d aroun ladies to the right promenade all in and out here and there back and forth up and down perpetual motion double twisted and turned and tacked and tangled into forty eleven thousand double bow knots By jinks it was a mixtery And then he wouldn t let the old pianner go He fetcht up his right wing he fetcht up his left wing he fetcht up his center he fetcht up his reserves He fired by file he fired by platoons by company by regiments and by brigades He opened his cannon siege guns down thar Napoleons here twelve pounders yonder big guns little guns middle sized guns round shot shells shrapnels grape canister mortar mines and magazines every livin battery and bomb a

intuitive certainty and here she was perfectly impregnable No possible amount of talent or authority or explanation could ever make her believe that any other way was better than her own or that the course she had pursued in the smallest matter could be in the least modified This had been a conceded point with her old mistress Marie s mother and Miss Marie as Dinah always called her young mistress even after her marriage found it easier to submit than contend and so Dinah had ruled supreme This was the easier in that she was perfect mistress of that diplomatic art which unites the utmost subservience of manner with the utmost inflexibility as to measure Dinah was the mistress of the whole art and mystery of excuse making in all its branches Indeed it was an axiom with her that the cook can do no wrong and a cook in a Southern kitchen finds abundance of heads and shoulders on which to lay off every sin and frailty so as to maintain her own immaculateness entire If any part of the dinner was a failure there were fifty indisputably good reasons for it and it was the fault undeniably of fifty other people whom Dinah berated with unsparing zeal But it was very seldom that there was any failure in Dinah s last results Though her mode of doing everything was peculiarly meandering and circuitous and without any sort of calculation as to time and place though her kitchen generally looked as if it had been arranged by a hurricane blowing through it and she had about as many places for each cooking utensil as there were days in the year yet if one could have patience to wait her own good time up would come her dinner in perfect order and in a style of preparation with which an epicure could find no fault It was now the season of incipient preparation for dinner Dinah who required large intervals of reflection and repose and was studious of ease in all her arrangements was seated on the kitchen floor smoking a short stumpy pipe to which she was much addicted and which she always kindled up as a sort of censer whenever she felt the need of an inspiration in her arrangements It was Dinah s mode of invoking the domestic Muses Seated around her were various members of that rising race with which a Southern household abounds engaged in shelling peas peeling potatoes picking pin feathers out of fowls and other preparatory arrangements Dinah every once in a while interrupting her meditations to give a poke or a rap on the head to some of the young operators with the pudding stick that lay by her side In fact Dinah ruled over the woolly heads of the younger members with a rod of iron and seemed to consider them born for no earthly purpose but to save her steps as she phrased it It was the spirit of the system under which she had grown up and she carried it out to its full extent Miss Ophelia after passing on her reformatory tour through all the other parts of the establishment now entered the kitchen Dinah had heard from various sources what was going on and resolved to stand on defensive and conservative ground mentally determined to oppose and ignore every new measure without any actual and observable contest The kitchen was a large brick floored apartment with a great old fashioned fireplace stretching along one side of it an arrangement which saint Clair had vainly tried to persuade Dinah to exchange for the convenience of a modern cook stove Not she No Pusseyite or conservative of any school was ever more inflexibly attached to time honored inconveniences than Dinah When saint Clair had first returned from the North impressed with the system and order of his uncle s kitchen arrangements he had largely provided his own with an array of cupboards drawers and various apparatus to induce systematic regulation under the sanguine illusion that it would be of any possible assistance to Dinah in her arrangements He might as well have provided them for a squirrel or a magpie The more drawers and closets there were the more hiding holes could Dinah make for the accommodation of old rags hair combs old shoes ribbons cast off artificial flowers and other articles of vertu wherein her soul delighted When Miss Ophelia entered the kitchen Dinah did not rise but smoked on in sublime tranquillity regarding her movements obliquely out of the corner of her eye but apparently intent only on the operations around her Miss Ophelia commenced opening a set of drawers What is this drawer for Dinah she said It s handy for most anything missis said Dinah So it appeared to be From the variety it contained Miss Ophelia pulled out first a fine damask table cloth stained with blood having evidently been used to envelop some raw meat What s this Dinah You don t wrap up meat in your mistress s best table cloth Oh Lor missis no the towels was all a missin so I just did it I laid it out to wash that ar that s why I put it thar Shir less said Miss Ophelia to herself proceeding to tumble over the drawer where she found a nutmeg grater and two or three nutmegs a Methodist hymn book a couple of soiled Madras handkerchiefs some yarn and knitting work a paper of tobacco and a pipe a few crackers one or two gilded china saucers with some pomade in them one or two thin old shoes a piece of flannel carefully pinned up enclosing some small white onions several damask table napkins some coarse crash towels some twine and darning needles and several broken papers from which sundry sweet herbs were sifting into the drawer Where do you keep your nutmegs Dinah said Miss Ophelia with the air of one who prayed for patience Most anywhar missis there s some in that cracked tea cup up there and there s some over in that ar cupboard Here are some in the grater said Miss Ophelia holding them up Laws yes I put em there this morning I likes to keep my things handy said Dinah You Jake what are you stopping for You ll cotch it Be still thar she added with a dive of her stick at the criminal What s this said Miss Ophelia holding up the saucer of pomade Laws it s my har grease I put it thar to have it handy Do you use your mistress s best saucers for that Law it was cause I was driv and in sich a hurry I was gwine to change it this very day Here are two damask table napkins Them table napkins I put thar to get em washed out some day Don t you have some place here on purpose for things to be washed Well Mas r saint Clair got dat ar chest he said for dat but I likes to mix up biscuit and hev my things on it some days and then it ain t handy a liftin up the lid Why don t you mix your biscuits on the pastry table there Law missis it gets sot so full of dishes and one thing and another der ain t no room noways But you should wash your dishes and clear them away Wash my dishes said Dinah in a high key as her wrath began to rise over her habitual respect of manner What does ladies know bout work I want to know When d mas r ever get his dinner if I was to spend all my time a washin and a puttin up dishes Miss Marie never telled me so nohow Well here are these onions Laws yes said Dinah that is whar I put em now I couldn t member Them s particular onions I was a savin for dis yer very stew I d forgot they was in dat ar old flannel Miss Ophelia lifted out the sifting papers of sweet herbs I wish missis wouldn t touch dem ar I likes to keep my things where I knows whar to go to em said Dinah rather decidedly But you don t want these holes in the papers Them s handy for siftin on t out said Dinah But you see it spills all over the drawer Laws yes if missis will go a tumblin things all up so it will Missis has spilt lots dat ar way said Dinah coming uneasily to the drawers If missis only will go up sta rs till my clarin up time comes I ll have everything right but I can t do nothin when ladies is round a henderin You Sam don t you gib de baby dat ar sugar bowl I ll crack ye over if ye don t mind I m going through the kitchen and going to put everything in order once Dinah and then I ll expect you to keep it so Lor now Miss Phelia dat ar ain t no way for ladies to do I never did see ladies doin no sich my old missis nor Miss Marie never did and I don t see no kinder need on t And Dinah stalked indignantly about while Miss Ophelia piled and sorted dishes emptied dozens of scattering bowls of sugar into one receptacle sorted napkins table cloths and towels for washing washing wiping and arranging with her own hands and with a speed and alacrity which perfectly amazed Dinah Lor now if dat ar de way dem Northern ladies do dey ain t ladies nohow she said to some of her satellites when at a safe hearing distance I has things as straight as anybody when my clarin up times comes but I don t want ladies round a henderin and gettin my things all where I can t find em To do Dinah justice she had at irregular periods paroxysms of reformation and arrangement which she called clarin up times when she would begin with great zeal and turn every drawer and closet wrong side outward on to the floor or tables and make the ordinary confusion sevenfold more confounded Then she would light her pipe and leisurely go over her arrangements looking things over and discoursing upon them making all the young fry scour most vigorously on the tin things and keeping up for several hours a most energetic state of confusion which she would explain to the satisfaction of all inquirers by the remark that she was a clarin up She couldn t hev things a gwine on so as they had been and she was gwine to make these yer young ones keep better order for Dinah herself somehow indulged the illusion that she herself was the soul of order and it was only the young uns and the everybody else in the house that were the cause of anything that fell short of perfection in this respect When all the tins were scoured and the tables scrubbed snowy white and everything that could offend tucked out of sight in holes and corners Dinah would dress herself up in a smart dress clean apron and high brilliant Madras turban and tell all marauding young uns to keep out of the kitchen for she was gwine to have things kept nice Indeed these periodic seasons were often an inconvenience to the whole household for Dinah would contract such an immoderate attachment to her scoured tin as to insist upon it that it shouldn t be used again for any possible purpose at least till the ardor of the clarin up period abated THE STRIKE AT HINMAN S BY ROBERT J BURDETTE Away back in the fifties Hinman s was not only the best school in Peoria but it was the greatest school in the world I sincerely thought so then and as I was a very lively part of it I should know mister Hinman was the Faculty and he was sufficiently numerous to demonstrate cube root with one hand and maintain discipline with the other Dear old man boys and girls with grandchildren love him to day and think of him among their blessings He was superintendent of public instruction board of education school trustee county superintendent principal of the high school and janitor He had a pleasant smile a genius for mathematics and a West Point idea of obedience and discipline He carried upon his person a grip that would make the imported malady which mocks that name in these degenerate days call itself Slack in very terror at having assumed the wrong title We used to have General Exercises on Friday afternoon The most exciting feature of this weekly frivolity consisted of a free for all exercise in mental arithmetic mister Hinman gave out lists of numbers beginning with easy ones and speaking slowly each succeeding list he dictated more rapidly and with ever increasing complications of addition subtraction multiplication and division until at last he was giving them out faster than he could talk One by one the pupils dropped out of the race with despairing faces but always at the closing peremptory Answer At least a dozen hands shot into the air and as many voices shouted the correct result We didn t have many books and the curriculum of an Illinois school in those days was not academic but two things the children could do they could spell as well as the dictionary and they could handle figures Some of the fellows fairly wallowed in them I didn t I simply drowned in the shallowest pond of numbers that ever spread itself on the page As even unto this day I do the same Well one year the Teacher introduced an innovation compositions by the girls and speakin pieces by the boys It was easy enough for the girls who had only to read the beautiful thought that spring is the pleasantest season of the year Now and then a new girl from the east awfully precise would begin her essay spring is the most pleasant season of the year and her would we call down with derisive laughter whereat she walked to her seat very stiffly with a proud dry eyed look in her face only to lay her head upon her desk when she reached it and weep silently until school closed But speakin pieces did not meet with favor from the boys save one or two good boys who were in training by their parents for congressmen or presidents The rest of us who were just boys with no desire ever to be anything else endured the tyranny of compulsory oratory about a month and then resolved to abolish the whole business by a general revolt Big and little we agreed to stand by each other break up the new exercise and get back to the old order of things the hurdle races in mental arithmetic and the geographical chants which we could run and intone together Was I a mutineer Well say son your Pa was a constituent conspirator He was in the color guard You see the first boy called on for a declamation was to announce the strike and as my name stood very high in the alphabetical roll of pupils I had an excellent chance of leading the assaulting column a distinction for which I was not at all ambitious being a stripling of tender years ruddy countenance and sensitive feelings However I stiffened the sinews of my soul girded on my armor by slipping an atlas back under my jacket and was ready for the fray feeling a little terrified shiver of delight as I thought that the first lick mister Hinman gave me would make him think he had broken my back The hour for speakin pieces an hour big with fate arrived on time A boy named Aby Abbott was called up ahead of me but he happened to be one of the presidential aspirants he was mate on an Illinois river steamboat stern wheeler at that the last I knew of him and of course he flunked and said his piece a sadly prophetic selection mister President it is natural for man to indulge in the illusions of hope We made such suggestive and threatening gestures at him however when mister Hinman wasn t looking that he forgot half his piece broke down and cried He also cried after school a little more bitterly and with far better reason Then after an awful pause in which the conspirators could hear the beating of each other s hearts my name was called I sat still at my desk and said I ain t goin to speak no piece mister Hinman looked gently surprised and asked Why not Robert I replied Because there ain t goin to be any more speakin pieces The teacher s eyes grew round and big as he inquired Who says there will not I said in slightly firmer tones as I realized that the moment had come for dragging the rest of the rebels into court All of us boys But mister Hinman smiled and said quietly that he guessed there would be a little more speaking before the close of the session Then laying his hand on my shoulder with most punctilious but chilling courtesy he invited me to the rostrum The rostrum was twenty five feet distant but I arrived there on schedule time and only touched my feet to the floor twice on my way And then and there under mister Hinman s judicious coaching before the assembled school with feelings nay emotions which I now shudder to recall I did my first song and dance Many times before had I stepped off a solo cachuca to the staccato pleasing of a fragment of slate frame upon which my tutor was a gifted performer but never until that day did I accompany myself with words Boy like I had chosen for my piece a poem sweetly expressive of those peaceful virtues which I most heartily despised So that my performance at the inauguration of the strike as mister Hinman conducted the overture ran something like this Oh not for me whack is the rolling whack drum Or the whack whack trumpet s wild whack appeal Boo hoo Or the cry swish whack of boo hoo hoo war when the whack foe is come ouch Or the ow wow brightly whack flashing whack whack steel wah hoo wah hoo Words and symbols can not convey to the most gifted imagination the gestures with which I illustrated the seven stanzas of this beautiful poem I had really selected it to please my mother whom I had invited to be present when I supposed I would deliver it But the fact that she attended a missionary meeting in the Baptist church that afternoon made me a friend of missions forever Suffice it to say then that my pantomime kept pace and time with mister Hinman s system of punctuation until the last line was sobbed and whacked out I groped my bewildered way to my seat through a mist of tears and sat down gingerly and sideways inly wondering why an inscrutable providence had given to the rugged rhinoceros the hide which the eternal fitness of things had plainly prepared for the school boy But I quickly forgot my own sorrow and dried my tears with laughter in the enjoyment of the subsequent acts of the opera as the chorus developed the plot and action mister Hinman who had been somewhat gentle with me dealt firmly with the larger boy who followed and there was a scene of revelry for the next twenty minutes The old man shook Bill Morrison until his teeth rattled so you couldn t hear him cry He hit Mickey McCann the tough boy from the Lower Prairie and Mickey ran out and lay down in the snow to cool off He hit Jake Bailey across the legs with a slate frame and it hurt so that Jake couldn t howl he just opened his mouth wide held up his hands gasped and forgot his own name He pushed Bill Haskell into a seat and the bench broke He ran across the room and reached out for Lem Harkins and Lem had a fit before the old man touched him He shook Dan Stevenson for two minutes and when he let him go Dan walked around his own desk five times before he could find it and then he couldn t sit down without holding on He whipped the two Knowltons with a skate strap in each hand at the same time the Greenwood family five boys and a big girl he whipped all at once with a girl s skipping rope and they raised such a united wail that the clock stopped He took a twist in Bill Rodecker s front hair and Bill slept with his eyes open for a week He kept the atmosphere of that school room full of dust and splinters and lint weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth until he reached the end of the alphabet and all hearts ached and wearied of the inhuman strife and wicked contention Then he stood up before us a sickening tangle of slate frame strap ebony ferule and skipping rope a smile on his kind old face and asked in clear triumphant tones WHO says there isn t going to be any more speaking pieces And every last boy in that school sprang to his feet standing there as one human being with one great mouth we shrieked in concerted anguish NOBODY DON T And your Pa my son who led that strike has been speakin pieces ever since A NAUTICAL BALLAD BY CHARLES E CARRYL A capital ship for an ocean trip Was the Walloping Window blind No gale that blew dismayed her crew Or troubled the captain s mind The man at the wheel was taught to feel Contempt for the wildest blow And it often appeared when the weather had cleared That he d been in his bunk below The boatswain s mate was very sedate Yet fond of amusement too And he played hop scotch with the starboard watch While the captain tickled the crew And the gunner we had was apparently mad For he sat on the after rail And fired salutes with the captain s boots In the teeth of the booming gale The captain sat in a commodore s hat And dined in a royal way On toasted pigs and pickles and figs And gummery bread each day But the cook was Dutch and behaved as such For the diet he gave the crew Was a number of tons of hot cross buns Prepared with sugar and glue All nautical pride we laid aside And we cast the vessel ashore On the Gulliby Isles where the Poohpooh smiles And the Rumbletumbunders roar And we sat on the edge of a sandy ledge And shot at the whistling bee And the cinnamon bats wore water proof hats As they danced in the sounding sea On rubgub bark from dawn to dark We fed till we all had grown Uncommonly shrunk when a Chinese junk Came by from the torriby zone She was stubby and square but we didn t much care And we cheerily put to sea And we left the crew of the junk to chew The bark of the rubgub tree NATURAL PERVERSITIES BY JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY I am not prone to moralize In scientific doubt On certain facts that Nature tries To puzzle us about For I am no philosopher Of wise elucidation But speak of things as they occur From simple observation I notice little things to wit I never missed a train Because I didn t run for it I never knew it rain That my umbrella wasn t lent Or when in my possession The sun but wore to all intent A jocular expression I never knew a creditor To dun me for a debt But I was cramped or busted or I never knew one yet When I had plenty in my purse To make the least invasion As I accordingly perverse Have courted no occasion Nor do I claim to comprehend What Nature has in view In giving us the very friend To trust we oughtn t to But so it is The trusty gun Disastrously exploded Is always sure to be the one We didn t think was loaded Our moaning is another s mirth And what is worse by half We say the funniest thing on earth And never raise a laugh Mid friends that love us overwell And sparkling jests and liquor Our hearts somehow are liable To melt in tears the quicker We reach the wrong when most we seek The right in like effect We stay the strong and not the weak Do most when we neglect Neglected genius truth be said As wild and quick as tinder The more you seek to help ahead The more you seem to hinder I ve known the least the greatest too And on the selfsame plan The biggest fool I ever knew Was quite a little man We find we ought and then we won t We prove a thing then doubt it Know everything but when we don t Know anything about it BUDD WILKINS AT THE SHOW BY S E KISER Since I ve got used to city ways and don t scare at the cars It makes me smile to set and think of years ago My stars How green I was and how green all them country people be Sometimes it seems almost as if this hardly could be me Well I was goin to tell you bout Budd Wilkins I declare He was the durndest greenest chap that ever breathed the air The biggest town on earth he thought was our old county seat With its one two story brick hotel and dusty bizness street We d fairs in fall and now and then a dance or huskin bee Which was the most excitin things Budd Wilkins ever see Until one winter Skigginsville was all turned upside down By a troupe of real play actors a comin into town The court house it was turned into a theater that night And I don t s pose I ll live to see another sich a sight I guess that every person who was able fer to go Jest natchelly cut loose fer oncet and went to see the show Me and Budd we stood around there all day in the snow But gosh it paid us fer we got seats right in the second row Well the brass band played a tune or two and then the play begun And twa n t long fore the villain had the hero on the run Say talk about your purty girls with sweet confidin ways I never see the equal yit in all o my born days Of that there brave young heroine so clingin and so mild And jest as innocent as if she d been a little child I most forgot to say that Budd stood six feet in his socks As brave as any lion too and stronger than an ox But there never was a man I ll bet that had a softer heart And he was always sure to take the weaker person s part Budd he fell dead in love right off with that there purty girl And I suppose the feller s brain was in a fearful whirl Fer there he set and gazed at her and when she sighed he sighed And when she hid her face and sobbed he actually cried He clinched his fists and ground his teeth when the villain laid his plot And said out loud he d like to kill the rogue right on the spot And when the hero helped the girl Budd up and yelled Hooray He d clean fergot the whole blame thing was nothing but a play At last the villain trapped the girl that sweet confidin child And when she cried for help why I ll admit that I was riled The hero couldn t do a thing but roll and writhe around And tug and groan because they d got the poor chap gagged and bound The maiden cried Unhand me now or weak girl that I am And then Budd Wilkins he jumped up and give his hat a slam And quicker n I can tell it he was up there raisin Ned A rescuin the maiden and a punchin the rogue s head I can t somehow perticklerize concernin that there row The whole thing seems a sort of blur as I recall it now But I can still remember that there was a fearful thud With the air chock full of arms and legs and the villain under Budd I never see a chap so bruised and battered up before As that there villain was when he was picked up from the floor The show Oh it was busted and they put poor Budd in jail And kept him there all night because I couldn t go his bail Next mornin what d you think we heard Most s prised in all my life That sweet confidin maiden was the cruel villain s wife Budd wilted when he heard it and he groaned and then says he Well I ll be dummed Bill that s the last play actin show fer me BALLAD BY CHARLES GODFREY LELAND Der noble Ritter Hugo Von

evening I m sorry that the stages are disappearing so rapidly I never enjoyed traveling so well as in the slow coaches I ve made a good many passages over the Alleghanies and across Ohio from Cleveland to Columbus and Cincinnati all over the South down East and up North in stages and I generally had a good time When I passed over from Cleveland to Cincinnati the last time in a stage I met a queer crowd Such a corps such a time you never did see I never was better amused in my life We had a good team spanking horses fine coaches and one of them drivers you read of Well there was nine insiders and I don t believe there ever was a stage full of Christians ever started before so chuck full of music There was a beautiful young lady going to one of the Cincinnati academies next to her sat a Jew peddler Cowes and a market wedging him was a dandy black leg with jewelry and chains around about his breast and neck enough to hang him There was myself and an old gentleman with large spectacles gold headed cane and a jolly soldering iron looking nose by him was a circus rider whose breath was enough to breed yaller fever and could be felt just as easy as cotton velvet A cross old woman came next whose look would have given any reasonable man the double breasted blues before breakfast alongside of her was a rale backwoods preacher with the biggest and ugliest mouth ever got up since the flood He was flanked by the low comedian of the party an Indiana Hoosier gwine down to Orleans to get an army contrac to supply the forces then in Mexico with beef We rolled along for some time Nobody seemed inclined to open The old aunty sat bolt upright looking crab apples and persimmons at the hoosier and the preacher the young lady dropped the green curtain of her bonnet over her pretty face and leaned back in her seat to nod and dream over japonicas and jumbles pantalets and poetry the old gentleman proprietor of the Bardolph nose looked out at the corduroy and swashes the gambler fell off into a doze and the circus convoy followed suit leaving the preacher and me vis a vis and saying nothing to nobody Indiany he stuck his mug out of the window and criticized the cattle we now and then passed I was wishing somebody would give the conversation a start when Indiany made a break This ain t no great stock country says he to the old gentleman with the cane No sir says the old gentleman There s very little grazing here and the range is pretty much wore out Then there was nothing said again for some time Bimeby the hoosier opened ag in It s the d dest place for simmon trees and turkey buzzards I ever did see The old gentleman with the cane didn t say nothing and the preacher gave a long groan The young lady smiled through her veil and the old lady snapped her eyes and looked sideways at the speaker Don t make much beef here I reckon says the hoosier No says the gentleman Well I don t see how in h ll they all manage to get along in a country whar thar ain t no ranges and they don t make no beef A man ain t considered worth a cuss in Indiany what hasn t got his brand on a hundred head Yours is a great beef country I believe says the old gentleman Well sir it ain t anything else A man that s got sense enuff to foller his own cow bell with us ain t in no danger of starvin I m gwine down to Orleans to see if I can t git a contract out of Uncle Sam to feed the boys what s been lickin them infernal Mexicans so bad I s pose you ve seed them cussed lies what s been in the papers about the Indiany boys at Bony Visty I ve read some accounts of the battle says the old gentleman that didn t give a very flattering account of the conduct of some of our troops With that the Indiany man went into a full explanation of the affair and gettin warmed up as he went along begun to cuss and swear like he d been through a dozen campaigns himself The old preacher listened to him with evident signs of displeasure twistin and groanin till he couldn t stand it no longer My friend says he you must excuse me but your conversation would be a great deal more interesting to me and I m sure would please the company much better if you wouldn t swear so terribly It s very wrong to swear and I hope you ll have respect for our feelin s if you hain t no respect for your Maker If the hoosier had been struck with thunder and lightnin he couldn t have been more completely tuck aback He shut his mouth right in the middle of what he was sayin and looked at the preacher while his face got as red as fire Swearin says the old preacher is a terrible bad practice and there ain t no use in it nohow The Bible says Swear not at all and I s pose you know the commandments about swearin The old lady sort of brightened up the preacher was her duck of a man the old fellow with the nose and cane let off a few umph ah umphs but Indiany kept shady he appeared to be cowed down I know says the preacher that a great many people swear without thinkin and some people don t b lieve the Bible And then he went on to preach a regular sermon ag in swearing and to quote Scripture like he had the whole Bible by heart In the course of his argument he undertook to prove the Scriptures to be true and told us all about the miracles and prophecies and their fulfilment The old gentleman with the cane took a part in the conversation and the hoosier listened without ever opening his head I ve just heard of a gentleman says the preacher that s been to the Holy Land and went over the Bible country It s astonishin to hear what wonderful things he has seen He was at Sodom and Gomorrow and seen the place whar Lot s wife fell Ah says the old gentleman with the cane Yes says the preacher he went to the very spot and what s the remarkablest thing of all he seen the pillar of salt what she was turned into Is it possible says the old gentleman Yes sir he seen the salt standin thar to this day What says the hoosier real genewine good salt Yes sir a pillar of salt jest as it was when that wicked woman was punished for her disobedience All but the gambler who was snoozing in the corner of the coach looked at the preacher the hoosier with an expression of countenance that plainly told us that his mind was powerfully convicted of an important fact Right out in the open air he asked Yes standin right in the open field whar she fell Well sir says Indiany all I ve got to say is if she d dropped in our parts the cattle would have licked her up afore sundown The preacher raised both his hands at such an irreverent remark and the old gentleman laughed himself into a fit of asthmatics what he didn t get over till we came to the next change of horses The hoosier had played the mischief with the gravity of the whole party even the old maid had to put her handkerchief to her face and the young lady s eyes were filled with tears for half an hour afterward The old preacher hadn t another word to say on the subject but whenever we came to any place or met anybody on the road the circus man nursed the thing along by asking what was the price of salt A RIVAL ENTERTAINMENT BY KATE FIELD I once heard a bright child declare that if circuses were prohibited in heaven she did not wish to go there She had been baptized was under Christian influences and previous to this heterodoxy had never given her good parents a moment s anxiety Her naive utterance touched a responsive chord within my own breast for well did I remember how gloriously the circus shone by the light of other days how the ring master in a wrinkled dress coat seemed the most enviable of mortals being on speaking terms with all the celestial creatures who jumped over flags and through balloons how the clown was the dearest funniest of men how the young athletes in tights and spangles were my beau ideals of masculinity and how La Belle Rose with one foot upon her native heath otherwise a well padded saddle and the other pointed in the direction of the sweet little cherubs that sat up aloft was the most fascinating of her sex I am persuaded that circuses fill an aching void in the universe What children did before their invention I shudder to think for circuses are to childhood what butter is to bread and what the world did before the birth of Barnum is an almost equally frightful problem Some are born to shows others attain shows and yet again others have shows thrust upon them Barnum is a born showman If ever a man fulfills his destiny it is the discoverer of Tom Thumb With the majority of men and women life is a failure Not until one leg dangles in the grave is their raison d etre disclosed The round people always find themselves sticking in the square holes and vice versa but with Barnum we need not deplore a vie manquee We can smile at his reverses for even the phoenix has cause to blush in his presence Though pursued by tongues of fire Barnum remains invincible when iron stone and mortar crumble around him and while yet the smoke is telling volumes of destruction the cheery voice of the showman exclaims Here you are gentlemen admission fifty cents children half price Apropos of Barnum once in my life I gave myself up to unmitigated joy Weary of lecturing singing the song I would I were a boy again I went to see the elephant To speak truly I saw not one elephant but half a dozen I had a feast of roaring and a flow of circus In fact I indulged in the wildest dissipation I visited Barnum s circus and sucked peppermint candy in a way most childlike and bland The reason seems obscure but circuses and peppermint candy are as inseparable as peanuts and the Bowery Appreciating this solemn fact Barnum provides bigger sticks adorned with bigger red stripes than ever Romans sucked in the palmy days of the Coliseum In the dim distance I mistook them for barbers poles but upon direct application I recognized them for my long lost own However let me like the Germans begin with the creation Here ladies and gentlemen is for sale mister Barnum s Autobiography full of interest and anecdote one of the most charming productions ever issued from the press nine hundred pages thirty two full page engravings reduced from three dollars fifty cents to one dollar fifty cents Every purchaser enters free How ordinary mortals can resist buying Barnum s Autobiography for one dollar such a bargain as never was is incomprehensible I believe they can not I believe they do their duty like men As one man I resisted because I belong to the press and therefore am not mortal Who ever heard of a journalist getting a bargain With Spartan firmness I turned a deaf ear to the persuasive music of the propagandist and entered where hope is all before I was not staggered by a welcome from all the Presidents of the United States Fitz Greene Halleck General Hooker and Gratz Brown These personages are rather woodeny and red about the face as though flushed with victories of the platform or the table but I recognize their fitness in a menagerie What athlete has turned more somersaults than some of these representative men What lion has roared more gently than a few of these sucking doves Barnum s tact in appropriately grouping curiosities living and dead is too well known to require comment Passing what Sam Weller would call a reg lar knock down of intellect I took my seat high in the air amid a dense throng of my fellow creatures and realized how many people it takes to make up the world What did I see I saw double I beheld not one ring but two in each of which the uncommon variety of man was disporting in an entertaining manner I felt for these uncommon men Think what immortal hates must arise from these dual performances We all like to receive the reward of merit but when two performances are going on simultaneously how are the artists to know for whom it is intended Applause is the sweet compensation for which all strive privately or publicly and to be cheated out of it or left in doubt as to its destination is a refined form of the Inquisition Fancy the sensations of the man balancing plates on the little end of nothing a feat to which he has consecrated his life at thought of his neighbor s performance of impossible feats in the air It would be more than human in both not to wish the other in Jericho or in some equally remote quarter of the globe I sympathized with them I became bewildered in my endeavors to keep one eye on each If human beings were constructed on the same principles as Janus and had two faces a fore and aft circus would be convenient but as nowadays double faced people only wear two eyes in their heads the Barnumian conception muddles the intellect I pray you great and glorious showman take pity on your artists and your audiences Don t drive the former mad and the latter distracted Remember that insanity is on the increase and that accommodations in asylums are limited Take warning before you undermine the reason of an entire continent Beware Beware I hear much and see more of the physical weakness of woman Michelet tells the sentimental world that woman is an exquisite invalid with a perennial headache and nerves perpetually on the rack It is a mistake When I gaze upon German and French peasant women I ask Michelet which is right he or Nature And since my introduction to Barnum s female gymnast a good looking well formed mother of a family who walks about unflinchingly with men and boys on her shoulders and carries a three hundred pound gun as easily as the ordinary woman carries a clothes basket I have been persuaded that the coming woman like Brother Jonathan will lick all creation In that good time woman will have her rights because she will have her muscle Then if there are murders and playful beatings between husbands and wives the wives will enjoy all the glory of crime What an outlook And what a sublime consolation to the present enfeebled race of wives that are having their throats cut and their eyes carved out merely because their biceps have not gone into training Barnum s female gymnast is an example to her sex What woman has done woman may do again Mothers train up your daughters in the way they should fight and when they are married they will not depart this life God is on the side of the stoutest muscle as well as of the heaviest battalions It is perfectly useless to talk about the equality of the sexes as long as a man can strangle his own mother in law I was exceedingly thrilled by the appearance of the two young gentlemen from the Cannibal Islands who are beautifully embossed in green and red and compassionated them for the sacrifices they make in putting on blankets and civilization Is it right to deprive them of their daily bread I mean their daily baby Think what self restraint they must exercise while gazing upon the toothsome infants that congregate at the circus That they do gaze and smack their overhanging lips I know because after going through their cannibalistic dance they sat behind me and howled in a subdued manner The North American Indian who occupied an adjoining seat favored me with a translation of their charming conversation by which I learned many important facts concerning man as an article of diet It appears that babies after all do not make the daintiest morsels Tender they are of course but being immature they have not the rich flavor of a youthful adult This seems reasonable Veal is tender but can it be favorably compared with beef The cases are parallel The embossed young men consider babies excellent for entrees but for roasts there is nothing like plump maidens in their teens Men of twenty are not bad eating When older they are invariably boiled Commenting upon the audience the critics did not consider it appetizing and strange as it may appear I felt somewhat hurt by the remark for who is not vain enough to wish to look good enough to eat Fancy being shipwrecked off the Fiji Islands and discarded by cannibals as a tough subject while your companions are literally killed with attention Can you not imagine that under such circumstances a peculiar jealousy of the superior tenderness of your friends would be a thorn in the flesh rendering existence a temporary burden If we lived among people who adored squinting should we not all take to it and cherish it as the apple of our eye And if we fell among anthropophagi would not our love of approbation make us long to be as succulent as young pigs What glory to escape from the jaws of death if the jaws repudiate us So long as memory holds a seat in this distracted brain I shall entertain unpleasant feelings toward the embossed young gentlemen who did not sigh to fasten their affections otherwise their teeth on me It was worse than a crime it was bad taste Roaming among the wild animals I made the acquaintance of the cassowary in which I have been deeply interested since childhood s sunny hours for then t was oft I sang a touching hymn running thus If I were a cassowary Far away in Timbuctoo I should eat a missionary Hat and boots and hymn book too From that hour the cassowary occupied a large niche in my heart The desire to gaze upon a bird capable of digesting food to which even the ostrich never aspired pursued me by day and tinctured my dreams by night What you seek for all your life you will come upon suddenly when the whole family is at dinner says Thoreau I met the cassowary at dinner He was dining alone having left his family in Africa and I must say that I never met with a greater disappointment Were it not for the touching intimation of the hymn I should believe it impossible for him to eat a missionary A quieter more amiable bird never stood on two legs A polite attendant stirred him up for me yet his temper and his feathers remained unruffled Perhaps if our geographical position had changed to Timbuctoo and I had been a missionary with hymn book in hand the cassowary might have realized my expectations As it was one more illusion vanished In order to regain my spirits I shook hands with the handsome giant in brass buttons and speaking of giants leads me to the subject of all lusus naturae particularly the Circassian young lady the dwarf the living skeleton the Albinos and What is it I have dropped more than one tear at the fate of these unfortunate beings for what is more horribly solitary than to live in a strange crowd with No one to love None to caress Noah was human When he retired to the ark he selected two of a kind from all the animal kingdom for the sake of sociability as well as for more practical purposes Showmen should be equally considerate To think of those Albino sisters with never an Albino beau of the Circassian beauty with never a Circassian sweetheart of the living skeleton with never another skeleton in his closet how he can look so good natured would be most mysterious were not his digestion pronounced perfect to think of the wretched What is it with never a missus What is it produces unspeakable anguish May they meet their affinities in another and a more sympathetic world where monstrosities are impossible for the reason that we leave our bones on earth Since gazing at the What is it I have become a convert to Darwin It is too true Our ancestors stood on their hind legs and the less we talk about pedigree the better The noble democrat in search of a coat of arms and a grandfather should visit a grand moral circus Let us assume a virtue though we have it not let our pride ape humility Were I asked which I thought the greater necessity of civilization lectures or circuses I should lay my right hand upon my left heart and exclaim Circuses YAWCOB STRAUSS BY CHARLES FOLLEN ADAMS I haf von funny leedle poy

Strauss SEFFY AND SALLY BY JOHN LUTHER LONG The place was the porch of the store the time was about ten o clock in the morning of a summer day the people were the amiable loafers and Old Baumgartner The person he was discoursing about was his son Sephenijah I am not sure that the name was not the ripe fruit of his father s fancy with perhaps the Scriptural suggestion which is likely to be present in the affairs of a Pennsylvania German whether a communicant or not even if he live in Maryland Yas always last expecial at funerals and weddings Except his own he s sure to be on time at his own funeral Right out in front Hah But sometimes he misses his wedding Why I knowed a feller yous all knowed him begoshens that didn t git there tell another feller d married her bout more n a year afterward Wasn t it more n a year boys Yas Bill Eisenkrout Or now was it his brother Baltzer Iron Cabbage Seems to me now like it was Baltz Somesing wiss a B at the front end anyhow Henry Wasserman diffidently intimated that there was a curious but satisfactory element of safety in being last a fastnacht in their language in fact Those in front were the ones usually hurt in railroad accidents Alexander Althoff remembered Safe cried the speaker Of course But for why say for why Old Baumgartner challenged defiantly No one answered and he let several impressive minutes intervene You don t know Hang you none of yous knows Well because he ain t there when anysing occurs always a little late They agreed with him by a series of sage nods But fellers the worst is about courting It s no way to be always late Everybody else gits there first and it s nossing for the fastnacht but weeping and wailing and gnashing of the teeth And mebby the other feller gits considerable happiness and a good farm There was complaint in the old man s voice and they knew that he meant his own son Seffy To add to their embarrassment this same son was now appearing over the Lustich Hill an opportune moment for a pleasing digression For you must be told early concerning Old Baumgartner s longing for certain lands tenements and hereditaments using his own phrase which were not his own but which adjoined his It had passed into a proverb of the vicinage indeed though the property in question belonged to one Sarah Pressel it was known colloquially as Baumgartner s Yearn And the reason of it was this Between his own farm and the public road and the railroad station when it came lay the fairest meadow land farmer s eye had ever rested upon I am speaking again for the father of Seffy and with his hyperbole Save in one particular it was like an enemy s beautiful territory lying between one s less beautiful own and the open sea keeping one a poor inlander who is mad for the seas whose crops must either pass across the land of his adversary and pay tithes to him or go by long distances around him at the cost of greater tithes to the soulless owners of the turnpikes who aggravatingly fix a gate each way to make their tithes more sure So I say it was like having the territory of his enemy lying between him and the deep water save as I have also said in one particular to wit that the owner the Sarah Pressel I have mentioned was not Old Baumgartner s enemy In fact they were tremendous friends And it was by this friendship and one other thing which I mean to mention later that Old Baumgartner hoped before he died to attain the wish of his life and see not only the Elysian pasture field but the whole of the adjoining farm with the line fences down a part of his The other thing I promised to mention as an aid to this ambition was Seffy And since the said Sarah was of nearly the same age as Seffy perhaps I need not explain further except to say that the only obstruction the old man could see now to acquiring the title by marriage was Seffy himself He was and always had been afraid of girls especially such aggressive flirtatious pretty and tempestuous girls as this Sarah These things however were hereditary with the girl It was historical in fact that during the life of Sarah s good looking father so importunate had been Old Baumgartner for the purchase of at least the meadow he could not have ventured more at that time and so obstinate had been the father of the present owner he had red hair precisely as his daughter had that they had come to blows about it to the discomfiture of Old Baumgartner and afterward they did not speak Yet when the loafers at the store laughed Baumgartner swore that he would nevertheless have that pasture before he died But then as if fate too were against him the railroad was built and its station was placed so that the Pressel farm lay directly between it and him and of course the life went more and more in the direction of the station left him more and more out of it and made him poorer and poorer and Pressel richer and richer And when the store laughed at that Baumgartner swore that he would possess half of the farm before he died and as Pressel and his wife died and Seffy grew up and as he noticed the fondness of the little red headed girl for his little tow headed boy he added to his adjuration that he would be harrowing that whole farm before he died without paying a cent for it But both Seffy and Sally had grown to a marriageable age without anything happening Seffy had become inordinately shy while the coquettish Sally had accepted the attentions of Sam Pritz the clerk at the store as an antagonist more worthy of her and in a fashion which sometimes made the father of Seffy swear and lose his temper with Seffy Though of course in the final disposition of the matter he was sure that no girl so nice as Sally would marry such a person as Sam Pritz with no extremely visible means of support a salary of four dollars a week and an odious reputation for liquor And it was for these things all of which were known for Baumgartner had not a single secret that the company at the store detected the personal equation in Old Baumgartner s communications Seffy had almost arrived by this time and Sally was in the store With Sam The situation was highly dramatic But the old man consummately ignored this complication and directed attention to his son For him the molasses tapper did not exist The fact is he was overjoyed Seffy for once in his life would be on time He would do the rest Now boys chust look at em Dogged if they ain t bose like one another How s the proferb Birds of a feather flock wiss one another I dunno Anyhow Sef flocks wiss Betz constant And they understand one another good Trotting like a sidewise dog of a hot summer s day And he showed the company up and down the store porch just how a sidewise dog would be likely to trot on a hot summer day and then laughed joyously If there had been an artist eye to see they would have been well worth its while Seffy and the mare so affectionately disparaged And after all I am not sure that the speaker himself had not an artist s eye For a spring pasture or a fallow upland or a drove of goodly cows deep in his clover I know he had Perhaps you too have And this was his best mare and his only son The big bay clad in broad banded harness soft with oil and glittering with brasses was shambling indolently down the hill resisting her own momentum by the diagonal motion the old man had likened to a dog s sidewise trot The looped trace chains were jingling a merry dithyramb her head was nodding her tail swaying and Seffy propped by his elbow on her broad back one leg swung between the hames the other keeping time on her ribs was singing I want to be an angel And with the angels stand A crown upon my forehead A harp within my hand His adoring father chuckled I wonder what for kind of anchel he d make anyhow And Betz they ll have to go together Say I wonder if it is horse anchels No one knew no one offered a suggestion Well it ought to be Say he ken perform circus wiss ol Betz They expressed their polite surprise at this for perhaps the hundredth time Yas they have a kind of circus ring in the barnyard He stands on one foot then on another and on his hands wiss his feet kicking and then he says words like hokey pokey and Betz she kicks up behind and throws him off in the dung and we all laugh happy efer after Betz most of all After the applause he said I guess I d better wake em up What you sink They one and all thought he had They knew he would do it no matter what they thought His method as usual was his own He stepped to the adjoining field and selecting a clod with the steely polish of the plowshare upon it threw it at the mare It struck her on the flank She gathered her feet under her in sudden alarm then slowly relaxed looked slyly for the old man found him and understanding suddenly wheeled and ambled off home leaving Seffy prone on the ground as her part of the joke The old man brought Seffy in triumph to the store porch Chust stopped you afore you got to be a anchel he was saying We couldn t bear to sink about you being a anchel an wiss the anchels stand a harp upon your forehead a crown within your hand I expect when it s corn planting time Seffy grinned cheerfully brushed off the dust and contemplated his father s watch held accusingly against him Old Baumgartner went on gaily About an inch and a half apast ten Seffy I m glad you ain t breaking your reputation for being fastnachtich Chust about a quarter of an inch too late for the prize wiss flour on its hair and arms and its frock pinned up to show its new petticoat Uhu If I had such a nice petticoat he imitated the lady in question to the tremendous delight of the gentle loafers Seffy stared a little and rubbed some dust out of his eyes He was pleasant but dull Yassir Sef if you d a got yere at a inch and a quarter apast Now Sam s got her Down in the cellar a licking molasses together Doggone if Sam don t git eferysing except his due bills He don t want to be no anchel tell he dies He s got fun enough yere but Seffy you re like the flow of molasses in January at courting This oblique suasion made no impression on Seffy It is doubtful if he understood it at all The loafers began to smile One laughed The old man checked him with a threat of personal harm Hold on there Jefferson Dafis Busby he chid I don t allow no one to laugh at my Seffy except chust me account I m his daddy It s a fight word the next time you do it mister Busby straightened his countenance He don t seem to notice nor keer bout gals do he No one spoke No durn him he ain t no good Say what ll you give for him hah Yere he goes to the highest bidder for richer for poorer for better for worser up and down in and out swing your partners what s bid He ken plow as crooked as a mule s hind leg sleep hard as a possum in wintertime eat like a snake git left efery time but he ken ketch fish They wait on him What s bid No one would hazard a bid Yit a minute shouted the old fellow pulling out his bull s eye watch again what s bid Going going all done going A dollar The bid came from behind him and the voice was beautiful to hear A gleam came into the old man s eyes as he heard it He deliberately put the watch back in its pocket put on his spectacles and turned as if she were a stranger Gone he announced then Who s the purchaser Come forwards and take away you property What s the name please Then he pretended to recognize her Oach Sally Well that s lucky He goes in good hands He s sound and kind but needs the whip He held out his hand for the dollar It was the girl of whom he had spoken accurately as a prize Her sleeves were turned up as far as they would go revealing some soft lace trimmed whiteness and there was flour on her arms Some patches of it on her face gave a petal like effect to her otherwise aggressive color The pretty dress was pinned far enough back to reveal the prettier petticoat plus a pair of trimly clad ankles Perhaps these were neither the garments nor the airs in which every farmer maiden did her baking But then Sally was no ordinary farmer maiden She was all this it is true but she was besides grace and color and charm itself And if she chose to bake in such attire or even if she chose to pretend to do so where was the churl to say her nay even though the flour was part of a deliberate make up Certainly he was not at the store that summer morning And Seffy was there Her hair escaped redness by only a little But that little was just the difference between ugliness and beauty For whether Sally were beautiful or not about which we might contend a bit her hair was and perhaps that is the reason why it was nearly always uncovered or possibly again because it was so much uncovered was the reason it was beautiful It seemed to catch some of the glory of the sun Her face had a few freckles and her mouth was a trifle too large But in it were splendid teeth In short by the magic of brilliant color and natural grace she narrowly escaped being extremely handsome in the way of a sunburned peach or a maiden s blush apple And even if you should think she were not handsome you would admit that there was an indescribable rustic charm about her She was like the aroma of the hay fields or the woods or a field of daisies or dandelions The girl laughing surrendered the money and the old man taking an arm of each marched them peremptorily away Come to the house and git his clothes Eferysing goes in stofepipe hat butterfly necktie diamond pin toothbrush hair oil razor and soap They had got far enough around the corner to be out of sight of the store during this gaiety and the old man now shoved Seffy and the girl out in front of him linked their arms and retreated to the rear What Sephenijah P Baumgartner Senior hath j ined together let nobody put athunder begoshens he announced The proceeding appeared to be painful to Seffy but not to Sally She frankly accepted the situation and promptly put into action its opportunities for coquetry She begged him first with consummate aplomb to aid her in adjusting her parcels more securely insisting upon carrying them herself and it would be impossible to describe adequately her allures The electrical touches half caress half defiance the confidential whisperings so that the wily old man in the rear might not hear the surges up against him the recoveries only to surge again these would require a mechanical contrivance which reports not only speech but action and even this might easily fail so subtle was it all Sef Seffy I thought it was his old watch he was auctioning off I wanted it for for a nest egg aha ha ha You must excuse me You wouldn t a bid at all if you d knowed it was me I reckon said Seffy Yes I would declared the coquette I d rather have you than any nest egg in the whole world any two of em and when he did not take his chance if they were made of gold But then she spoiled it It s worse fellows than you Seffy The touch of coquetry was but too apparent And better said Seffy with a lump in his throat I know I ain t no good with girls and I don t care Yes she assented wickedly There are better ones Sam Pritz Sally looked away smiled and was silent Sulky Seffy she finally said If he does stink of salt mackerel and most always drunk Seffy went on bitterly He s nothing but a molasses tapper Sally began to drift farther away and to sing Calling Pritz names was of no consequence except that it kept Seffy from making love to her while he was doing it which seemed foolish to Sally The old man came up and brought them together again Oach go long and make lofe some more I like to see it I expect I am an old fool but I like to see it it s like ol times yas and if you don t look out there Seffy I ll take a hand myself yassir go long He drew them very close together each looking the other way Indeed he held them there for a moment roughly Seffy stole a glance at Sally He wanted to see how she was taking his father s odiously intimate suggestion But it happened that Sally wanted to see how he was taking it She laughed with the frankest of joy as their eyes met Seffy I do like you said the coquette And you ought to know it You imp Now this was immensely stimulating to the bashful Seffy I like you he said ever since we was babies Sef I don t believe you Or you wouldn t waste your time so about Sam Pritz Er Sally where you going to to night Seffy meant to prove himself And Sally answered with a little fright at the sudden aggressiveness she had procured Nowheres that I know of Well may I set up with you The pea green sunbonnet could not conceal the utter amazement and then the radiance which shot into Sally s face Set up with me Yes said Seffy almost savagely That s what I said Oh I I guess so Yes of course she answered variously and rushed off home You know I own you she laughed back as if she had not been sufficiently explicit I paid for you Your pappy s got the money I ll expect my property to night Yas shouted the happy old man and begoshens it s a reg lar bargain Ain t it Seffy You her property real estate hereditaments and tenements And even Seffy was drawn into the joyous laughing conceit of it Had he not just done the bravest thing of his small life Yes he cried after the fascinating Sally For sure and certain to night It s a bargain cried she For better or worser richer or poorer up an down in an out chassez right and left Aha ha ha Aha ha ha But Seffy and the happy father turned to the happy son and hugged him don t you efer forgit that she s a feather head and got a bright red temper like her daddy And they both work mighty bad together sometimes When you get her at the right place onct well nail her down hand and feet so s she can t git away When she gits mad her little brain evaporates and if she had a knife she d go round stabbing her best friends that s the only sing that safes her yas and us no knife If she had a knife it would be funerals following her all the time II They advanced together now Seffy s father whistling some tune that was never heard before on earth and with his arm in that of his son they watched Sally bounding away Once more as she leaped a fence she looked laughingly back The old man whistled wildly out of tune Seffy waved a hand Now you shouting Seffy Shout ag in I didn t say a word Well it ain t too late Go on Now Seffy understood and laughed with his father Nice gal Sef Seffy Yes admitted Seffy with reserve Healthy Seffy agreed to this also No doctor bills his father amplified Seffy said nothing Entire orphen She s got a granny Yas chuckled the old man at the way his son was drifting into the situation thinking about granny but Sally owns the farm Uhu said Seffy whatever that might mean And Sally s the boss Silence And granny won t object to any one Sally marries anyhow she dassent She d git licked Who said anything about marrying Seffy was speciously savage now as any successful wooer might be Nobody but me sank you said the old man with equally specious meekness Look how she ken jump a six rail fence Like a three year filly She s a nice gal Seffy and the farms j ine together her pasture field and our corn field And she s kissing her hand backwards At me or you Seffy Seffy said he didn t know And he did not return the kiss though he yearned to Well I bet a dollar that the first initial of his last name is Sephenijah P Baumgartner Junior Well said Seffy with a great flourish I m going to set up with her to night Oach git out Sef though he knew it You ll see No I won t said his father I wouldn t be so durn mean Nossir Seffy grinned at this subtle foolery and his courage continued to grow I m going to wear my high hat he announced with his nose quite in the air No Sef said the old man with a wonderful inflection facing him about that he might look into his determined face For it must be explained that the stovepipe hat in that day and that country was dedicated only to the most momentous social occasions and that consequently gentlemen wore it to go courting Yes declared Seffy again Bring forth the stovepipe The stovepipe the stovepipe chanted Seffy s frivolous father in the way of the Anvil Chorus And my butterfly necktie with Wiss the di mond on whispered his father They laughed in confidence of their secret Seffy the successful wooer was thawing out again The diamond was not a diamond at all the Hebrew who sold it to Seffy had confessed as much But he also swore that if it were kept in perfect polish no one but a diamond merchant could tell the difference Therefore there being no diamond merchant anywhere near and the jewel being always immaculate Seffy presented it as a diamond and had risen perceptibly in the opinion of the vicinage And and and Sef Seffy what you goin to do Do Seffy had been absorbed in what he was going to wear Yas yas that s the most important He encircled Seffy s waist and gently squeezed it Oh of course Hah But what yit I regret to say that Seffy did not understand Seffy he said impressively you haf tol me what you goin to wear It ain t much The weather s yit pooty colonel nights But I ken stand it if you ken God knows about Sally Now what you goin to do that s the conuntrum I ast you Still it was not clear to Seffy Why what I m a going to do hah Why whatever occurs Gosh a mighty And nefer say a word or do a sing to help the occurrences along Goshens What a setting up Why say Seffy what you set up for Seffy did not exactly know He had never hoped to practise the thing in that sublimely militant phase What do you think Well Sef plow straight to her heart I wisht I had your chance I d show you a other guess kind a setting up yassir Make your mouth warter and your head swim begoshens Why that Sally s just like a young stubble field got to be worked constant and plowed deep and manured heafy and mebby drained wiss blind ditches and crops changed constant and kep a going thataway constant constant so s the weeds can t git in her Then you ken put her in wheat after a while and git your money back This drastic metaphor had its effect Seffy began to understand He said so Now look here Seffy his father went on more softly when you git to this and this and this he went through his pantomime again and it included a progressive caressing to the kissing point well chust when you bose comfortable hah mebby on one cheer what I know it s so long sence I done it myself when you bose comfortable ast her chust ast her aham what she ll take for the pasture field She owns you bose and she can t use bose you and the pasture A bird in the hand is worth seferal in another feller s not so But Seffy only stopped and stared at his father This again he did not understand You know well enough I got no money to buy no pasture field said he Gosh a mighty said the old man joyfully making as if he would strike Seffy with his huge fist a thing he often did And ain t got nossing to trade Nothing except the mare said the boy Say ain t you got no feelings you idjiot Oh said Seffy And then But what s feelings got to do with cow pasture Oach No wonder he wants to be an anchel and wiss the anchels stand holding sings in his hands and on his head He s too good for this wile world He d linger shifering on the brink and fear to launch away all his durn life if some one didn t push him in So here goes This was spoken to

again with a huge ahem And the tune his father whistled as he opened the door for him sounded something like I want to be an angel But not to buy no pasture land warned Seffy Oach no of course not

array himself as he had threatened And when it was all done you wouldn t have known him you wouldn t have cared to know him For his fine yellow hair was changed to an ugly brown by the patent hair oil with which he had dressed it and you would not have liked its fragrance I trust Bergamot I think it was His fine young throat was garroted within a starched standing collar his feet were pinched in creaking boots his hands close gauntleted in buckskin gloves and he altogether incomparable uncomfortable and triumphant Down stairs his father paced the floor watch in hand From time to time he would call out the hour like a watchman on a minaret At last Look a yere Seffy it s about two inches apast seven and by the time you git there say nefer gif another feller a chance to git there afore you or

tack Thus spoke A Joke With boastful croak And as he said Upon his head He stood and waited for the tread Of thoughtless wight Who in the night Gets up arrayed in garments white And indiscreet With unshod feet Prowls round for something good to eat But other Jokes His speech provokes And old and bald and lame and gray With loftiest scorn they say him Nay And bid him hold his unweaned tongue For they were blind ere he was young So hot They grew This complot Crew They laid a plan To catch a Man That all the clan Might then trepan His skull with Jokes they thus began First Mule his heel its skill to try Amid his ribs like lightning laid And back recoiled he well knew why Insurance Man he faintly sayed Next Stove Pipe rushed as hot as fire Put up he cried in accents bold With Elbow joint he struck the lyre And knocked the Weather Prophet cold But thou Ice Cream with hair so gray Three thousand years before the Flood Cold bitter cold will be the day Thou dost not warm the Jester s blood Spoons for the spooney was her ancient song That with slow measure dragged its deathless length along And longer had she sung but with a frown Old Pie impatient rose And roared Behold I am the Funny Clown And without me there is no Joke that goes To every Jester in the land I lend my omnipresent hand I ve filled in Jokes of every grade Since ever Jokes and Pies were made Sewed pegged and pasted glued or cast If not the first of Jokes I ll be the last With heart unripe and mottled hide Pale summer watermeloncholly sighed And but the Muse would find it vain To give a list of all the train The hairless purblind toothless crew That burst on Man s astonished view The Bull dog and the Garden gate The Girl s Papa in wrathful state Ma ma in law the Leathern Clam The Woodshed Cat the Rampant Ram The Fly the Goat the Skating Rink The Paste brush plunging in the Ink The Baby wailing in the Dark The Songs they sang upon the Ark Things that were old when Earth was new And as they lived still old and older grew And as these Jokes about him cried And all their Ancient Arts upon him tried Their hapless victim Man lay down and died A BOY S VIEW OF IT BY FRANK L STANTON Mother she

card THE COLONEL S CLOTHES BY CAROLINE HOWARD GILMAN Every man has some peculiar taste or preference and I think though papa dressed with great elegance his was a decided love of his old clothes his garments like his friends became dearer to him from their wear and tear in his service and they were deposited successively in his dressing room though mamma thought them quite unfit for him He averred that he required his old hunting suits for accidents his summer jackets and vests though faded were the coolest in the world his worm eaten but warm roquelaure was admirable for riding about the fields et cetera In vain mamma represented the economy of cutting up some for the boys and giving others to the servants he would not consent nor part with articles in which he said he felt at home Often did mamma remonstrate against the dressing room s looking like a haberdasher s shop often did she take down a coat hold it up to the light and show him perforations that would have honored New Orleans or Waterloo often while Chloe was flogging the pantaloons which ungallantly kicked in return did she declare that it was a sin and a shame for her master to have such things in the house still the anti cherubic shapes accumulated on the nails and hooks and were even considered as of sufficient importance to be preserved from the fire at the burning of Roseland Our little circle about this time was animated by a visit from a peddler As soon as he was perceived crossing the lawn with a large basket on his arm and a bundle slung across a stick on his shoulder a stir commenced in the house Mamma assumed an air of importance and responsibility I felt a pleasurable excitement Chloe s and Flora s eyes twinkled with expectation while from different quarters the house servants entered standing with eyes and mouth silently open as the peddler after depositing his basket and deliberately untying his bundle offered his goods to our inspection He was a stout man with a dark complexion pitted with the small pox and spoke in a foreign accent I confess that I yielded myself to the pleasure of purchasing some gewgaws which I afterward gave to Flora while mamma looked at the glass and plated ware Ver sheap said the peddler following her eye and taking up a pair of glass pitchers only two dollar sheap as dirt If te lady hash any old closhes it is petter as money Mamma took the pitchers in her hand with an inquisitorial air balanced them knocked them with her small knuckles they rang as clear as a bell examined the glass there was not a flaw in it Chloe went through the same process they looked significantly at each other nodded set the pitchers on the slab and gave a little approbatory cough They are certainly very cheap said mamma tentatively They is for true my mistress said Chloe with solemnity and more handsomer than missus Whitney s that she gin six dollars for at Charleston Chloe said mamma were not those pantaloons you were shaking to day quite shrunk and worn out Yes ma am said she and they don t fit nohow The last time the colonel wore them he seemed quite on restless Just step up said her mistress and bring them down but stay what did you say was the price of these candlesticks sir Tish only von dollars but tish more cheaper for te old closhes If te lady will get te old closhes I will put in te pellows and te prush and it ish more sheaper too Chloe and mamma looked at each other and raised their eyebrows I will just step up and see those pantaloons said mamma in a consulting tone It will be a mercy to the colonel to clear out some of that rubbish I am confident he can never wear the pantaloons again they are rubbed in the knees and require seating and he never will wear seated pantaloons These things are unusually cheap and the colonel told me lately we were in want of a few little matters of this sort Thus saying with a significant whisper to me to watch the peddler she disappeared with Chloe They soon returned Chloe bearing a variety of garments for mamma had taken the important premier pas The pantaloons were first produced The peddler took them in his hand which flew up like an empty scale to show how light they were he held them up to the sun and a half contemptuous smile crossed his lips then shaking his head he threw them down beside his basket A drab overcoat was next inspected and was also thrown aside with a doubtful expression mister Peddler said mamma in a very soft tone you must allow me a fair price these are very excellent articles Oh ver fair said he but te closhes ish not ver goot te closhesman is not going to give me noting for dish and he laid a waistcoat on the other two articles Mamma and Chloe had by this time reached the depths of the basket and with sympathetic exclamations arranged several articles on the slab You will let me have these pitchers said mamma with a look of concentrated resolution for that very nice pair of pantaloons The peddler gave a short whistle expressive of contempt shook his head and said Tish not possibles I will give two pishers and von prush for te pantaloon and waistcoat Mamma and Chloe glanced at each other and at me I was absorbed in my own bargains and said carelessly that the pitchers were perfect beauties Chloe pushed one pitcher a little forward mamma pushed the other on a parallel line then poised a decanter and again applied her delicate knuckles for the test That too rang out the musical unbroken sound so dear to the housewife s ear and with a pair of plated candlesticks was deposited on the table The peddler took up the drab overcoat Te closhesman s give noting for dish Mamma looked disconcerted The expression of her face implied the fear that the peddler would not even accept it as a gift Chloe and she held a whispering consultation At this moment Binah came in with little Patsey who seeing the articles on the slab pointed with her dimpled fingers and said her only words Pretty pretty At the same moment Lafayette and Venus the two little novices in furniture rubbing exclaimed Ki if dem ting an t shine too much These opinions made the turning point in mamma s mind though coming from such insignificant sources So they are pretty my darling said mamma to Patsey and then turning to the peddler she asked him what he would give in exchange for the pantaloons the waistcoat and the coat The peddler set aside two decanters one pitcher the plated candlesticks and a hearth brush Tish ver goot pargains for te lady said he Mamma gained courage I can not think of letting you have all these things without something more You must at least throw in that little tray and she looked at a small scarlet one worth perhaps a quarter of a dollar The peddler hesitated and held it up so that the morning sun shone on its bright hues I shall not make a bargain without that said mamma resolutely The peddler sighed and laying it with the selected articles said Tish ver great pargains for te lady Mamma smiled triumphantly and the peddler tying up his bundle and slinging his stick departed with an air of humility Papa s voice was soon heard as usual before he was seen Rub down Beauty Mark and tell Diggory to call out the hounds There was a slight embarrassment in mamma s manner when he entered mingled with the same quantity of bravado He nodded to her tapped me on the head with his riding whip gave Patsey a kiss as she stretched out her arms to him tossed her in the air and returning her to her nurse was passing on Do stop Colonel said mamma and admire my bargains See this cut glass and plate that we have been wishing for to save our best set What this trash said he pausing a moment at the table blown glass and washed brass Who has been fooling you Colonel said mamma coloring highly how can you I can not stop a minute now wife said he Jones and Ferguson are for a hunt to day They are waiting at Drake s corner It looks like falling weather and my old drab will come in well to day Mamma looked frightened and he passed on up stairs He was one of those gentlemen who keep a house alive as the phrase is whether in merriment or the contrary and we were always prepared to search for his hat or whip or slippers which he was confident he put in their places but which by some miracle were often in opposite directions Our greatest trial however was with mamma s and his spectacles for they had four pairs between them far sighted and near sighted There were indeed optical delusions practiced with them for when papa wanted his they were hidden behind some pickle jar and when mamma had carefully placed hers in her key basket they were generally found in one of papa s various pockets when a distant object was to be seen he was sure to mount the near sighted and cry Pshaw and if a splinter was to be taken out nothing could be found but the far sighted ones and he said something worse sometimes all four pairs were missing and such a scampering ensued We now heard a great outcry up stairs Wife Chloe Cornelia come and find my drab coat We looked at each other in dismay but papa was not a man for delay and we obeyed his summons Wife said he beating aside the externals of man that hung about his dressing room where is my old drab coat Mamma swallowed as if a dry artichoke was in her throat as she said slowly Why colonel you know you had not worn that coat for months and as you have another one and a roquelaure and the coat was full of moth holes I exchanged it with the peddler for cut glass and plate Cut devils said papa who liked to soften an oath by combinations it was worth twenty dollars yes more because I felt at home in it I hate new coats as I do But colonel interrupted mamma you did not see the scarlet tray and the Scarlet nonsense shouted papa I believe if they could women would sell their husbands to those rascally peddlers Beauty and the hounds were now pronounced ready I followed papa to the piazza and heard his wrath rolling off as he cantered
