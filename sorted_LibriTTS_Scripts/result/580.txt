The first ray of light which illumines the gloom and converts into a dazzling brilliancy that obscurity in which the earlier history of the public career of the immortal Pickwick would appear to be involved is derived from the perusal of the following entry in the Transactions of the Pickwick Club which the editor of these papers feels the highest pleasure in laying before his readers as a proof of the careful attention indefatigable assiduity and nice discrimination with which his search among the multifarious documents confided to him has been conducted May twelve eighteen twenty seven Joseph Smiggers esquire P V P M P C Perpetual Vice President Member Pickwick Club presiding The following resolutions unanimously agreed to That this Association has heard read with feelings of unmingled satisfaction and unqualified approval the paper communicated by Samuel Pickwick esquire G C M P C General Chairman Member Pickwick Club entitled Speculations on the Source of the Hampstead Ponds with some Observations on the Theory of Tittlebats and that this Association does hereby return its warmest thanks to the said Samuel Pickwick esquire G C M P C for the same That while this Association is deeply sensible of the advantages which must accrue to the cause of science from the production to which they have just adverted no less than from the unwearied researches of Samuel Pickwick esquire G C M P C in Hornsey Highgate Brixton and Camberwell they cannot but entertain a lively sense of the inestimable benefits which must inevitably result from carrying the speculations of that learned man into a wider field from extending his travels and consequently enlarging his sphere of observation to the advancement of knowledge and the diffusion of learning That with the view just mentioned this Association has taken into its serious consideration a proposal emanating from the aforesaid Samuel Pickwick esquire G C M P C and three other Pickwickians hereinafter named for forming a new branch of United Pickwickians under the title of The Corresponding Society of the Pickwick Club That the said proposal has received the sanction and approval of this Association That the Corresponding Society of the Pickwick Club is therefore hereby constituted and that Samuel Pickwick esquire G C M P C Tracy Tupman esquire M P C Augustus Snodgrass esquire M P C and Nathaniel Winkle esquire M P C are hereby nominated and appointed members of the same and that they be requested to forward from time to time authenticated accounts of their journeys and investigations of their observations of character and manners and of the whole of their adventures together with all tales and papers to which local scenery or associations may give rise to the Pickwick Club stationed in London That this Association cordially recognises the principle of every member of the Corresponding Society defraying his own travelling expenses and that it sees no objection whatever to the members of the said society pursuing their inquiries for any length of time they please upon the same terms That the members of the aforesaid Corresponding Society be and are hereby informed that their proposal to pay the postage of their letters and the carriage of their parcels has been deliberated upon by this Association that this Association considers such proposal worthy of the great minds from which it emanated and that it hereby signifies its perfect acquiescence therein A casual observer adds the secretary to whose notes we are indebted for the following account a casual observer might possibly have remarked nothing extraordinary in the bald head and circular spectacles which were intently turned towards his the secretary s face during the reading of the above resolutions to those who knew that the gigantic brain of Pickwick was working beneath that forehead and that the beaming eyes of Pickwick were twinkling behind those glasses the sight was indeed an interesting one There sat the man who had traced to their source the mighty ponds of Hampstead and agitated the scientific world with his Theory of Tittlebats as calm and unmoved as the deep waters of the one on a frosty day or as a solitary specimen of the other in the inmost recesses of an earthen jar And how much more interesting did the spectacle be

none	none	when starting into full life and animation as a simultaneous call for Pickwick burst from his followers that illustrious man slowly mounted into the Windsor chair on which he had been previously seated and addressed the club himself had founded What a study for an artist did that exciting scene present The eloquent Pickwick with one hand gracefully concealed behind his coat tails and the other waving in air to assist his glowing declamation his elevated position revealing those tights and gaiters which had they clothed an ordinary man might have passed without observation but which when Pickwick clothed them if we may use the expression inspired involuntary awe and respect surrounded by the men who had volunteered to share the perils of his travels and who were destined to participate in the glories of his discoveries On his right sat mister Tracy Tupman the too susceptible Tupman who to the wisdom and experience of maturer years superadded the enthusiasm and ardour of a boy in the most interesting and pardonable of human weaknesses love Time and feeding had expanded that once romantic form the black silk waistcoat had become more and more developed inch by inch had the gold watch chain beneath it disappeared from within the range of Tupman s vision and gradually had the capacious chin encroached upon the borders of the white cravat but the soul of Tupman had known no change admiration of the fair sex was still its ruling passion On the left of his great leader sat the poetic Snodgrass and near him again the sporting Winkle the former poetically enveloped in a mysterious blue cloak with a canine skin collar and the latter communicating additional lustre to a new green shooting coat plaid neckerchief and closely fitted drabs mister Pickwick s oration upon this occasion together with the debate thereon is entered on the Transactions of the Club Both bear a strong affinity to the discussions of other celebrated bodies and as it is always interesting to trace a resemblance between the proceedings of great men we transfer the entry to these pages mister Pickwick observed says the secretary that fame was dear to the heart of every man Poetic fame was dear to the heart of his friend Snodgrass the fame of conquest was equally dear to his friend Tupman and the desire of earning fame in the sports of the field the air and the water was uppermost in the breast of his friend Winkle He mister Pickwick would not deny that he was influenced by human passions and human feelings cheers possibly by human weaknesses loud cries of No but this he would say that if ever the fire of self importance broke out in his bosom the desire to benefit the human race in preference effectually quenched it The praise of mankind was his swing philanthropy was his insurance office Vehement cheering He had felt some pride he acknowledged it freely and let his enemies make the most of it he had felt some pride when he presented his Tittlebatian Theory to the world it might be celebrated or it might not A cry of It is and great cheering He would take the assertion of that honourable Pickwickian whose voice he had just heard it was celebrated but if the fame of that treatise were to extend to the farthest confines of the known world the pride with which he should reflect on the authorship of that production would be as nothing compared with the pride with which he looked around him on this the proudest moment of his existence Cheers He was a humble individual No no Still he could not but feel that they had selected him for a service of great honour and of some danger Travelling was in a troubled state and the minds of coachmen were unsettled Let them look abroad and contemplate the scenes which were enacting around them Stage coaches were upsetting in all directions horses were bolting boats were overturning and boilers were bursting Cheers a voice No No Cheers Let that honourable Pickwickian who cried No so loudly come forward and deny it if he could Cheers Who was it that cried No Enthusiastic cheering Was it some vain and disappointed man he would not say haberdasher loud cheers who jealous of the praise which had been perhaps undeservedly bestowed on his mister Pickwick s researches and smarting under the censure which had been heaped upon his own feeble attempts at rivalry now took this vile and calumnious mode of mister BLOTTON of Aldgate rose to order Did the honourable Pickwickian allude to him Cries of Order Chair
1265_135635_000090_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes 
none	none	No Go on Leave off et cetera mister PICKWICK would not put up to be put down by clamour He had alluded to the honourable gentleman Great excitement mister BLOTTON would only say then that he repelled the honorable gent s false and scurrilous accusation with profound contempt Great cheering The honorable gent was a humbug Immense confusion and loud cries of Chair and Order mister A SNODGRASS rose to order He threw himself upon the chair Hear He wished to know whether this disgraceful contest between two members of that club should be allowed to continue Hear hear The CHAIRMAN was quite sure the honorable Pickwickian would withdraw the expression he had just made use of mister BLOTTON with all possible respect for the chair was quite sure he would not The CHAIRMAN felt it his imperative duty to demand of the honourable gentleman whether he had used the expression which had just escaped him in a common sense mister BLOTTON had no hesitation in saying that he had not he had used the word in its Pickwickian sense Hear hear He was bound to acknowledge that personally he entertained the highest regard and esteem for the honourable gentleman he had merely considered him a humbug in a Pickwickian point of view Hear hear mister PICKWICK felt much gratified by the fair candid and full explanation of his honourable friend He begged it to be at once understood that his own observations had been merely intended to bear a Pickwickian construction Cheers Here the entry terminates as we have no doubt the debate did also after arriving at such a highly satisfactory and intelligible point We have no official statement of the facts which the reader will find recorded in the next chapter but they have been carefully collated from letters and other MS authorities so unquestionably genuine as to justify their narration in a connected form CHAPTER II THE FIRST DAY S JOURNEY AND THE FIRST EVENING S ADVENTURES WITH THEIR CONSEQUENCES That punctual servant of all work the sun had just risen and begun to strike a light on the morning of the thirteenth of May one thousand eight hundred and twenty seven when mister Samuel Pickwick burst like another sun from his slumbers threw open his chamber window and looked out upon the world beneath Goswell Street was at his feet Goswell Street was on his right hand as far as the eye could reach Goswell Street extended on his left and the opposite side of Goswell Street was over the way Such thought mister Pickwick are the narrow views of those philosophers who content with examining the things that lie before them look not to the truths which are hidden beyond As
1265_135635_000083_000000	train-clean-360	 well 
none	none	might I be content to gaze on Goswell Street for ever without one effort to penetrate to the hidden countries which on every side surround it And having given vent to this beautiful reflection mister Pickwick proceeded to put himself into his clothes and his clothes into his portmanteau Great men are seldom over scrupulous in the arrangement of their attire the operation of shaving dressing and coffee imbibing was soon performed and in another hour mister Pickwick with his portmanteau in his hand his telescope in his greatcoat pocket and his note book in his waistcoat ready for the reception of any discoveries worthy of being noted down had arrived at the coach stand in saint Martin s le Grand Cab said mister Pickwick Here you are sir shouted a strange specimen of the human race in a sackcloth coat and apron of the same who with a brass label and number round his neck looked as if he were catalogued in some collection of rarities This was the waterman Here you are sir Now then fust cab And the first cab having been fetched from the public house where he had been smoking his first pipe mister Pickwick and his portmanteau were thrown into the vehicle Golden Cross said mister Pickwick Only a bob s vorth Tommy cried the driver sulkily for the information of his friend the waterman as the cab drove off How old is that horse my friend inquired mister Pickwick rubbing his nose with the shilling he had reserved for the fare Forty two replied the driver eyeing him askant What ejaculated mister Pickwick laying his hand upon his note book The driver reiterated his former statement mister Pickwick looked very hard at the man s face but his features were immovable so he noted down the fact forthwith And how long do you keep him out at a time inquired mister Pickwick searching for further information Two or three veeks replied the man Weeks said mister Pickwick in astonishment and out came the note book again He lives at Pentonwil when he s at home observed the driver coolly but we seldom takes him home on account of his weakness On account of his weakness reiterated the perplexed mister Pickwick He always falls down when he s took out o the cab continued the driver but when he s in it we bears him up werry tight and takes him in werry short so as he can t werry well fall down and we ve got a pair o precious large wheels on so ven he does move they run after him and he must go on he can t help it mister Pickwick entered every word of this statement in his note book with the view of communicating it to the club as a singular instance of the tenacity of life in horses under trying circumstances The entry was scarcely completed when they reached the Golden Cross Down jumped the driver and out got mister Pickwick mister Tupman mister Snodgrass and mister Winkle who had been anxiously waiting the arrival of their illustrious leader crowded to welcome him Here s your fare said mister Pickwick holding out the shilling to the driver What was the learned man s astonishment when that unaccountable person flung the money on the pavement and requested in figurative terms to be allowed the pleasure of fighting him mister Pickwick for the amount You are mad said mister Snodgrass Or drunk said mister Winkle Or both said mister Tupman Come on said the cab driver sparring away like clockwork Come on all four on you Here s a lark shouted half a dozen hackney coachmen Go to vork Sam and they crowded with great glee round the party What s the row Sam inquired one gentleman in black calico sleeves Row replied the cabman what did he want my number for I didn t want your number said the astonished mister Pickwick What did you take it for then inquired the cabman I didn t take it said mister Pickwick indignantly Would anybody believe continued the cab driver appealing to the crowd would anybody believe as an informer ud go about in a man s cab not only takin down his number but ev ry word he says into the bargain a light flashed upon mister Pickwick it was the note book Did he though inquired another cabman Yes did he replied the first and then arter aggerawatin me to assault him gets three witnesses here to prove it But I ll give it him if I ve six months for it Come on and the cabman dashed his hat upon the ground with a reckless disregard of his own private property and knocked mister Pickwick s spectacles off and followed up the attack with a blow on mister Pickwick s nose and another on mister Pickwick s chest and a third in mister Snodgrass s eye and a fourth by way of variety in mister Tupman s waistcoat and then danced into the road and then back again to the pavement and finally dashed the whole temporary supply of breath out of mister Winkle s body and all in half a dozen seconds Where s an officer said mister Snodgrass Put em under the pump suggested a hot pieman You shall smart for this gasped mister Pickwick Informers shouted the crowd Come on cried the cabman who had been sparring without cessation the whole time The mob hitherto had been passive spectators of the scene but as the intelligence of the Pickwickians being informers was spread among them they began to canvass with considerable vivacity the propriety of enforcing the heated pastry vendor s proposition and there is no saying what acts of personal aggression they might have committed had not the affray been unexpectedly terminated by the interposition of a new comer What s the fun said a rather tall thin young man in a green coat emerging suddenly from the coach yard informers shouted the crowd again We are not roared mister Pickwick in a tone which to any dispassionate listener carried conviction with it Ain t you though ain t you said the young man appealing to mister Pickwick and making his way through the crowd by the infallible process of elbowing the countenances of its component members That learned man in a few hurried words explained the real state of the case Come along then said he of the green coat lugging mister Pickwick after him by main force and talking the whole way Here No nine hundred twenty four take your fare and take yourself off respectable gentleman know him well none of your nonsense this way sir where s your friends all a mistake I see never mind accidents will happen best regulated families never say die down upon your luck Pull him UP Put that in his pipe like the flavour damned rascals And with a lengthened string of similar broken sentences delivered with extraordinary volubility the stranger led the way to the traveller s waiting room whither he was closely followed by mister Pickwick and his disciples Here waiter shouted the stranger ringing the bell with tremendous violence glasses round brandy and water hot and strong and sweet and plenty eye damaged Sir Waiter raw beef steak for the gentleman s eye nothing like raw beef steak for a bruise sir cold lamp post very good but lamp post inconvenient damned odd standing in the open street half an hour with your eye against a lamp post eh very good ha ha And the stranger without stopping to take breath swallowed at a draught full half a pint of the reeking brandy and water and flung himself into a chair with as much ease as if nothing uncommon had occurred While his three companions were busily engaged in proffering their thanks to their new acquaintance mister Pickwick had leisure to examine his costume and appearance He was about the middle height but the thinness of his body and the length of his legs gave him the appearance of being much taller The green coat had been a smart dress garment in the days of swallow tails but had evidently in those times adorned a much shorter man than the stranger for the soiled and faded sleeves scarcely reached to his wrists It was buttoned closely up to his chin at the imminent hazard of splitting the back and an old stock without a vestige of shirt collar ornamented his neck His scanty black trousers displayed here and there those shiny patches which bespeak long service and were strapped very tightly over a pair of patched and mended shoes as if to conceal the dirty white stockings which were nevertheless distinctly visible His long black hair escaped in negligent waves from beneath each side of his old pinched up hat and glimpses of his bare wrists might be observed between the tops of his gloves and the cuffs of his coat sleeves His face was thin and haggard but an indescribable air of jaunty impudence and perfect self possession pervaded the whole man Such was the individual on whom mister Pickwick gazed through his spectacles which he had fortunately recovered and to whom he proceeded when his friends had exhausted themselves to return in chosen terms his warmest thanks for his recent assistance Never mind said the stranger cutting the address very short said enough no more smart chap that cabman handled his fives well but if I d been your friend in the green jemmy damn me punch his head cod I would pig s whisper pieman too no gammon This coherent speech was interrupted by the entrance of the Rochester coachman to announce that the Commodore was on the point of starting Commodore said the stranger starting up my coach place booked one outside leave you to pay for the brandy and water want change for a five bad silver Brummagem buttons won t do no go eh and he shook his head most knowingly Now it so happened that mister Pickwick and his three companions had resolved to make Rochester their first halting place too and having intimated to their new found acquaintance that they were journeying to the same city they agreed to occupy the seat at the back of the coach where they could all sit together Up with you said the stranger assisting mister Pickwick on to the roof with so much precipitation as to impair the gravity of that gentleman s deportment very materially Any luggage Sir inquired the coachman Who I Brown paper parcel here that s all other luggage gone by water packing cases nailed up big as houses heavy heavy damned heavy replied the stranger as he forced into his pocket as much as he could of the brown paper parcel which presented most suspicious indications of containing one shirt and a handkerchief Heads heads take care of your heads cried the loquacious stranger as they came out under the low archway which in those days formed the entrance to the coach yard Terrible place dangerous work other day five children mother tall lady eating sandwiches forgot the arch crash knock children look round mother s head off sandwich in her hand no mouth to put it in head of a family off shocking shocking Looking at Whitehall sir fine place little window somebody else s head off there eh sir he didn t keep a sharp look out enough either eh Sir eh I am ruminating said mister Pickwick on the strange mutability of human affairs Ah I see in at the palace door one day out at the window the next Philosopher Sir An observer of human nature Sir said mister Pickwick Ah so am I Most people are when they ve little to do and less to get Poet Sir My friend mister Snodgrass has a strong poetic turn said mister Pickwick So have I said the stranger Epic poem ten thousand lines revolution of July composed it on the spot Mars by day Apollo by night bang the field piece twang the lyre You were present at that glorious scene sir said mister Snodgrass Present think I was fired a musket fired with an idea rushed into wine shop wrote it down back again whiz bang another idea wine shop again pen and ink back again cut and slash noble time Sir Sportsman sir abruptly turning to mister Winkle A remarkable instance of the prophetic force of mister Jingle s imagination this dialogue occurring in the year eighteen twenty seven and the Revolution in eighteen thirty A little Sir replied that gentleman Fine pursuit sir fine pursuit Dogs Sir Not just now said mister Winkle Ah you should keep dogs fine animals sagacious creatures dog of my own once pointer surprising instinct out shooting one day entering inclosure whistled dog stopped whistled again Ponto no go stock still called him Ponto Ponto wouldn t move dog transfixed staring at a board looked up saw an inscription Gamekeeper has orders to shoot all dogs found in this inclosure wouldn t pass it wonderful dog valuable dog that very Singular circumstance that said mister Pickwick Will you allow me to make a note of it Certainly Sir certainly hundred more anecdotes of the same animal Fine girl Sir to mister Tracy Tupman who had been bestowing sundry anti Pickwickian glances on a young lady by the roadside Very said mister Tupman English girls not so fine as Spanish noble creatures jet hair black eyes lovely forms sweet creatures beautiful You have been in Spain sir said mister Tracy Tupman Lived there ages Many conquests sir inquired mister Tupman Conquests Thousands Don Bolaro Fizzgig grandee only daughter Donna Christina splendid creature loved me to distraction jealous father high souled daughter handsome Englishman Donna Christina in despair prussic acid stomach pump in my portmanteau operation performed old Bolaro in ecstasies consent to our union join hands and floods of tears romantic story very Is the lady in England now sir inquired mister Tupman on whom the description of her charms had produced a powerful impression Dead sir dead said the stranger applying to his right eye the brief remnant of a very old cambric handkerchief Never recovered the stomach pump undermined constitution fell a victim And her father inquired the poetic Snodgrass Remorse and misery replied the stranger Sudden disappearance talk of the whole city search made everywhere without success public fountain in the great square suddenly ceased playing weeks elapsed still a stoppage workmen employed to clean it water drawn off father in law discovered sticking head first in the main pipe with a full confession in his right boot took him out and the fountain played away again as well as ever Will you allow me to note that little romance down Sir said mister Snodgrass deeply affected Certainly Sir certainly fifty more if you like to hear em strange life mine rather curious history not extraordinary but singular In this strain with an occasional glass of ale by way of parenthesis when the coach changed horses did the stranger proceed until they reached Rochester bridge by which time the note books both of mister Pickwick and mister Snodgrass were completely filled with selections from his adventures Magnificent ruin said mister Augustus Snodgrass with all the poetic fervour that distinguished him when they came in sight of the fine old castle What a sight for an antiquarian were the very words which fell from mister Pickwick s mouth as he applied his telescope to his eye Ah fine place said the stranger glorious pile frowning walls tottering arches dark nooks crumbling staircases old cathedral too earthy smell pilgrims feet wore away the old steps little Saxon doors confessionals like money takers boxes at theatres queer customers those monks popes and lord treasurers and all sorts of old fellows with great red faces and broken noses turning up every day buff jerkins too match locks sarcophagus fine place old legends too strange stories capital and the stranger continued to soliloquise until they reached the Bull Inn in the High Street where the coach stopped Do you remain here Sir inquired mister Nathaniel Winkle Here not I but you d better good house nice beds Wright s next house dear very dear half a crown in the bill if you look at the waiter charge you more if you dine at a friend s than they would if you dined in the coffee room rum fellows very mister Winkle turned to mister Pickwick and murmured a few words a whisper passed from mister Pickwick to mister Snodgrass from mister Snodgrass to mister Tupman and nods of assent were exchanged mister Pickwick addressed the stranger You rendered us a very important service this morning sir said he will you allow us to offer a slight mark of our gratitude by begging the favour of your company at dinner Great pleasure not presume to dictate but broiled fowl and mushrooms capital thing What time Let me see replied mister Pickwick referring to his watch it is now nearly three Shall we say five Suit me excellently said the stranger five precisely till then care of yourselves and lifting the pinched up hat a few inches from his head and carelessly replacing it very much on one side the stranger with half the brown paper parcel sticking out of his pocket walked briskly up the yard and turned into the High Street Evidently a traveller in many countries and a close observer of men and things said mister Pickwick I should like to see his poem said mister Snodgrass I should like to have seen that dog said mister Winkle mister Tupman said nothing but he thought of Donna Christina the stomach pump and the fountain and his eyes filled with tears A private sitting room having been engaged bedrooms inspected and dinner ordered the party walked out to view the city and adjoining neighbourhood We do not find from a careful perusal of mister Pickwick s notes of the four towns Stroud Rochester Chatham and Brompton that his impressions of their appearance differ in any material point from those of other travellers who have gone over the same ground His general description is easily abridged The principal productions of these towns says mister Pickwick appear to be soldiers sailors Jews chalk shrimps officers and dockyard men The commodities chiefly exposed for sale in the public streets are marine stores hard bake apples flat fish and oysters The streets present a lively and animated appearance occasioned chiefly by the conviviality of the military It is truly delightful to a philanthropic mind to see these gallant men staggering along under the influence of an overflow both of animal and ardent spirits more especially when we remember that the following them about and jesting with them affords a cheap and innocent amusement for the boy population Nothing adds mister Pickwick can exceed their good humour It was but the day before my arrival that one of them had been most grossly insulted in the house of a publican The barmaid had positively refused to draw him any more liquor in return for which he had merely in playfulness drawn his bayonet and wounded the girl in the shoulder And yet this fine fellow was the very first to go down to the house next morning and express his readiness to overlook the matter and forget what had occurred The consumption of tobacco in these towns continues mister Pickwick must be very great and the smell which pervades the streets must be exceedingly delicious to those who are extremely fond of smoking A superficial traveller might object to the dirt which is their leading characteristic but to those who view it as an indication of traffic and commercial prosperity it is truly gratifying Punctual to five o clock came the stranger and shortly afterwards the dinner He had divested himself of his brown paper parcel but had made no alteration in his attire and was if possible more loquacious than ever What s that he inquired as the waiter removed one of the covers Soles Sir Soles ah capital fish all come from London stage coach proprietors get up political dinners carriage of soles dozens of baskets cunning fellows Glass of wine Sir With pleasure said mister Pickwick and the stranger took wine first with him and then with mister Snodgrass and then with mister Tupman and then with mister Winkle and then with the whole party together almost as rapidly as he talked Devil of a mess on the staircase waiter said the stranger Forms going up carpenters coming down lamps glasses harps What s going forward Ball Sir said the waiter Assembly eh No Sir not assembly Sir Ball for the benefit of a charity Sir Many fine women in this town do you know Sir inquired mister Tupman with great interest Splendid capital Kent sir everybody knows Kent apples cherries hops and women Glass of wine Sir With great pleasure replied mister Tupman The stranger filled and emptied I should very much like to go said mister Tupman resuming the subject of the ball very much Tickets at the bar Sir interposed the waiter half a guinea each Sir mister Tupman again expressed an earnest wish to be present at the festivity but meeting with no response in the darkened eye of mister Snodgrass or the abstracted gaze of mister Pickwick he applied himself with great interest to the port wine and dessert which had just been placed on the table The waiter withdrew and the party were left to enjoy the cosy couple of hours succeeding dinner Beg your pardon sir said the stranger bottle stands pass it round way of the sun through the button hole no heeltaps and he emptied his glass which he had filled about two minutes before and poured out another with the air of a man who was used to it The wine was passed and a fresh supply ordered The visitor talked the Pickwickians listened mister Tupman felt every moment more disposed for the ball mister Pickwick s countenance glowed with an expression of universal philanthropy and mister Winkle and mister Snodgrass fell fast asleep They re beginning upstairs said the stranger hear the company fiddles tuning now the harp there they go The various sounds which found their way downstairs announced the commencement of the first quadrille How I should like to go said mister Tupman again So should I said the stranger confounded luggage heavy smacks nothing to go in odd ain t it Now general benevolence was one of the leading features of the Pickwickian theory and no one was more remarkable for the zealous manner in which he observed so noble a principle than mister Tracy Tupman The number of instances recorded on the Transactions of the Society in which that excellent man referred objects of charity to the houses of other members for left off garments or pecuniary relief is almost incredible I should be very happy to lend you a change of apparel for the purpose said mister Tracy Tupman but you are rather slim and I am Rather fat grown up Bacchus cut the leaves dismounted from the tub and adopted kersey eh not double distilled but double milled ha ha pass the wine Whether mister Tupman was somewhat indignant at the peremptory tone in which he was desired to pass the wine which the stranger passed so quickly away or whether he felt very properly scandalised at an influential member of the Pickwick Club being ignominiously compared to a dismounted Bacchus is a fact not yet completely ascertained He passed the wine coughed twice and looked at the stranger for several seconds with a stern intensity as that individual however appeared perfectly collected and quite calm under his searching glance he gradually relaxed and reverted to the subject of the ball I was about to observe Sir he said that though my apparel would be too large a suit of my friend mister Winkle s would perhaps fit you better The stranger took mister Winkle s measure with his eye and that feature glistened with satisfaction as he said Just the thing mister Tupman looked round him The wine which had exerted its somniferous influence over mister Snodgrass and mister Winkle had stolen upon the senses of mister Pickwick That gentleman had gradually passed through the various stages which precede the lethargy produced by dinner and its consequences He had undergone the ordinary transitions from the height of conviviality to the depth of misery and from the depth of misery to the height of conviviality Like a gas lamp in the street with the wind in the pipe he had exhibited for a moment an unnatural brilliancy then sank so low as to be scarcely discernible after a short interval he had burst out again to enlighten for a moment then flickered with an uncertain staggering sort of light and then gone out altogether His head was sunk upon his bosom and perpetual snoring with a partial choke occasionally were the only audible indications of the great man s presence The temptation to be present at the ball and to form his first impressions of the beauty of the Kentish ladies was strong upon mister Tupman The temptation to take the stranger with him was equally great He was wholly unacquainted with the place and its inhabitants and the stranger seemed to possess as great a knowledge of both as if he had lived there from his infancy mister Winkle was asleep and mister Tupman had had sufficient experience in such matters to know that the moment he awoke he would in the ordinary course of nature roll heavily to bed He was undecided Fill your glass and pass the wine said the indefatigable visitor mister Tupman did as he was requested and the additional stimulus of the last glass settled his determination Winkle s bedroom is inside mine said mister Tupman I couldn t make him understand what I wanted if I woke him now but I know he has a dress suit in a carpet bag and supposing you wore it to the ball and took it off when we returned I could replace it without troubling him at all about the matter Capital said the stranger famous plan damned odd situation fourteen coats in the packing cases and obliged to wear another man s very good notion that very We must purchase our tickets said mister Tupman Not worth while splitting a guinea said the stranger toss who shall pay for both I call you spin first time woman woman bewitching woman and down came the sovereign with the dragon called by courtesy a woman uppermost mister Tupman rang the bell purchased the tickets and ordered chamber candlesticks In another quarter of an hour the stranger was completely arrayed in a full suit of mister Nathaniel Winkle s It s a new coat said mister Tupman as the stranger surveyed himself with great complacency in a cheval glass the first that s been made with our club button and he called his companions attention to the large gilt button which displayed a bust of mister Pickwick in the centre and the letters P C on either side P C said the stranger queer set out old fellow s likeness and P C What does P C stand for Peculiar Coat eh mister Tupman with rising indignation and great importance explained the mystic device Rather short in the waist ain t it said the stranger screwing himself round to catch a glimpse in the glass of the waist buttons which were half way up his back Like a general postman s coat queer coats those made by contract no measuring mysterious dispensations of Providence all the short men get long coats all the long men short ones Running on in this way mister Tupman s new companion adjusted his dress or rather the dress of mister Winkle and accompanied by mister Tupman ascended the staircase leading to the ballroom What names sir said the man at the door mister Tracy Tupman was stepping forward to announce his own titles when the stranger prevented him No names at all and then he whispered mister Tupman names won t do not known very good names in their way but not great ones capital names for a small party but won t make an impression in public assemblies incog the thing gentlemen from London distinguished foreigners anything The door was thrown open and mister Tracy Tupman and the stranger entered the ballroom It was a long room with crimson covered benches and wax candles in glass chandeliers The musicians were securely confined in an elevated den and quadrilles were being systematically got through by two or three sets of dancers Two card tables were made up in the adjoining card room and two pair of old ladies and a corresponding number of stout gentlemen were executing whist therein The finale concluded the dancers promenaded the room and mister Tupman and his companion stationed themselves in a corner to observe the company Charming women said mister Tupman Wait a minute said the stranger fun presently nobs not come yet queer place dockyard people of upper rank don t know dockyard people of lower rank dockyard people of lower rank don t know small gentry small gentry don t know tradespeople commissioner don t know anybody Who s that little boy with the light hair and pink eyes in a fancy dress inquired mister Tupman Hush pray pink eyes fancy

voice A great sensation was created throughout the room by the entrance of a tall gentleman in a blue coat and bright buttons a large lady in blue satin and two young ladies on a similar scale in fashionably made dresses of the same hue Commissioner head of the yard great man remarkably great man whispered the stranger in mister Tupman s ear as the charitable committee ushered Sir Thomas Clubber and family to the top of the room The Honourable Wilmot Snipe and other distinguished gentlemen crowded to render homage to the Misses Clubber and Sir Thomas Clubber stood bolt upright and looked majestically over his black kerchief at the assembled company mister Smithie

none	none	Smithie and the Misses Smithie was the next announcement What s mister Smithie inquired mister Tracy Tupman Something in the yard replied the stranger mister Smithie bowed deferentially to Sir Thomas Clubber and Sir Thomas Clubber acknowledged the salute with conscious condescension Lady Clubber took a telescopic view of missus Smithie and family through her eye glass and missus Smithie stared in her turn at missus Somebody else whose husband was not in the dockyard at all Colonel Bulder missus Colonel Bulder and Miss Bulder were the next arrivals Head of the garrison said the stranger in reply to mister Tupman s inquiring look Miss Bulder was warmly welcomed by the Misses Clubber the greeting between missus Colonel Bulder and Lady Clubber was of the most affectionate description Colonel Bulder and Sir Thomas Clubber exchanged snuff boxes and looked very much like a pair of Alexander Selkirks Monarchs of all they surveyed While the aristocracy of the place the Bulders and Clubbers and Snipes were thus preserving their dignity at the upper end of the room the other classes of society were imitating their example in other parts of it The less aristocratic officers of the ninety seventh devoted themselves to the families of the less important functionaries from the dockyard The solicitors wives and the wine merchant s wife headed another grade the brewer s wife visited the Bulders and missus Tomlinson the post office keeper seemed by mutual consent to have been chosen the leader of the trade party One of the most popular personages in his own circle present was a little fat man with a ring of upright black hair round his head and an extensive bald plain on the top of it Doctor Slammer surgeon to the ninety seventh The doctor took snuff with everybody chatted with everybody laughed danced made jokes played whist did everything and was everywhere To these pursuits multifarious as they were the little doctor added a more important one than any he was indefatigable in paying the most unremitting and devoted attention to a little old widow whose rich dress and profusion of ornament bespoke her a most desirable addition to a limited income Upon the doctor and the widow the eyes of both mister Tupman and his companion had been fixed for some time when the stranger broke silence Lots of money old girl pompous doctor not a bad idea good fun were the intelligible sentences which issued from his lips mister Tupman looked inquisitively in his face I ll dance with the widow said the stranger Who is she inquired mister Tupman Don t know never saw her in all my life cut out the doctor here goes And the stranger forthwith crossed the room and leaning against a mantel piece commenced gazing with an air of respectful and melancholy admiration on the fat countenance of the little old lady mister Tupman looked on in mute astonishment The stranger progressed rapidly the little doctor danced with another lady the widow dropped her fan the stranger picked it up and presented it a smile a bow a curtsey a few words of conversation The stranger walked boldly up to and returned with the master of the ceremonies a little introductory pantomime and the stranger and missus Budger took their places in a quadrille The surprise of mister Tupman at this summary proceeding great as it was was immeasurably exceeded by the astonishment of the doctor The stranger was young and the widow was flattered The doctor s attentions were unheeded by the widow and the doctor s indignation was wholly lost on his imperturbable rival Doctor Slammer was paralysed He Doctor Slammer of the ninety seventh to be extinguished in a moment by a man whom nobody had ever seen before and whom nobody knew even now Doctor Slammer Doctor Slammer of the ninety seventh rejected Impossible It could not be Yes it was there they were What introducing his friend Could he believe his eyes He looked again and was under the painful necessity of admitting the veracity of his optics missus Budger was dancing with mister Tracy Tupman there was no mistaking the fact There was the widow before him bouncing bodily here and there with unwonted vigour and mister Tracy Tupman hopping about with a face expressive of the most intense solemnity dancing as a good many people do as if a quadrille were not a thing to be laughed at but a severe trial to the feelings which it requires inflexible resolution to encounter Silently and patiently did the doctor bear all this and all the handings of negus and watching for glasses and darting for biscuits and coquetting that ensued but a few seconds after the stranger had disappeared to lead missus Budger to her carriage he darted swiftly from the room with every particle of his hitherto bottled up indignation effervescing from all parts of his countenance in a perspiration of passion The stranger was returning and mister Tupman was beside him He spoke in a low tone and laughed The little doctor thirsted for his life He was exulting He had triumphed Sir said the doctor in an awful voice producing a card and retiring into an angle of the passage my name is Slammer Doctor Slammer sir ninety seventh Regiment Chatham Barracks my card Sir my card He would have added more but his indignation choked him Ah replied the stranger coolly Slammer much obliged polite attention not ill now Slammer but when I am knock you up You you re a shuffler sir gasped the furious doctor a poltroon a coward a liar a a will nothing induce you to give me your card sir

none	none	I see said the stranger half aside negus too strong here liberal landlord very foolish very lemonade much better hot rooms elderly gentlemen suffer for it in the morning cruel cruel and he moved on a step or two You are stopping in this house Sir said the indignant little man you are intoxicated now Sir you shall hear from me in the morning sir I shall find you out sir I shall find you out Rather you found me out than found me at home replied the unmoved stranger Doctor Slammer looked unutterable ferocity as he fixed his hat on his head with an indignant knock and the stranger and mister Tupman ascended to the bedroom of the latter to restore the borrowed plumage to the unconscious Winkle That gentleman was fast asleep the restoration was soon made The stranger was extremely jocose and mister Tracy Tupman being quite bewildered with wine negus lights and ladies thought the whole affair was an exquisite joke His new friend departed and after experiencing some slight difficulty in finding the orifice in his nightcap originally intended for the reception of his head and finally overturning his candlestick in his struggles to put it on mister Tracy Tupman managed to get into bed by a series of complicated evolutions and shortly afterwards sank into repose Seven o clock had hardly ceased striking on the following morning when mister Pickwick s comprehensive mind was aroused from the state of unconsciousness in which slumber had plunged it by a loud knocking at his chamber door Who s there said mister Pickwick starting up in bed Boots sir What do you want Please sir can you tell me which gentleman of your party wears a bright blue dress coat with a gilt button with P C on it It s been given out to brush thought mister Pickwick and the man has forgotten whom it belongs to mister Winkle he called out next room but two on the right hand Thank ee sir said the Boots and away he went What s the matter cried mister Tupman as a loud knocking at his door roused hint from his oblivious repose Can I speak to mister Winkle sir replied Boots from the outside Winkle Winkle shouted mister Tupman calling into the inner room Hollo replied a faint voice from within the bed clothes You re wanted some one at the door and having exerted himself to articulate thus much mister Tracy Tupman turned round and fell fast asleep again Wanted said mister Winkle hastily jumping out of bed and putting on a few articles of clothing wanted at this distance from town who on earth can want me Gentleman in the coffee room sir replied the Boots as mister Winkle opened the door and confronted him gentleman says he ll not detain you a moment Sir but he can take no denial Very odd said mister Winkle I ll be down directly He hurriedly wrapped himself in a travelling shawl and dressing gown and proceeded downstairs An old woman and a couple of waiters were cleaning the coffee room and an officer in undress uniform was looking out of the window He turned round as mister Winkle entered and made a stiff inclination of the head Having ordered the attendants to retire and closed the door very carefully he said mister Winkle I presume My name is Winkle sir You will not be surprised sir when I inform you that I have called here this morning on behalf of my friend Doctor Slammer of the ninety seventh Doctor Slammer said mister Winkle Doctor Slammer He begged me to express his opinion that your conduct of last evening was of a description which no gentleman could endure and he added which no one gentleman would pursue towards another mister Winkle s astonishment was too real and too evident to escape the observation of Doctor Slammer s friend he therefore proceeded My friend Doctor Slammer requested me to add that he was firmly persuaded you were intoxicated during a portion of the evening and possibly unconscious of the extent of the insult you were guilty of He commissioned me to say that should this be pleaded as an excuse for your behaviour he will consent to accept a written apology to be penned by you from my dictation A written apology repeated mister Winkle in the most emphatic tone of amazement possible Of course you know the alternative replied the visitor coolly Were you intrusted with this message to me by name inquired mister Winkle whose intellects were hopelessly confused by this extraordinary conversation I was not present myself replied the visitor and in consequence of your firm refusal to give your card to Doctor Slammer I was desired by that gentleman to identify the wearer of a very uncommon coat a bright blue dress coat with a gilt button displaying a bust and the letters P C mister Winkle actually staggered with astonishment as he heard his own costume thus minutely described Doctor Slammer s friend proceeded From the inquiries I made at the bar just now I was convinced that the owner of the coat in question arrived here with three gentlemen yesterday afternoon I immediately sent up to the gentleman who was described as appearing the head of the party and he at once referred me to you If the principal tower of Rochester Castle had suddenly walked from its foundation and stationed itself opposite the coffee room window mister Winkle s surprise would have been as nothing compared with the profound astonishment with which he had heard this address His first impression was that his coat had been stolen Will you allow me to detain you one moment said he Certainly replied the unwelcome visitor mister Winkle ran hastily upstairs and with a trembling hand opened the bag There was the coat in its usual place but exhibiting on a close inspection evident tokens of having been worn on the preceding night It must be so said mister Winkle letting the coat fall from his hands I took too much wine after dinner and have a very vague recollection of walking about the streets and smoking a cigar afterwards The fact is I was very drunk I must have changed my coat gone somewhere and insulted somebody I have no doubt of it and this message is the terrible consequence Saying which mister Winkle retraced his steps in the direction of the coffee room with the gloomy and dreadful resolve of accepting the challenge of the warlike Doctor Slammer and abiding by the worst consequences that might ensue To this determination mister Winkle was urged by a variety of considerations the first of which was his reputation with the club He had always been looked up to as a high authority on all matters of amusement and dexterity whether offensive defensive or inoffensive and if on this very first occasion of being put to the test he shrunk back from the trial beneath his leader s eye his name and standing were lost for ever Besides he remembered to have heard it frequently surmised by the uninitiated in such matters that by an understood arrangement between the seconds the pistols were seldom loaded with ball and furthermore he reflected that if he applied to mister Snodgrass to act as his second and depicted the danger in glowing terms that gentleman might possibly communicate the intelligence to mister Pickwick who would certainly lose no time in transmitting it to the local authorities and thus prevent the killing or maiming of his follower Such were his thoughts when he returned to the coffee room and intimated his intention of accepting the doctor s challenge Will you refer me to a friend to arrange the time and place of meeting said the officer Quite unnecessary replied mister Winkle name them to me and I can procure the attendance of a friend afterwards Shall we say sunset this evening inquired the officer in a careless tone Very good replied mister Winkle thinking in his heart it was very bad You know Fort Pitt Yes I saw it yesterday If you will take the trouble to turn into the field which borders the trench take the foot path to the left when you arrive at an angle of the fortification and keep straight on till you see me I will precede you to a secluded place where the affair can be conducted without fear of interruption Fear of interruption thought mister Winkle Nothing more to arrange I think said the officer I am not aware of anything more replied mister Winkle Good morning Good morning and the officer whistled a lively air as he strode away That morning s breakfast passed heavily off mister Tupman was not in a condition to rise after the unwonted dissipation of the previous night mister Snodgrass appeared to labour under a poetical depression of spirits and even mister Pickwick evinced an unusual attachment to silence and soda water mister Winkle eagerly watched his opportunity it was not long wanting mister Snodgrass proposed a visit to the castle and as mister Winkle was the only other member of the party disposed to walk they went out together Snodgrass said mister Winkle when they had turned out of the public street Snodgrass my dear fellow can I rely upon your secrecy As he said this he most devoutly and earnestly hoped he could not You can replied mister Snodgrass Hear me swear No no interrupted Winkle terrified at the idea of his companion s unconsciously pledging himself not to give information don t swear don t swear it s quite unnecessary mister Snodgrass dropped the hand which he had in the spirit of poesy raised towards the clouds as he made the above appeal and assumed an attitude of attention I want your assistance my dear fellow in an affair of honour said mister Winkle You shall have it replied mister Snodgrass clasping his friend s hand With a doctor Doctor Slammer of the ninety seventh said mister Winkle wishing to make the matter appear as solemn as possible an affair with an officer seconded by another officer at sunset this evening in a lonely field beyond Fort Pitt I will attend you said mister Snodgrass He was astonished but by no means dismayed It is extraordinary how cool any party but the principal can be in such cases mister Winkle had forgotten this He had judged of his friend s feelings by his own The consequences may be dreadful said mister Winkle I hope not said mister Snodgrass The doctor I believe is a very good shot said mister Winkle Most of these military men are observed mister Snodgrass calmly but so are you ain t you mister Winkle replied in the affirmative and perceiving that he had not alarmed his companion sufficiently changed his ground Snodgrass he said in a voice tremulous with emotion if I fall you will find in a packet which I shall place in your hands a note for my for my father This attack was a failure also mister Snodgrass was affected but he undertook the delivery of the note as readily as if he had been a twopenny postman If I fall said mister Winkle or if the doctor falls you my dear friend will be tried as an accessory before the fact Shall I involve my friend in transportation possibly for life mister Snodgrass winced a little at this but his heroism was invincible In the cause of friendship he fervently exclaimed I would brave all dangers How mister Winkle cursed his companion s devoted friendship internally as they walked silently along side by side for some minutes each immersed in his own meditations The morning was wearing away he grew desperate Snodgrass he said stopping suddenly do not let me be balked in this matter do not give information to the local authorities do not obtain the assistance of several peace officers to take either me or Doctor Slammer of the ninety seventh Regiment at present quartered in Chatham Barracks into custody and thus prevent this duel I say do not mister Snodgrass seized his friend s hand warmly as he enthusiastically replied Not for worlds A thrill passed over mister Winkle s frame as the conviction that he had nothing to hope from his friend s fears and that he was destined to become an animated target rushed forcibly upon him The state of the case having been formally explained to mister Snodgrass and a case of satisfactory pistols with the satisfactory accompaniments of powder ball and caps having been hired from a manufacturer in Rochester the two friends returned to their inn mister Winkle to ruminate on the approaching struggle and mister Snodgrass to arrange the weapons of war and put them into proper order for immediate use it was a dull and heavy evening when they again sallied forth on their awkward errand mister Winkle was muffled up in a huge cloak to escape observation and mister Snodgrass bore under his the instruments of destruction Have you got everything said mister Winkle in an agitated tone Everything replied mister Snodgrass plenty of ammunition in case the shots don t take effect There s a quarter of a pound of powder in the case and I have got two newspapers in my pocket for the loadings These were instances of friendship for which any man might reasonably feel most grateful The presumption is that the gratitude of mister Winkle was too powerful for utterance as he said nothing but continued to walk on rather slowly We are in excellent time said mister Snodgrass as they climbed the fence of the first field the sun is just going down mister Winkle looked up at the declining orb and painfully thought of the probability of his going down himself before long There s the officer exclaimed mister Winkle after a few minutes walking Where said mister Snodgrass There the gentleman in the blue cloak mister Snodgrass looked in the direction indicated by the forefinger of his friend and observed a figure muffled up as he had described The officer evinced his consciousness of their presence by slightly beckoning with his hand and the two friends followed him at a little distance as he walked away The evening grew more dull every moment and a melancholy wind sounded through the deserted fields like a distant giant whistling for his house dog The sadness of the scene imparted a sombre tinge to the feelings of mister Winkle He started as they passed the angle of the trench it looked like a colossal grave The officer turned suddenly from the path and after climbing a paling and scaling a hedge entered a secluded field Two gentlemen were waiting in it one was a little fat man with black hair and the other a portly personage in a braided surtout was sitting with perfect equanimity on a camp stool The other party and a surgeon I suppose said mister Snodgrass take a drop of brandy mister Winkle seized the wicker bottle which his friend proffered and took a lengthened pull at the exhilarating liquid My friend Sir mister Snodgrass said mister Winkle as the officer approached Doctor Slammer s friend bowed and produced a case similar to that which mister Snodgrass carried We have nothing further to say Sir I think he coldly remarked as he opened the case an apology has been resolutely declined Nothing Sir said mister Snodgrass who began to feel rather uncomfortable himself Will you step forward said the officer Certainly replied mister Snodgrass The ground was measured and preliminaries arranged You will find these better than your own said the opposite second producing his pistols You saw me load them Do you object to use them Certainly not replied mister Snodgrass The offer relieved him from considerable embarrassment for his previous notions of loading a pistol were rather vague and undefined We may place our men then I think observed the officer with as much indifference as if the principals were chess men and the seconds players I think we may replied mister Snodgrass who would have assented to any proposition because he knew nothing about the matter The officer crossed to Doctor Slammer and mister Snodgrass went up to mister Winkle It s all ready said he offering the pistol Give me your cloak You have got the packet my dear fellow said poor Winkle All right said mister Snodgrass Be steady and wing him It occurred to mister Winkle that this advice was very like that which bystanders invariably give to the smallest boy in a street fight namely Go in and win an admirable thing to recommend if you only know how to do it He took off his cloak however in silence it always took a long time to undo that cloak and accepted the pistol The seconds retired the gentleman on the camp stool did the same and the belligerents approached each other mister Winkle was always remarkable for extreme humanity It is conjectured that his unwillingness to hurt a fellow creature intentionally was the cause of his shutting his eyes when he arrived at the fatal spot and that the circumstance of his eyes being closed prevented his observing the very extraordinary and unaccountable demeanour of Doctor Slammer That gentleman started stared retreated rubbed his eyes stared again and finally shouted Stop stop What s all this said Doctor Slammer as his friend and mister Snodgrass came running up that s not the man Not the man said Doctor Slammer s second Not the man said mister Snodgrass Not the man said the gentleman with the camp stool in his hand Certainly not replied the little doctor That s not the person who insulted me last night Very extraordinary exclaimed the officer Very said the gentleman with the camp stool The only question is whether the gentleman being on the ground must not be considered as a matter of form to be the individual who insulted our friend Doctor Slammer yesterday evening whether he is really that individual or not and having delivered this suggestion with a very sage and mysterious air the man with the camp stool took a large pinch of snuff and looked profoundly round with the air of an authority in such matters Now mister Winkle had opened his eyes and his ears too when he heard his adversary call out for a cessation of hostilities and perceiving by what he had afterwards said that there was beyond all question some mistake in the matter he at once foresaw the increase of reputation he should inevitably acquire by concealing the real motive of his coming out he therefore stepped boldly forward and said I am not the person I know it Then that said the man with the camp stool is an affront to Doctor Slammer and a sufficient reason for proceeding immediately Pray be quiet Payne said the doctor s second Why did you not communicate this fact to me this morning Sir To be sure to be sure said the man with the camp stool indignantly I entreat you to be quiet Payne said the other May I repeat my question Sir Because Sir replied mister Winkle who had had time to deliberate upon his answer because Sir you described an intoxicated and ungentlemanly person as wearing a coat which I have the honour not only to wear but to have invented the proposed uniform Sir of the Pickwick Club in London The honour of that uniform I feel bound to maintain and I therefore without inquiry accepted the challenge which you offered me My dear Sir said the good humoured little doctor advancing with extended hand I honour your gallantry Permit me to say Sir that I highly admire your conduct and extremely regret having caused you the inconvenience of this meeting to no purpose I beg you won t mention it Sir said mister Winkle I shall feel proud of your acquaintance Sir said the little doctor It will afford me the greatest pleasure to know you sir replied mister Winkle Thereupon the doctor and mister Winkle shook hands and then mister Winkle and Lieutenant Tappleton the doctor s second and then mister Winkle and the man with the camp stool and finally mister Winkle and mister Snodgrass the last named gentleman in an excess of admiration at the noble conduct of his heroic friend I think we may adjourn said Lieutenant Tappleton Certainly added the doctor Unless interposed the man with the camp stool unless mister Winkle feels himself aggrieved by the challenge in which case I submit he has a right to satisfaction mister Winkle with great self denial expressed himself quite satisfied already Or possibly said the man with the camp stool the gentleman s second may feel himself affronted with some observations which fell from me at an early period of this meeting if so I shall be happy to give him satisfaction immediately mister Snodgrass hastily professed himself very much obliged with the handsome offer of the gentleman who had spoken last which he was only induced to decline by his entire contentment with the whole proceedings The two seconds adjusted the cases and the whole party left the ground in a much more lively manner than they had proceeded to it Do you remain long here inquired Doctor Slammer of mister Winkle as they walked on most amicably together I think we shall leave here the day after to morrow was the reply I trust I shall have the pleasure of seeing you and your friend at my rooms and of spending a pleasant evening with you after this awkward mistake said the little doctor are you disengaged this evening We have some friends here replied mister Winkle and I should not like to leave them to night Perhaps you and your friend will join us at the Bull With great pleasure said the little doctor will ten o clock be too late to look in for half an hour Oh dear no said mister Winkle I shall be most happy to introduce you to my friends mister Pickwick and mister Tupman It will give me great pleasure I am sure replied Doctor Slammer little suspecting who mister Tupman was You will be sure to come said mister Snodgrass Oh certainly By this time they had reached the road Cordial farewells were exchanged and the party separated Doctor Slammer and his friends repaired to the barracks and mister Winkle accompanied by mister Snodgrass returned to their inn CHAPTER III A NEW ACQUAINTANCE THE STROLLER S TALE A DISAGREEABLE INTERRUPTION AND AN UNPLEASANT ENCOUNTER mister Pickwick had felt some apprehensions in consequence of the unusual absence of his two friends which their mysterious behaviour during the whole morning had by no means tended to diminish It was therefore with more than ordinary pleasure that he rose to greet them when they again entered and with more than ordinary interest that he inquired what had occurred to detain them from his society In reply to his questions on this point mister Snodgrass was about to offer an historical account of the circumstances just now detailed when he was suddenly checked by observing that there were present not only mister Tupman and their stage coach companion of the preceding day but another stranger of equally singular appearance It was a careworn looking man whose sallow face and deeply sunken eyes were rendered still more striking than Nature had made them by the straight black hair which hung in matted disorder half way down his face His eyes were almost unnaturally bright and piercing his cheek bones were high and prominent and his jaws were so long and lank that an observer would have supposed that he was drawing the flesh of his face in for a moment by some contraction of the muscles if his half opened mouth and immovable expression had not announced that it was his ordinary appearance Round his neck he wore a green shawl with the large ends straggling over his chest and making their appearance occasionally beneath the worn button holes of his old waistcoat His upper garment was a long black surtout and below it he wore wide drab trousers and large boots running rapidly to seed It was on this uncouth looking person that mister Winkle s eye rested and it was towards him that mister Pickwick extended his hand when he said A friend of our friend s here We discovered this morning that our friend was connected with the theatre in this place though he is not desirous to have it generally known and this gentleman is a member of the same profession He was about to favour us with a little anecdote connected with it when you entered Lots of anecdote said the green coated stranger of the day before advancing to mister Winkle and speaking in a low and confidential tone Rum fellow does the heavy business no actor strange man all sorts of miseries Dismal Jemmy we call him on the circuit mister Winkle and mister Snodgrass politely welcomed the gentleman elegantly designated as Dismal Jemmy and calling for brandy and water in imitation of the remainder of the company seated themselves at the table Now sir said mister Pickwick will you oblige us by proceeding with what you were going to relate The dismal individual took a dirty roll of paper from his pocket and turning to mister Snodgrass who had just taken out his note book said in a hollow voice perfectly in keeping with his outward man Are you the poet I I do a little in that way replied mister Snodgrass rather taken aback by the abruptness of the question Ah poetry makes life what light and music do the stage strip the one of the false embellishments and the other of its illusions and what is there real in either to live or care for Very true Sir replied mister Snodgrass To be before the footlights continued the dismal man is like sitting at a grand court show and admiring the silken dresses of the gaudy throng to be behind them is to be the people who make that finery uncared for and unknown and left to sink or swim to starve or live as fortune wills it Certainly said mister Snodgrass for the sunken eye of the dismal man rested on him and he felt it necessary to say something Go on Jemmy said the Spanish traveller like black eyed Susan all in the Downs no croaking speak out look lively Will you make another glass before you begin Sir said mister Pickwick The dismal man took the hint and having mixed a glass of brandy and water and slowly swallowed half of it opened the roll of paper and proceeded partly to read and partly to relate the following incident which we find recorded on the Transactions of the Club as The Stroller s Tale THE STROLLER S TALE There is nothing of the marvellous in what I am going to relate said the dismal man there is nothing even uncommon in it Want and sickness are too common in many stations of life to deserve more notice than is usually bestowed on the most ordinary vicissitudes of human nature I have thrown these few notes together because the subject of them was well known to me for many years I traced his progress downwards step by step until at last he reached that excess of destitution from which he never rose again The man of whom I speak was a low pantomime actor and like many people of his class an habitual drunkard In his better days before he had become enfeebled by dissipation and emaciated by disease he had been in the receipt of a good salary which if he had been careful and prudent he might have continued to receive for some years not many because these men either die early or by unnaturally taxing their bodily energies lose prematurely those physical powers on which alone they can depend for subsistence His besetting sin gained so fast upon him however that it was found impossible to employ him in the situations in which he really was useful to the theatre The public house had a fascination for him which he could not resist Neglected disease and hopeless poverty were as certain to be his portion as death itself if he persevered in the same course yet he did persevere and the result may be guessed He could obtain no engagement and he wanted bread Everybody who is at all acquainted with theatrical matters knows what a host of shabby poverty stricken men hang about the stage of a large establishment not regularly engaged actors but ballet people procession men tumblers and so forth who are taken on during the run of a pantomime or an Easter piece and are then discharged until the production of some heavy spectacle occasions a new demand for their services To this mode of life the man was compelled to resort and taking the chair every night at some low theatrical house at once put him in possession of a few more shillings weekly and enabled him to gratify his old propensity Even this resource shortly failed him his irregularities were too great to admit of his earning the wretched pittance he might thus have procured and he was actually reduced to a state bordering on starvation only procuring a trifle occasionally by borrowing it of some old companion or by obtaining an appearance at one or other of the commonest of the minor theatres and when he did earn anything it was spent in the old way About this time and when he had been existing for upwards of a year no one knew how I had a short engagement at one of the theatres on the Surrey side of the water and here I saw this man whom I had lost sight of for some time for I had been travelling in the provinces and he had been skulking in the lanes and alleys of London I was dressed to leave the house and was crossing the stage on my way out when he tapped me on the shoulder Never shall I forget the repulsive sight that met my eye when I turned round He was dressed for the pantomimes in all the absurdity of a clown s costume The spectral figures in the Dance of Death the most frightful shapes that the ablest painter ever portrayed on canvas never presented an appearance half so ghastly His bloated body and shrunken legs their deformity enhanced a hundredfold by the fantastic dress the glassy eyes contrasting fearfully with the thick white paint with which the face was besmeared the grotesquely ornamented head trembling with paralysis and the long skinny hands rubbed with white chalk all gave him a hideous and unnatural appearance of which no description could convey an adequate idea and which to this day I shudder to think of His voice was hollow and tremulous as he took me aside and in broken words recounted a long catalogue of sickness and privations terminating as usual with an urgent request for the loan of a trifling sum of money I put a few shillings in his hand and as I turned away I heard the roar of laughter which followed his first tumble on the stage A few nights afterwards a boy put a dirty scrap of paper in my hand on which were scrawled a few words in pencil intimating that the man was dangerously ill and begging me after the performance to see him at his lodgings in some street I forget the name of it now at no great distance from the theatre I promised to comply as soon as I could get away and after the curtain fell sallied forth on my melancholy errand It was late for I had been playing in the last piece and as it was a benefit night the performances had been protracted to an unusual length It was a dark cold night with a chill damp wind which blew the rain heavily against the windows and house fronts Pools of water had collected in the narrow and little frequented streets and as many of the thinly scattered oil lamps had been blown out by the violence of the wind the walk was not only a comfortless but most uncertain one I had fortunately taken the right course however and succeeded after a little difficulty in finding the house to which I had been directed a coal shed with one Storey above it in the back room of which lay the object of my search A wretched looking woman the man s wife met me on the stairs and telling me that he had just fallen into a kind of doze led me softly in and placed a chair for me at the bedside The sick man was lying with his face turned towards the wall and as he took no heed of my presence I had leisure to observe the place in which I found myself He was lying on an old bedstead which turned up during the day The tattered remains of a checked curtain were drawn round the bed s head to exclude the wind which however made its way into the comfortless room through the numerous chinks in the door and blew it to and fro every instant There was a low cinder fire in a rusty unfixed grate and an old three cornered stained table with some medicine bottles a broken glass and a few other domestic articles was drawn out before it A little child was sleeping on a temporary bed which had been made for it on the floor and the woman sat on a chair by its side There were a couple of shelves with a few plates and cups and saucers and a pair of stage shoes and a couple of foils hung beneath them With the exception of little heaps of rags and bundles which had been carelessly thrown into the corners of the room these were the only things in the apartment I had had time to note these little particulars and to mark the heavy breathing and feverish startings of the sick man before he was aware of my presence In the restless attempts to procure some easy resting place for his head he tossed his hand out of the bed and it fell on mine He started up and stared eagerly in my face mister Hutley John said his wife mister Hutley that you sent for to night you know Ah said the invalid passing his hand across his forehead Hutley Hutley let me see He seemed endeavouring to collect his thoughts for a few seconds and then grasping me tightly by the wrist said Don t leave me don t leave me old fellow She ll murder me I know she will Has he been long so said I addressing his weeping wife Since yesterday night she replied John John don t you know me Don t let her come near me said the man with a shudder as she stooped over him Drive her away I can t bear her near me He stared wildly at her with a look of deadly apprehension and then whispered in my ear I beat her Jem I beat her yesterday and many times before I have starved her and the boy too and now I am weak and helpless Jem she ll murder me for it I know she will If you d seen her cry as I have you d know it too Keep her off He relaxed his grasp and sank back exhausted on the pillow I knew but too well what all this meant If I could have entertained any doubt of it for an instant one glance at the woman s pale face and wasted form would have sufficiently explained the real state of the case You had better stand aside said I to the poor creature You can do him no good Perhaps he will be calmer if he does not see you She retired out of the man s sight He opened his eyes after a few seconds and looked anxiously round Is she gone he eagerly inquired Yes yes said I she shall not hurt you I ll tell you what Jem said the man in a low voice she does hurt me There s something in her eyes wakes such a dreadful fear in my heart that it drives me mad All last night her large staring eyes and pale face were close to mine wherever I turned they turned and whenever I started up from my sleep she was at the bedside looking at me He drew me closer to him as he said in a deep alarmed whisper Jem she must be an evil spirit a devil Hush I know she is If she had been a woman she would have died long ago No woman could have borne what she has I sickened at the thought of the long course of cruelty and neglect which must have occurred to produce such an impression on such a man I could say nothing in reply for who could offer hope or consolation to the abject being before me I sat there for upwards of two hours during which time he tossed about murmuring exclamations of pain or impatience restlessly throwing his arms here and there and turning constantly from side to side At length he fell into that state of partial unconsciousness in which the mind wanders uneasily from scene to scene and from place to place without the control of reason but still without being able to divest itself of an indescribable sense of present suffering Finding from his incoherent wanderings that this was the case and knowing that in all probability the fever would not grow immediately worse I left him promising his miserable wife that I would repeat my visit next evening and if necessary sit up with the patient during the night I kept my promise The last four and twenty hours had produced a frightful alteration The eyes though deeply sunk and heavy shone with a lustre frightful to behold The lips were parched and cracked in many places the hard dry skin glowed with a burning heat and there was an almost unearthly air of wild anxiety in the man s face indicating even more strongly the ravages of the disease The fever was at its height I took the seat I had occupied the night before and there I sat for hours listening to sounds which must strike deep to the heart of the most callous among human beings the awful ravings of a dying man From what I had heard of the medical attendant s opinion I knew there was no hope for him I was sitting by his death bed I saw the wasted limbs which a few hours before had been distorted for the amusement of a boisterous gallery writhing under the tortures of a burning fever I heard the clown s shrill laugh blending with the low murmurings of the dying man It is a touching thing to hear the mind reverting to the ordinary occupations and pursuits of health when the body lies before you weak and helpless but when those occupations are of a character the most strongly opposed to anything we associate with grave and solemn ideas the impression produced is infinitely more powerful The theatre and the public house were the chief themes of the wretched man s wanderings It was evening he fancied he had a part to play that night it was late and he must leave home instantly Why did they hold him and prevent his going he should lose the money he must go No they would not let him He hid his face in his burning hands and feebly bemoaned his own weakness and the cruelty of his persecutors A short pause and he shouted out a few doggerel rhymes the last he had ever learned He rose in bed drew up his withered limbs and rolled about in uncouth positions he was acting he was at the theatre A minute s silence and he murmured the burden of some roaring song He had reached the old house at last how hot the room was He had been ill very ill but he was well now and happy Fill up his glass Who was that that dashed it from his lips It was the same persecutor that had followed him before He fell back upon his pillow and moaned aloud A short period of oblivion and he was wandering through a tedious maze of low arched rooms so low sometimes that he must creep upon his hands and knees to make his way along it was close and dark and every way he turned some obstacle impeded his progress There were insects too hideous crawling things with eyes that stared upon him and filled the very air around glistening horribly amidst the thick darkness of the place The walls and ceiling were alive with reptiles the vault expanded to an enormous size frightful figures flitted to and fro and the faces of men he knew rendered hideous by gibing and mouthing peered out from among them they were searing him with heated irons and binding his head with cords till the blood started and he struggled madly for life At the close of one of these paroxysms when I had with great difficulty held him down in his bed he sank into what appeared to be a slumber Overpowered with watching and exertion I had closed my eyes for a few minutes when I felt a violent clutch on my shoulder I awoke instantly He had raised himself up so as to seat himself in bed a dreadful change had come over his face but consciousness had returned for he evidently knew me The child who had been long since disturbed by his ravings rose from its little bed and ran towards its father screaming with fright the mother hastily caught it in her arms lest he should injure it in the violence of his insanity but terrified by the alteration of his features stood transfixed by the bedside He grasped my shoulder convulsively and striking his breast with the other hand made a desperate attempt to articulate It was unavailing he extended his arm towards them and made another violent effort There was a rattling noise in the throat a glare of the eye a short stifled groan and he fell back dead It would afford us the highest gratification to be enabled to record mister Pickwick s opinion of the foregoing anecdote We have little doubt that we should have been enabled to present it to our readers but for a most unfortunate occurrence mister Pickwick had replaced on the table the glass which during the last few sentences of the tale he had retained in his hand and had just made up his mind to speak indeed we have the authority of mister Snodgrass s note book for stating that he had actually opened his mouth when the waiter entered the room and said Some gentlemen Sir It has been conjectured that mister Pickwick was on the point of delivering some remarks which would have enlightened the world if not the Thames when he was thus interrupted for he gazed sternly on the waiter s countenance and then looked round on the company generally as if seeking for information relative to the new comers Oh said mister Winkle rising some friends of mine show them in Very pleasant fellows added mister Winkle after the waiter had retired officers of the ninety seventh whose acquaintance I made rather oddly this morning You will like them very much mister Pickwick s equanimity was at once restored The waiter returned and ushered three gentlemen into the room Lieutenant Tappleton said mister Winkle Lieutenant Tappleton mister Pickwick Doctor Payne mister Pickwick mister Snodgrass you have seen before my friend mister Tupman Doctor Payne Doctor Slammer mister Pickwick mister Tupman Doctor Slam Here mister Winkle suddenly paused for strong emotion was visible on the countenance both of mister Tupman and the doctor I have met THIS gentleman before said the Doctor with marked emphasis Indeed said mister Winkle And and that person too if I am not mistaken said the doctor bestowing a scrutinising glance on the green coated stranger I think I gave that person a very pressing invitation last night which he thought proper to decline Saying which the doctor scowled magnanimously on the stranger and whispered his friend Lieutenant Tappleton You don t say so said that gentleman at the conclusion of the whisper I do indeed replied Doctor Slammer You are bound to kick him on the spot murmured the owner of the camp stool with great importance Do be quiet Payne interposed the lieutenant Will you allow me to ask you sir he said addressing mister Pickwick who was considerably mystified by this very unpolite by play will you allow me to ask you Sir whether that person belongs to your party No Sir replied mister Pickwick he is a guest of ours He is a member of your club or I am mistaken said the lieutenant inquiringly Certainly not responded mister Pickwick And never wears your club button said the lieutenant No never replied the astonished mister Pickwick Lieutenant Tappleton turned round to his friend Doctor Slammer with a scarcely perceptible shrug of the shoulder as if implying some doubt of the accuracy of his recollection The little doctor looked wrathful but confounded and mister Payne gazed with a ferocious aspect on the beaming countenance of the unconscious Pickwick Sir said the doctor suddenly addressing mister Tupman in a tone which made that gentleman start as perceptibly as if a pin had been cunningly inserted in the calf of his leg you were at the ball here last night mister Tupman gasped a faint affirmative looking very hard at mister Pickwick all the while That person was your companion said the doctor pointing to the still unmoved stranger mister Tupman admitted the fact Now sir said the doctor to the stranger I ask you once again in the presence of these gentlemen whether you choose to give me your card and to receive the treatment of a gentleman or whether you impose upon me the necessity of personally chastising you on the spot Stay sir said mister Pickwick I really cannot allow this matter to go any further without some explanation Tupman recount the circumstances mister Tupman thus solemnly adjured stated the case in a few words touched slightly on the borrowing of the coat expatiated largely on its having been done after dinner wound up with a little penitence on his own account and left the stranger to clear himself as best he could He was apparently about to proceed to do so when Lieutenant Tappleton who had been eyeing him with great curiosity said with considerable scorn Haven t I seen you at the theatre Sir Certainly replied the unabashed stranger He is a strolling actor said the lieutenant contemptuously turning to Doctor Slammer He acts in the piece that the officers of the fifty second get up at the Rochester Theatre to morrow night You cannot proceed in this affair Slammer impossible Quite said the dignified Payne Sorry to have placed you in this disagreeable situation said Lieutenant Tappleton addressing mister Pickwick allow me to suggest that the best way of avoiding a recurrence of such scenes in future will be to be more select in the choice of your companions Good evening Sir and the lieutenant bounced out of the room And allow me to say Sir said the irascible Doctor Payne that if I had been Tappleton or if I had been Slammer I would have pulled your nose Sir and the nose of every man in this company I would sir every man Payne is my name sir Doctor Payne of the forty third Good evening Sir Having concluded this speech and uttered the last three words in a loud key he stalked majestically after his friend closely followed by Doctor Slammer who said nothing but contented himself by withering the company with a look Rising rage and extreme bewilderment had swelled the noble breast of mister Pickwick almost to the bursting of his waistcoat during the delivery of the above defiance He stood transfixed to the spot gazing on vacancy The closing of the door recalled him to himself He rushed forward with fury in his looks and fire in his eye His hand was upon the lock of the door in another instant it would have been on the throat of Doctor Payne of the forty third had not mister Snodgrass seized his revered leader by the coat tail and dragged him backwards Restrain him cried mister Snodgrass Winkle Tupman he must not peril his distinguished life in such a cause as this Let me go said mister Pickwick Hold him tight shouted mister Snodgrass and by the united efforts of the whole company mister Pickwick was forced into an arm chair Leave him alone said the green coated stranger brandy and water jolly old gentleman lots of pluck swallow this ah capital stuff Having previously tested the virtues of a bumper which had been mixed by the dismal man the stranger applied the glass to mister Pickwick s mouth and the remainder of its contents rapidly disappeared There was a short pause the brandy and water had done its work the amiable countenance of mister Pickwick was fast recovering its customary expression They are not worth your notice said the dismal man You are right sir replied mister Pickwick they are not I am ashamed to have been betrayed into this warmth of feeling Draw your chair up to the table Sir The dismal man readily complied a circle was again formed round the table and harmony once more prevailed Some lingering irritability appeared to find a resting place in mister Winkle s bosom occasioned possibly by the temporary abstraction of his coat though it is scarcely reasonable to suppose that so slight a circumstance can have excited even a passing feeling of anger in a Pickwickian s breast With this exception their good humour was completely restored and the evening concluded with the conviviality with which it had begun CHAPTER IV A FIELD DAY AND BIVOUAC MORE NEW FRIENDS AN INVITATION TO THE COUNTRY Many authors entertain not only a foolish but a really dishonest objection to acknowledge the sources whence they derive much valuable information We have no such feeling We are merely endeavouring to discharge in an upright manner the responsible duties of our editorial functions and whatever ambition we might have felt under other circumstances to lay claim to the authorship of these adventures a regard for truth forbids us to do more than claim the merit of their judicious arrangement and impartial narration The Pickwick papers are our New River Head and we may be compared to the New River Company The labours of others have raised for us an immense reservoir of important facts We merely lay them on and communicate them in a clear and gentle stream through the medium of these pages to a world thirsting for Pickwickian knowledge Acting in this spirit and resolutely proceeding on our determination to avow our obligations to the authorities we have consulted we frankly say that to the note book of mister Snodgrass are we indebted for the particulars recorded in this and the succeeding chapter particulars which now that we have disburdened our consciences we shall proceed to detail without further comment The whole population of Rochester and the adjoining towns rose from their beds at an early hour of the following morning in a state of the utmost bustle and excitement A grand review was to take place upon the lines The manoeuvres of half a dozen regiments were to be inspected by the eagle eye of the commander in chief temporary fortifications had been erected the citadel was to be attacked and taken and a mine was to be sprung mister Pickwick was as our readers may have gathered from the slight extract we gave from his description of Chatham an enthusiastic admirer of the army Nothing could have been more delightful to him nothing could have harmonised so well with the peculiar feeling of each of his companions as this sight Accordingly they were soon afoot and walking in the direction of the scene of action towards which crowds of people were already pouring from a variety of quarters The appearance of everything on the lines denoted that the approaching ceremony was one of the utmost grandeur and importance There were sentries posted to keep the ground for the troops and servants on the batteries keeping places for the ladies and sergeants running to and fro with vellum covered books under their arms and Colonel Bulder in full military uniform on horseback galloping first to one place and then to another and backing his horse among the people and prancing and curvetting and shouting in a most alarming manner and making himself very hoarse in the voice and very red in the face without any assignable cause or reason whatever Officers were running backwards and forwards first communicating with Colonel Bulder and then ordering the sergeants and then running away altogether and even the very privates themselves looked from behind their glazed stocks with an air of mysterious solemnity which sufficiently bespoke the special nature of the occasion mister Pickwick and his three companions stationed themselves in the front of the crowd and patiently awaited the commencement of the proceedings The throng was increasing every moment and the efforts they were compelled to make to retain the position they had gained sufficiently occupied their attention during the two hours that ensued At one time there was a sudden pressure from behind and then mister Pickwick was jerked forward for several yards with a degree of speed and elasticity highly inconsistent with the general gravity of his demeanour at another moment there was a request to keep back from the front and then the butt end of a musket was either dropped upon mister Pickwick s toe to remind him of the demand or thrust into his chest to insure its being complied with Then some facetious gentlemen on the left after pressing sideways in a body and squeezing mister Snodgrass into the very last extreme of human torture would request to know vere he vos a shovin to and when mister Winkle had done expressing his excessive indignation at witnessing this unprovoked assault some person behind would knock his hat over his eyes and beg the favour of his putting his head in his pocket These and other practical witticisms coupled with the unaccountable absence of mister Tupman who had suddenly disappeared and was nowhere to be found rendered their situation upon the whole rather more uncomfortable than pleasing or desirable At length that low roar of many voices ran through the crowd which usually announces the arrival of whatever they have been waiting for All eyes were turned in the direction of the sally port A few moments of eager expectation and colours were seen fluttering gaily in the air arms glistened brightly in the sun column after column poured on to the plain The troops halted and formed the word of command rang through the line there was a general clash of muskets as arms were presented and the commander in chief attended by Colonel Bulder and numerous officers cantered to the front The military bands struck up altogether the horses stood upon two legs each cantered backwards and whisked their tails about in all directions the dogs barked the mob screamed the troops recovered and nothing was to be seen on either side as far as the eye could reach but a long perspective of red coats and white trousers fixed and motionless mister Pickwick had been so fully occupied in falling about and disentangling himself miraculously from between the legs of horses that he had not enjoyed sufficient leisure to observe the scene before him until it assumed the appearance we have just described When he was at last enabled to stand firmly on his legs his gratification and delight were unbounded Can anything be finer or more delightful he inquired of mister Winkle Nothing replied that gentleman who had had a short man standing on each of his feet for the quarter of an hour immediately preceding It is indeed a noble and a brilliant sight said mister Snodgrass in whose bosom a blaze of poetry was rapidly bursting forth to see the gallant defenders of their country drawn up in brilliant array before its peaceful citizens their faces beaming not with warlike ferocity but with civilised gentleness their eyes flashing not with the rude fire of rapine or revenge but with the soft light of humanity and intelligence mister Pickwick fully entered into the spirit of this eulogium but he could not exactly re echo its terms for the soft light of intelligence burned rather feebly in the eyes of the warriors inasmuch as the command eyes front had been given and all the spectator saw before him was several thousand pair of optics staring straight forward wholly divested of any expression whatever We are in a capital situation now said mister Pickwick looking round him The crowd had gradually dispersed in their immediate vicinity and they were nearly alone Capital echoed both mister Snodgrass and mister Winkle What are they doing now inquired mister Pickwick adjusting his spectacles I I rather think said mister Winkle changing colour I rather think they re going to fire Nonsense said mister Pickwick hastily I I really think they are urged mister Snodgrass somewhat alarmed Impossible replied mister Pickwick He had hardly uttered the word when the whole half dozen regiments levelled their muskets as if they had but one common object and that object the Pickwickians and burst forth with the most awful and tremendous discharge that ever shook the earth to its centres or an elderly gentleman off his It was in this trying situation exposed to a galling fire of blank cartridges and harassed by the operations of the military a fresh body of whom had begun to fall in on the opposite side that mister Pickwick displayed that perfect coolness and self possession which are the indispensable accompaniments of a great mind He seized mister Winkle by the arm and placing himself between that gentleman and mister Snodgrass earnestly besought them to remember that beyond the possibility of being rendered deaf by the noise there was no immediate danger to be apprehended from the firing But but suppose some of the men should happen to have ball cartridges by mistake remonstrated mister Winkle pallid at the supposition he was himself conjuring up I heard something whistle through the air now so sharp close to my ear We had better throw ourselves on our faces hadn t we said mister Snodgrass No no it s over now said mister Pickwick His lip might quiver and his cheek might blanch but no expression of fear or concern escaped the lips of that immortal man mister Pickwick was right the firing ceased but he had scarcely time to congratulate himself on the accuracy of his opinion when a quick movement was visible in the line the hoarse shout of the word of command ran along it and before either of the party could form a guess at the meaning of this new manoeuvre the whole of the half dozen regiments with fixed bayonets charged at double quick time down upon the very spot on which mister Pickwick and his friends were stationed Man is but mortal and there is a point beyond which human courage cannot extend mister Pickwick gazed through his spectacles for an instant on the advancing mass and then fairly turned his back and we will not say fled firstly because it is an ignoble term and secondly because mister Pickwick s figure was by no means adapted for that mode of retreat he trotted away at as quick a rate as his legs would convey him so quickly indeed that he did not perceive the awkwardness of his situation to the full extent until too late The opposite troops whose falling in had perplexed mister Pickwick a few seconds before were drawn up to repel the mimic attack of the sham besiegers of the citadel and the consequence was that mister Pickwick and his two companions found themselves suddenly inclosed between two lines of great length the one advancing at a rapid pace and the other firmly waiting the collision in hostile array Hoi shouted the officers of the advancing line Get out of the way cried the officers of the stationary one Where are we to go to screamed the agitated Pickwickians Hoi hoi hoi was the only reply There was a moment of intense bewilderment a heavy tramp of footsteps a violent concussion a smothered laugh the half dozen regiments were half a thousand yards off and the soles of mister Pickwick s boots were elevated in air mister Snodgrass and mister Winkle had each performed a compulsory somerset with remarkable agility when the first object that met the eyes of the latter as he sat on the ground staunching with a yellow silk handkerchief the stream of life which issued from his nose was his venerated leader at some distance off running after his own hat which was gambolling playfully away in perspective There are very few moments in a man s existence when he experiences so much ludicrous distress or meets with so little charitable commiseration as when he is in pursuit of his own hat A vast deal of coolness and a peculiar degree of judgment are requisite in catching a hat A man must not be precipitate or he runs over it he must not rush into the opposite extreme or he loses it altogether The best way is to keep gently up with the object of pursuit to be wary and cautious to watch your opportunity well get gradually before it then make a rapid dive seize it by the crown and stick it firmly on your head smiling pleasantly all the time as if you thought it as good a joke as anybody else There was a fine gentle wind and mister Pickwick s hat rolled sportively before it The wind puffed and mister Pickwick puffed and the hat rolled over and over as merrily as a lively porpoise in a strong tide and on it might have rolled far beyond mister Pickwick s reach had not its course been providentially stopped just as that gentleman was on the point of resigning it to its fate mister Pickwick we say was completely exhausted and about to give up the chase when the hat was blown with some violence against the wheel of a carriage which was drawn up in a line with half a dozen other vehicles on the spot to which his steps had been directed mister Pickwick perceiving his advantage darted briskly forward secured his property planted it on his head and paused to take breath He had not been stationary half a minute when he heard his own name eagerly pronounced by a voice which he at once recognised as mister Tupman s and looking upwards he beheld a sight which filled him with surprise and pleasure In an open barouche the horses of which had been taken out the better to accommodate it to the crowded place stood a stout old gentleman in a blue coat and bright buttons corduroy breeches and top boots two young ladies in scarfs and feathers a young gentleman apparently enamoured of one of the young ladies in scarfs and feathers a lady of doubtful age probably the aunt of the aforesaid and mister Tupman as easy and unconcerned as if he had belonged to the family from the first moments of his infancy Fastened up behind the barouche was a hamper of spacious dimensions one of those hampers which always awakens in a contemplative mind associations connected with cold fowls tongues and bottles of wine and on the box sat a fat and red faced boy in a state of somnolency whom no speculative observer could have regarded for an instant without setting down as the official dispenser of the contents of the before mentioned hamper when the proper time for their consumption should arrive mister Pickwick had bestowed a hasty glance on these interesting objects when he was again greeted by his faithful disciple Pickwick Pickwick said mister Tupman come up here Make haste Come along Sir Pray come up said the stout gentleman Joe damn that boy he s gone to sleep again Joe let down the steps The fat boy rolled slowly off the box let down the steps and held the carriage door invitingly open mister Snodgrass and mister Winkle came up at the moment Room for you all gentlemen said the stout man Two inside and one out Joe make room for one of these gentlemen on the box Now Sir come along and the stout gentleman extended his arm and pulled first mister Pickwick and then mister Snodgrass into the barouche by main force mister Winkle mounted to the box the fat boy waddled to the same perch and fell fast asleep instantly Well gentlemen said the stout man very glad to see you Know you very well gentlemen though you mayn t remember me I spent some ev nin s at your club last winter picked up my friend mister Tupman here this morning and very glad I was to see him Well Sir and how are you You do look uncommon well to be sure mister Pickwick acknowledged the compliment and cordially shook hands with the stout gentleman in the top boots Well and how are you sir said the stout gentleman addressing mister Snodgrass with paternal anxiety Charming eh Well that s right that s right And how are you sir to mister Winkle Well I am glad to hear you say you are well very glad I am to be sure My daughters gentlemen my gals these are and that s my sister Miss Rachael Wardle She s a Miss she is and yet she ain t a Miss eh Sir eh And the stout gentleman playfully inserted his elbow between the ribs of mister Pickwick and laughed very heartily Lor brother said Miss Wardle with a deprecating smile True true said the stout gentleman no one can deny it Gentlemen I beg your pardon this is my friend mister Trundle And now you all know each other let s be comfortable and happy and see what s going forward that s what I say So the stout gentleman put on his spectacles and mister Pickwick pulled out his glass and everybody stood up in the carriage and looked over somebody else s shoulder at the evolutions of the military Astounding evolutions they were one rank firing over the heads of another rank and then running away and then the other rank firing over the heads of another rank and running away in their turn and then forming squares with officers in the centre and then descending the trench on one side with scaling ladders and ascending it on the other again by the same means and knocking down barricades of baskets and behaving in the most gallant manner possible Then there was such a ramming down of the contents of enormous guns on the battery with instruments like magnified mops such a preparation before they were let off and such an awful noise when they did go that the air resounded with the screams of ladies The young Misses Wardle were so frightened that mister Trundle was actually obliged to hold one of them up in the carriage while mister Snodgrass supported the other and mister Wardle s sister suffered under such a dreadful state of nervous alarm that mister Tupman found it indispensably necessary to put his arm round her waist to keep her up at all Everybody was excited except the fat boy and he slept as soundly as if the roaring of cannon were his ordinary lullaby Joe Joe said the stout gentleman when the citadel was taken and the besiegers and besieged sat down to dinner Damn that boy he s gone to sleep again Be good enough to pinch him sir in the leg if you please nothing else wakes him thank you Undo the hamper Joe The fat boy who had been effectually roused by the compression of a portion of his leg between the finger and thumb of mister Winkle rolled off the box once again and proceeded to unpack the hamper with more expedition than could have been expected from his previous inactivity Now we must sit close said the stout gentleman After a great many jokes about squeezing the ladies sleeves and a vast quantity of blushing at sundry jocose proposals that the ladies should sit in the gentlemen s laps the whole party were stowed down in the barouche and the stout gentleman proceeded to hand the things from the fat boy who had mounted up behind for the purpose into the carriage Now Joe knives and forks The knives and forks were handed in and the ladies and gentlemen inside and mister Winkle on the box were each furnished with those useful instruments Plates Joe plates A similar process employed in the distribution of the crockery Now Joe the fowls Damn that boy he s gone to sleep again Joe Joe Sundry taps on the head with a stick and the fat boy with some difficulty roused from his lethargy Come hand in the eatables There was something in the sound of the last word which roused the unctuous boy He jumped up and the leaden eyes which twinkled behind his mountainous cheeks leered horribly upon the food as he unpacked it from the basket Now make haste said mister Wardle for the fat boy was hanging fondly over a capon which he seemed wholly unable to part with The boy sighed deeply and bestowing an ardent gaze upon its plumpness unwillingly consigned it to his master That s right look sharp Now the tongue now the pigeon pie Take care of that veal and ham mind the lobsters take the salad out of the cloth give me the dressing Such were the hurried orders which issued from the lips of mister Wardle as he handed in the different articles described and placed dishes in everybody s hands and on everybody s knees in endless number Now ain t this capital inquired that jolly personage when the work of destruction had commenced Capital said mister Winkle who was carving a fowl on the box Glass of wine With the greatest pleasure You d better have a bottle to yourself up there hadn t you You re very good Joe Yes Sir He wasn t asleep this time having just succeeded in abstracting a veal patty Bottle of wine to the gentleman on the box Glad to see you Sir Thank ee mister Winkle emptied his glass and placed the bottle on the coach box by his side Will you permit me to have the pleasure Sir said mister Trundle to mister Winkle With great pleasure replied mister Winkle to mister Trundle and then the two gentlemen took wine after which they took a glass of wine round ladies and all How dear Emily is flirting with the strange gentleman whispered the spinster aunt with true spinster aunt like envy to her brother mister Wardle Oh I don t know said the jolly old gentleman all very natural I dare say nothing unusual mister Pickwick some wine Sir mister Pickwick who had been deeply investigating the interior of the pigeon pie readily assented Emily my dear said the spinster aunt with a patronising air don t talk so loud love Lor aunt Aunt and the little old gentleman want to have it all to themselves I think whispered Miss Isabella Wardle to her sister Emily The young ladies laughed very heartily and the old one tried to look amiable but couldn t manage it Young girls have such spirits said Miss Wardle to mister Tupman with an air of gentle commiseration as if animal spirits were contraband and their possession without a permit a high crime and misdemeanour Oh they have replied mister Tupman not exactly making the sort of reply that was expected from him It s quite delightful Hem said Miss Wardle rather dubiously Will you permit me said mister Tupman in his blandest manner touching the enchanting Rachael s wrist with one hand and gently elevating the bottle with the other Will you permit me Oh sir mister Tupman looked most impressive and Rachael expressed her fear that more guns were going off in which case of course she should have required support again Do you think my dear nieces pretty whispered their affectionate aunt to mister Tupman I should if their aunt wasn t here replied the ready Pickwickian with a passionate glance Oh you naughty man but really if their complexions were a little better don t you think they would be nice looking girls by candlelight Yes I think they would said mister Tupman with an air of indifference Oh you quiz I know what you were going to say What inquired mister Tupman who had not precisely made up his mind to say anything at all You were going to say that Isabel stoops I know you were you men are such observers Well so she does it can t be denied and certainly if there is one thing more than another that makes a girl look ugly it is stooping I often tell her that when she gets a little older she ll be quite frightful Well you are a quiz mister Tupman had no objection to earning the reputation at so cheap a rate so he looked very knowing and smiled mysteriously What a sarcastic smile said the admiring Rachael I declare I m quite afraid of you Afraid of me Oh you can t disguise anything from me I know what that smile means very well What said mister Tupman who had not the slightest notion himself You mean said the amiable aunt sinking her voice still lower you mean that you don t think Isabella s stooping is as bad as Emily s boldness Well she is bold You cannot think how wretched it makes me sometimes I m sure I cry about it for hours together my dear brother is SO good and so unsuspicious that he never sees it if he did I m quite certain it would break his heart I wish I could think it was only manner I hope it may be Here the affectionate relative heaved a deep sigh and shook her head despondingly I m sure aunt s talking about us whispered Miss Emily Wardle to her sister I m quite certain of it she looks so malicious Is she replied Isabella Hem aunt dear Yes my dear love I m SO afraid you ll catch cold aunt have a silk handkerchief to tie round your dear old head you really should take care of yourself consider your age However well deserved this piece of retaliation might have been it was as vindictive a one as could well have been resorted to There is no guessing in what form of reply the aunt s indignation would have vented itself had not mister Wardle unconsciously changed the subject by calling emphatically for Joe Damn that boy said the old gentleman he s gone to sleep again Very extraordinary boy that said mister Pickwick does he always sleep in this way Sleep said the old gentleman he s always asleep Goes on errands fast asleep and snores as he waits at table How very odd said mister Pickwick Ah odd indeed returned the old gentleman I m proud of that boy wouldn t part with him on any account he s a natural curiosity Here Joe Joe take these things away and open another bottle d ye hear The fat boy rose opened his eyes swallowed the huge piece of pie he had been in the act of masticating when he last fell asleep and slowly obeyed his master s orders gloating languidly over the remains of the feast as he removed the plates and deposited them in the hamper The fresh bottle was produced and speedily emptied the hamper was made fast in its old place the fat boy once more mounted the box the spectacles and pocket glass were again adjusted and the evolutions of the military recommenced There was a great fizzing and banging of guns and starting of ladies and then a Mine was sprung to the gratification of everybody and when the mine had gone off the military and the company followed its example and went off too Now mind said the old gentleman as he shook hands with mister Pickwick at the conclusion of a conversation which had been carried on at intervals during the conclusion of the proceedings we shall see you all to morrow Most certainly replied mister Pickwick You have got the address Manor Farm Dingley Dell said mister Pickwick consulting his pocket book That s it said the old gentleman I don t let you off mind under a week and undertake that you shall see everything worth seeing If you ve come down for a country life come to me and I ll give you plenty of it Joe damn that boy he s gone to sleep again Joe help Tom put in the horses The horses were put in the driver mounted the fat boy clambered up by his side farewells were exchanged and the carriage rattled off As the Pickwickians turned round to take a last glimpse of it the setting sun cast a rich glow on the faces of their entertainers and fell upon the form of the fat boy His head was sunk upon his bosom and he slumbered again CHAPTER V A SHORT ONE SHOWING AMONG OTHER MATTERS HOW mister PICKWICK UNDERTOOK TO DRIVE AND mister WINKLE TO RIDE AND HOW THEY BOTH DID IT Bright and pleasant was the sky balmy the air and beautiful the appearance of every object around as mister Pickwick leaned over the balustrades of Rochester Bridge contemplating nature and waiting for breakfast The scene was indeed one which might well have charmed a far less reflective mind than that to which it was presented On the left of the spectator lay the ruined wall broken in many places and in some overhanging the narrow beach below in rude and heavy masses Huge knots of seaweed hung upon the jagged and pointed stones trembling in every breath of wind and the green ivy clung mournfully round the dark and ruined battlements Behind it rose the ancient castle its towers roofless and its massive walls crumbling away but telling us proudly of its old might and strength as when seven hundred years ago it rang with the clash of arms or resounded with the noise of feasting and revelry On either side the banks of the Medway covered with cornfields and pastures with here and there a windmill or a distant church stretched away as far as the eye could see presenting a rich and varied landscape rendered more beautiful by the changing shadows which passed swiftly across it as the thin and half formed clouds skimmed away in the light of the morning sun The river reflecting the clear blue of the sky glistened and sparkled as it flowed noiselessly on and the oars of the fishermen dipped into the water with a clear and liquid sound as their heavy but picturesque boats glided slowly down the stream mister Pickwick was roused from the agreeable reverie into which he had been led by the objects before him by a deep sigh and a touch on his shoulder He turned round and the dismal man was at his side Contemplating the scene inquired the dismal man I was said mister Pickwick And congratulating yourself on being up so soon mister Pickwick nodded assent Ah people need to rise early to see the sun in all his splendour for his brightness seldom lasts the day through The morning of day and the morning of life are but too much alike You speak truly sir said mister Pickwick How common the saying continued the dismal man The morning s too fine to last How well might it be applied to our everyday existence God what would I forfeit to have the days of my childhood restored or to be able to forget them for ever You have seen much trouble sir said mister Pickwick compassionately I have said the dismal man hurriedly I have More than those who see me now would believe possible He paused for an instant and then said abruptly Did it ever strike you on such a morning as this that drowning would be happiness and peace God bless me no replied mister Pickwick edging a little from the balustrade as the possibility of the dismal man s tipping him over by way of experiment occurred to him rather forcibly I have thought so often said the dismal man without noticing the action The calm cool water seems to me to murmur an invitation to repose and rest A bound a splash a brief struggle there is an eddy for an instant it gradually subsides into a gentle ripple the waters have closed above your head and the world has closed upon your miseries and misfortunes for ever The sunken eye of the dismal man flashed brightly as he spoke but the momentary excitement quickly subsided and he turned calmly away as he said There enough of that I wish to see you on another subject You invited me to read that paper the night before last and listened attentively while I did so I did replied mister Pickwick and I certainly thought I asked for no opinion said the dismal man interrupting him and I want none You are travelling for amusement and instruction Suppose I forward you a curious manuscript observe not curious because wild or improbable but curious as a leaf from the romance of real life would you communicate it to the club of which you have spoken so frequently Certainly replied mister Pickwick if you wished it and it would be entered on their transactions You shall have it replied the dismal man Your address and mister Pickwick having communicated their probable route the dismal man carefully noted it down in a greasy pocket book and resisting mister Pickwick s pressing invitation to breakfast left that gentleman at his inn and walked slowly away mister Pickwick found that his three companions had risen and were waiting his arrival to commence breakfast which was ready laid in tempting display They sat down to the meal and broiled ham eggs tea coffee and sundries began to disappear with a rapidity which at once bore testimony to the excellence of the fare and the appetites of its consumers Now about Manor Farm said mister Pickwick How shall we go We had better consult the waiter perhaps said mister Tupman and the waiter was summoned accordingly Dingley Dell gentlemen fifteen miles gentlemen cross road post chaise sir Post chaise won t hold more than two said mister Pickwick True sir beg your pardon sir Very nice four wheel chaise sir seat for two behind one in front for the gentleman that drives oh beg your pardon sir that ll only hold three What s to be done said mister Snodgrass Perhaps one of the gentlemen would like to ride sir suggested the waiter looking towards mister Winkle very good saddle horses sir any of mister Wardle s men coming to Rochester bring em back Sir The very thing said mister Pickwick Winkle will you go on horseback Now mister Winkle did entertain considerable misgivings in the very lowest recesses of his own heart relative to his equestrian skill but as he would not have them even suspected on any account he at once replied with great hardihood Certainly I should enjoy it of all things mister Winkle had rushed upon his fate there was no resource Let them be at the door by eleven said mister Pickwick Very well sir replied the waiter The waiter retired the breakfast concluded and the travellers ascended to their respective bedrooms to prepare a change of clothing to take with them on their approaching expedition mister Pickwick had made his preliminary arrangements and was looking over the coffee room blinds at the passengers in the street when the waiter entered and announced that the chaise was ready an announcement which the vehicle itself confirmed by forthwith appearing before the coffee room blinds aforesaid It was a curious little green box on four wheels with a low place like a wine bin for two behind and an elevated perch for one in front drawn by an immense brown horse displaying great symmetry of bone An hostler stood near holding by the bridle another immense horse apparently a near relative of the animal in the chaise ready saddled for mister Winkle Bless my soul said mister Pickwick as they stood upon the pavement while the coats were being put in Bless my soul who s to drive I never thought of that Oh you of course said mister Tupman Of course said mister Snodgrass I exclaimed mister Pickwick Not the slightest fear Sir interposed the hostler Warrant him quiet Sir a hinfant in arms might drive him He don t shy does he inquired mister Pickwick Shy sir he wouldn t shy if he was to meet a vagin load of monkeys with their tails burned off The last recommendation was indisputable mister Tupman and mister Snodgrass got into the bin mister Pickwick ascended to his perch and deposited his feet on a floor clothed shelf erected beneath it for that purpose Now shiny Villiam said the hostler to the deputy hostler give the general lm n the ribbons Shiny Villiam so called probably from his sleek hair and oily countenance placed the reins in mister Pickwick s left hand and the upper hostler thrust a whip into his right Wo o cried mister Pickwick as the tall quadruped evinced a decided inclination to back into the coffee room window Wo o echoed mister Tupman and mister Snodgrass from the bin Only his playfulness general lm n said the head hostler encouragingly jist kitch hold on him Villiam The deputy restrained the animal s impetuosity and the principal ran to assist mister Winkle in mounting T other side sir if you please Blowed if the general lm n worn t a gettin up on the wrong side whispered a grinning post boy to the inexpressibly gratified waiter mister Winkle thus instructed climbed into his saddle with about as much difficulty as he would have experienced in getting up the side of a first rate man of war All right inquired mister Pickwick with an inward presentiment that it was all wrong All right replied mister Winkle faintly Let em go cried the hostler Hold him in sir and away went the chaise and the saddle horse with mister Pickwick on the box of the one and mister Winkle on the back of the other to the delight and gratification of the whole inn yard What makes him go sideways said mister Snodgrass in the bin to mister Winkle in the saddle I can t imagine replied mister Winkle His horse was drifting up the street in the most mysterious manner side first with his head towards one side of the way and his tail towards the other mister Pickwick had no leisure to observe either this or any other particular the whole of his faculties being concentrated in the management of the animal attached to the chaise who displayed various peculiarities highly interesting to a bystander but by no means equally amusing to any one seated behind him Besides constantly jerking his head up in a very unpleasant and uncomfortable manner and tugging at the reins to an extent which rendered it a matter of great difficulty for mister Pickwick to hold them he had a singular propensity for darting suddenly every now and then to the side of the road then stopping short and then rushing forward for some minutes at a speed which it was wholly impossible to control What CAN he mean by this said mister Snodgrass when the horse had executed this manoeuvre for the twentieth time I don t know replied mister Tupman it looks very like shying don t it mister Snodgrass was about to reply when he was interrupted by a shout from mister Pickwick Woo said that gentleman I have dropped my whip Winkle said mister Snodgrass as the equestrian came trotting up on the tall horse with his hat over his ears and shaking all over as if he would shake to pieces with the violence of the exercise pick up the whip there s a good fellow mister Winkle pulled at the bridle of the tall horse till he was black in the face and having at length succeeded in stopping him dismounted handed the whip to mister Pickwick and grasping the reins prepared to remount Now whether the tall horse in the natural playfulness of his disposition was desirous of having a little innocent recreation with mister Winkle or whether it occurred to him that he could perform the journey as much to his own satisfaction without a rider as with one are points upon which of course we can arrive at no definite and distinct conclusion By whatever motives the animal was actuated certain it is that mister Winkle had no sooner touched the reins than he slipped them over his head and darted backwards to their full length Poor fellow said mister Winkle soothingly poor fellow good old horse The poor fellow was proof against flattery the more mister Winkle tried to get nearer him the more he sidled away and notwithstanding all kinds of coaxing and wheedling there were mister Winkle and the horse going round and round each other for ten minutes at the end of which time each was at precisely the same distance from the other as when they first commenced an unsatisfactory sort of thing under any circumstances but particularly so in a lonely road where no assistance can be procured What am I to do shouted mister Winkle after the dodging had been prolonged for a considerable time What am I to do I can t get on him You had better lead him till we come to a turnpike replied mister Pickwick from the chaise But he won t come roared mister Winkle Do come and hold him mister Pickwick was the very personation of kindness and humanity he threw the reins on the horse s back and having descended from his seat carefully drew the chaise into the hedge lest anything should come along the road and stepped back to the assistance of his distressed companion leaving mister Tupman and mister Snodgrass in the vehicle The horse no sooner beheld mister Pickwick advancing towards him with the chaise whip in his hand than he exchanged the rotary motion in which he had previously indulged for a retrograde movement of so very determined a character that it at once drew mister Winkle who was still at the end of the bridle at a rather quicker rate than fast walking in the direction from which they had just come mister Pickwick ran to his assistance but the faster mister Pickwick ran forward the faster the horse ran backward There was a great scraping of feet and kicking up of the dust and at last mister Winkle his arms being nearly pulled out of their sockets fairly let go his hold The horse paused stared shook his head turned round and quietly trotted home to Rochester leaving mister Winkle and mister Pickwick gazing on each other with countenances of blank dismay A rattling noise at a little distance attracted their attention They looked up Bless my soul exclaimed the agonised mister Pickwick there s the other horse running away It was but too true The animal was startled by the noise and the reins were on his back The results may be guessed He tore off with the four wheeled chaise behind him and mister Tupman and mister Snodgrass in the four wheeled chaise The heat was a short one mister Tupman threw himself into the hedge mister Snodgrass followed his example the horse dashed the four wheeled chaise against a wooden bridge separated the wheels from the body and the bin from the perch and finally stood stock still to gaze upon the ruin he had made The first care of the two unspilt friends was to extricate their unfortunate companions from their bed of quickset a process which gave them the unspeakable satisfaction of discovering that they had sustained no injury beyond sundry rents in their garments and various lacerations from the brambles The next thing to be done was to unharness the horse This complicated process having been effected the party walked slowly forward leading the horse among them and abandoning the chaise to its fate An hour s walk brought the travellers to a little road side public house with two elm trees a horse trough and a signpost in front one or two deformed hay ricks behind a kitchen garden at the side and rotten sheds and mouldering outhouses jumbled in strange confusion all about it A red headed man was working in the garden and to him mister Pickwick called lustily Hollo there The red headed man raised his body shaded his eyes with his hand and stared long and coolly at mister Pickwick and his companions Hollo there repeated mister Pickwick Hollo was the red headed man s reply How far is it to Dingley Dell Better er seven mile Is it a good road No tain t Having uttered this brief reply and apparently satisfied himself with another scrutiny the red headed man resumed his work We want to put this horse up here said mister Pickwick I suppose we can can t we Want to put that ere horse up do ee repeated the red headed man leaning on his spade Of course replied mister Pickwick who had by this time advanced horse in hand to the garden rails Missus roared the man with the red head emerging from the garden and looking very hard at the horse missus A tall bony woman straight all the way down in a coarse blue pelisse with the waist an inch or two below her arm pits responded to the call Can we put this horse up here my good woman said mister Tupman advancing and speaking in his most seductive tones The woman looked very hard at the whole party and the red headed man whispered something in her ear No replied the woman after a little consideration I m afeerd on it Afraid exclaimed mister Pickwick what s the woman afraid of It got us in trouble last time said the woman turning into the house I woan t have nothin to say to un Most extraordinary thing I have ever met with in my life said the astonished mister Pickwick I I really believe whispered mister Winkle as his friends gathered round him that they think we have come by this horse in some dishonest manner What exclaimed mister Pickwick in a storm of indignation mister Winkle modestly repeated his suggestion Hollo you fellow said the angry mister Pickwick do you think we stole the horse I m sure ye did replied the red headed man with a grin which agitated his countenance from one auricular organ to the other Saying which he turned into the house and banged the door after him It s like a dream ejaculated mister Pickwick a hideous dream The idea of a man s walking about all day with a dreadful horse that he can t get rid of The depressed Pickwickians turned moodily away with the tall quadruped for which they all felt the most unmitigated disgust following slowly at their heels It was late in the afternoon when the four friends and their four footed companion turned into the lane leading to Manor Farm and even when they were so near their place of destination the pleasure they would otherwise have experienced was materially damped as they reflected on the singularity of their appearance and the absurdity of their situation Torn clothes lacerated faces dusty shoes exhausted looks and above all the horse Oh how mister Pickwick cursed that horse he had eyed the noble animal from time to time with looks expressive of hatred and revenge more than once he had calculated the probable amount of the expense he would incur by cutting his throat and now the temptation to destroy him or to cast him loose upon the world rushed upon his mind with tenfold force He was roused from a meditation on these dire imaginings by the sudden appearance of two figures at a turn of the lane It was mister Wardle and his faithful attendant the fat boy Why where have you been said the hospitable old gentleman I ve been waiting for you all day Well you DO look tired What Scratches Not hurt I hope eh Well I AM glad to hear that very So you ve been spilt eh Never mind Common accident in these parts Joe he s asleep again Joe take that horse from the gentlemen and lead it into the stable The fat boy sauntered heavily behind them with the animal and the old gentleman condoling with his guests in homely phrase on so much of the day s adventures as they thought proper to communicate led the way to the kitchen We ll have you put to rights here said the old gentleman and then I ll introduce you to the people in the parlour Emma bring out the cherry brandy now Jane a needle and thread here towels and water Mary Come girls bustle about Three or four buxom girls speedily dispersed in search of the different articles in requisition while a couple of large headed circular visaged males rose from their seats in the chimney corner for although it was a May evening their attachment to the wood fire appeared as cordial as if it were Christmas and dived into some obscure recesses from which they speedily produced a bottle of blacking and some half dozen brushes Bustle said the old gentleman again but the admonition was quite unnecessary for one of the girls poured out the cherry brandy and another brought in the towels and one of the men suddenly seizing mister Pickwick by the leg at imminent hazard of throwing him off his balance brushed away at his boot till his corns were red hot while the other shampooed mister Winkle with a heavy clothes brush indulging during the operation in that hissing sound which hostlers are wont to produce when engaged in rubbing down a horse mister Snodgrass having concluded his ablutions took a survey of the room while standing with his back to the fire sipping his cherry brandy with heartfelt satisfaction He describes it as a large apartment with a red brick floor and a capacious chimney the ceiling garnished with hams sides of bacon and ropes of onions The walls were decorated with several hunting whips two or three bridles a saddle and an old rusty blunderbuss with an inscription below it intimating that it was Loaded as it had been on the same authority for half a century at least An old eight day clock of solemn and sedate demeanour ticked gravely in one corner and a silver watch of equal antiquity dangled from one of the many hooks which ornamented the dresser Ready said the old gentleman inquiringly when his guests had been washed mended brushed and brandied Quite replied mister Pickwick Come along then and the party having traversed several dark passages and being joined by mister Tupman who had lingered behind to snatch a kiss from Emma for which he had been duly rewarded with sundry pushings and scratchings arrived at the parlour door Welcome said their hospitable host throwing it open and stepping forward to announce them welcome gentlemen to Manor Farm CHAPTER VI AN OLD FASHIONED CARD PARTY THE CLERGYMAN S VERSES THE STORY OF THE CONVICT S RETURN Several guests who were assembled in the old parlour rose to greet mister Pickwick and his friends upon their entrance and during the performance of the ceremony of introduction with all due formalities mister Pickwick had leisure to observe the appearance and speculate upon the characters and pursuits of the persons by whom he was surrounded a habit in which he in common with many other great men delighted to indulge A very old lady in a lofty cap and faded silk gown no less a personage than mister Wardle s mother occupied the post of honour on the right hand corner of the chimney piece and various certificates of her having been brought up in the way she should go when young and of her not having departed from it when old ornamented the walls in the form of samplers of ancient date worsted landscapes of equal antiquity and crimson silk tea kettle holders of a more modern period The aunt the two young ladies and mister Wardle each vying with the other in paying zealous and unremitting attentions to the old lady crowded round her easy chair one holding her ear trumpet another an orange and a third a smelling bottle while a fourth was busily engaged in patting and punching the pillows which were arranged for her support On the opposite side sat a bald headed old gentleman with a good humoured benevolent face the clergyman of Dingley Dell and next him sat his wife a stout blooming old lady who looked as if she were well skilled not only in the art and mystery of manufacturing home made cordials greatly to other people s satisfaction but of tasting them occasionally very much to her own A little hard headed Ripstone pippin faced man was conversing with a fat old gentleman in one corner and two or three more old gentlemen and two or three more old ladies sat bolt upright and motionless on their chairs staring very hard at mister Pickwick and his fellow voyagers mister Pickwick mother said mister Wardle at the very top of his voice Ah said the old lady shaking her head I can t hear you mister Pickwick grandma screamed both the young ladies together Ah exclaimed the old lady Well it don t much matter He don t care for an old ooman like me I dare say I assure you ma am said mister Pickwick grasping the old lady s hand and speaking so loud that the exertion imparted a crimson hue to his benevolent countenance I assure you ma am that nothing delights me more than to see a lady of your time of life heading so fine a family and looking so young and well Ah said the old lady after a short pause it s all very fine I dare say but I can t hear him Grandma s rather put out now said Miss Isabella Wardle in a low tone but she ll talk to you presently mister Pickwick nodded his readiness to humour the infirmities of age and entered into a general conversation with the other members of the circle Delightful situation this said mister Pickwick Delightful echoed Messrs Snodgrass Tupman and Winkle Well I think it is said mister Wardle There ain t a better spot o ground in all Kent sir said the hard headed man with the pippin face there ain t indeed sir I m sure there ain t Sir The hard headed man looked triumphantly round as if he had been very much contradicted by somebody but had got the better of him at last There ain t a better spot o ground in all Kent said the hard headed man again after a pause Cept Mullins s Meadows observed the fat man solemnly Mullins s Meadows ejaculated the other with profound contempt Ah Mullins s Meadows repeated the fat man Reg lar good land that interposed another fat man And so it is sure ly said a third fat man Everybody knows that said the corpulent host The hard headed man looked dubiously round but finding himself in a minority assumed a compassionate air and said no more What are they talking about inquired the old lady of one of her granddaughters in a very audible voice for like many deaf people she never seemed to calculate on the possibility of other persons hearing what she said herself About the land grandma What about the land Nothing the matter is there No no mister Miller was saying our land was better than Mullins s Meadows How should he know anything about it inquired the old lady indignantly Miller s a conceited coxcomb and you may tell him I said so Saying which the old lady quite unconscious that she had spoken above a whisper drew herself up and looked carving knives at the hard headed delinquent Come come said the bustling host with a natural anxiety to change the conversation what say you to a rubber mister Pickwick I should like it of all things replied that gentleman but pray don t make up one on my account Oh I assure you mother s very fond of a rubber said mister Wardle ain t you mother The old lady who was much less deaf on this subject than on any other replied in the affirmative Joe Joe said the gentleman Joe damn that oh here he is put out the card tables The lethargic youth contrived without any additional rousing to set out two card tables the one for Pope Joan and the other for whist The whist players were mister Pickwick and the old lady mister Miller and the fat gentleman The round game comprised the rest of the company The rubber was conducted with all that gravity of deportment and sedateness of demeanour which befit the pursuit entitled whist a solemn observance to which as it appears to us the title of game has been very irreverently and ignominiously applied The round game table on the other hand was so boisterously merry as materially to interrupt the contemplations of mister Miller who not being quite so much absorbed as he ought to have been contrived to commit various high crimes and misdemeanours which excited the wrath of the fat gentleman to a very great extent and called forth the good humour of the old lady in a proportionate degree There said the criminal Miller triumphantly as he took up the odd trick at the conclusion of a hand that could not have been played better I flatter myself impossible to have made another trick Miller ought to have trumped the diamond oughtn t he Sir said the old lady mister Pickwick nodded assent Ought I though said the unfortunate with a doubtful appeal to his partner You ought Sir said the fat gentleman in an awful voice Very sorry said the crestfallen Miller Much use that growled the fat gentleman Two by honours makes us eight said mister Pickwick Another hand Can you one inquired the old lady I can replied mister Pickwick Double single and the rub Never was such luck said mister Miller Never was such cards said the fat gentleman A solemn silence mister Pickwick humorous the old lady serious the fat gentleman captious and mister Miller timorous Another double said the old lady triumphantly making a memorandum of the circumstance by placing one sixpence and a battered halfpenny under the candlestick A double sir said mister Pickwick Quite aware of the fact Sir replied the fat gentleman sharply Another game with a similar result was followed by a revoke from the unlucky Miller on which the fat gentleman burst into a state of high personal excitement which lasted until the conclusion of the game when he retired into a corner and remained perfectly mute for one hour and twenty seven minutes at the end of which time he emerged from his retirement and offered mister Pickwick a pinch of snuff with the air of a man who had made up his mind to a Christian forgiveness of injuries sustained The old lady s hearing decidedly improved and the unlucky Miller felt as much out of his element as a dolphin in a sentry box Meanwhile the round game proceeded right merrily Isabella Wardle and mister Trundle went partners and Emily Wardle and mister Snodgrass did the same and even mister Tupman and the spinster aunt established a joint stock company of fish and flattery Old mister Wardle was in the very height of his jollity and he was so funny in his management of the board and the old ladies were so sharp after their winnings that the whole table was in a perpetual roar of merriment and laughter There was one old lady who always had about half a dozen cards to pay for at which everybody laughed regularly every round and when the old lady looked cross at having to pay they laughed louder than ever on which the old lady s face gradually brightened up till at last she laughed louder than any of them Then when the spinster aunt got matrimony the young ladies laughed afresh and the Spinster aunt seemed disposed to be pettish till feeling mister Tupman squeezing her hand under the table she brightened up too and looked rather knowing as if matrimony in reality were not quite so far off as some people thought for whereupon everybody laughed again and especially old mister Wardle who enjoyed a joke as much as the youngest As to mister Snodgrass he did nothing but whisper poetical sentiments into his partner s ear which made one old gentleman facetiously sly about partnerships at cards and partnerships for life and caused the aforesaid old gentleman to make some remarks thereupon accompanied with divers winks and chuckles which made the company very merry and the old gentleman s wife especially so And mister Winkle came out with jokes which are very well known in town but are not all known in the country and as everybody laughed at them very heartily and said they were very capital mister Winkle was in a state of great honour and glory And the benevolent clergyman looked pleasantly on for the happy faces which surrounded the table made the good old man feel happy too and though the merriment was rather boisterous still it came from the heart and not from the lips and this is the right sort of merriment after all The evening glided swiftly away in these cheerful recreations and when the substantial though homely supper had been despatched and the little party formed a social circle round the fire mister Pickwick thought he had never felt so happy in his life and at no time so much disposed to enjoy and make the most of the passing moment Now this said the hospitable host who was sitting in great state next the old lady s arm chair with her hand fast clasped in his this is just what I like the happiest moments of my life have been passed at this old fireside and I am so attached to it that I keep up a blazing fire here every evening until it actually grows too hot to bear it Why my poor old mother here used to sit before this fireplace upon that little stool when she was a girl didn t you mother The tear which starts unbidden to the eye when the recollection of old times and the happiness of many years ago is suddenly recalled stole down the old lady s face as she shook her head with a melancholy smile You must excuse my talking about this old place mister Pickwick resumed the host after a short pause for I love it dearly and know no other the old houses and fields seem like living friends to me and so does our little church with the ivy about which by the bye our excellent friend there made a song when he first came amongst us mister Snodgrass have you anything in your glass Plenty thank you replied that gentleman whose poetic curiosity had been greatly excited by the last observation of his entertainer I beg your pardon but you were talking about the song of the Ivy You must ask our friend opposite about that said the host knowingly indicating the clergyman by a nod of his head May I say that I should like to hear you repeat it sir said mister Snodgrass Why really replied the clergyman it s a very slight affair and the only excuse I have for having ever perpetrated it is that I was a young man at the time Such as it is however you shall hear it if you wish A murmur of curiosity was of course the reply and the old gentleman proceeded to recite with the aid of sundry promptings from his wife the lines in question I call them said he THE IVY GREEN Oh a dainty plant is the Ivy green That creepeth o er ruins old Of right choice food are his meals I ween In his cell so lone and cold The wall must be crumbled the stone decayed To pleasure his dainty whim And the mouldering dust that years have made Is a merry meal for him Creeping where no life is seen A rare old plant is the Ivy green Fast he stealeth on though he wears no wings And a staunch old heart has he How closely he twineth how tight he clings To his friend the huge Oak Tree And slily he traileth along the ground And his leaves he gently waves As he joyously hugs and crawleth round The rich mould of dead men s graves Creeping where grim death has been A rare old plant is the Ivy green Whole ages have fled and their works decayed And nations have scattered been But the stout old Ivy shall never fade From its hale and hearty green The brave old plant in its lonely days Shall fatten upon the past For the stateliest building man can raise Is the Ivy s food at last Creeping on where time has been A rare old plant is the Ivy green While the old gentleman repeated these lines a second time to enable mister Snodgrass to note them down mister Pickwick perused the lineaments of his face with an expression of great interest The old gentleman having concluded his dictation and mister Snodgrass having returned his note book to his pocket mister Pickwick said Excuse me sir for making the remark on so short an acquaintance but a gentleman like yourself cannot fail I should think to have observed many scenes and incidents worth recording in the course of your experience as a minister of the Gospel I have witnessed some certainly replied the old gentleman but the incidents and characters have been of a homely and ordinary nature my sphere of action being so very limited You did make some notes I think about John Edmunds did you not inquired mister Wardle who appeared very desirous to draw his friend out for the edification of his new visitors The old gentleman slightly nodded his head in token of assent and was proceeding to change the subject when mister Pickwick said I beg your pardon sir but pray if I may venture to inquire who was John Edmunds The very thing I was about to ask said mister Snodgrass eagerly You are fairly in for it said the jolly host You must satisfy the curiosity of these gentlemen sooner or later so you had better take advantage of this favourable opportunity and do so at once The old gentleman smiled good humouredly as he drew his chair forward the remainder of the party drew their chairs closer together especially mister Tupman and the spinster aunt who were possibly rather hard of hearing and the old lady s ear trumpet having been duly adjusted and mister Miller who had fallen asleep during the recital of the verses roused from his slumbers by an admonitory pinch administered beneath the table by his ex partner the solemn fat man the old gentleman without further preface commenced the following tale to which we have taken the liberty of prefixing the title of THE CONVICT S RETURN When I first settled in this village said the old gentleman which is now just five and twenty years ago the most notorious person among my parishioners was a man of the name of Edmunds who leased a small farm near this spot He was a morose savage hearted bad man idle and dissolute in his habits cruel and ferocious in his disposition Beyond the few lazy and reckless vagabonds with whom he sauntered away his time in the fields or sotted in the ale house he had not a single friend or acquaintance no one cared to speak to the man whom many feared and every one detested and Edmunds was shunned by all This man had a wife and one son who when I first came here was about twelve years old Of the acuteness of that woman s sufferings of the gentle and enduring manner in which she bore them of the agony of solicitude with which she reared that boy no one can form an adequate conception Heaven forgive me the supposition if it be an uncharitable one but I do firmly and in my soul believe that the man systematically tried for many years to break her heart but she bore it all for her child s sake and however strange it may seem to many for his father s too for brute as he was and cruelly as he had treated her she had loved him once and the recollection of what he had been to her awakened feelings of forbearance and meekness under suffering in her bosom to which all God s creatures but women are strangers They were poor they could not be otherwise when the man pursued such courses but the woman s unceasing and unwearied exertions early and late morning noon and night kept them above actual want These exertions were but ill repaid People who passed the spot in the evening sometimes at a late hour of the night reported that they had heard the moans and sobs of a woman in distress and the sound of blows and more than once when it was past midnight the boy knocked softly at the door of a neighbour s house whither he had been sent to escape the drunken fury of his unnatural father During the whole of this time and when the poor creature often bore about her marks of ill usage and violence which she could not wholly conceal she was a constant attendant at our little church Regularly every Sunday morning and afternoon she occupied the same seat with the boy at her side and though they were both poorly dressed much more so than many of their neighbours who were in a lower station they were always neat and clean Every one had a friendly nod and a kind word for poor missus Edmunds and sometimes when she stopped to exchange a few words with a neighbour at the conclusion of the service in the little row of elm trees which leads to the church porch or lingered behind to gaze with a mother s pride and fondness upon her healthy boy as he sported before her with some little companions her careworn face would lighten up with an expression of heartfelt gratitude and she would look if not cheerful and happy at least tranquil and contented Five or six years passed away the boy had become a robust and well grown youth The time that had strengthened the child s slight frame and knit his weak limbs into the strength of manhood had bowed his mother s form and enfeebled her steps but the arm that should have supported her was no longer locked in hers the face that should have cheered her no more looked upon her own She occupied her old seat but there was a vacant one beside her The Bible was kept as carefully as ever the places were found and folded down as they used to be but there was no one to read it with her and the tears fell thick and fast upon the book and blotted the words from her eyes Neighbours were as kind as they were wont to be of old but she shunned their greetings with averted head There was no lingering among the old elm trees now no cheering anticipations of happiness yet in store The desolate woman drew her bonnet closer over her face and walked hurriedly away Shall I tell you that the young man who looking back to the earliest of his childhood s days to which memory and consciousness extended and carrying his recollection down to that moment could remember nothing which was not in some way connected with a long series of voluntary privations suffered by his mother for his sake with ill usage and insult and violence and all endured for him shall I tell you that he with a reckless disregard for her breaking heart and a sullen wilful forgetfulness of all she had done and borne for him had linked himself with depraved and abandoned men and was madly pursuing a headlong career which must bring death to him and shame to her Alas for human nature You have anticipated it long since The measure of the unhappy woman s misery and misfortune was about to be completed Numerous offences had been committed in the neighbourhood the perpetrators remained undiscovered and their boldness increased A robbery of a daring and aggravated nature occasioned a vigilance of pursuit and a strictness of search they had not calculated on Young Edmunds was suspected with three companions He was apprehended committed tried condemned to die The wild and piercing shriek from a woman s voice which resounded through the court when the solemn sentence was pronounced rings in my ears at this moment That cry struck a terror to the culprit s heart which trial condemnation the approach of death itself had failed to awaken The lips which had been compressed in dogged sullenness throughout quivered and parted involuntarily the face turned ashy pale as the cold perspiration broke forth from every pore the sturdy limbs of the felon trembled and he staggered in the dock In the first transports of her mental anguish the suffering mother threw herself on her knees at my feet and fervently sought the Almighty Being who had hitherto supported her in all her troubles to release her from a world of woe and misery and to spare the life of her only child A burst of grief and a violent struggle such as I hope I may never have to witness again succeeded I knew that her heart was breaking from that hour but I never once heard complaint or murmur escape her lips It was a piteous spectacle to see that woman in the prison yard from day to day eagerly and fervently attempting by affection and entreaty to soften the hard heart of her obdurate son It was in vain He remained moody obstinate and unmoved Not even the unlooked for commutation of his sentence to transportation for fourteen years softened for an instant the sullen hardihood of his demeanour But the spirit of resignation and endurance that had so long upheld her was unable to contend against bodily weakness and infirmity She fell sick She dragged her tottering limbs from the bed to visit her son once more but her strength failed her and she sank powerless on the ground And now the boasted coldness and indifference of the young man were tested indeed and the retribution that fell heavily upon him nearly drove him mad A day passed away and his mother was not there another flew by and she came not near him a third evening arrived and yet he had not seen her and in four and twenty hours he was to be separated from her perhaps for ever Oh how the long forgotten thoughts of former days rushed upon his mind as he almost ran up and down the narrow yard as if intelligence would arrive the sooner for his hurrying and how bitterly a sense of his helplessness and desolation rushed upon him when he heard the truth His mother the only parent he had ever known lay ill it might be dying within one mile of the ground he stood on were he free and unfettered a few minutes would place him by her side He rushed to the gate and grasping the iron rails with the energy of desperation shook it till it rang again and threw himself against the thick wall as if to force a passage through the stone but the strong building mocked his feeble efforts and he beat his hands together and wept like a child I bore the mother s forgiveness and blessing to her son in prison and I carried the solemn assurance of repentance and his fervent supplication for pardon to her sick bed I heard with pity and compassion the repentant man devise a thousand little plans for her comfort and support when he returned but I knew that many months before he could reach his place of destination his mother would be no longer of this world He was removed by night A few weeks afterwards the poor woman s soul took its flight I confidently hope and solemnly believe to a place of eternal happiness and rest I performed the burial service over her remains She lies in our little churchyard There is no stone at her grave s head Her sorrows were known to man her virtues to God it had been arranged previously to the convict s departure that he should write to his mother as soon as he could obtain permission and that the letter should be addressed to me The father had positively refused to see his son from the moment of his apprehension and it was a matter of indifference to him whether he lived or died Many years passed over without any intelligence of him and when more than half his term of transportation had expired and I had received no letter I concluded him to be dead as indeed I almost hoped he might be Edmunds however had been sent a considerable distance up the country on his arrival at the settlement and to this circumstance perhaps may be attributed the fact that though several letters were despatched none of them ever reached my hands He remained in the same place during the whole fourteen years At the expiration of the term steadily adhering to his old resolution and the pledge he gave his mother he made his way back to England amidst innumerable difficulties and returned on foot to his native place On a fine Sunday evening in the month of August John Edmunds set foot in the village he had left with shame and disgrace seventeen years before His nearest way lay through the churchyard The man s heart swelled as he crossed the stile The tall old elms through whose branches the declining sun cast here and there a rich ray of light upon the shady part awakened the associations of his earliest days He pictured himself as he was then clinging to his mother s hand and walking peacefully to church He remembered how he used to look up into her pale face and how her eyes would sometimes fill with tears as she gazed upon his features tears which fell hot upon his forehead as she stooped to kiss him and made him weep too although he little knew then what bitter tears hers were He thought how often he had run merrily down that path with some childish playfellow looking back ever and again to catch his mother s smile or hear her gentle voice and then a veil seemed lifted from his memory and words of kindness unrequited and warnings despised and promises broken thronged upon his recollection till his heart failed him and he could bear it no longer He entered the church The evening service was concluded and the congregation had dispersed but it was not yet closed His steps echoed through the low building with a hollow sound and he almost feared to be alone it was so still and quiet He looked round him Nothing was changed The place seemed smaller than it used to be but there were the old monuments on which he had gazed with childish awe a thousand times the little pulpit with its faded cushion the Communion table before which he had so often repeated the Commandments he had reverenced as a child and forgotten as a man He approached the old seat it looked cold and desolate The cushion had been removed and the Bible was not there Perhaps his mother now occupied a poorer seat or possibly she had grown infirm and could not reach the church alone He dared not think of what he feared A cold feeling crept over him and he trembled violently as he turned away An old man entered the porch just as he reached it Edmunds started back for he knew him well many a time he had watched him digging graves in the churchyard What would he say to the returned convict The old man raised his eyes to the stranger s face bade him good evening and walked slowly on He had forgotten him He walked down the hill and through the village The weather was warm and the people were sitting at their doors or strolling in their little gardens as he passed enjoying the serenity of the evening and their rest from labour Many a look was turned towards him and many a doubtful glance he cast on either side to see whether any knew and shunned him There were strange faces in almost every house in some he recognised the burly form of some old schoolfellow a boy when he last saw him surrounded by a troop of merry children in others he saw seated in an easy chair at a cottage door a feeble and infirm old man whom he only remembered as a hale and hearty labourer but they had all forgotten him and he passed on unknown The last soft light of the setting sun had fallen on the earth casting a rich glow on the yellow corn sheaves and lengthening the shadows of the orchard trees as he stood before the old house the home of his infancy to which his heart had yearned with an intensity of affection not to be described through long and weary years of captivity and sorrow The paling was low though he well remembered the time that it had seemed a high wall to him and he looked over into the old garden There were more seeds and gayer flowers than there used to be but there were the old trees still the very tree under which he had lain a thousand times when tired of playing in the sun and felt the soft mild sleep of happy boyhood steal gently upon him There were voices within the house He listened but they fell strangely upon his ear he knew them not They were merry too and he well knew that his poor old mother could not be cheerful and he away The door opened and a group of little children bounded out shouting and romping The father with a little boy in his arms appeared at the door and they crowded round him clapping their tiny hands and dragging him out to join their joyous sports The convict thought on the many times he had shrunk from his father s sight in that very place He remembered how often he had buried his trembling head beneath the bedclothes and heard the harsh word and the hard stripe and his mother s wailing and though the man sobbed aloud with agony of mind as he left the spot his fist was clenched and his teeth were set in a fierce and deadly passion And such was the return to which he had looked through the weary perspective of many years and for which he had undergone so much suffering No face of welcome no look of forgiveness no house to receive no hand to help him and this too in the old village What was his loneliness in the wild thick woods where man was never seen to this He felt that in the distant land of his bondage and infamy he had thought of his native place as it was when he left it and not as it would be when he returned The sad reality struck coldly at his heart and his spirit sank within him He had not courage to make inquiries or to present himself to the only person who was likely to receive him with kindness and compassion He walked slowly on and shunning the roadside like a guilty man turned into a meadow he well remembered and covering his face with his hands threw himself upon the grass He had not observed that a man was lying on the bank beside him his garments rustled as he turned round to steal a look at the new comer and Edmunds raised his head The man had moved into a sitting posture His body was much bent and his face was wrinkled and yellow His dress denoted him an inmate of the workhouse he had the appearance of being very old but it looked more the effect of dissipation or disease than the length of years He was staring hard at the stranger and though his eyes were lustreless and heavy at first they appeared to glow with an unnatural and alarmed expression after they had been fixed upon him for a short time until they seemed to be starting from their sockets Edmunds gradually raised himself to his knees and looked more and more earnestly on the old man s face They gazed upon each other in silence The old man was ghastly pale He shuddered and tottered to his feet Edmunds sprang to his He stepped back a pace or two Edmunds advanced Let me hear you speak said the convict in a thick broken voice Stand off cried the old man with a dreadful oath The convict drew closer to him Stand off shrieked the old man Furious with terror he raised his stick and struck Edmunds a heavy blow across the face Father devil murmured the convict between his set teeth He rushed wildly forward and clenched the old man by the throat but he was his father and his arm fell powerless by his side The old man uttered a loud yell which rang through the lonely fields like the howl of an evil spirit His face turned black the gore rushed from his mouth and nose and dyed the grass a deep dark red as he staggered and fell He had ruptured a blood vessel and he was a dead man before his son could raise him In that corner of the churchyard said the old gentleman after a silence of a few moments in that corner of the churchyard of which I have before spoken there lies buried a man who was in my employment for three years after this event and who was truly contrite penitent and humbled if ever man was No one save myself knew in that man s lifetime who he was or whence he came it was John Edmunds the returned convict CHAPTER VII HOW mister WINKLE INSTEAD OF SHOOTING AT THE PIGEON AND KILLING THE CROW SHOT AT THE CROW AND WOUNDED THE PIGEON HOW THE DINGLEY DELL CRICKET CLUB PLAYED ALL MUGGLETON AND HOW ALL MUGGLETON DINED AT THE DINGLEY DELL EXPENSE WITH OTHER INTERESTING AND INSTRUCTIVE MATTERS The fatiguing adventures of the day or the somniferous influence of the clergyman s tale operated so strongly on the drowsy tendencies of mister Pickwick that in less than five minutes after he had been shown to his comfortable bedroom he fell into a sound and dreamless sleep from which he was only awakened by the morning sun darting his bright beams reproachfully into the apartment mister Pickwick was no sluggard and he sprang like an ardent warrior from his tent bedstead Pleasant pleasant country sighed the enthusiastic gentleman as he opened his lattice window Who could live to gaze from day to day on bricks and slates who had once felt the influence of a scene like this Who could continue to exist where there are no cows but the cows on the chimney pots nothing redolent of Pan but pan tiles no crop but stone crop Who could bear to drag out a life in such a spot Who I ask could endure it and having cross examined solitude after the most approved precedents at considerable length mister Pickwick thrust his head out of the lattice and looked around him The rich sweet smell of the hay ricks rose to his chamber window the hundred perfumes of the little flower garden beneath scented the air around the deep green meadows shone in the morning dew that glistened on every leaf as it trembled in the gentle air and the birds sang as if every sparkling drop were to them a fountain of inspiration mister Pickwick fell into an enchanting and delicious reverie Hollo was the sound that roused him He looked to the right but he saw nobody his eyes wandered to the left and pierced the prospect he stared into the sky but he wasn t wanted there and then he did what a common mind would have done at once looked into the garden and there saw mister Wardle How are you said the good humoured individual out of breath with his own anticipations of pleasure Beautiful morning ain t it Glad to see you up so early Make haste down and come out I ll wait for you here mister Pickwick needed no second invitation Ten minutes sufficed for the completion of his toilet and at the expiration of that time he was by the old gentleman s side Hollo said mister Pickwick in his turn seeing that his companion was armed with a gun and that another lay ready on the grass what s going forward Why your friend and I replied the host are going out rook shooting before breakfast He s a very good shot ain t he I ve heard him say he s a capital one replied mister Pickwick but I never saw him aim at anything Well said the host I wish he d come Joe Joe The fat boy who under the exciting influence of the morning did not appear to be more than three parts and a fraction asleep emerged from the house Go up and call the gentleman and tell him he ll find me and mister Pickwick in the rookery Show the gentleman the way there d ye hear The boy departed to execute his commission and the host carrying both guns like a second Robinson Crusoe led the way from the garden This is the place said the old gentleman pausing after a few minutes walking in an avenue of trees The information was unnecessary for the incessant cawing of the unconscious rooks sufficiently indicated their whereabouts The old gentleman laid one gun on the ground and loaded the other Here they are said mister Pickwick and as he spoke the forms of mister Tupman mister Snodgrass and mister Winkle appeared in the distance The fat boy not being quite certain which gentleman he was directed to call had with peculiar sagacity and to prevent the possibility of any mistake called them all Come along shouted the old gentleman addressing mister Winkle a keen hand like you ought to have been up long ago even to such poor work as this mister Winkle responded with a forced smile and took up the spare gun with an expression of countenance which a metaphysical rook impressed with a foreboding of his approaching death by violence may be supposed to assume It might have been keenness but it looked remarkably like misery The old gentleman nodded and two ragged boys who had been marshalled to the spot under the direction of the infant Lambert forthwith commenced climbing up two of the trees What are these lads for inquired mister Pickwick abruptly He was rather alarmed for he was not quite certain but that the distress of the agricultural interest about which he had often heard a great deal might have compelled the small boys attached to the soil to earn a precarious and hazardous subsistence by making marks of themselves for inexperienced sportsmen Only to start the game replied mister Wardle laughing To what inquired mister Pickwick Why in plain English to frighten the rooks Oh is that all You are satisfied Quite Very well Shall I begin If you please said mister Winkle glad of any respite Stand aside then Now for it The boy shouted and shook a branch with a nest on it Half a dozen young rooks in violent conversation flew out to ask what the matter was The old gentleman fired by way of reply Down fell one bird and off flew the others Take him up Joe said the old gentleman There was a smile upon the youth s face as he advanced Indistinct visions of rook pie floated through his imagination He laughed as he retired with the bird it was a plump one Now mister Winkle said the host reloading his own gun Fire away mister Winkle advanced and levelled his gun mister Pickwick and his friends cowered involuntarily to escape damage from the heavy fall of rooks which they felt quite certain would be occasioned by the devastating barrel of their friend There was a solemn pause a shout a flapping of wings a faint click Hollo said the old gentleman Won t it go inquired mister Pickwick Missed fire said mister Winkle who was very pale probably from disappointment Odd said the old gentleman taking the gun Never knew one of them miss fire before Why I don t see anything of the cap Bless my soul said mister Winkle I declare I forgot the cap The slight omission was rectified mister Pickwick crouched again mister Winkle stepped forward with an air of determination and resolution and mister Tupman looked out from behind a tree The boy shouted four birds flew out mister Winkle fired There was a scream as of an individual not a rook in corporal anguish mister Tupman had saved the lives of innumerable unoffending birds by receiving a portion of the charge in his left arm To describe the confusion that ensued would be impossible To tell how mister Pickwick in the first transports of emotion called mister Winkle Wretch how mister Tupman lay prostrate on the ground and how mister Winkle knelt horror stricken beside him how mister Tupman called distractedly upon some feminine Christian name and then opened first one eye and then the other and then fell back and shut them both all this would be as difficult to describe in detail as it would be to depict the gradual recovering of the unfortunate individual the binding up of his arm with pocket handkerchiefs and the conveying him back by slow degrees supported by the arms of his anxious friends They drew near the house The ladies were at the garden gate waiting for their arrival and their breakfast The spinster aunt appeared she smiled and beckoned them to walk quicker Twas evident she knew not of the disaster Poor thing there are times when ignorance is bliss indeed They approached nearer Why what is the matter with the little old gentleman said Isabella Wardle The spinster aunt heeded not the remark she thought it applied to mister Pickwick In her eyes Tracy Tupman was a youth she viewed his years through a diminishing glass Don t be frightened called out the old host fearful of alarming his daughters The little party had crowded so completely round mister Tupman that they could not yet clearly discern the nature of the accident Don t be frightened said the host What s the matter screamed the ladies mister Tupman has met with a little accident that s all The spinster aunt uttered a piercing scream burst into an hysteric laugh and fell backwards in the arms of her nieces Throw some cold water over her said the old gentleman No no murmured the spinster aunt I am better now Bella Emily a surgeon Is he wounded Is he dead Is he Ha ha ha Here the spinster aunt burst into fit number two of hysteric laughter interspersed with screams Calm yourself said mister Tupman affected almost to tears by this expression of sympathy with his sufferings Dear dear madam calm yourself It is his voice exclaimed the spinster aunt and strong symptoms of fit number three developed themselves forthwith Do not agitate yourself I entreat you dearest madam said mister Tupman soothingly I am very little hurt I assure you Then you are not dead ejaculated the hysterical lady Oh say you are not dead Don t be a fool Rachael interposed mister Wardle rather more roughly than was consistent with the poetic nature of the scene What the devil s the use of his saying he isn t dead No no I am not said mister Tupman I require no assistance but yours Let me lean on your arm He added in a whisper Oh Miss Rachael The agitated female advanced and offered her arm They turned into the breakfast parlour mister Tracy Tupman gently pressed her hand to his lips and sank upon the sofa Are you faint inquired the anxious Rachael No said mister Tupman It is nothing I shall be better presently He closed his eyes He sleeps murmured the spinster aunt His organs of vision had been closed nearly twenty seconds Dear dear mister Tupman mister Tupman jumped up Oh say those words again he exclaimed The lady started Surely you did not hear them she said bashfully Oh yes I did replied mister Tupman repeat them If you would have me recover repeat them Hush said the lady My brother mister Tracy Tupman resumed his former position and mister Wardle accompanied by a surgeon entered the room The arm was examined the wound dressed and pronounced to be a very slight one and the minds of the company having been thus satisfied they proceeded to satisfy their appetites with countenances to which an expression of cheerfulness was again restored mister Pickwick alone was silent and reserved Doubt and distrust were exhibited in his countenance His confidence in mister Winkle had been shaken greatly shaken by the proceedings of the morning Are you a cricketer inquired mister Wardle of the marksman At any other time mister Winkle would have replied in the affirmative He felt the delicacy of his situation and modestly replied No Are you sir inquired mister Snodgrass I was once upon a time replied the host but I have given it up now I subscribe to the club here but I don t play The grand match is played to day I believe said mister Pickwick It is replied the host Of course you would like to see it I sir replied mister Pickwick am delighted to view any sports which may be safely indulged in and in which the impotent effects of unskilful people do not endanger human life mister Pickwick paused and looked steadily on mister Winkle who quailed beneath his leader s searching glance The great man withdrew his eyes after a few minutes and added Shall we be justified in leaving our wounded friend to the care of the ladies You cannot leave me in better hands said mister Tupman Quite impossible said mister Snodgrass It was therefore settled that mister Tupman should be left at home in charge of the females and that the remainder of the guests under the guidance of mister Wardle should proceed to the spot where was to be held that trial of skill which had roused all Muggleton from its torpor and inoculated Dingley Dell with a fever of excitement As their walk which was not above two miles long lay through shady lanes and sequestered footpaths and as their conversation turned upon the delightful scenery by which they were on every side surrounded mister Pickwick was almost inclined to regret the expedition they had used when he found himself in the main street of the town of Muggleton Everybody whose genius has a topographical bent knows perfectly well that Muggleton is a corporate town with a mayor burgesses and freemen and anybody who has consulted the addresses of the mayor to the freemen or the freemen to the mayor or both to the corporation or all three to Parliament will learn from thence what they ought to have known before that Muggleton is an ancient and loyal borough mingling a zealous advocacy of Christian principles with a devoted attachment to commercial rights in demonstration whereof the mayor corporation and other inhabitants have presented at divers times no fewer than one thousand four hundred and twenty petitions against the continuance of negro slavery abroad and an equal number against any interference with the factory system at home sixty eight in favour of the sale of livings in the Church and eighty six for abolishing Sunday trading in the street mister Pickwick stood in the principal street of this illustrious town and gazed with an air of curiosity not unmixed with interest on the objects around him There was an open square for the market place and in the centre of it a large inn with a sign post in front displaying an object very common in art but rarely met with in nature to wit a blue lion with three bow legs in the air balancing himself on the extreme point of the centre claw of his fourth foot There were within sight an auctioneer s and fire agency office a corn factor s a linen draper s a saddler s a distiller s a grocer s and a shoe shop the last mentioned warehouse being also appropriated to the diffusion of hats bonnets wearing apparel cotton umbrellas and useful knowledge There was a red brick house with a small paved courtyard in front which anybody might have known belonged to the attorney and there was moreover another red brick house with Venetian blinds and a large brass door plate with a very legible announcement that it belonged to the surgeon A few boys were making their way to the cricket field and two or three shopkeepers who were standing at their doors looked as if they should like to be making their way to the same spot as indeed to all appearance they might have done without losing any great amount of custom thereby mister Pickwick having paused to make these observations to be noted down at a more convenient period hastened to rejoin his friends who had turned out of the main street and were already within sight of the field of battle The wickets were pitched and so were a couple of marquees for the rest and refreshment of the contending parties The game had not yet commenced Two or three Dingley Dellers and All Muggletonians were amusing themselves with a majestic air by throwing the ball carelessly from hand to hand and several other gentlemen dressed like them in straw hats flannel jackets and white trousers a costume in which they looked very much like amateur stone masons were sprinkled about the tents towards one of which mister Wardle conducted the party Several dozen of How are you s hailed the old gentleman s arrival and a general raising of the straw hats and bending forward of the flannel jackets followed his introduction of his guests as gentlemen from London who were extremely anxious to witness the proceedings of the day with which he had no doubt they would be greatly delighted You had better step into the marquee I think Sir said one very stout gentleman whose body and legs looked like half a gigantic roll of flannel elevated on a couple of inflated pillow cases You ll find it much pleasanter Sir urged another stout gentleman who strongly resembled the other half of the roll of flannel aforesaid You re very good said mister Pickwick This way said the first speaker they notch in here it s the best place in the whole field and the cricketer panting on before preceded them to the tent Capital game smart sport fine exercise very were the words which fell upon mister Pickwick s ear as he entered the tent and the first object that met his eyes was his green coated friend of the Rochester coach holding forth to the no small delight and edification of a select circle of the chosen of All Muggleton His dress was slightly improved and he wore boots but there was no mistaking him The stranger recognised his friends immediately and darting forward and seizing mister Pickwick by the hand dragged him to a seat with his usual impetuosity talking all the while as if the whole of the arrangements were under his especial patronage and direction This way this way capital fun lots of beer hogsheads rounds of beef bullocks mustard cart loads glorious day down with you make yourself at home glad to see you very mister Pickwick sat down as he was bid and mister Winkle and mister Snodgrass also complied with the directions of their mysterious friend mister Wardle looked on in silent wonder mister Wardle a friend of mine said mister Pickwick Friend of yours My dear sir how are you Friend of my friend s give me your hand sir and the stranger grasped mister Wardle s hand with all the fervour of a close intimacy of many years and then stepped back a pace or two as if to take a full survey of his face and figure and then shook hands with him again if possible more warmly than before Well and how came you here said mister Pickwick with a smile in which benevolence struggled with surprise Come replied the stranger stopping at Crown Crown at Muggleton met a party flannel jackets white trousers anchovy sandwiches devilled kidney splendid fellows glorious mister Pickwick was sufficiently versed in the stranger s system of stenography to infer from this rapid and disjointed communication that he had somehow or other contracted an acquaintance with the All Muggletons which he had converted by a process peculiar to himself into that extent of good fellowship on which a general invitation may be easily founded His curiosity was therefore satisfied and putting on his spectacles he prepared himself to watch the play which was just commencing All Muggleton had the first innings and the interest became intense when mister Dumkins and mister Podder two of the most renowned members of that most distinguished club walked bat in hand to their respective wickets mister Luffey the highest ornament of Dingley Dell was pitched to bowl against the redoubtable Dumkins and mister Struggles was selected to do the same kind office for the hitherto unconquered Podder Several players were stationed to look out in different parts of the field and each fixed himself into the proper attitude by placing one hand on each knee and stooping very much as if he were making a back for some beginner at leap frog All the regular players do this sort of thing indeed it is generally supposed that it is quite impossible to look out properly in any other position The umpires were stationed behind the wickets the scorers were prepared to notch the runs a breathless silence ensued mister Luffey retired a few paces behind the wicket of the passive Podder and applied the ball to his right eye for several seconds Dumkins confidently awaited its coming with his eyes fixed on the motions of Luffey Play suddenly cried the bowler The ball flew from his hand straight and swift towards the centre stump of the wicket The wary Dumkins was on the alert it fell upon the tip of the bat and bounded far away over the heads of the scouts who had just stooped low enough to let it fly over them Run run another Now then throw her up up with her stop there another no yes no throw her up throw her up Such were the shouts which followed the stroke and at the conclusion of which All Muggleton had scored two Nor was Podder behindhand in earning laurels wherewith to garnish himself and Muggleton He blocked the doubtful balls missed the bad ones took the good ones and sent them flying to all parts of the field The scouts were hot and tired the bowlers were changed and bowled till their arms ached but Dumkins and Podder remained unconquered Did an elderly gentleman essay to stop the progress of the ball it rolled between his legs or slipped between his fingers Did a slim gentleman try to catch it it struck him on the nose and bounded pleasantly off with redoubled violence while the slim gentleman s eyes filled with water and his form writhed with anguish Was it thrown straight up to the wicket Dumkins had reached it before the ball In short when Dumkins was caught out and Podder stumped out All Muggleton had notched some fifty four while the score of the Dingley Dellers was as blank as their faces The advantage was too great to be recovered In vain did the eager Luffey and the enthusiastic Struggles do all that skill and experience could suggest to regain the ground Dingley Dell had lost in the contest it was of no avail and in an early period of the winning game Dingley Dell gave in and allowed the superior prowess of All Muggleton The stranger meanwhile had been eating drinking and talking without cessation At every good stroke he expressed his satisfaction and approval of the player in a most condescending and patronising manner which could not fail to have been highly gratifying to the party concerned while at every bad attempt at a catch and every failure to stop the ball he launched his personal displeasure at the head of the devoted individual in such denunciations as Ah ah stupid Now butter fingers Muff Humbug and so forth ejaculations which seemed to establish him in the opinion of all around as a most excellent and undeniable judge of the whole art and mystery of the noble game of cricket Capital game well played some strokes admirable said the stranger as both sides crowded into the tent at the conclusion of the game You have played it sir inquired mister Wardle who had been much amused by his loquacity Played it Think I have thousands of times not here West Indies exciting thing hot work very It must be rather a warm pursuit in such a climate observed mister Pickwick Warm red hot scorching glowing Played a match once single wicket friend the colonel Sir Thomas Blazo who should get the greatest number of runs Won the toss first innings seven o clock A m six natives to look out went in kept in heat intense natives

Samba last man left sun so hot bat in blisters ball scorched brown five hundred and seventy runs rather exhausted Quanko mustered up last remaining strength bowled me out had a bath and went out to dinner And what became of what s his name Sir inquired an old gentleman Blazo No the other gentleman Quanko Samba Yes sir Poor Quanko never recovered it bowled on on my account bowled off on his own died sir Here the stranger buried his countenance in a brown jug but whether to hide his emotion or imbibe its contents we cannot distinctly affirm We only know that he paused suddenly drew a long and deep breath and looked anxiously on as two of the principal members of the Dingley Dell club approached mister Pickwick and said We are about to partake of a plain dinner at the Blue Lion Sir we hope you and your friends will join us Of course said mister Wardle among our friends we include mister and he looked towards the stranger Jingle said that versatile gentleman taking the hint at once Jingle Alfred Jingle esquire of No Hall Nowhere I shall be very happy I am sure said mister Pickwick So shall I said mister Alfred Jingle drawing one arm through mister Pickwick s and another through mister Wardle s as he whispered confidentially in the ear of the former gentleman Devilish good dinner cold but capital peeped into the room this morning fowls and pies and all that sort of thing pleasant fellows these well behaved too very There being no further preliminaries to arrange the company straggled into the town in little knots of twos and threes and within a quarter of an hour were all seated in the great room of the Blue Lion Inn Muggleton mister Dumkins acting as chairman and mister Luffey officiating as vice There was a vast deal of talking and rattling of knives and forks and plates a great running about of three ponderous headed waiters and a rapid disappearance of the substantial viands on the table to each and every of which item of confusion the facetious mister Jingle lent the aid of half a dozen ordinary men at least When everybody had eaten as much as possible the cloth was removed bottles glasses and dessert were placed on the table and the waiters withdrew to clear away or in other words to appropriate to their own private use and emolument whatever remnants of the eatables and drinkables they could contrive to lay their hands on Amidst the general hum of mirth and conversation that ensued there was a little man with a puffy Say nothing to me or I ll contradict you sort of countenance who remained very quiet occasionally looking round him when the conversation slackened as if he contemplated putting in something very weighty and now and then bursting into a short cough of inexpressible grandeur At length during a moment of comparative silence the little man called out in a very loud solemn voice mister Luffey Everybody was hushed into a profound stillness as the individual addressed replied Sir I wish to address a few words to you Sir if you will entreat the gentlemen to fill their glasses mister Jingle uttered a patronising Hear hear which was responded to by the remainder of the company and the glasses having been filled the vice president assumed an air of wisdom in a state of profound attention and said mister Staple Sir said the little man rising I wish to address what I have to say to you and not to our worthy chairman because our worthy chairman is in some measure I may say in a great degree the subject of what I have to say or I may say to to State suggested mister Jingle Yes to state said the little man I thank my honourable friend if he will allow me to call him so four hears and one certainly from mister Jingle for the suggestion Sir I am a Deller a Dingley Deller cheers I cannot lay claim to the honour of forming an item in the population of Muggleton nor Sir I will frankly admit do I covet that honour and I will tell you why Sir hear to Muggleton I will readily concede all these honours and distinctions to which it can fairly lay claim they are too numerous and too well known to require aid or recapitulation from me But sir while we remember that Muggleton has given birth to a Dumkins and a Podder let us never forget that Dingley Dell can boast a Luffey and a Struggles Vociferous cheering Let me not be considered as wishing to detract from the merits of the former gentlemen Sir I envy them the luxury of their own feelings on this occasion Cheers Every gentleman who hears me is probably acquainted with the reply made by an individual who to use an ordinary figure of speech hung out in a tub to the emperor Alexander if I were not Diogenes said he I would be Alexander I can well imagine these gentlemen to say If I were not Dumkins I would be Luffey if I were not Podder I would be Struggles Enthusiasm But gentlemen of Muggleton is it in cricket alone that your fellow townsmen stand pre eminent Have you never heard of Dumkins and determination Have you never been taught to associate Podder with property Great applause Have you never when struggling for your rights your liberties and your privileges been reduced if only for an instant to misgiving and despair And when you have been thus depressed has not the name of Dumkins laid afresh within your breast the fire which had just gone out and has not a word from that man lighted it again as brightly as if it had never expired Great cheering Gentlemen I beg to surround with a rich halo of enthusiastic cheering the united names of Dumkins and Podder Here the little man ceased and here the company commenced a raising of voices and thumping of tables which lasted with little intermission during the remainder of the evening Other toasts were drunk mister Luffey and mister Struggles mister Pickwick and mister Jingle were each in his turn the subject of unqualified eulogium and each in due course returned thanks for the honour Enthusiastic as we are in the noble cause to which we have devoted ourselves we should have felt a sensation of pride which we cannot express and a consciousness of having done something to merit immortality of which we are now deprived could we have laid the faintest outline on these addresses before our ardent readers mister Snodgrass as usual took a great mass of notes which would no doubt have afforded most useful and valuable information had not the burning eloquence of the words or the feverish influence of the wine made that gentleman s hand so extremely unsteady as to render his writing nearly unintelligible and his style wholly so By dint of patient investigation we have been enabled to trace some characters bearing a faint resemblance to the names of the speakers and we can only discern an entry of a song supposed to have been sung by mister Jingle in which the words bowl sparkling ruby bright and wine are frequently repeated at short intervals We fancy too that we can discern at the very end of the notes some indistinct reference to broiled bones and then the words cold without occur but as any hypothesis we could found upon them must necessarily rest upon mere conjecture we are not disposed to indulge in any of the speculations to which they may give rise We will therefore return to mister Tupman merely adding that within some few minutes before twelve o clock that night the convocation of worthies of Dingley Dell and Muggleton were heard to sing with great feeling and emphasis the beautiful and pathetic national air of We won t go home till morning We won t go home till morning We won t go home till morning Till daylight doth appear CHAPTER VIII STRONGLY ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE POSITION THAT THE COURSE OF TRUE LOVE IS NOT A RAILWAY The quiet seclusion of Dingley Dell the presence of so many of the gentler sex and the solicitude and anxiety they evinced in his behalf were all favourable to the growth and development of those softer feelings which nature had implanted deep in the bosom of mister Tracy Tupman and which now appeared destined to centre in one lovely object The young ladies were pretty their manners winning their dispositions unexceptionable but there was a dignity in the air a touch me not ishness in the walk a majesty in the eye of the spinster aunt to which at their time of life they could lay no claim which distinguished her from any female on whom mister Tupman had ever gazed That there was something kindred in their nature something congenial in their souls something mysteriously sympathetic in their bosoms was evident Her name was the first that rose to mister Tupman s lips as he lay wounded on the grass and her hysteric laughter was the first sound that fell upon his ear when he was supported to the house But had her agitation arisen from an amiable and feminine sensibility which would have been equally irrepressible in any case or had it been called forth by a more ardent and passionate feeling which he of all men living could alone awaken These were the doubts which racked his brain as he lay extended on the sofa these were the doubts which he determined should be at once and for ever resolved it was evening Isabella and Emily had strolled out with mister Trundle the deaf old lady had fallen asleep in her chair the snoring of the fat boy penetrated in a low and monotonous sound from the distant kitchen the buxom servants were lounging at the side door enjoying the pleasantness of the hour and the delights of a flirtation on first principles with certain unwieldy animals attached to the farm and there sat the interesting pair uncared for by all caring for none and dreaming only of themselves there they sat in short like a pair of carefully folded kid gloves bound up in each other I have forgotten my flowers said the spinster aunt Water them now said mister Tupman in accents of persuasion You will take cold in the evening air urged the spinster aunt affectionately No no said mister Tupman rising it will do me good Let me accompany you The lady paused to adjust the sling in which the left arm of the youth was placed and taking his right arm led him to the garden There was a bower at the farther end with honeysuckle jessamine and creeping plants one of those sweet retreats which humane men erect for the accommodation of spiders The spinster aunt took up a large watering pot which lay in one corner and was about to leave the arbour mister Tupman detained her and drew her to a seat beside him Miss Wardle said he The spinster aunt trembled till some pebbles which had accidentally found their way into the large watering pot shook like an infant s rattle Miss Wardle said mister Tupman you are an angel mister Tupman exclaimed Rachael blushing as red as the watering pot itself Nay said the eloquent Pickwickian I know it but too well All women are angels they say murmured the lady playfully Then what can you be or to what without presumption can I compare you replied mister Tupman Where was the woman ever seen who resembled you Where else could I hope to find so rare a combination of excellence and beauty Where else could I seek to Oh Here mister Tupman paused and pressed the hand which clasped the handle of the happy watering pot The lady turned aside her head Men are such deceivers she softly whispered They are they are ejaculated mister Tupman but not all men There lives at least one being who can never change one being who would be content to devote his whole existence to your happiness who lives but in your eyes who breathes but in your smiles who bears the heavy burden of life itself only for you Could such an individual be found said the lady But he CAN be found said the ardent mister Tupman interposing He IS found He is here Miss Wardle And ere the lady was aware of his intention mister Tupman had sunk upon his knees at her feet mister Tupman rise said Rachael Never was the valorous reply Oh Rachael He seized her passive hand and the watering pot fell to the ground as he pressed it to his lips Oh Rachael say you love me mister Tupman said the spinster aunt with averted head I can hardly speak the words but but you are not wholly indifferent to me mister Tupman no sooner heard this avowal than he proceeded to do what his enthusiastic emotions prompted and 
1265_135635_000106_000002	train-clean-360	what for 
none	none	aught we know for we are but little acquainted with such matters people so circumstanced always do He jumped up and throwing his arm round the neck of the spinster aunt imprinted upon her lips numerous kisses which after a due show of struggling and resistance she received so passively that there is no telling how many more mister Tupman might have bestowed if the lady had not given a very unaffected start and exclaimed in an affrighted tone mister Tupman we are observed we are discovered mister Tupman looked round There was the fat boy perfectly motionless with his large circular eyes staring into the arbour but without the slightest expression on his face that the most expert physiognomist could have referred to astonishment curiosity or any other known passion that agitates the human breast mister Tupman gazed on the fat boy and the fat boy stared at him and the longer mister Tupman observed the utter vacancy of the fat boy s countenance the more convinced he became that he either did not know or did not understand anything that had been going forward Under this impression he said with great firmness What do you want here Sir Supper s ready sir was the prompt reply Have you just come here sir inquired mister Tupman with a piercing look Just replied the fat boy mister Tupman looked at him very hard again but there was not a wink in his eye or a curve in his face mister Tupman took the arm of the spinster aunt and walked towards the house the fat boy followed behind He knows nothing of what has happened he whispered Nothing said the spinster aunt There was a sound behind them as of an imperfectly suppressed chuckle mister Tupman turned sharply round No it could not have been the fat boy there was not a gleam of mirth or anything but feeding in his whole visage He must have been fast asleep whispered mister Tupman I have not the least doubt of it replied the spinster aunt They both laughed heartily mister Tupman was wrong The fat boy for once had not been fast asleep He was awake wide awake to what had been going forward The supper passed off without any attempt at a general conversation The old lady had gone to bed Isabella Wardle devoted herself exclusively to mister Trundle the spinster s attentions were reserved for mister Tupman and Emily s thoughts appeared to be engrossed by some distant object possibly they were with the absent Snodgrass Eleven twelve one o clock had struck and the gentlemen had not arrived Consternation sat on every face Could they have been waylaid and robbed Should they send men and lanterns in every direction by which they could be supposed likely to have travelled home or should they Hark there they were What could have made them so late A strange voice too To whom could it belong They rushed into the kitchen whither the truants had repaired and at once obtained rather more than a glimmering of the real state of the case mister Pickwick with his hands in his pockets and his hat cocked completely over his left eye was leaning against the dresser shaking his head from side to side and producing a constant succession of the blandest and most benevolent smiles without being moved thereunto by any discernible cause or pretence whatsoever old mister Wardle with a highly inflamed countenance was grasping the hand of a strange gentleman muttering protestations of eternal friendship mister Winkle supporting himself by the eight day clock was feebly invoking destruction upon the head of any member of the family who should suggest the propriety of his retiring for the night and mister Snodgrass had sunk into a chair with an expression of the most abject and hopeless misery that the human mind can imagine portrayed in every lineament of his expressive face
1265_135635_000069_000001	train-clean-360	 Is anything the matter 
none	none	inquired the three ladies Nothing the matter replied mister Pickwick We we re all right I say Wardle we re all right ain t we I should think so replied the jolly host My dears here s my friend mister Jingle mister Pickwick s friend mister Jingle come pon little visit Is anything the matter with mister Snodgrass Sir inquired Emily with great anxiety Nothing the matter ma am replied the stranger Cricket dinner glorious party capital songs old port claret good very good wine ma am wine It wasn t the wine murmured mister Snodgrass in a broken voice It was the salmon Somehow or other it never is the wine in these cases Hadn t they better go to bed ma am inquired Emma Two of the boys will carry the gentlemen upstairs I won t go to bed said mister Winkle firmly No living boy shall carry me said mister Pickwick stoutly and he went on smiling as before Hurrah gasped mister Winkle faintly Hurrah echoed mister Pickwick taking off his hat and dashing it on the floor and insanely casting his spectacles into the middle of the kitchen At this humorous feat he laughed outright Let s have nother bottle cried mister Winkle commencing in a very loud key and ending in a very faint one His head dropped upon his breast and muttering his invincible determination not to go to his bed and a sanguinary regret that he had not done for old Tupman in the morning he fell fast asleep in which condition he was borne to his apartment by two young giants under the personal superintendence of the fat boy to whose protecting care mister Snodgrass shortly afterwards confided his own person mister Pickwick accepted the proffered arm of mister Tupman and quietly disappeared smiling more than ever and mister Wardle after taking as affectionate a leave of the whole family as if he were ordered for immediate execution consigned to mister Trundle the honour of conveying him upstairs and retired with a very futile attempt to look impressively solemn and dignified What a shocking scene said the spinster aunt Dis gusting ejaculated both the young ladies Dreadful dreadful said Jingle looking very grave he was about a bottle and a half ahead of any of his companions Horrid spectacle very What a nice man whispered the spinster aunt to mister Tupman Good looking too whispered Emily Wardle Oh decidedly observed the spinster aunt mister Tupman thought of the widow at Rochester and his mind was troubled The succeeding half hour s conversation was not of a nature to calm his perturbed spirit The new visitor was very talkative and the number of his anecdotes was only to be exceeded by the extent of his politeness mister Tupman felt that as Jingle s popularity increased he Tupman retired further into the shade His laughter was forced his merriment feigned and when at last he laid his aching temples between the sheets he thought with horrid delight on the satisfaction it would afford him to have Jingle s head at that moment between the feather bed and the mattress The indefatigable stranger rose betimes next morning and although his companions remained in bed overpowered with the dissipation of the previous night exerted himself most successfully to promote the hilarity of the breakfast table So successful were his efforts that even the deaf old lady insisted on having one or two of his best jokes retailed through the trumpet and even she condescended to observe to the spinster aunt that He meaning Jingle was an impudent young fellow a sentiment in which all her relations then and there present thoroughly coincided It was the old lady s habit on the fine summer mornings to repair to the arbour in which mister Tupman had already signalised himself in form and manner following first the fat boy fetched from a peg behind the old lady s bedroom door a close black satin bonnet a warm cotton shawl and a thick stick with a capacious handle and the old lady having put on the bonnet and shawl at her leisure would lean one hand on the stick and the other on the fat boy s shoulder and walk leisurely to the arbour where the fat boy would leave her to enjoy the fresh air for the space of half an hour at the expiration of which time he would return and reconduct her to the house The old lady was very precise and very particular and as this ceremony had been observed for three successive summers without the slightest deviation from the accustomed form she was not a little surprised on this particular morning to see the fat boy instead of leaving the arbour walk a few paces out of it look carefully round him in every direction and return towards her with great stealth and an air of the most profound mystery The old lady was timorous most old ladies are and her first impression was that the bloated lad was about to do her some grievous bodily harm with the view of possessing himself of her loose coin She would have cried for assistance but age and infirmity had long ago deprived her of the power of screaming she therefore watched his motions with feelings of intense horror which were in no degree diminished by his coming close up to her and shouting in her ear in an agitated and as it seemed to her a threatening tone Missus Now it so happened that mister Jingle was walking in the garden close to the arbour at that moment He too heard the shouts of Missus and stopped to hear more There were three reasons for his doing so In the first place he was idle and curious secondly he was by no means scrupulous thirdly and lastly he was concealed from view by some flowering shrubs So there he stood and there he listened Missus shouted the fat boy Well Joe said the trembling old lady I m sure I have been a good mistress to you Joe You have invariably been treated very kindly You have never had too much to do and you have always had enough to eat This last was an appeal to the fat boy s most sensitive feelings He seemed touched as he replied emphatically I knows I has Then what can you want to do now said the old lady gaining courage I wants to make your flesh creep replied the boy This sounded like a very bloodthirsty mode of showing one s gratitude and as the old lady did not precisely understand the process by which such a result was to be attained all her former horrors returned What do you think I see in this very arbour last night inquired the boy Bless us What exclaimed the old lady alarmed at the solemn manner of the corpulent youth The strange gentleman him as had his arm hurt a kissin and huggin Who Joe None of the servants I hope Worser than that roared the fat boy in the old lady s ear Not one of my grandda aters Worser than that Worse than that Joe said the old lady who had thought this the extreme limit of human atrocity Who was it Joe I insist upon knowing The fat boy looked cautiously round and having concluded his survey shouted in the old lady s ear Miss Rachael What said the old lady in a shrill tone Speak louder Miss Rachael roared the fat boy My da ater The train of nods which the fat boy gave by way of assent communicated a blanc mange like motion to his fat cheeks And she suffered him exclaimed the old lady A grin stole over the fat boy s features as he said I see her a kissin of him agin If mister Jingle from his place of concealment could have beheld the expression which the old lady s face assumed at this communication the probability is that a sudden burst of laughter would have betrayed his close vicinity to the summer house He listened attentively Fragments of angry sentences such as Without my permission At her time of life Miserable old ooman like me Might have waited till I was dead and so forth reached his ears and then he heard the heels of the fat boy s boots crunching the gravel as he retired and left the old lady alone It was a remarkable coincidence perhaps but it was nevertheless a fact that mister Jingle within five minutes of his arrival at Manor Farm on the preceding night had inwardly resolved to lay siege to the heart of the spinster aunt without delay He had observation enough to see that his off hand manner was by no means disagreeable to the fair object of his attack and he had more than a strong suspicion that she possessed that most desirable of all requisites a small independence The imperative necessity of ousting his rival by some means or other flashed quickly upon him and he immediately resolved to adopt certain proceedings tending to that end and object without a moment s delay Fielding tells us that man is fire and woman tow and the Prince of Darkness sets a light to em mister Jingle knew that young men to spinster aunts are as lighted gas to gunpowder and he determined to essay the effect of an explosion without loss of time Full of reflections upon this important decision he crept from his place of concealment and under cover of the shrubs before mentioned approached the house Fortune seemed determined to favour his design mister Tupman and the rest of the gentlemen left the garden by the side gate just as he obtained a view of it and the young ladies he knew had walked out alone soon after breakfast The coast was clear The breakfast parlour door was partially open He peeped in The spinster aunt was knitting He coughed she looked up and smiled Hesitation formed no part of mister Alfred Jingle s character He laid his finger on his lips mysteriously walked in and closed the door Miss Wardle said mister Jingle with affected earnestness forgive intrusion short acquaintance no time for ceremony all discovered Sir said the spinster aunt rather astonished by the unexpected apparition and somewhat doubtful of mister Jingle s sanity Hush said mister Jingle in a stage whisper Large boy dumpling face round eyes rascal Here he shook his head expressively and the spinster aunt trembled with agitation I presume you allude to Joseph Sir said the lady making an effort to appear composed Yes ma am damn that Joe treacherous dog Joe told the old lady old lady furious wild raving arbour Tupman kissing and hugging all that sort of thing eh ma am eh mister Jingle said the spinster aunt if you come here Sir to insult me Not at all by no means replied the unabashed mister Jingle overheard the tale came to warn you of your danger tender my services prevent the hubbub Never mind think it an insult leave the room and he turned as if to carry the threat into execution What SHALL I do said the poor spinster bursting into tears My brother will be furious Of course he will said mister Jingle pausing outrageous Oh mister Jingle what CAN I say exclaimed the spinster aunt in another flood of despair Say he dreamt it replied mister Jingle coolly A ray of comfort darted across the mind of the spinster aunt at this suggestion mister Jingle perceived it and followed up his advantage Pooh pooh nothing more easy blackguard boy lovely woman fat boy horsewhipped you believed end of the matter all comfortable Whether the probability of escaping from the consequences of this ill timed discovery was delightful to the spinster s feelings or whether the hearing herself described as a lovely woman softened the asperity of her grief we know not She blushed slightly and cast a grateful look on mister Jingle That insinuating gentleman sighed deeply fixed his eyes on the spinster aunt s face for a couple of minutes started melodramatically and suddenly withdrew them You seem unhappy mister Jingle said the lady in a plaintive voice May I show my gratitude for your kind interference by inquiring into the cause with a view if possible to its removal Ha exclaimed mister Jingle with another start removal remove my unhappiness and your love bestowed upon a man who is insensible to the blessing who even now contemplates a design upon the affections of the niece of the creature who but no he is my friend I will not expose his vices Miss Wardle farewell At the conclusion of this address the most consecutive he was ever known to utter mister Jingle applied to his eyes the remnant of a handkerchief before noticed and turned towards the door Stay mister Jingle said the spinster aunt emphatically You have made an allusion to mister Tupman explain it Never exclaimed Jingle with a professional i e theatrical air Never and by way of showing that he had no desire to be questioned further he drew a chair close to that of the spinster aunt and sat down mister Jingle said the aunt I entreat I implore you if there is any dreadful mystery connected with mister Tupman reveal it Can I said mister Jingle fixing his eyes on the aunt s face can I see lovely creature sacrificed at the shrine heartless avarice He appeared to be struggling with various conflicting emotions for a few seconds and then said in a low voice Tupman only wants your money The wretch exclaimed the spinster with energetic indignation mister Jingle s doubts were resolved She HAD money More than that said Jingle loves another Another ejaculated the spinster Who Short girl black eyes niece Emily There was a pause Now if there was one individual in the whole world of whom the spinster aunt entertained a mortal and deep rooted jealousy it was this identical niece The colour rushed over her face and neck and she tossed her head in silence with an air of ineffable contempt At last biting her thin lips and bridling up she said It can t be I won t believe it Watch em said Jingle I will said the aunt Watch his looks I will His whispers I will He ll sit next her at table Let him He ll flatter her Let him He ll pay her every possible attention Let him And he ll cut you Cut ME screamed the spinster aunt HE cut ME will he and she trembled with rage and disappointment You will convince yourself said Jingle I will You ll show your spirit I will You ll not have him afterwards Never You ll take somebody else Yes You shall mister Jingle fell on his knees remained thereupon for five minutes thereafter and rose the accepted lover of the spinster aunt conditionally upon mister Tupman s perjury being made clear and manifest The burden of proof lay with mister Alfred Jingle and he produced his evidence that very day at dinner The spinster aunt could hardly believe her eyes mister Tracy Tupman was established at Emily s side ogling whispering and smiling in opposition to mister Snodgrass Not a word not a look not a glance did he bestow upon his heart s pride of the evening before Damn that boy thought old mister Wardle to himself He had heard the story from his mother Damn that boy He must have been asleep It s all imagination Traitor thought the spinster aunt Dear mister Jingle was not deceiving me Ugh how I hate the wretch The following conversation may serve to explain to our readers this apparently unaccountable alteration of deportment on the part of mister Tracy Tupman The time was evening the scene the garden There were two figures walking in a side path one was rather short and stout the other tall and slim They were mister Tupman and mister Jingle The stout figure commenced the dialogue How did I do it he inquired Splendid capital couldn t act better myself you must repeat the part to morrow every evening till further notice Does Rachael still wish it Of course she don t like it but must be done avert suspicion afraid of her brother says there s no help for it only a few days more when old folks blinded crown your happiness Any message Love best love kindest regards unalterable affection Can I say anything for you My dear fellow replied the unsuspicious mister Tupman fervently grasping his friend s hand carry my best love say how hard I find it to dissemble say anything that s kind but add how sensible I am of the necessity of the suggestion she made to me through you this morning Say I applaud her wisdom and admire her discretion I will Anything more Nothing only add how ardently I long for the time when I may call her mine and all dissimulation may be unnecessary Certainly certainly Anything more Oh my friend said poor mister Tupman again grasping the hand of his companion receive my warmest thanks for your disinterested kindness and forgive me if I have ever even in thought done you the injustice of supposing that you could stand in my way My dear friend can I ever repay you Don t talk of it replied mister Jingle He stopped short as if suddenly recollecting something and said By the bye can t spare ten pounds can you very particular purpose pay you in three days I dare say I can replied mister Tupman in the fulness of his heart Three days you say Only three days all over then no more difficulties mister Tupman counted the money into his companion s hand and he dropped it piece by piece into his pocket as they walked towards the house Be careful said mister Jingle not a look Not a wink said mister Tupman Not a syllable Not a whisper All your attentions to the niece rather rude than otherwise to the aunt only way of deceiving the old ones I ll take care said mister Tupman aloud And I LL take care said mister Jingle internally and they entered the house The scene of that afternoon was repeated that evening and on the three afternoons and evenings next ensuing On the fourth the host was in high spirits for he had satisfied himself that there was no ground for the charge against mister Tupman So was mister Tupman for mister Jingle had told him that his affair would soon be brought to a crisis So was mister Pickwick for he was seldom otherwise So was not mister Snodgrass for he had grown jealous of mister Tupman So was the old lady for she had been winning at whist So were mister Jingle and Miss Wardle for reasons of sufficient importance in this eventful history to be narrated in another chapter CHAPTER IX A DISCOVERY AND A CHASE The supper was ready laid the chairs were drawn round the table bottles jugs and glasses were arranged upon the sideboard and everything betokened the approach of the most convivial period in the whole four and twenty hours Where s Rachael said mister Wardle Ay and Jingle added mister Pickwick Dear me said the host I wonder I haven t missed him before Why I don t think I ve heard his voice for two hours at least Emily my dear ring the bell The bell was rung and the fat boy appeared Where s Miss Rachael He couldn t say Where s mister Jingle then He didn t know Everybody looked surprised It was late past eleven o clock mister Tupman laughed in his sleeve They were loitering somewhere talking about him Ha ha capital notion that funny Never mind said Wardle after a short pause They ll turn up presently I dare say I never wait supper for anybody Excellent rule that said mister Pickwick admirable Pray sit down said the host Certainly said mister Pickwick and down they sat There was a gigantic round of cold beef on the table and mister Pickwick was supplied with a plentiful portion of it He had raised his fork to his lips and was on the very point of opening his mouth for the reception of a piece of beef when the hum of many voices suddenly arose in the kitchen He paused and laid down his fork mister Wardle paused too and insensibly released his hold of the carving knife which remained inserted in the beef He looked at mister Pickwick mister Pickwick looked at him Heavy footsteps were heard in the passage the parlour door was suddenly burst open and the man who had cleaned mister Pickwick s boots on his first arrival rushed into the room followed by the fat boy and all the domestics What the devil s the meaning of this exclaimed the host The kitchen chimney ain t a fire is it Emma inquired the old lady Lor grandma No screamed both the young ladies What s the matter roared the master of the house The man gasped for breath and faintly ejaculated They ha gone mas r gone right clean off Sir At this juncture mister Tupman was observed to lay down his knife and fork and to turn very pale Who s gone said mister Wardle fiercely Mus r Jingle and Miss Rachael in a po chay from Blue Lion Muggleton I was there but I couldn t stop em so I run off to tell ee I paid his expenses said mister Tupman jumping up frantically He s got ten pounds of mine stop him he s swindled me I won t bear it I ll have justice Pickwick I won t stand it and with sundry incoherent exclamations of the like nature the unhappy gentleman spun round and round the apartment in a transport of frenzy Lord preserve us ejaculated mister Pickwick eyeing the extraordinary gestures of his friend with terrified surprise He s gone mad What shall we do Do said the stout old host who regarded only the last words of the sentence Put the horse in the gig I ll get a chaise at the Lion and follow em instantly Where he exclaimed as the man ran out to execute the commission where s that villain Joe Here I am but I hain t a willin replied a voice It was the fat boy s Let me get at him Pickwick cried Wardle as he rushed at the ill starred youth He was bribed by that scoundrel Jingle to put me on a wrong scent by telling a cock and bull story of my sister and your friend Tupman Here mister Tupman sank into a chair Let me get at him Don t let him screamed all the women above whose exclamations the blubbering of the fat boy was distinctly audible I won t be held cried the old man mister Winkle take your hands off mister Pickwick let me go sir It was a beautiful sight in that moment of turmoil and confusion to behold the placid and philosophical expression of mister Pickwick s face albeit somewhat flushed with exertion as he stood with his arms firmly clasped round the extensive waist of their corpulent host thus restraining the impetuosity of his passion while the fat boy was scratched and pulled and pushed from the room by all the females congregated therein He had no sooner released his hold than the man entered to announce that the gig was ready Don t let him go alone screamed the females He ll kill somebody I ll go with him said mister Pickwick You re a good fellow Pickwick said the host grasping his hand Emma give mister Pickwick a shawl to tie round his neck make haste Look after your grandmother girls she has fainted away Now then are you ready mister Pickwick s mouth and chin having been hastily enveloped in a large shawl his hat having been put on his head and his greatcoat thrown over his arm he replied in the affirmative They jumped into the gig Give her her head Tom cried the host and away they went down the narrow lanes jolting in and out of the cart ruts and bumping up against the hedges on either side as if they would go to pieces every moment How much are they ahead shouted Wardle as they drove up to the door of the Blue Lion round which a little crowd had collected late as it was Not above three quarters of an hour was everybody s reply Chaise and four directly out with em Put up the gig afterwards Now boys cried the landlord chaise and four out make haste look alive there Away ran the hostlers and the boys The lanterns glimmered as the men ran to and fro the horses hoofs clattered on the uneven paving of the yard the chaise rumbled as it was drawn out of the coach house and all was noise and bustle Now then is that chaise coming out to night cried Wardle Coming down the yard now Sir replied the hostler Out came the chaise in went the horses on sprang the boys in got the travellers Mind the seven mile stage in less than half an hour shouted Wardle Off with you The boys applied whip and spur the waiters shouted the hostlers cheered and away they went fast and furiously Pretty situation thought mister Pickwick when he had had a moment s time for reflection Pretty situation for the general chairman of the Pickwick Club Damp chaise strange horses fifteen miles an hour and twelve o clock at night For the first three or four miles not a word was spoken by either of the gentlemen each being too much immersed in his own reflections to address any observations to his companion When they had gone over that much ground however and the horses getting thoroughly warmed began to do their work in really good style mister Pickwick became too much exhilarated with the rapidity of the motion to remain any longer perfectly mute We re sure to catch them I think said he Hope so replied his companion Fine night said mister Pickwick looking up at the moon which was shining brightly So much the worse returned Wardle for they ll have had all the advantage of the moonlight to get the start of us and we shall lose it It will have gone down in another hour It will be rather unpleasant going at this rate in the dark won t it inquired mister Pickwick I dare say it will replied his friend dryly mister Pickwick s temporary excitement began to sober down a little as he reflected upon the inconveniences and dangers of the expedition in which he had so thoughtlessly embarked He was roused by a loud shouting of the post boy on the leader Yo yo yo yo yoe went the first boy Yo yo yo yoe went the second Yo yo yo yoe chimed in old Wardle himself most lustily with his head and half his body out of the coach window Yo yo yo yoe shouted mister Pickwick taking up the burden of the cry though he had not the slightest notion of its meaning or object And amidst the yo yoing of the whole four the chaise stopped What s the matter inquired mister Pickwick There s a gate here replied old Wardle We shall hear something of the fugitives After a lapse of five minutes consumed in incessant knocking and shouting an old man in his shirt and trousers emerged from the turnpike house and opened the gate How long is it since a post chaise went through here inquired mister Wardle How long Ah Why I don t rightly know It worn t a long time ago nor it worn t a short time ago just between the two perhaps Has any chaise been by at all Oh yes there s been a Shay by How long ago my friend interposed mister Pickwick an hour Ah I dare say it might be replied the man Or two hours inquired the post boy on the wheeler Well I shouldn t wonder if it was returned the old man doubtfully Drive on boys cried the testy old gentleman don t waste any more time with that old idiot Idiot exclaimed the old man with a grin as he stood in the middle of the road with the gate half closed watching the chaise which rapidly diminished in the increasing distance No not much o that either you ve lost ten minutes here and gone away as wise as you came arter all If every man on the line as has a guinea give him earns it half as well you won t catch t other shay this side Mich lmas old short and fat And with another prolonged grin the old man closed the gate re entered his house and bolted the door after him Meanwhile the chaise proceeded without any slackening of pace towards the conclusion of the stage The moon as Wardle had foretold was rapidly on the wane large tiers of dark heavy clouds which had been gradually overspreading the sky for some time past now formed one black mass overhead and large drops of rain which pattered every now and then against the windows of the chaise seemed to warn the travellers of the rapid approach of a stormy night The wind too which was directly against them swept in furious gusts down the narrow road and howled dismally through the trees which skirted the pathway mister Pickwick drew his coat closer about him coiled himself more snugly up into the corner of the chaise and fell into a sound sleep from which he was only awakened by the stopping of the vehicle the sound of the hostler s bell and a loud cry of Horses on directly But here another delay occurred The boys were sleeping with such mysterious soundness that it took five minutes a piece to wake them The hostler had somehow or other mislaid the key of the stable and even when that was found two sleepy helpers put the wrong harness on the wrong horses and the whole process of harnessing had to be gone through afresh Had mister Pickwick been alone these multiplied obstacles would have completely put an end to the pursuit at once but old Wardle was not to be so easily daunted and he laid about him with such hearty good will cuffing this man and pushing that strapping a buckle here and taking in a link there that the chaise was ready in a much shorter time than could reasonably have been expected under so many difficulties They resumed their journey and certainly the prospect before them was by no means encouraging The stage was fifteen miles long the night was dark the wind high and the rain pouring in torrents It was impossible to make any great way against such obstacles united it was hard upon one o clock already and nearly two hours were consumed in getting to the end of the stage Here however an object presented itself which rekindled their hopes and reanimated their drooping spirits When did this chaise come in cried old Wardle leaping out of his own vehicle and pointing to one covered with wet mud which was standing in the yard Not a quarter of an hour ago sir replied the hostler to whom the question was addressed Lady and gentleman inquired Wardle almost breathless with impatience Yes sir Tall gentleman dress coat long legs thin body Yes sir Elderly lady thin face rather skinny eh Yes sir By heavens it s the couple Pickwick exclaimed the old gentleman Would have been here before said the hostler but they broke a trace Tis them said Wardle it is by Jove Chaise and four instantly We shall catch them yet before they reach the next stage A guinea a piece boys be alive there bustle about there s good fellows And with such admonitions as these the old gentleman ran up and down the yard and bustled to and fro in a state of excitement which communicated itself to mister Pickwick also and under the influence of which that gentleman got himself into complicated entanglements with harness and mixed up with horses and wheels of chaises in the most surprising manner firmly believing that by so doing he was materially forwarding the preparations for their resuming their journey Jump in jump in cried old Wardle climbing into the chaise pulling up the steps and slamming the door after him Come along Make haste And before mister Pickwick knew precisely what he was about he felt himself forced in at the other door by one pull from the old gentleman and one push from the hostler and off they were again Ah we are moving now said the old gentleman exultingly They were indeed as was sufficiently testified to mister Pickwick by his constant collision either with the hard wood work of the chaise or the body of his companion Hold up said the stout old mister Wardle as mister Pickwick dived head foremost into his capacious waistcoat I never did feel such a jolting in my life said mister Pickwick Never mind replied his companion it will soon be over Steady steady mister Pickwick planted himself into his own corner as firmly as he could and on whirled the chaise faster than ever They had travelled in this way about three miles when mister Wardle who had been looking out of the Window for two or three minutes suddenly drew in his face covered with splashes and exclaimed in breathless eagerness Here they are mister Pickwick thrust his head out of his window Yes there was a chaise and four a short distance before them dashing along at full gallop Go on go on almost shrieked the old gentleman Two guineas a piece boys don t let em gain on us keep it up keep it up The horses in the first chaise started on at their utmost speed and those in mister Wardle s galloped furiously behind them I see his head exclaimed the choleric old man damme I see his head So do I said mister Pickwick that s he mister Pickwick was not mistaken The countenance of mister Jingle completely coated with mud thrown up by the wheels was plainly discernible at the window of his chaise and the motion of his arm which was waving violently towards the postillions denoted that he was encouraging them to increased exertion The interest was intense Fields trees and hedges seemed to rush past them with the velocity of a whirlwind so rapid was the pace at which they tore along They were close by the side of the first chaise Jingle s voice could be plainly heard even above the din of the wheels urging on the boys Old mister Wardle foamed with rage and excitement He roared out scoundrels and villains by the dozen clenched his fist and shook it expressively at the object of his indignation but mister Jingle only answered with a contemptuous smile and replied to his menaces by a shout of triumph as his horses answering the increased application of whip and spur broke into a faster gallop and left the pursuers behind mister Pickwick had just drawn in his head and mister Wardle exhausted with shouting had done the same when a tremendous jolt threw them forward against the front of the vehicle There was a sudden bump a loud crash away rolled a wheel and over went the chaise After a very few seconds of bewilderment and confusion in which nothing but the plunging of horses and breaking of glass could be made out mister Pickwick felt himself violently pulled out from among the ruins of the chaise and as soon as he had gained his feet extricated his head from the skirts of his greatcoat which materially impeded the usefulness of his spectacles the full disaster of the case met his view Old mister Wardle without a hat and his clothes torn in several places stood by his side and the fragments of the chaise lay scattered at their feet The post boys who had succeeded in cutting the traces were standing disfigured with mud and disordered by hard riding by the horses heads About a hundred yards in advance was the other chaise which had pulled up on hearing the crash The postillions each with a broad grin convulsing his countenance were viewing the adverse party from their saddles and mister Jingle was contemplating the wreck from the coach window with evident satisfaction The day was just breaking and the whole scene was rendered perfectly visible by the grey light of the morning Hollo shouted the shameless Jingle anybody damaged elderly gentlemen no light weights dangerous work very You re a rascal roared Wardle Ha ha replied Jingle and then he added with a knowing wink and a jerk of the thumb towards the interior of the chaise I say she s very well desires her compliments begs you won t trouble yourself love to TUPPY won t you get up behind drive on boys The postillions resumed their proper attitudes and away rattled the chaise mister Jingle fluttering in derision a white handkerchief from the coach window Nothing in the whole adventure not even the upset had disturbed the calm and equable current of mister Pickwick s temper The villainy however which could first borrow money of his faithful follower and then abbreviate his name to Tuppy was more than he could patiently bear He drew his breath hard and coloured up to the very tips of his spectacles as he said slowly and emphatically If ever I meet that man again I ll Yes yes interrupted Wardle that s all very well but while we stand talking here they ll get their licence and be married in London mister Pickwick paused bottled up his vengeance and corked it down How far is it to the next stage inquired mister Wardle of one of the boys Six mile ain t it Tom Rayther better Rayther better nor six mile Sir Can t be helped said Wardle we must walk it Pickwick No help for it replied that truly great man So sending forward one of the boys on horseback to procure a fresh chaise and horses and leaving the other behind to take care of the broken one mister Pickwick and mister Wardle set manfully forward on the walk first tying their shawls round their necks and slouching down their hats to escape as much as possible from the deluge of rain which after a slight cessation had again begun to pour heavily down CHAPTER X CLEARING UP ALL DOUBTS IF ANY EXISTED OF THE DISINTERESTEDNESS OF mister A JINGLE S CHARACTER There are in London several old inns once the headquarters of celebrated coaches in the days when coaches performed their journeys in a graver and more solemn manner than they do in these times but which have now degenerated into little more than the abiding and booking places of country wagons The reader would look in vain for any of these ancient hostelries among the Golden Crosses and Bull and Mouths which rear their stately fronts in the improved streets of London If he would light upon any of these old places he must direct his steps to the obscurer quarters of the town and there in some secluded nooks he will find several still standing with a kind of gloomy sturdiness amidst the modern innovations which surround them In the Borough especially there still remain some half dozen old inns which have preserved their external features unchanged and which have escaped alike the rage for public improvement and the encroachments of private speculation Great rambling queer old places they are with galleries and passages and staircases wide enough and antiquated enough to furnish materials for a hundred ghost stories supposing we should ever be reduced to the lamentable necessity of inventing any and that the world should exist long enough to exhaust the innumerable veracious legends connected with old London Bridge and its adjacent neighbourhood on the Surrey side It was in the yard of one of these inns of no less celebrated a one than the White Hart that a man was busily employed in brushing the dirt off a pair of boots early on the morning succeeding the events narrated in the last chapter He was habited in a coarse striped waistcoat with black calico sleeves and blue glass buttons drab breeches and leggings A bright red handkerchief was wound in a very loose and unstudied style round his neck and an old white hat was carelessly thrown on one side of his head There were two rows of boots before him one cleaned and the other dirty and at every addition he made to the clean row he paused from his work and contemplated its results with evident satisfaction The yard presented none of that bustle and activity which are the usual characteristics of a large coach inn Three or four lumbering wagons each with a pile of goods beneath its ample canopy about the height of the second floor window of an ordinary house were stowed away beneath a lofty roof which extended over one end of the yard and another which was probably to commence its journey that morning was drawn out into the open space A double tier of bedroom galleries with old Clumsy balustrades ran round two sides of the straggling area and a double row of bells to correspond sheltered from the weather by a little sloping roof hung over the door leading to the bar and coffee room Two or three gigs and chaise carts were wheeled up under different little sheds and pent houses and the occasional heavy tread of a cart horse or rattling of a chain at the farther end of the yard announced to anybody who cared about the matter that the stable lay in that direction When we add that a few boys in smock frocks were lying asleep on heavy packages wool packs and other articles that were scattered about on heaps of straw we have described as fully as need be the general appearance of the yard of the White Hart Inn High Street Borough on the particular morning in question A loud ringing of one of the bells was followed by the appearance of a smart chambermaid in the upper sleeping gallery who after tapping at one of the doors and receiving a request from within called over the balustrades Sam Hollo replied the man with the white hat Number twenty two wants his boots Ask number twenty two vether he ll have em now or vait till he gets em was the reply Come don t be a fool Sam said the girl coaxingly the gentleman wants his boots directly Well you ARE a nice young ooman for a musical party you are said the boot cleaner Look at these here boots eleven pair o boots and one shoe as belongs to number six with the wooden leg The eleven boots is to be called at half past eight and the shoe at nine Who s number twenty two that s to put all the others out No no reg lar rotation as Jack Ketch said ven he tied the men up Sorry to keep you a waitin Sir but I ll attend to you directly Saying which the man in the white hat set to work upon a top boot with increased assiduity There was another loud ring and the bustling old landlady of the White Hart made her appearance in the opposite gallery Sam cried the landlady where s that lazy idle why Sam oh there you are why don t you answer Vouldn t be general teel to answer till you d done talking replied Sam gruffly Here clean these shoes for number seventeen directly and take em to private sitting room number five first floor The landlady flung a pair of lady s shoes into the yard and bustled away Number five said Sam as he picked up the shoes and taking a piece of chalk from his pocket made a memorandum of their destination on the soles Lady s shoes and private sittin room I suppose she didn t come in the vagin She came in early this morning cried the girl who was still leaning over the railing of the gallery with a gentleman in a hackney coach and it s him as wants his boots and you d better do em that s all about it Vy didn t you say so before said Sam with great indignation singling out the boots in question from the heap before him For all I know d he was one o the regular threepennies Private room and a lady too If he s anything of a general l m n he s vurth a shillin a day let alone the arrands Stimulated by this inspiring reflection mister Samuel brushed away with such hearty good will that in a few minutes the boots and shoes with a polish which would have struck envy to the soul of the amiable mister Warren for they used Day Martin at the White Hart had arrived at the door of number five Come in said a man s voice in reply to Sam s rap at the door Sam made his best bow and stepped into the presence of a lady and gentleman seated at breakfast Having officiously deposited the gentleman s boots right and left at his feet and the lady s shoes right and left at hers he backed towards the door Boots said the gentleman Sir said Sam closing the door and keeping his hand on the knob of the lock Do you know what s a name Doctors Commons Yes Sir Where is it Paul s Churchyard Sir low archway on the carriage side bookseller s at one corner hot el on the other and two porters in the middle as touts for licences Touts for licences said the gentleman Touts

Blessed if I know says he Not know says the lawyer No more nor you do says my father can t I put that in arterwards Impossible says the lawyer Wery well says my father after he d thought a moment put

have me I know The licence was made out and she DID have him and what s more she s got him now and I never had any of the four hundred pound worse luck Beg your pardon sir said Sam when he had concluded but wen I gets on this here grievance I runs on like a new barrow with the wheel greased Having said which and having paused for an instant to see whether he was wanted for anything more Sam left the room Half past nine just the time off at once said the gentleman whom we need hardly introduce as mister Jingle Time for what said the spinster aunt coquettishly Licence dearest of angels give notice at the church call you mine to morrow said mister Jingle and he squeezed the spinster aunt s hand The licence said Rachael blushing The licence repeated mister Jingle In hurry post haste for a licence In hurry ding dong I come back How you run on said Rachael Run on nothing to the hours days weeks months years when we re united run on they ll fly on bolt mizzle steam engine thousand horse power nothing to it Can t can t we be married before to morrow morning inquired Rachael Impossible can t be notice at the church leave the licence to day ceremony come off to morrow I am so terrified lest my brother should discover us said Rachael Discover nonsense too much shaken by the break down besides extreme caution gave up the post chaise walked on took a hackney coach came to the Borough last place in the world that he d look in ha ha capital notion that very Don t be long said the spinster affectionately as mister Jingle stuck the pinched up hat on his head Long away from you Cruel charmer and mister Jingle skipped playfully up to the spinster aunt imprinted a chaste kiss upon her lips and danced out of the room Dear man said the spinster as the door closed after him Rum old girl said mister Jingle as he walked down the passage It is painful to reflect upon the perfidy of our species and we will not therefore pursue the thread of mister Jingle s meditations as he wended his way to Doctors Commons It will be sufficient for our purpose to relate that escaping the snares of the dragons in white aprons who guard the entrance to that enchanted region he reached the vicar general s office in safety and having procured a highly flattering address on parchment from the Archbishop of Canterbury to his trusty and well beloved Alfred Jingle and Rachael Wardle greeting he carefully deposited the mystic document in his pocket and retraced his steps in triumph to the Borough He was yet on his way to the White Hart when two plump gentleman and one thin one entered the yard and looked round in search of some authorised person of whom they could make a few inquiries mister Samuel Weller happened to be at that moment engaged in burnishing a pair of painted tops the personal property of a farmer who was refreshing himself with a slight lunch of two or three pounds of cold beef and a pot or two of porter after the fatigues of the Borough market and to him the thin gentleman straightway advanced My friend said the thin gentleman You re one o the adwice gratis order thought Sam or you wouldn t be so wery fond o me all at once But he only said Well Sir My friend said the thin gentleman with a conciliatory hem have you got many people stopping here now Pretty busy Eh Sam stole a look at the inquirer He was a little high dried man with a dark squeezed up face and small restless black eyes that kept winking and twinkling on each side of his little inquisitive nose as if they were playing a perpetual game of peep bo with that feature He was dressed all in black with boots as shiny as his eyes a low white neckcloth and a clean shirt with a frill to it A gold watch chain and seals depended from his fob He carried his black kid gloves IN his hands and not ON them and as he spoke thrust his wrists beneath his coat tails with the air of a man who was in the habit of propounding some regular posers Pretty busy eh said the little man Oh wery well Sir replied Sam we shan t be bankrupts and we shan t make our fort ns We eats our biled mutton without capers and don t care for horse radish ven ve can get beef Ah said the little man you re a wag ain t you My eldest brother was troubled with that complaint said Sam it may be catching I used to sleep with him This is a curious old house of yours said the little man looking round him If you d sent word you was a coming we d ha had it repaired replied the imperturbable Sam The little man seemed rather baffled by these several repulses and a short consultation took place between him and the two plump gentlemen At its conclusion the little man took a pinch of snuff from an oblong silver box and was apparently on the point of renewing the conversation when one of the plump gentlemen who in addition to a benevolent countenance possessed a pair of spectacles and a pair of black gaiters interfered The fact of the matter is said the benevolent gentleman that my friend here pointing to the other plump gentleman will give you half a guinea if you ll answer one or two Now my dear sir my dear Sir said the little man pray allow me my dear Sir the very first principle to be observed in these cases is this if you place the matter in the hands of a professional man you must in no way interfere in the progress of the business you must repose implicit confidence in him Really mister He turned to the other plump gentleman and said I forget your friend s name Pickwick said mister Wardle for it was no other than that jolly personage Ah Pickwick really mister Pickwick my dear Sir excuse me I shall be happy to receive any private suggestions of yours as AMICUS CURIAE but you must see the impropriety of your interfering with my conduct in this case with such an AD CAPTANDUM argument as the offer of half a guinea Really my dear Sir really and the little man took an argumentative pinch of snuff and looked very profound My only wish Sir said mister Pickwick was to bring this very unpleasant matter to as speedy a close as possible Quite right quite right said the little man With which view continued mister Pickwick I made use of the argument which my experience of men has taught me is the most likely to succeed in any case Ay ay said the little man very good very good indeed but you should have suggested it to me My dear sir I m quite certain you cannot be ignorant of the extent of confidence which must be placed in professional men If any authority can be necessary on such a point my dear sir let me refer you to the well known case in Barnwell and Never mind George Barnwell interrupted Sam who had remained a wondering listener during this short colloquy everybody knows what sort of a case his was tho it s always been my opinion mind you that the young ooman deserved scragging a precious sight more than he did Hows ever that s neither here nor there You want me to accept of half a guinea Wery well I m agreeable I can t say no fairer than that can I sir mister Pickwick smiled Then the next question is what the devil do you want with me as the man said wen he see the ghost We want to know said mister Wardle Now my dear sir my dear sir interposed the busy little man mister Wardle shrugged his shoulders and was silent We want to know said the little man solemnly and we ask the question of you in order that we may not awaken apprehensions inside we want to know who you ve got in this house at present Who there is in the house said Sam in whose mind the inmates were always represented by that particular article of their costume which came under his immediate superintendence There s a vooden leg in number six there s a pair of Hessians in thirteen there s two pair of halves in the commercial there s these here painted tops in the snuggery inside the bar and five more tops in the coffee room Nothing more said the little man Stop a bit replied Sam suddenly recollecting himself Yes there s a pair of Vellingtons a good deal worn and a pair o lady s shoes in number five What sort of shoes hastily inquired Wardle who together with mister Pickwick had been lost in bewilderment at the singular catalogue of visitors Country make replied Sam Any maker s name Brown Where of Muggleton It is them exclaimed Wardle By heavens we ve found them Hush said Sam The Vellingtons has gone to Doctors Commons No said the little man Yes for a licence We re in time exclaimed Wardle Show us the room not a moment is to be lost Pray my dear sir pray said the little man caution caution He drew from his pocket a red silk purse and looked very hard at Sam as he drew out a sovereign Sam grinned expressively Show us into the room at once without announcing us said the little man and it s yours Sam threw the painted tops into a corner and led the way through a dark passage and up a wide staircase He paused at the end of a second passage and held out his hand Here it is whispered the attorney as he deposited the money on the hand of their guide The man stepped forward for a few paces followed by the two friends and their legal adviser He stopped at a door Is this the room murmured the little gentleman Sam nodded assent Old Wardle opened the door and the whole three walked into the room just as mister Jingle who had that moment returned had produced the licence to the spinster aunt The spinster uttered a loud shriek and throwing herself into a chair covered her face with her hands mister Jingle crumpled up the licence and thrust it into his coat pocket The unwelcome visitors advanced into the middle of the room You you are a nice rascal arn t you exclaimed Wardle breathless with passion My dear Sir my dear sir said the little man laying his hat on the table pray consider pray Defamation of character action for damages Calm yourself my dear sir pray How dare you drag my sister from my house said the old man Ay ay very good said the little gentleman you may ask that How dare you sir eh sir Who the devil are you inquired mister Jingle in so fierce a tone that the little gentleman involuntarily fell back a step or two Who is he you scoundrel interposed Wardle He s my lawyer mister Perker of Gray s Inn Perker I ll have this fellow prosecuted indicted I ll I ll I ll ruin him And you continued mister Wardle turning abruptly round to his sister you Rachael at a time of life when you ought to know better what do you mean by running away with a vagabond disgracing your family and making yourself miserable Get on your bonnet and come back Call a hackney coach there directly and bring this lady s bill d ye hear d ye hear Cert nly Sir replied Sam who had answered Wardle s violent ringing of the bell with a degree of celerity which must have appeared marvellous to anybody who didn t know that his eye had been applied to the outside of the keyhole during the whole interview Get on your bonnet repeated Wardle Do nothing of the kind said Jingle Leave the room Sir no business here lady s free to act as she pleases more than one and twenty More than one and twenty ejaculated Wardle contemptuously More than one and forty I ain t said the spinster aunt her indignation getting the better of her determination to faint You are replied Wardle you re fifty if you re an hour Here the spinster aunt uttered a loud shriek and became senseless A glass of water said the humane mister Pickwick summoning the landlady A glass of water said the passionate Wardle Bring a bucket and throw it all over her it ll do her good and she richly deserves it Ugh you brute ejaculated the kind hearted landlady Poor dear And with sundry ejaculations of Come now there s a dear drink a little of this it ll do you good don t give way so there s a love et cetera et cetera the landlady assisted by a chambermaid proceeded to vinegar the forehead beat the hands titillate the nose and unlace the stays of the spinster aunt and to administer such other restoratives as are usually applied by compassionate females to ladies who are endeavouring to ferment themselves into hysterics Coach is ready Sir said Sam appearing at the door Come along cried Wardle I ll carry her downstairs At this proposition the hysterics came on with redoubled violence The landlady was about to enter a very violent protest against this proceeding and had already given vent to an indignant inquiry whether mister Wardle considered himself a lord of the creation when mister Jingle interposed Boots said he get me an officer Stay stay said little mister Perker Consider Sir consider I ll not consider replied Jingle She s her own mistress see who dares to take her away unless she wishes it I WON T be taken away murmured the spinster aunt I DON T wish it Here there was a frightful relapse My dear Sir said the little man in a low tone taking mister Wardle and mister Pickwick apart my dear Sir we re in a very awkward situation It s a distressing case very I never knew one more so but really my dear sir really we have no power to control this lady s actions I warned you before we came my dear sir that there was nothing to look to but a compromise There was a short pause What kind of compromise would you recommend inquired mister Pickwick Why my dear Sir our friend s in an unpleasant position very much so We must be content to suffer some pecuniary loss I ll suffer any rather than submit to this disgrace and let her fool as she is be made miserable for life said Wardle I rather think it can be done said the bustling little man mister Jingle will you step with us into the next room for a moment mister Jingle assented and the quartette walked into an empty apartment Now sir said the little man as he carefully closed the door is there no way of accommodating this matter step this way sir for a moment into this window Sir where we can be alone there sir there pray sit down sir Now my dear Sir between you and I we know very well my dear Sir that you have run off with this lady for the sake of her money Don t frown Sir don t frown I say between you and I WE know it We are both men of the world and WE know very well that our friends here are not eh mister Jingle s face gradually relaxed and something distantly resembling a wink quivered for an instant in his left eye Very good very good said the little man observing the impression he had made Now the fact is that beyond a few hundreds the lady has little or nothing till the death of her mother fine old lady my dear Sir OLD said mister Jingle briefly but emphatically Why yes said the attorney with a slight cough You are right my dear Sir she is rather old She comes of an old family though my dear Sir old in every sense of the word The founder of that family came into Kent when Julius Caesar invaded Britain only one member of it since who hasn t lived to eighty five and he was beheaded by one of the Henrys The old lady is not seventy three now my dear Sir The little man paused and took a pinch of snuff Well cried mister Jingle Well my dear sir you don t take snuff ah so much the better expensive habit well my dear Sir you re a fine young man man of the world able to push your fortune if you had capital eh Well said mister Jingle again Do you comprehend me Not quite Don t you think now my dear Sir I put it to you don t you think that fifty pounds and liberty would be better than Miss Wardle and expectation Won t do not half enough said mister Jingle rising Nay nay my dear Sir remonstrated the little attorney seizing him by the button Good round sum a man like you could treble it in no time great deal to be done with fifty pounds my dear Sir More to be done with a hundred and fifty replied mister Jingle coolly Well my dear Sir we won t waste time in splitting straws resumed the little man say say seventy Won t do said mister Jingle Don t go away my dear sir pray don t hurry said the little man Eighty come I ll write you a cheque at once Won t do said mister Jingle Well my dear Sir well said the little man still detaining him just tell me what WILL do Expensive affair said mister Jingle Money out of pocket posting nine pounds licence three that s twelve compensation a hundred hundred and twelve breach of honour and loss of the lady Yes my dear Sir yes said the little man with a knowing look never mind the last two items That s a hundred and twelve say a hundred come And twenty said mister Jingle Come come I ll write you a cheque said the little man and down he sat at the table for that purpose I ll make it payable the day after to morrow said the little man with a look towards mister Wardle and we can get the lady away meanwhile mister Wardle sullenly nodded assent A hundred said the little man And twenty said mister Jingle My dear Sir remonstrated the little man Give it him interposed mister Wardle and let him go The cheque was written by the little gentleman and pocketed by mister Jingle Now leave this house instantly said Wardle starting up My dear Sir urged the little man And mind said mister Wardle that nothing should have induced me to make this compromise not even a regard for my family if I had not known that the moment you got any money in that pocket of yours you d go to the devil faster if possible than you would without it My dear sir urged the little man again Be quiet Perker resumed Wardle Leave the room Sir Off directly said the unabashed Jingle Bye bye Pickwick If any dispassionate spectator could have beheld the countenance of the illustrious man whose name forms the leading feature of the title of this work during the latter part of this conversation he would have been almost induced to wonder that the indignant fire which flashed from his eyes did not melt the glasses of his spectacles so majestic was his wrath His nostrils dilated and his fists clenched involuntarily as he heard himself addressed by the villain But he restrained himself again he did not pulverise him Here continued the hardened traitor tossing the licence at mister Pickwick s feet get the name altered take home the lady do for Tuppy mister Pickwick was a philosopher but philosophers are only men in armour after all The shaft had reached him penetrated through his philosophical harness to his very heart In the frenzy of his rage he hurled the inkstand madly forward and followed it up himself But mister Jingle had disappeared and he found himself caught in the arms of Sam Hollo said that eccentric functionary furniter s cheap where you come from Sir Self acting ink that ere it s wrote your mark upon the wall old general l m n Hold still Sir wot s the use o runnin arter a man as has made his lucky and got to t other end of the Borough by this time mister Pickwick s mind like those of all truly great men was open to conviction He was a quick and powerful reasoner and a moment s reflection sufficed to remind him of the impotency of his rage It subsided as quickly as it had been roused He panted for breath and looked benignantly round upon his friends Shall we tell the lamentations that ensued when Miss Wardle found herself deserted by the faithless Jingle Shall we extract mister Pickwick s masterly description of that heartrending scene His note book blotted with the tears of sympathising humanity lies open before us one word and it is in the printer s hands But no we will be resolute We will not wring the public bosom with the delineation of such suffering Slowly and sadly did the two friends and the deserted lady return next day in the Muggleton heavy coach Dimly and darkly had the sombre shadows of a summer s night fallen upon all around when they again reached Dingley Dell and stood within the entrance to Manor Farm CHAPTER XI INVOLVING ANOTHER JOURNEY AND AN ANTIQUARIAN DISCOVERY RECORDING mister PICKWICK S DETERMINATION TO BE PRESENT AT AN ELECTION AND CONTAINING A MANUSCRIPT OF THE OLD CLERGYMAN S A night of quiet and repose in the profound silence of Dingley Dell and an hour s breathing of its fresh and fragrant air on the ensuing morning completely recovered mister Pickwick from the effects of his late fatigue of body and anxiety of mind That illustrious man had been separated from his friends and fol lowers for two whole days and it was with a degree of pleasure and delight which no common imagination can adequately conceive that he stepped forward to greet mister Winkle and mister Snodgrass as he encountered those gentlemen on his return from his early walk The pleasure was mutual for who could ever gaze on mister Pickwick s beaming face without experiencing the sensation But still a cloud seemed to hang over his companions which that great man could not but be sensible of and was wholly at a loss to account for There was a mysterious air about them both as unusual as it was alarming And how said mister Pickwick when he had grasped his followers by the hand and exchanged warm salutations of welcome how is Tupman mister Winkle to whom the question was more peculiarly addressed made no reply He turned away his head and appeared absorbed in melancholy reflection Snodgrass said mister Pickwick earnestly how is our friend he is not ill No replied mister Snodgrass and a tear trembled on his sentimental eyelid like a rain drop on a window frame no he is not ill mister Pickwick stopped and gazed on each of his friends in turn Winkle Snodgrass said mister Pickwick what does this mean Where is our friend What has happened Speak I conjure I entreat nay I command you speak There was a solemnity a dignity in mister Pickwick s manner not to be withstood He is gone said mister Snodgrass Gone exclaimed mister Pickwick Gone Gone repeated mister Snodgrass Where ejaculated mister Pickwick We can only guess from that communication replied mister Snodgrass taking a letter from his pocket and placing it in his friend s hand Yesterday morning when a letter was received from mister Wardle stating that you would be home with his sister at night the melancholy which had hung over our friend during the whole of the previous day was observed to increase He shortly afterwards disappeared he was missing during the whole day and in the evening this letter was brought by the hostler from the Crown at Muggleton It had been left in his charge in the morning with a strict injunction that it should not be delivered until night mister Pickwick opened the epistle It was in his friend s hand writing and these were its contents MY DEAR PICKWICK YOU my dear friend are placed far beyond the reach of many mortal frailties and weaknesses which ordinary people cannot overcome You do not know what it is at one blow to be deserted by a lovely and fascinating creature and to fall a victim to the artifices of a villain who had the grin of cunning beneath the mask of friendship I hope you never may Any letter addressed to me at the Leather Bottle Cobham Kent will be forwarded supposing I still exist I hasten from the sight of that world which has become odious to me Should I hasten from it altogether pity forgive me Life my dear Pickwick has become insupportable to me The spirit which burns within us is a porter s knot on which to rest the heavy load of worldly cares and troubles and when that spirit fails us the burden is too heavy to be borne We sink beneath it You may tell Rachael Ah that name TRACY TupmAN We must leave this place directly said mister Pickwick as he refolded the note It would not have been decent for us to remain here under any circumstances after what has happened and now we are bound to follow in search of our friend And so saying he led the way to the house His intention was rapidly communicated The entreaties to remain were pressing but mister Pickwick was inflexible Business he said required his immediate attendance The old clergyman was present You are not really going said he taking mister Pickwick aside mister Pickwick reiterated his former determination Then here said the old gentleman is a little manuscript which I had hoped to have the pleasure of reading to you myself I found it on the death of a friend of mine a medical man engaged in our county lunatic asylum among a variety of papers which I had the option of destroying or preserving as I thought proper I can hardly believe that the manuscript is genuine though it certainly is not in my friend s hand However whether it be the genuine production of a maniac or founded upon the ravings of some unhappy being which I think more probable read it and judge for yourself mister Pickwick received the manuscript and parted from the benevolent old gentleman with many expressions of good will and esteem It was a more difficult task to take leave of the inmates of Manor Farm from whom they had received so much hospitality and kindness mister Pickwick kissed the young ladies we were going to say as if they were his own daughters only as he might possibly have infused a little more warmth into the salutation the comparison would not be quite appropriate hugged the old lady with filial cordiality and patted the rosy cheeks of the female servants in a most patriarchal manner as he slipped into the hands of each some more substantial expression of his approval The exchange of cordialities with their fine old host and mister Trundle was even more hearty and prolonged and it was not until mister Snodgrass had been several times called for and at last emerged from a dark passage followed soon after by Emily whose bright eyes looked unusually dim that the three friends were enabled to tear themselves from their friendly entertainers Many a backward look they gave at the farm as they walked slowly away and many a kiss did mister Snodgrass waft in the air in acknowledgment of something very like a lady s handkerchief which was waved from one of the upper windows until a turn of the lane hid the old house from their sight At Muggleton they procured a conveyance to Rochester By the time they reached the last named place the violence of their grief had sufficiently abated to admit of their making a very excellent early dinner and having procured the necessary information relative to the road the three friends set forward again in the afternoon to walk to Cobham A delightful walk it was for it was a pleasant afternoon in June and their way lay through a deep and shady wood cooled by the light wind which gently rustled the thick foliage and enlivened by the songs of the birds that perched upon the boughs The ivy and the moss crept in thick clusters over the old trees and the soft green turf overspread the ground like a silken mat They emerged upon an open park with an ancient hall displaying the quaint and picturesque architecture of Elizabeth s time Long vistas of stately oaks and elm trees appeared on every side large herds of deer were cropping the fresh grass and occasionally a startled hare scoured along the ground with the speed of the shadows thrown by the light clouds which swept across a sunny landscape like a passing breath of summer If this said mister Pickwick looking about him if this were the place to which all who are troubled with our friend s complaint came I fancy their old attachment to this world would very soon return I think so too said mister Winkle And really added mister Pickwick after half an hour s walking had brought them to the village really for a misanthrope s choice this is one of the prettiest and most desirable places of residence I ever met with In this opinion also both mister Winkle and mister Snodgrass expressed their concurrence and having been directed to the Leather Bottle a clean and commodious village ale house the three travellers entered and at once inquired for a gentleman of the name of Tupman Show the gentlemen into the parlour Tom said the landlady A stout country lad opened a door at the end of the passage and the three friends entered a long low roofed room furnished with a large number of high backed leather cushioned chairs of fantastic shapes and embellished with a great variety of old portraits and roughly coloured prints of some antiquity At the upper end of the room was a table with a white cloth upon it well covered with a roast fowl bacon ale and et ceteras and at the table sat mister Tupman looking as unlike a man who had taken his leave of the world as possible On the entrance of his friends that gentleman laid down his knife and fork and with a mournful air advanced to meet them I did not expect to see you here he said as he grasped mister Pickwick s hand It s very kind Ah said mister Pickwick sitting down and wiping from his forehead the perspiration which the walk had engendered Finish your dinner and walk out with me I wish to speak to you alone mister Tupman did as he was desired and mister Pickwick having refreshed himself with a copious draught of ale waited his friend s leisure The dinner was quickly despatched and they walked out together For half an hour their forms might have been seen pacing the churchyard to and fro while mister Pickwick was engaged in combating his companion s resolution Any repetition of his arguments would be useless for what language could convey to them that energy and force which their great originator s manner communicated Whether mister Tupman was already tired of retirement or whether he was wholly unable to resist the eloquent appeal which was made to him matters not he did NOT resist it at last It mattered little to him he said where he dragged out the miserable remainder of his days and since his friend laid so much stress upon his humble companionship he was willing to share his adventures mister Pickwick smiled they shook hands and walked back to rejoin their companions It was at this moment that mister Pickwick made that immortal discovery which has been the pride and boast of his friends and the envy of every antiquarian in this or any other country They had passed the door of their inn and walked a little way down the village before they recollected the precise spot in which it stood As they turned back mister Pickwick s eye fell upon a small broken stone partially buried in the ground in front of a cottage door He paused This is very strange said mister Pickwick What is strange inquired mister Tupman staring eagerly at every object near him but the right one God bless me what s the matter This last was an ejaculation of irrepressible astonishment occasioned by seeing mister Pickwick in his enthusiasm for discovery fall on his knees before the little stone and commence wiping the dust off it with his pocket handkerchief There is an inscription here said mister Pickwick Is it possible said mister Tupman I can discern continued mister Pickwick rubbing away with all his might and gazing intently through his spectacles I can discern a cross and a thirteen and then a T This is important continued mister Pickwick starting up This is some very old inscription existing perhaps long before the ancient alms houses in this place It must not be lost He tapped at the cottage door A labouring man opened it Do you know how this stone came here my friend inquired the benevolent mister Pickwick No I doan t Sir replied the man civilly It was here long afore I was born or any on us mister Pickwick glanced triumphantly at his companion You you are not particularly attached to it I dare say said mister Pickwick trembling with anxiety You wouldn t mind selling it now Ah but who d buy it inquired the man with an expression of face which he probably meant to be very cunning I ll give you ten shillings for it at once said mister Pickwick if you would take it up for me The astonishment of the village may be easily imagined when the little stone having been raised with one wrench of a spade mister Pickwick by dint of great personal exertion bore it with his own hands to the inn and after having carefully washed it deposited it on the table The exultation and joy of the Pickwickians knew no bounds when their patience and assiduity their washing and scraping were crowned with success The stone was uneven and broken and the letters were straggling and irregular but the following fragment of an inscription was clearly to be deciphered cross B I L S T u m P S H I S M ARK mister Pickwick s eyes sparkled with delight as he sat and gloated over the treasure he had discovered He had attained one of the greatest objects of his ambition In a county known to abound in the remains of the early ages in a village in which there still existed some memorials of the olden time he he the chairman of the Pickwick Club had discovered a strange and curious inscription of unquestionable antiquity which had wholly escaped the observation of the many learned men who had preceded him He could hardly trust the evidence of his senses This this said he determines me We return to town to morrow To morrow exclaimed his admiring followers To morrow said mister Pickwick This treasure must be at once deposited where it can be thoroughly investigated and properly understood I have another reason for this step In a few days an election is to take place for the borough of Eatanswill at which mister Perker a gentleman whom I lately met is the agent of one of the candidates We will behold and minutely examine a scene so interesting to every Englishman We will was the animated cry of three voices mister Pickwick looked round him The attachment and fervour of his followers lighted up a glow of enthusiasm within him He was their leader and he felt it Let us celebrate this happy meeting with a convivial glass said he This proposition like the other was received with unanimous applause Having himself deposited the important stone in a small deal box purchased from the landlady for the purpose he placed himself in an arm chair at the head of the table and the evening was devoted to festivity and conversation It was past eleven o clock a late hour for the little village of Cobham when mister Pickwick retired to the bedroom which had been prepared for his reception He threw open the lattice window and setting his light upon the table fell into a train of meditation on the hurried events of the two preceding days The hour and the place were both favourable to contemplation mister Pickwick was roused by the church clock striking twelve The first stroke of the hour sounded solemnly in his ear but when the bell ceased the stillness seemed insupportable he almost felt as if he had lost a companion He was nervous and excited and hastily undressing himself and placing his light in the chimney got into bed Every one has experienced that disagreeable state of mind in which a sensation of bodily weariness in vain contends against an inability to sleep It was mister Pickwick s condition at this moment he tossed first on one side and then on the other and perseveringly closed his eyes as if to coax himself to slumber It was of no use Whether it was the unwonted exertion he had undergone or the heat or the brandy and water or the strange bed whatever it was his thoughts kept reverting very uncomfortably to the grim pictures downstairs and the old stories to which they had given rise in the course of the evening After half an hour s tumbling about he came to the unsatisfactory conclusion that it was of no use trying to sleep so he got up and partially dressed himself Anything he thought was better than lying there fancying all kinds of horrors He looked out of the window it was very dark He walked about the room it was very lonely He had taken a few turns from the door to the window and from the window to the door when the clergyman s manuscript for the first time entered his head It was a good thought If it failed to interest him it might send him to sleep He took it from his coat pocket and drawing a small table towards his bedside trimmed the light put on his spectacles and composed himself to read It was a strange handwriting and the paper was much soiled and blotted The title gave him a sudden start too and he could not avoid casting a wistful glance round the room Reflecting on the absurdity of giving way to such feelings however he trimmed the light again and read as follows A MADMAN S MANUSCRIPT Yes a madman s How that word would have struck to my heart many years ago How it would have roused the terror that used to come upon me sometimes sending the blood hissing and tingling through my veins till the cold dew of fear stood in large drops upon my skin and my knees knocked together with fright I like it now though It s a fine name Show me the monarch whose angry frown was ever feared like the glare of a madman s eye whose cord and axe were ever half so sure as a madman s gripe Ho ho It s a grand thing to be mad to be peeped at like a wild lion through the iron bars to gnash one s teeth and howl through the long still night to the merry ring of a heavy chain and to roll and twine among the straw transported with such brave music Hurrah for the madhouse Oh it s a rare place I remember days when I was afraid of being mad when I used to start from my sleep and fall upon my knees and pray to be spared from the curse of my race when I rushed from the sight of merriment or happiness to hide myself in some lonely place and spend the weary hours in watching the progress of the fever that was to consume my brain I knew that madness was mixed up with my very blood and the marrow of my bones that one generation had passed away without the pestilence appearing among them and that I was the first in whom it would revive I knew it must be so that so it always had been and so it ever would be and when I cowered in some obscure corner of a crowded room and saw men whisper and point and turn their eyes towards me I knew they were telling each other of the doomed madman and I slunk away again to mope in solitude I did this for years long long years they were The nights here are long sometimes very long but they are nothing to the restless nights and dreadful dreams I had at that time It makes me cold to remember them Large dusky forms with sly and jeering faces crouched in the corners of the room and bent over my bed at night tempting me to madness They told me in low whispers that the floor of the old house in which my father died was stained with his own blood shed by his own hand in raging madness I drove my fingers into my ears but they screamed into my head till the room rang with it that in one generation before him the madness slumbered but that his grandfather had lived for years with his hands fettered to the ground to prevent his tearing himself to pieces I knew they told the truth I knew it well I had found it out years before though they had tried to keep it from me Ha ha I was too cunning for them madman as they thought me At last it came upon me and I wondered how I could ever have feared it I could go into the world now and laugh and shout with the best among them I knew I was mad but they did not even suspect it How I used to hug myself with delight when I thought of the fine trick I was playing them after their old pointing and leering when I was not mad but only dreading that I might one day become so And how I used to laugh for joy when I was alone and thought how well I kept my secret and how quickly my kind friends would have fallen from me if they had known the truth I could have screamed with ecstasy when I dined alone with some fine roaring fellow to think how pale he would have turned and how fast he would have run if he had known that the dear friend who sat close to him sharpening a bright glittering knife was a madman with all the power and half the will to plunge it in his heart Oh it was a merry life Riches became mine wealth poured in upon me and I rioted in pleasures enhanced a thousandfold to me by the consciousness of my well kept secret I inherited an estate The law the eagle eyed law itself had been deceived and had handed over disputed thousands to a madman s hands Where was the wit of the sharp sighted men of sound mind Where the dexterity of the lawyers eager to discover a flaw The madman s cunning had overreached them all I had money How I was courted I spent it profusely How I was praised How those three proud overbearing brothers humbled themselves before me The old white headed father too such deference such respect such devoted friendship he worshipped me The old man had a daughter and the young men a sister and all the five were poor I was rich and when I married the girl I saw a smile of triumph play upon the faces of her needy relatives as they thought of their well planned scheme and their fine prize It was for me to smile To smile To laugh outright and tear my hair and roll upon the ground with shrieks of merriment They little thought they had married her to a madman Stay If they had known it would they have saved her A sister s happiness against her husband s gold The lightest feather I blow into the air against the gay chain that ornaments my body In one thing I was deceived with all my cunning If I had not been mad for though we madmen are sharp witted enough we get bewildered sometimes I should have known that the girl would rather have been placed stiff and cold in a dull leaden coffin than borne an envied bride to my rich glittering house I should have known that her heart was with the dark eyed boy whose name I once heard her breathe in her troubled sleep and that she had been sacrificed to me to relieve the poverty of the old white headed man and the haughty brothers I don t remember forms or faces now but I know the girl was beautiful I know she was for in the bright moonlight nights when I start up from my sleep and all is quiet about me I see standing still and motionless in one corner of this cell a slight and wasted figure with long black hair which streaming down her back stirs with no earthly wind and eyes that fix their gaze on me and never wink or close Hush the blood chills at my heart as I write it down that form is HERS the face is very pale and the eyes are glassy bright but I know them well That figure never moves it never frowns and mouths as others do that fill this place sometimes but it is much more dreadful to me even than the spirits that tempted me many years ago it comes fresh from the grave and is so very death like For nearly a year I saw that face grow paler for nearly a year I saw the tears steal down the mournful cheeks and never knew the cause I found it out at last though They could not keep it from me long She had never liked me I had never thought she did she despised my wealth and hated the splendour in which she lived but I had not expected that She loved another This I had never thought of Strange feelings came over me and thoughts forced upon me by some secret power whirled round and round my brain I did not hate her though I hated the boy she still wept for I pitied yes I pitied the wretched life to which her cold and selfish relations had doomed her I knew that she could not live long but the thought that before her death she might give birth to some ill fated being destined to hand down madness to its offspring determined me I resolved to kill her For many weeks I thought of poison and then of drowning and then of fire A fine sight the grand house in flames and the madman s wife smouldering away to cinders Think of the jest of a large reward too and of some sane man swinging in the wind for a deed he never did and all through a madman s cunning I thought often of this but I gave it up at last Oh the pleasure of stropping the razor day after day feeling the sharp edge and thinking of the gash one stroke of its thin bright edge would make At last the old spirits who had been with me so often before whispered in my ear that the time was come and thrust the open razor into my hand I grasped it firmly rose softly from the bed and leaned over my sleeping wife Her face was buried in her hands I withdrew them softly and they fell listlessly on her bosom She had been weeping for the traces of the tears were still wet upon her cheek Her face was calm and placid and even as I looked upon it a tranquil smile lighted up her pale features I laid my hand softly on her shoulder She started it was only a passing dream I leaned forward again She screamed and woke One motion of my hand and she would never again have uttered cry or sound But I was startled and drew back Her eyes were fixed on mine I knew not how it was but they cowed and frightened me and I quailed beneath them She rose from the bed still gazing fixedly and steadily on me I trembled the razor was in my hand but I could not move She made towards the door As she neared it she turned and withdrew her eyes from my face The spell was broken I bounded forward and clutched her by the arm Uttering shriek upon shriek she sank upon the ground Now I could have killed her without a struggle but the house was alarmed I heard the tread of footsteps on the stairs I replaced the razor in its usual drawer unfastened the door and called loudly for assistance They came and raised her and placed her on the bed She lay bereft of animation for hours and when life look and speech returned her senses had deserted her and she raved wildly and furiously Doctors were called in great men who rolled up to my door in easy carriages with fine horses and gaudy servants They were at her bedside for weeks They had a great meeting and consulted together in low and solemn voices in another room One the cleverest and most celebrated among them took me aside and bidding me prepare for the worst told me me the madman that my wife was mad He stood close beside me at an open window his eyes looking in my face and his hand laid upon my arm With one effort I could have hurled him into the street beneath It would have been rare sport to have done it but my secret was at stake and I let him go A few days after they told me I must place her under some restraint I must provide a keeper for her I I went into the open fields where none could hear me and laughed till the air resounded with my shouts She died next day The white headed old man followed her to the grave and the proud brothers dropped a tear over the insensible corpse of her whose sufferings they had regarded in her lifetime with muscles of iron All this was food for my secret mirth and I laughed behind the white handkerchief which I held up to my face as we rode home till the tears Came into my eyes But though I had carried my object and killed her I was restless and disturbed and I felt that before long my secret must be known I could not hide the wild mirth and joy which boiled within me and made me when I was alone at home jump up and beat my hands together and dance round and round and roar aloud When I went out and saw the busy crowds hurrying about the streets or to the theatre and heard the sound of music and beheld the people dancing I felt such glee that I could have rushed among them and torn them to pieces limb from limb and howled in transport But I ground my teeth and struck my feet upon the floor and drove my sharp nails into my hands I kept it down and no one knew I was a madman yet I remember though it s one of the last things I can remember for now I mix up realities with my dreams and having so much to do and being always hurried here have no time to separate the two from some strange confusion in which they get involved I remember how I let it out at last Ha ha I think I see their frightened looks now and feel the ease with which I flung them from me and dashed my clenched fist into their white faces and then flew like the wind and left them screaming and shouting far behind The strength of a giant comes upon me when I think of it There see how this iron bar bends beneath my furious wrench I could snap it like a twig only there are long galleries here with many doors I don t think I could find my way along them and even if I could I know there are iron gates below which they keep locked and barred They know what a clever madman I have been and they are proud to have me here to show Let me see yes I had been out It was late at night when I reached home and found the proudest of the three proud brothers waiting to see me urgent business he said I recollect it well I hated that man with all a madman s hate Many and many a time had my fingers longed to tear him They told me he was there I ran swiftly upstairs He had a word to say to me I dismissed the servants It was late and we were alone together for the first time I kept my eyes carefully from him at first for I knew what he little thought and I gloried in the knowledge that the light of madness gleamed from them like fire We sat in silence for a few minutes He spoke at last My recent dissipation and strange remarks made so soon after his sister s death were an insult to her memory Coupling together many circumstances which had at first escaped his observation he thought I had not treated her well He wished to know whether he was right in inferring that I meant to cast a reproach upon her memory and a disrespect upon her family It was due to the uniform he wore to demand this explanation This man had a commission in the army a commission purchased with my money and his sister s misery This was the man who had been foremost in the plot to ensnare me and grasp my wealth This was the man who had been the main instrument in forcing his sister to wed me well knowing that her heart was given to that puling boy Due to his uniform The livery of his degradation I turned my eyes upon him I could not help it but I spoke not a word I saw the sudden change that came upon him beneath my gaze He was a bold man but the colour faded from his face and he drew back his chair I dragged mine nearer to him and I laughed I was very merry then I saw him shudder I felt the madness rising within me He was afraid of me You were very fond of your sister when she was alive I said Very He looked uneasily round him and I saw his hand grasp the back of his chair but he said nothing You villain said I I found you out I discovered your hellish plots against me I know her heart was fixed on some one else before you compelled her to marry me I know it I know it He jumped suddenly from his chair brandished it aloft and bid me stand back for I took care to be getting closer to him all the time I spoke I screamed rather than talked for I felt tumultuous passions eddying through my veins and the old spirits whispering and taunting me to tear his heart out Damn you said I starting up and rushing upon him I killed her I am a madman Down with you Blood blood I will have it I turned aside with one blow the chair he hurled at me in his terror and closed with him and with a heavy crash we rolled upon the floor together It was a fine struggle that for he was a tall strong man fighting for his life and I a powerful madman thirsting to destroy him I knew no strength could equal mine and I was right Right again though a madman His struggles grew fainter I knelt upon his chest and clasped his brawny throat firmly with both hands His face grew purple his eyes were starting from his head and with protruded tongue he seemed to mock me I squeezed the tighter The door was suddenly burst open with a loud noise and a crowd of people rushed forward crying aloud to each other to secure the madman My secret was out and my only struggle now was for liberty and freedom I gained my feet before a hand was on me threw myself among my assailants and cleared my way with my strong arm as if I bore a hatchet in my hand and hewed them down before me I gained the door dropped over the banisters and in an instant was in the street Straight and swift I ran and no one dared to stop me I heard the noise of the feet behind and redoubled my speed It grew fainter and fainter in the distance and at length died away altogether but on I bounded through marsh and rivulet over fence and wall with a wild shout which was taken up by the strange beings that flocked around me on every side and swelled the sound till it pierced the air I was borne upon the arms of demons who swept along upon the wind and bore down bank and hedge before them and spun me round and round with a rustle and a speed that made my head swim until at last they threw me from them with a violent shock and I fell heavily upon the earth When I woke I found myself here here in this gray cell where the sunlight seldom comes and the moon steals in in rays which only serve to show the dark shadows about me and that silent figure in its old corner When I lie awake I can sometimes hear strange shrieks and cries from distant parts of this large place What they are I know not but they neither come from that pale form nor does it regard them For from the first shades of dusk till the earliest light of morning it still stands motionless in the same place listening to the music of my iron chain and watching my gambols on my straw bed At the end of the manuscript was written in another hand this note The unhappy man whose ravings are recorded above was a melancholy instance of the baneful results of energies misdirected in early life and excesses prolonged until their consequences could never be repaired The thoughtless riot dissipation and debauchery of his younger days produced fever and delirium The first effects of the latter was the strange delusion founded upon a well known medical theory strongly contended for by some and as strongly contested by others that an hereditary madness existed in his family This produced a settled gloom which in time developed a morbid insanity and finally terminated in raving madness There is every reason to believe that the events he detailed though distorted in the description by his diseased imagination really happened It is only matter of wonder to those who were acquainted with the vices of his early career that his passions when no longer controlled by reason did not lead him to the commission of still more frightful deeds mister Pickwick s candle was just expiring in the socket as he concluded the perusal of the old clergyman s manuscript and when the light went suddenly out without any previous flicker by way of warning it communicated a very considerable start to his excited frame Hastily throwing off such articles of clothing as he had put on when he rose from his uneasy bed and casting a fearful glance around he once more scrambled hastily between the sheets and soon fell fast asleep The sun was shining brilliantly into his chamber when he awoke and the morning was far advanced The gloom which had oppressed him on the previous night had disappeared with the dark shadows which shrouded the landscape and his thoughts and feelings were as light and gay as the morning itself After a hearty breakfast the four gentlemen sallied forth to walk to Gravesend followed by a man bearing the stone in its deal box They reached the town about one o clock their luggage they had directed to be forwarded to the city from Rochester and being fortunate enough to secure places on the outside of a coach arrived in London in sound health and spirits on that same afternoon The next three or four days were occupied with the preparations which were necessary for their journey to the borough of Eatanswill As any references to that most important undertaking demands a separate chapter we may devote the few lines which remain at the close of this to narrate with great brevity the history of the antiquarian discovery It appears from the Transactions of the Club then that mister Pickwick lectured upon the discovery at a General Club Meeting convened on the night succeeding their return and entered into a variety of ingenious and erudite speculations on the meaning of the inscription It also appears that a skilful artist executed a faithful delineation of the curiosity which was engraven on stone and presented to the Royal Antiquarian Society and other learned bodies that heart burnings and jealousies without number were created by rival controversies which were penned upon the subject and that mister Pickwick himself wrote a pamphlet containing ninety six pages of very small print and twenty seven different readings of the inscription that three old gentlemen cut off their eldest sons with a shilling a piece for presuming to doubt the antiquity of the fragment and that one enthusiastic individual cut himself off prematurely in despair at being unable to fathom its meaning that mister Pickwick was elected an honorary member of seventeen native and foreign societies for making the discovery that none of the seventeen could make anything of it but that all the seventeen agreed it was very extraordinary mister Blotton indeed and the name will be doomed to the undying contempt of those who cultivate the mysterious and the sublime mister Blotton we say with the doubt and cavilling peculiar to vulgar minds presumed to state a view of the case as degrading as ridiculous mister Blotton with a mean desire to tarnish the lustre of the immortal name of Pickwick actually undertook a journey to Cobham in person and on his return sarcastically observed in an oration at the club that he had seen the man from whom the stone was purchased that the man presumed the stone to be ancient but solemnly denied the antiquity of the inscription inasmuch as he represented it to have been rudely carved by himself in an idle mood and to display letters intended to bear neither more or less than the simple construction of BILL STUMPS HIS MARK and that mister Stumps being little in the habit of original composition and more accustomed to be guided by the sound of words than by the strict rules of orthography had omitted the concluding L of his Christian name The Pickwick Club as might have been expected from so enlightened an institution received this statement with the contempt it deserved expelled the presumptuous and ill conditioned Blotton from the society and voted mister Pickwick a pair of gold spectacles in token of their confidence and approbation in return for which mister Pickwick caused a portrait of himself to be painted and hung up in the club room mister Blotton was ejected but not conquered He also wrote a pamphlet addressed to the seventeen learned societies native and foreign containing a repetition of the statement he had already made and rather more than half intimating his opinion that the seventeen learned societies were so many humbugs Hereupon the virtuous indignation of the seventeen learned societies being roused several fresh pamphlets appeared the foreign learned societies corresponded with the native learned societies the native learned societies translated the pamphlets of the foreign learned societies into English the foreign learned societies translated the pamphlets of the native learned societies into all sorts of languages and thus commenced that celebrated scientific discussion so well known to all men as the Pickwick controversy But this base attempt to injure mister Pickwick recoiled upon the head of its calumnious author The seventeen learned societies unanimously voted the presumptuous Blotton an ignorant meddler and forthwith set to work upon more treatises than ever And to this day the stone remains an illegible monument of mister Pickwick s greatness and a lasting trophy to the littleness of his enemies CHAPTER XII DESCRIPTIVE OF A VERY IMPORTANT PROCEEDING ON THE PART OF mister PICKWICK NO LESS AN EPOCH IN HIS LIFE THAN IN THIS HISTORY mister Pickwick s apartments in Goswell Street although on a limited scale were not only of a very neat and comfortable description but peculiarly adapted for the residence of a man of his genius and observation His sitting room was the first floor front his bedroom the second floor front and thus whether he were sitting at his desk in his parlour or standing before the dressing glass in his dormitory he had an equal opportunity of contemplating human nature in all the numerous phases it exhibits in that not more populous than popular thoroughfare His landlady missus Bardell the relict and sole executrix of a deceased custom house officer was a comely woman of bustling manners and agreeable appearance with a natural genius for cooking improved by study and long practice into an exquisite talent There were no children no servants no fowls The only other inmates of the house were a large man and a small boy the first a lodger the second a production of missus Bardell s The large man was always home precisely at ten o clock at night at which hour he regularly condensed himself into the limits of a dwarfish French bedstead in the back parlour and the infantine sports and gymnastic exercises of Master Bardell were exclusively confined to the neighbouring pavements and gutters Cleanliness and quiet reigned throughout the house and in it mister Pickwick s will was law To any one acquainted with these points of the domestic economy of the establishment and conversant with the admirable regulation of mister Pickwick s mind his appearance and behaviour on the morning previous to that which had been fixed upon for the journey to Eatanswill would have been most mysterious and unaccountable He paced the room to and fro with hurried steps popped his head out of the window at intervals of about three minutes each constantly referred to his watch and exhibited many other manifestations of impatience very unusual with him It was evident that something of great importance was in contemplation but what that something was not even missus Bardell had been enabled to discover missus Bardell said mister Pickwick at last as that amiable female approached the termination of a prolonged dusting of the apartment Sir said missus Bardell Your little boy is a very long time gone Why it s a good long way to the Borough sir remonstrated missus Bardell Ah said mister Pickwick very true so it is mister Pickwick relapsed into silence and missus Bardell resumed her dusting missus Bardell said mister Pickwick at the expiration of a few minutes Sir said missus Bardell again Do you think it a much greater expense to keep two people than to keep one La mister Pickwick said missus Bardell colouring up to the very border of her cap as she fancied she observed a species of matrimonial twinkle in the eyes of her lodger La mister Pickwick what a question Well but do you inquired mister Pickwick That depends said missus Bardell approaching the duster very near to mister Pickwick s elbow which was planted on the table That depends a good deal upon the person you know mister Pickwick and whether it s a saving and careful person sir That s very true said mister Pickwick but the person I have in my eye here he looked very hard at missus Bardell I think possesses these qualities and has moreover a considerable knowledge of the world and a great deal of sharpness missus Bardell which may be of material use to me La mister Pickwick said missus Bardell the crimson rising to her cap border again I do said mister Pickwick growing energetic as was his wont in speaking of a subject which interested him I do indeed and to tell you the truth missus Bardell I have made up my mind Dear me sir exclaimed missus Bardell You ll think it very strange now said the amiable mister Pickwick with a good humoured glance at his companion that I never consulted you about this matter and never even mentioned it till I sent your little boy out this morning eh missus Bardell could only reply by a look She had long worshipped mister Pickwick at a distance but here she was all at once raised to a pinnacle to which her wildest and most extravagant hopes had never dared to aspire mister Pickwick was going to propose a deliberate plan too sent her little boy to the Borough to get him out of the way how thoughtful how considerate Well said mister Pickwick what do you think Oh mister Pickwick said missus Bardell trembling with agitation you re very kind sir It ll save you a good deal of trouble won t it said mister Pickwick Oh I never thought anything of the trouble sir replied missus Bardell and of course I should take more trouble to please you then than ever but it is so kind of you mister Pickwick to have so much consideration for my loneliness Ah to be sure said mister Pickwick I never thought of that When I am in town you ll always have somebody to sit with you To be sure so you will I am sure I ought to be a very happy woman said missus Bardell And your little boy said mister Pickwick Bless his heart interposed missus Bardell with a maternal sob He too will have a companion resumed mister Pickwick a lively one who ll teach him I ll be bound more tricks in a week than he would ever learn in a year And mister Pickwick smiled placidly Oh you dear said missus Bardell mister Pickwick started Oh you kind good playful dear said missus Bardell and without more ado she rose from her chair and flung her arms round mister Pickwick s neck with a cataract of tears and a chorus of sobs Bless my soul cried the astonished mister Pickwick missus Bardell my good woman dear me what a situation pray consider missus Bardell don t if anybody should come Oh let them come exclaimed missus Bardell frantically I ll never leave you dear kind good soul and with these words missus Bardell clung the tighter Mercy upon me said mister Pickwick struggling violently I hear somebody coming up the stairs Don t don t there s a good creature don t But entreaty and remonstrance were alike unavailing for missus Bardell had fainted in mister Pickwick s arms and before he could gain time to deposit her on a chair Master Bardell entered the room ushering in mister Tupman mister Winkle and mister Snodgrass mister Pickwick was struck motionless and speechless He stood with his lovely burden in his arms gazing vacantly on the countenances of his friends without the slightest attempt at recognition or explanation They in their turn stared at him and Master Bardell in his turn stared at everybody The astonishment of the Pickwickians was so absorbing and the perplexity of mister Pickwick was so extreme that they might have remained in exactly the same relative situations until the suspended animation of the lady was restored had it not been for a most beautiful and touching expression of filial affection on the part of her youthful son Clad in a tight suit of corduroy spangled with brass buttons of a very considerable size he at first stood at the door astounded and uncertain but by degrees the impression that his mother must have suffered some personal damage pervaded his partially developed mind and considering mister Pickwick as the aggressor he set up an appalling and semi earthly kind of howling and butting forward with his head commenced assailing that immortal gentleman about the back and legs with such blows and pinches as the strength of his arm and the violence of his excitement allowed Take this little villain away said the agonised mister Pickwick he s mad What is the matter said the three tongue tied Pickwickians I don t know replied mister Pickwick pettishly Take away the boy Here mister Winkle carried the interesting boy screaming and struggling to the farther end of the apartment Now help me lead this woman downstairs Oh I am better now said missus Bardell faintly Let me lead you downstairs said the ever gallant mister Tupman Thank you sir thank you exclaimed missus Bardell hysterically And downstairs she was led accordingly accompanied by her affectionate son I cannot conceive said mister Pickwick when his friend returned I cannot conceive what has been the matter with that woman I had merely announced to her my intention of keeping a man servant when she fell into the extraordinary paroxysm in which you found her Very extraordinary thing Very said his three friends Placed me in such an extremely awkward situation continued mister Pickwick Very was the reply of his followers as they coughed slightly and looked dubiously at each other This behaviour was not lost upon mister Pickwick He remarked their incredulity They evidently suspected him There is a man in the passage now said mister Tupman It s the man I spoke to you about said mister Pickwick I sent for him to the Borough this morning Have the goodness to call him up Snodgrass mister Snodgrass did as he was desired and mister Samuel Weller forthwith presented himself Oh you remember me I suppose said mister Pickwick I should think so replied Sam with a patronising wink Queer start that ere but he was one too many for you warn t he Up to snuff and a pinch or two over eh Never mind that matter now said mister Pickwick hastily I want to speak to you about something else Sit down Thank ee sir said Sam And down he sat without further bidding having previously deposited his old white hat on the landing outside the door Tain t a wery good un to look at said Sam but it s an astonishin un to wear and afore the brim went it was a wery handsome tile Hows ever it s lighter without it that s one thing and every hole lets in some air that s another wentilation gossamer I calls it On the delivery of this sentiment mister Weller smiled agreeably upon the assembled Pickwickians Now with regard to the matter on which I with the concurrence of these gentlemen sent for you said mister Pickwick That s the pint sir interposed Sam out vith it as the father said to his child when he swallowed a farden We want to know in the first place said mister Pickwick whether you have any reason to be discontented with your present situation Afore I answers that ere question general l m n replied mister Weller I should like to know in the first place whether you re a goin to purwide me with a better A sunbeam of placid benevolence played on mister Pickwick s features as he said I have half made up my mind to engage you myself Have you though said Sam mister Pickwick nodded in the affirmative Wages inquired Sam Twelve pounds a year replied mister Pickwick Clothes Two suits Work To attend upon me and travel about with me and these gentlemen here Take the bill down said Sam emphatically I m let to a single gentleman and the terms is agreed upon You accept the situation inquired mister Pickwick Cert nly replied Sam If the clothes fits me half as well as the place they ll do You can get a character of course said mister Pickwick Ask the landlady o the White Hart about that Sir replied Sam Can you come this evening I ll get into the clothes this minute if they re here said Sam with great alacrity Call at eight this evening said mister Pickwick and if the inquiries are satisfactory they shall be provided With the single exception of one amiable indiscretion in which an assistant housemaid had equally participated the history of mister Weller s conduct was so very blameless that mister Pickwick felt fully justified in closing the engagement that very evening With the promptness and energy which characterised not only the public proceedings but all the private actions of this extraordinary man he at once led his new attendant to one of those convenient emporiums where gentlemen s new and second hand clothes are provided and the troublesome and inconvenient formality of measurement dispensed with and before night had closed in mister Weller was furnished with a grey coat with the P C button a black hat with a cockade to it a pink striped waistcoat light breeches and gaiters and a variety of other necessaries too numerous to recapitulate Well said that suddenly transformed individual as he took his seat on the outside of the Eatanswill coach next morning I wonder whether I m meant to be a footman or a groom or a gamekeeper or a seedsman I looks like a sort of compo of every one on em Never mind there s a change of air plenty to see and little to do and all this suits my complaint uncommon so long life to the Pickvicks says I CHAPTER XIII SOME ACCOUNT OF EATANSWILL OF THE STATE OF PARTIES THEREIN AND OF THE ELECTION OF A MEMBER TO SERVE IN PARLIAMENT FOR THAT ANCIENT LOYAL AND PATRIOTIC BOROUGH We will frankly acknowledge that up to the period of our being first immersed in the voluminous papers of the Pickwick Club we had never heard of Eatanswill we will with equal candour admit that we have in vain searched for proof of the actual existence of such a place at the present day Knowing the deep reliance to be placed on every note and statement of mister Pickwick s and not presuming to set up our recollection against the recorded declarations of that great man we have consulted every authority bearing upon the subject to which we could possibly refer We have traced every name in schedules A and B without meeting with that of Eatanswill we have minutely examined every corner of the pocket county maps issued for the benefit of society by our distinguished publishers and the same result has attended our investigation We are therefore led to believe that mister Pickwick with that anxious desire to abstain from giving offence to any and with those delicate feelings for which all who knew him well know he was so eminently remarkable purposely substituted a fictitious designation for the real name of the place in which his observations were made We are confirmed in this belief by a little circumstance apparently slight and trivial in itself but when considered in this point of view not undeserving of notice In mister Pickwick s note book we can just trace an entry of the fact that the places of himself and followers were booked by the Norwich coach but this entry was afterwards lined through as if for the purpose of concealing even the direction in which the borough is situated We will not therefore hazard a guess upon the subject but will at once proceed with this history content with the materials which its characters have provided for us It appears then that the Eatanswill people like the people of many other small towns considered themselves of the utmost and most mighty importance and that every man in Eatanswill conscious of the weight that attached to his example felt himself bound to unite heart and soul with one of the two great parties that divided the town the Blues and the Buffs Now the Blues lost no opportunity of opposing the Buffs and the Buffs lost no opportunity of opposing the Blues and the consequence was that whenever the Buffs and Blues met together at public meeting town hall fair or market disputes and high words arose between them With these dissensions it is almost superfluous to say that everything in Eatanswill was made a party question If the Buffs proposed to new skylight the market place the Blues got up public meetings and denounced the proceeding if the Blues proposed the erection of an additional pump in the High Street the Buffs rose as one man and stood aghast at the enormity There were Blue shops and Buff shops Blue inns and Buff inns there was a Blue aisle and a Buff aisle in the very church itself Of course it was essentially and indispensably necessary that each of these powerful parties should have its chosen organ and representative and accordingly there were two newspapers in the town the Eatanswill GAZETTE and the Eatanswill INDEPENDENT the former advocating Blue principles and the latter conducted on grounds decidedly Buff Fine newspapers they were Such leading articles and such spirited attacks Our worthless contemporary the GAZETTE That disgraceful and dastardly journal the INDEPENDENT That false and scurrilous print the INDEPENDENT That vile and slanderous calumniator the GAZETTE these and other spirit stirring denunciations were strewn plentifully over the columns of each in every number and excited feelings of the most intense delight and indignation in the bosoms of the townspeople mister Pickwick with his usual foresight and sagacity had chosen a peculiarly desirable moment for his visit to the borough Never was such a contest known The Honourable Samuel Slumkey of Slumkey Hall was the Blue candidate and Horatio Fizkin esquire of Fizkin Lodge near Eatanswill had been prevailed upon by his friends to stand forward on the Buff interest The GAZETTE warned the electors of Eatanswill that the eyes not only of England but of the whole civilised world were upon them and the INDEPENDENT imperatively demanded to know whether the constituency of Eatanswill were the grand fellows they had always taken them for or base and servile tools undeserving alike of the name of Englishmen and the blessings of freedom Never had such a commotion agitated the town before It was late in the evening when mister Pickwick and his companions assisted by Sam dismounted from the roof of the Eatanswill coach Large blue silk flags were flying from the windows of the Town Arms Inn and bills were posted in every sash intimating in gigantic letters that the Honourable Samuel Slumkey s committee sat there daily A crowd of idlers were assembled in the road looking at a hoarse man in the balcony who was apparently talking himself very red in the face in mister Slumkey s behalf but the force and point of whose arguments were somewhat impaired by the perpetual beating of four large drums which mister Fizkin s committee had stationed at the street corner There was a busy little man beside him though who took off his hat at intervals and motioned to the people to cheer which they regularly did most enthusiastically and as the red faced gentleman went on talking till he was redder in the face than ever it seemed to answer his purpose quite as well as if anybody had heard him The Pickwickians had no sooner dismounted than they were surrounded by a branch mob of the honest and independent who forthwith set up three deafening cheers which being responded to by the main body for it s not at all necessary for a crowd to know what they are cheering about swelled into a tremendous roar of triumph which stopped even the red faced man in the balcony Hurrah shouted the mob in conclusion One cheer more screamed the little fugleman in the balcony and out shouted the mob again as if lungs were cast iron with steel works Slumkey for ever roared the honest and independent Slumkey for ever echoed mister Pickwick taking off his hat No Fizkin roared the crowd Certainly not shouted mister Pickwick Hurrah And then there was another roaring like that of a whole menagerie when the elephant has rung the bell for the cold meat Who is Slumkey whispered mister Tupman I don t know replied mister Pickwick in the same tone Hush Don t ask any questions It s always best on these occasions to do what the mob do But suppose there are two mobs suggested mister Snodgrass Shout with the largest replied mister Pickwick Volumes could not have said more They entered the house the crowd opening right and left to let them pass and cheering vociferously The first object of consideration was to secure quarters for the night Can we have beds here inquired mister Pickwick summoning the waiter Don t know Sir replied the man afraid we re full sir I ll inquire Sir Away he went for that purpose and presently returned to ask whether the gentleman were Blue As neither mister Pickwick nor his companions took any vital interest in the cause of either candidate the question was rather a difficult one to answer In this dilemma mister Pickwick bethought himself of his new friend mister Perker Do you know a gentleman of the name of Perker inquired mister Pickwick Certainly Sir Honourable mister Samuel Slumkey s agent He is Blue I think Oh yes Sir Then WE are Blue said mister Pickwick but observing that the man looked rather doubtful at this accommodating announcement he gave him his card and desired him to present it to mister Perker forthwith if he should happen to be in the house The waiter retired and reappearing almost immediately with a request that mister Pickwick would follow him led the way to a large room on the first floor where seated at a long table covered with books and papers was mister Perker Ah ah my dear Sir said the little man advancing to meet him very happy to see you my dear Sir very Pray sit down So you have carried your intention into effect You have come down here to see an election eh mister Pickwick replied in the affirmative Spirited contest my dear sir said the little man I m delighted to hear it said mister Pickwick rubbing his hands I like to see sturdy patriotism on whatever side it is called forth and so it s a spirited contest Oh yes said the little man very much so indeed We have opened all the public houses in the place and left our adversary nothing but the beer shops masterly stroke of policy that my dear Sir eh The little man smiled complacently and took a large pinch of snuff And what are the probabilities as to the result of the contest inquired mister Pickwick Why doubtful my dear Sir rather doubtful as yet replied the little man Fizkin s people have got three and thirty voters in the lock up coach house at the White Hart In the coach house said mister Pickwick considerably astonished by this second stroke of policy They keep em locked up there till they want em resumed the little man The effect of that is you see to prevent our getting at them and even if we could it would be of no use for they keep them very drunk on purpose Smart fellow Fizkin s agent very smart fellow indeed mister Pickwick stared but said nothing We are pretty confident though said mister Perker sinking his voice almost to a whisper We had a little tea party here last night five and forty women my dear sir and gave every one of em a green parasol when she went away A parasol said mister Pickwick Fact my dear Sir fact Five and forty green parasols at seven and sixpence a piece All women like finery extraordinary the effect of those parasols Secured all their husbands and half their brothers beats stockings and flannel and all that sort of thing hollow My idea my dear Sir entirely Hail rain or sunshine you can t walk half a dozen yards up the street without encountering half a dozen green parasols Here the little man indulged in a convulsion of mirth which was only checked by the entrance of a third party This was a tall thin man with a sandy coloured head inclined to baldness and a face in which solemn importance was blended with a look of unfathomable profundity He was dressed in a long brown surtout with a black cloth waistcoat and drab trousers A double eyeglass dangled at his waistcoat and on his head he wore a very low crowned hat with a broad brim The new comer was introduced to mister Pickwick as mister Pott the editor of the Eatanswill GAZETTE After a few preliminary remarks mister Pott turned round to mister Pickwick and said with solemnity This contest excites great interest in the metropolis sir I believe it does said mister Pickwick To which I have reason to know said Pott looking towards mister Perker for corroboration to which I have reason to know that my article of last Saturday in some degree contributed Not the least doubt of it said the little man The press is a mighty engine sir said Pott mister Pickwick yielded his fullest assent to the proposition But I trust sir said Pott that I have never abused the enormous power I wield I trust sir that I have never pointed the noble instrument which is placed in my hands against the sacred bosom of private life or the tender breast of individual reputation I trust sir that I have devoted my energies to to endeavours humble they may be humble I know they are to instil those principles of which are Here the editor of the Eatanswill GAZETTE appearing to ramble mister Pickwick came to his relief and said Certainly And what Sir said Pott what Sir let me ask you as an impartial man is the state of the public mind in London with reference to my contest with the INDEPENDENT Greatly excited no doubt interposed mister Perker with a look of slyness which was very likely accidental The contest said Pott shall be prolonged so long as I have health and strength and that portion of talent with which I am gifted From that contest Sir although it may unsettle men s minds and excite their feelings and render them incapable for the discharge of the everyday duties of ordinary life from that contest sir I will never shrink till I have set my heel upon the Eatanswill INDEPENDENT I wish the people of London and the people of this country to know sir that they may rely upon me that I will not desert them that I am resolved to stand by them Sir to the last Your conduct is most noble Sir said mister Pickwick and he grasped the hand of the magnanimous Pott You are sir I perceive a man of sense and talent said mister Pott almost breathless with the vehemence of his patriotic declaration I am most happy sir to make the acquaintance of such a man And I said mister Pickwick feel deeply honoured by this expression of your opinion Allow me sir to introduce you to my fellow travellers the other corresponding members of the club I am proud to have founded I shall be delighted said mister Pott mister Pickwick withdrew and returning with his friends presented them in due form to the editor of the Eatanswill GAZETTE Now my dear Pott said little mister Perker the question is what are we to do with our friends here We can stop in this house I suppose said mister Pickwick Not a spare bed in the house my dear sir not a single bed Extremely awkward said mister Pickwick Very said his fellow voyagers I have an idea upon this subject said mister Pott which I think may be very successfully adopted They have two beds at the Peacock and I can boldly say on behalf of missus Pott that she will be delighted to accommodate mister Pickwick and any one of his friends if the other two gentlemen and their servant do not object to shifting as they best can at the Peacock After repeated pressings on the part of mister Pott and repeated protestations on that of mister Pickwick that he could not think of incommoding or troubling his amiable wife it was decided that it was the only feasible arrangement that could be made So it WAS made and after dinner together at the Town Arms the friends separated mister Tupman and mister Snodgrass repairing to the Peacock and mister Pickwick and mister Winkle proceeding to the mansion of mister Pott it having been previously arranged that they should all reassemble at the Town Arms in the morning and accompany the Honourable Samuel Slumkey s procession to the place of nomination mister Pott s domestic circle was limited to himself and his wife All men whom mighty genius has raised to a proud eminence in the world have usually some little weakness which appears the more conspicuous from the contrast it presents to their general character If mister Pott had a weakness it was perhaps that he was rather too submissive to the somewhat contemptuous control and sway of his wife We do not feel justified in laying any particular stress upon the fact because on the present occasion all missus Pott s most winning ways were brought into requisition to receive the two gentlemen My dear said mister Pott mister Pickwick mister Pickwick of London missus Pott received mister Pickwick s paternal grasp of the hand with enchanting sweetness and mister Winkle who had not been announced at all sidled and bowed unnoticed in an obscure corner P my dear said missus Pott My life said mister Pott Pray introduce the other gentleman I beg a thousand pardons said mister Pott Permit me missus Pott mister Winkle said mister Pickwick Winkle echoed mister Pott and the ceremony of introduction was complete We owe you many apologies ma am said mister Pickwick for disturbing your domestic arrangements at so short a notice I beg you won t mention it sir replied the feminine Pott with vivacity It is a high treat to me I assure you to see any new faces living as I do from day to day and week to week in this dull place and seeing nobody Nobody my dear exclaimed mister Pott archly Nobody but you retorted missus Pott with asperity You see mister Pickwick said the host in explanation of his wife s lament that we are in some measure cut off from many enjoyments and pleasures of which we might otherwise partake My public station as editor of the Eatanswill GAZETTE the position which that paper holds in the country my constant immersion in the vortex of politics P my dear interposed missus Pott My life said the editor I wish my dear you would endeavour to find some topic of conversation in which these gentlemen might take some rational interest But my love said mister Pott with great humility mister Pickwick does take an interest in it It s well for him if he can said missus Pott emphatically I am wearied out of my life with your politics and quarrels with the INDEPENDENT and nonsense I am quite astonished P at your making such an exhibition of your absurdity But my dear said mister Pott Oh nonsense don t talk to me said missus Pott Do you play ecarte Sir I shall be very happy to learn under your tuition replied mister Winkle Well then draw that little table into this window and let me get out of hearing of those prosy politics Jane said mister Pott to the servant who brought in candles go down into the office and bring me up the file of the GAZETTE for eighteen hundred and twenty six I ll read you added the editor turning to mister Pickwick I ll just read you a few of the leaders I wrote at that time upon the Buff job of appointing a new tollman to the turnpike here I rather think they ll amuse you I should like to hear them very much indeed said mister Pickwick Up came the file and down sat the editor with mister Pickwick at his side We have in vain pored over the leaves of mister Pickwick s note book in the hope of meeting with a general summary of these beautiful compositions We have every reason to believe that he was perfectly enraptured with the vigour and freshness of the style indeed mister Winkle has recorded the fact that his eyes were closed as if with excess of pleasure during the whole time of their perusal The announcement of supper put a stop both to the game of ecarte and the recapitulation of the beauties of the Eatanswill GAZETTE missus Pott was in the highest spirits and the most agreeable humour mister Winkle had already made considerable progress in her good opinion and she did not hesitate to inform him confidentially that mister Pickwick was a delightful old dear These terms convey a familiarity of expression in which few of those who were intimately acquainted with that colossal minded man would have presumed to indulge We have preserved them nevertheless as affording at once a touching and a convincing proof of the estimation in which he was held by every class of society and the case with which he made his way to their hearts and feelings It was a late hour of the night long after mister Tupman and mister Snodgrass had fallen asleep in the inmost recesses of the Peacock when the two friends retired to rest Slumber soon fell upon the senses of mister Winkle but his feelings had been excited and his admiration roused and for many hours after sleep had rendered him insensible to earthly objects the face and figure of the agreeable missus Pott presented themselves again and again to his wandering imagination The noise and bustle which ushered in the morning were sufficient to dispel from the mind of the most romantic visionary in existence any associations but those which were immediately connected with the rapidly approaching election The beating of drums the blowing of horns and trumpets the shouting of men and tramping of horses echoed and re echoed through the streets from the earliest dawn of day and an occasional fight between the light skirmishers of either party at once enlivened the preparations and agreeably diversified their character Well Sam said mister Pickwick as his valet appeared at his bedroom door just as he was concluding his toilet all alive to day I suppose Reg lar game sir replied mister Weller our people s a collecting down at the Town Arms and they re a hollering themselves hoarse already Ah said mister Pickwick do they seem devoted to their party Sam Never see such dewotion in my life Sir Energetic eh said mister Pickwick Uncommon replied Sam I never see men eat and drink so much afore I wonder they ain t afeer d o bustin That s the mistaken kindness of the gentry here said mister Pickwick Wery likely replied Sam briefly Fine fresh hearty fellows they seem said mister Pickwick glancing from the window Wery fresh replied Sam me and the two waiters at the Peacock has been a pumpin over the independent woters as supped there last night Pumping over independent voters exclaimed mister Pickwick Yes said his attendant every man slept vere he fell down we dragged em out one by one this mornin and put em under the pump and they re in reg lar fine order now Shillin a head the committee paid for that ere job Can such things be exclaimed the astonished mister Pickwick Lord bless your heart sir said Sam why where was you half baptised that s nothin that ain t Nothing said mister Pickwick Nothin at all Sir replied his attendant The night afore the last day o the last election here the opposite party bribed the barmaid at the Town Arms to hocus the brandy and water of fourteen unpolled electors as was a stoppin in the house What do you mean by hocussing brandy and water inquired mister Pickwick Puttin laud num in it replied Sam Blessed if she didn t send em all to sleep till twelve hours arter the election was over They took one man up to the booth in a truck fast asleep by way of experiment but it was no go they wouldn t poll him so they brought him back and put him to bed again Strange practices these said mister Pickwick half speaking to himself and half addressing Sam Not half so strange as a miraculous circumstance as happened to my own father at an election time in this wery place Sir replied Sam What was that inquired mister Pickwick Why he drove a coach down here once said Sam lection time came on and he was engaged by vun party to bring down woters from London Night afore he was going to drive up committee on t other side sends for him quietly and away he goes vith the messenger who shows him in large room lots of general l m n heaps of papers pens and ink and all that ere Ah mister Weller says the general l m n in the chair glad to see you sir how are you Wery well thank ee Sir says my father I hope you re pretty middlin says he Pretty well thank ee Sir says the general l m n sit down mister Weller pray sit down sir So my father sits down and he and the general l m n looks wery hard at each other You don t remember me said the general l m n Can t say I do says my father Oh I know you says the general l m n know d you when you was a boy says he Well I don t remember you says my father That s wery odd says the general l m n Wery says my father You must have a bad mem ry mister Weller says the general l m n Well it is a wery bad un says my father I thought so says the general l m n So then they pours him out a glass of wine and gammons him about his driving and gets him into a reg lar good humour and at last shoves a twenty pound note into his hand It s a wery bad road between this and London says the general l m n Here and there it is a heavy road says my father Specially near the canal I think says the general l m n Nasty bit that ere says my father Well mister Weller says the general l m n you re a wery good whip and can do what you like with your horses we know We re all wery fond o you mister Weller so in case you should have an accident when you re bringing these here woters down and should tip em over into the canal vithout hurtin of em this is for yourself says he general l m n you re wery kind says my father and I ll drink your health in another glass of wine says he vich he did and then buttons up the money and bows himself out You wouldn t believe sir continued Sam with a look of inexpressible impudence at his master that on the wery day as he came down with them woters his coach WAS upset on that ere wery spot and ev ry man on em was turned into the canal And got out again inquired mister Pickwick hastily Why replied Sam very slowly I rather think one old general l m n was missin I know his hat was found but I ain t quite certain whether his head was in it or not But what I look at is the hex traordinary and wonderful coincidence that arter what that general l m n said my father s coach should be upset in that wery place and on that wery day it is no doubt a very extraordinary circumstance indeed said mister Pickwick But brush my hat Sam for I hear mister Winkle calling me to breakfast With these words mister Pickwick descended to the parlour where he found breakfast laid and the family already assembled The meal was hastily despatched each of the gentlemen s hats was decorated with an enormous blue favour made up by the fair hands of missus Pott herself and as mister Winkle had undertaken to escort that lady to a house top in the immediate vicinity of the hustings mister Pickwick and mister Pott repaired alone to the Town Arms from the back window of which one of mister Slumkey s committee was addressing six small boys and one girl whom he dignified at every second sentence with the imposing title of Men of Eatanswill whereat the six small boys aforesaid cheered prodigiously The stable yard exhibited unequivocal symptoms of the glory and strength of the Eatanswill Blues There was a regular army of blue flags some with one handle and some with two exhibiting appropriate devices in golden characters four feet high and stout in proportion There was a grand band of trumpets bassoons and drums marshalled four abreast and earning their money if ever men did especially the drum beaters who were very muscular There were bodies of constables with blue staves twenty committee men with blue scarfs and a mob of voters with blue cockades There were electors on horseback and electors afoot There was an open carriage and four for the Honourable Samuel Slumkey and there were four carriage and pair for his friends and supporters and the flags were rustling and the band was playing and the constables were swearing and the twenty committee men were squabbling and the mob were shouting and the horses were backing and the post boys perspiring and everybody and everything then and there assembled was for the special use behoof honour and renown of the Honourable Samuel Slumkey of Slumkey Hall one of the candidates for the representation of the borough of Eatanswill in the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom Loud and long were the cheers and mighty was the rustling of one of the blue flags with Liberty of the Press inscribed thereon when the sandy head of mister Pott was discerned in one of the windows by the mob beneath and tremendous was the enthusiasm when the Honourable Samuel Slumkey himself in top boots and a blue neckerchief advanced and seized the hand of the said Pott and melodramatically testified by gestures to the crowd his ineffaceable obligations to the Eatanswill GAZETTE Is everything ready said the Honourable Samuel Slumkey to mister Perker Everything my dear Sir was the little man s reply Nothing has been omitted I hope said the Honourable Samuel Slumkey Nothing has been left undone my dear sir nothing whatever There are twenty washed men at the street door for you to shake hands with and six children in arms that you re to pat on the head and inquire the age of be particular about the children my dear sir it has always a great effect that sort of thing I ll take care said the Honourable Samuel Slumkey And perhaps my dear Sir said the cautious little man perhaps if you could I don t mean to say it s indispensable but if you could manage to kiss one of em it would produce a very great impression on the crowd Wouldn t it have as good an effect if the proposer or seconder did that said the Honourable Samuel Slumkey Why I am afraid it wouldn t replied the agent if it were done by yourself my dear Sir I think it would make you very popular Very well said the Honourable Samuel Slumkey with a resigned air then it must be done That s all Arrange the procession cried the twenty committee men Amidst the cheers of the assembled throng the band and the constables and the committee men and the voters and the horsemen and the carriages took their places each of the two horse vehicles being closely packed with as many gentlemen as could manage to stand upright in it and that assigned to mister Perker containing mister Pickwick mister Tupman mister Snodgrass and about half a dozen of the committee besides There was a moment of awful suspense as the procession waited for the Honourable Samuel Slumkey to step into his carriage Suddenly the crowd set up a great cheering He has come out said little mister Perker greatly excited the more so as their position did not enable them to see what was going forward Another cheer much louder He has shaken hands with the men cried the little agent Another cheer far more vehement He has patted the babies on the head said mister Perker trembling with anxiety A roar of applause that rent the air He has kissed one of em exclaimed the delighted little man A second roar He has kissed another gasped the excited manager A third roar He s kissing em all screamed the enthusiastic little gentleman and hailed by the deafening shouts of the multitude the procession moved on How or by what means it became mixed up with the other procession and how it was ever extricated from the confusion consequent thereupon is more than we can undertake to describe inasmuch as mister Pickwick s hat was knocked over his eyes nose and mouth by one poke of a Buff flag staff very early in the proceedings He describes himself as being surrounded on every side when he could catch a glimpse of the scene by angry and ferocious countenances by a vast cloud of dust and by a dense crowd of combatants He represents himself as being forced from the carriage by some unseen power and being personally engaged in a pugilistic encounter but with whom or how or why he is wholly unable to state He then felt himself forced up some wooden steps by the persons from behind and on removing his hat found himself surrounded by his friends in the very front of the left hand side of the hustings The right was reserved for the Buff party and the centre for the mayor and his officers one of whom the fat crier of Eatanswill was ringing an enormous bell by way of commanding silence while mister Horatio Fizkin and the Honourable Samuel Slumkey with their hands upon their hearts were bowing with the utmost affability to the troubled sea of heads that inundated the open space in front and from whence arose a storm of groans and shouts and yells and hootings that would have done honour to an earthquake There s Winkle said mister Tupman pulling his friend by the sleeve Where said mister Pickwick putting on his spectacles which he had fortunately kept in his pocket hitherto There said mister Tupman on the top of that house And there sure enough in the leaden gutter of a tiled roof were mister Winkle and missus Pott comfortably seated in a couple of chairs waving their handkerchiefs in token of recognition a compliment which mister Pickwick returned by kissing his hand to the lady The proceedings had not yet commenced and as an inactive crowd is generally disposed to be jocose this very innocent action was sufficient to awaken their facetiousness Oh you wicked old rascal cried one voice looking arter the girls are you Oh you wenerable sinner cried another Putting on his spectacles to look at a married ooman said a third I see him a winkin at her with his wicked old eye shouted a fourth Look arter your wife Pott bellowed a fifth and then there was a roar of laughter As these taunts were accompanied with invidious comparisons between mister Pickwick and an aged ram and several witticisms of the like nature and as they moreover rather tended to convey reflections upon the honour of an innocent lady mister Pickwick s indignation was excessive but as silence was proclaimed at the moment he contented himself by scorching the mob with a look of pity for their misguided minds at which they laughed more boisterously than ever Silence roared the mayor s attendants Whiffin proclaim silence said the mayor with an air of pomp befitting his lofty station In obedience to this command the crier performed another concerto on the bell whereupon a gentleman in the crowd called out Muffins which occasioned another laugh Gentlemen said the mayor at as loud a pitch as he could possibly force his voice to gentlemen Brother electors of the borough of Eatanswill We are met here to day for the purpose of choosing a representative in the room of our late Here the mayor was interrupted by a voice in the crowd Suc cess to the mayor cried the voice and may he never desert the nail and sarspan business as he got his money by This allusion to the professional pursuits of the orator was received with a storm of delight which with a bell accompaniment rendered the remainder of his speech inaudible with the exception of the concluding sentence in which he thanked the meeting for the patient attention with which they heard him throughout an expression of gratitude which elicited another burst of mirth of about a quarter of an hour s duration Next a tall thin gentleman in a very stiff white neckerchief after being repeatedly desired by the crowd to send a boy home to ask whether he hadn t left his voice under the pillow begged to nominate a fit and proper person to represent them in Parliament And when he said it was Horatio Fizkin Esquire of Fizkin Lodge near Eatanswill the Fizkinites applauded and the Slumkeyites groaned so long and so loudly that both he and the seconder might have sung comic songs in lieu of speaking without anybody s being a bit the wiser The friends of Horatio Fizkin Esquire having had their innings a little choleric pink faced man stood forward to propose another fit and proper person to represent the electors of Eatanswill in Parliament and very swimmingly the pink faced gentleman would have got on if he had not been rather too choleric to entertain a sufficient perception of the fun of the crowd But after a very few sentences of figurative eloquence the pink faced gentleman got from denouncing those who interrupted him in the mob to exchanging defiances with the gentlemen on the hustings whereupon arose an uproar which reduced him to the necessity of expressing his feelings by serious pantomime which he did and then left the stage to his seconder who delivered a written speech of half an hour s length and wouldn t be stopped because he had sent it all to the Eatanswill GAZETTE and the Eatanswill GAZETTE had already printed it every word Then Horatio Fizkin Esquire of Fizkin Lodge near Eatanswill presented himself for the purpose of addressing the electors which he no sooner did than the band employed by the Honourable Samuel Slumkey commenced performing with a power to which their strength in the morning was a trifle in return for which the Buff crowd belaboured the heads and shoulders of the Blue crowd on which the Blue crowd endeavoured to dispossess themselves of their very unpleasant neighbours the Buff crowd and a scene of struggling and pushing and fighting succeeded to which we can no more do justice than the mayor could although he issued imperative orders to twelve constables to seize the ringleaders who might amount in number to two hundred and fifty or thereabouts At all these encounters Horatio Fizkin Esquire of Fizkin Lodge and his friends waxed fierce and furious until at last Horatio Fizkin Esquire of Fizkin Lodge begged to ask his opponent the Honourable Samuel Slumkey of Slumkey Hall whether that band played by his consent which question the Honourable Samuel Slumkey declining to answer Horatio Fizkin Esquire of Fizkin Lodge shook his fist in the countenance of the Honourable Samuel Slumkey of Slumkey Hall upon which the Honourable Samuel Slumkey his blood being up defied Horatio Fizkin Esquire to mortal combat At this violation of all known rules and precedents of order the mayor commanded another fantasia on the bell and declared that he would bring before himself both Horatio Fizkin Esquire of Fizkin Lodge and the Honourable Samuel Slumkey of Slumkey Hall and bind them over to keep the peace Upon this terrific denunciation the supporters of the two candidates interfered and after the friends of each party had quarrelled in pairs for three quarters of an hour Horatio Fizkin Esquire touched his hat to the Honourable Samuel Slumkey the Honourable Samuel Slumkey touched his to Horatio Fizkin Esquire the band was stopped the crowd were partially quieted and Horatio Fizkin Esquire was permitted to proceed The speeches of the two candidates though differing in every other respect afforded a beautiful tribute to the merit and high worth of the electors of Eatanswill Both expressed their opinion that a more independent a more enlightened a more public spirited a more noble minded a more disinterested set of men than those who had promised to vote for him never existed on earth each darkly hinted his suspicions that the electors in the opposite interest had certain swinish and besotted infirmities which rendered them unfit for the exercise of the important duties they were called upon to discharge Fizkin expressed his readiness to do anything he was wanted Slumkey his determination to do nothing that was asked of him Both said that the trade the manufactures the commerce the prosperity of Eatanswill would ever be dearer to their hearts than any earthly object and each had it in his power to state with the utmost confidence that he was the man who would eventually be returned There was a show of hands the mayor decided in favour of the Honourable Samuel Slumkey of Slumkey Hall Horatio Fizkin Esquire of Fizkin Lodge demanded a poll and a poll was fixed accordingly Then a vote of thanks was moved to the mayor for his able conduct in the chair and the mayor devoutly wishing that he had had a chair to display his able conduct in for he had been standing during the whole proceedings returned thanks The processions reformed the carriages rolled slowly through the crowd and its members screeched and shouted after them as their feelings or caprice dictated During the whole time of the polling the town was in a perpetual fever of excitement Everything was conducted on the most liberal and delightful scale Excisable articles were remarkably cheap at all the public houses and spring vans paraded the streets for the accommodation of voters who were seized with any temporary dizziness in the head an epidemic which prevailed among the electors during the contest to a most alarming extent and under the influence of which they might frequently be seen lying on the pavements in a state of utter insensibility A small body of electors remained unpolled on the very last day They were calculating and reflecting persons who had not yet been convinced by the arguments of either party although they had frequent conferences with each One hour before the close of the poll mister Perker solicited the honour of a private interview with these intelligent these noble these patriotic men It was granted His arguments were brief but satisfactory They went in a body to the poll and when they returned the Honourable Samuel Slumkey of Slumkey Hall was returned also CHAPTER XIV COMPRISING A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY AT THE PEACOCK ASSEMBLED AND A TALE TOLD BY A BAGMAN It is pleasant to turn from contemplating the strife and turmoil of political existence to the peaceful repose of private life Although in reality no great partisan of either side mister Pickwick was sufficiently fired with mister Pott s enthusiasm to apply his whole time and attention to the proceedings of which the last chapter affords a description compiled from his own memoranda Nor while he was thus occupied was mister Winkle idle his whole time being devoted to pleasant walks and short country excursions with missus Pott who never failed when such an opportunity presented itself to seek some relief from the tedious monotony she so constantly complained of The two gentlemen being thus completely domesticated in the editor s house mister Tupman and mister Snodgrass were in a great measure cast upon their own resources Taking but little interest in public affairs they beguiled their time chiefly with such amusements as the Peacock afforded which were limited to a bagatelle board in the first floor and a sequestered skittle ground in the back yard In the science and nicety of both these recreations which are far more abstruse than ordinary men suppose they were gradually initiated by mister Weller who possessed a perfect knowledge of such pastimes Thus notwithstanding that they were in a great measure deprived of the comfort and advantage of mister Pickwick s society they were still enabled to beguile the time and to prevent its hanging heavily on their hands It was in the evening however that the Peacock presented attractions which enabled the two friends to resist even the invitations of the gifted though prosy Pott It was in the evening that the commercial room was filled with a social circle whose characters and manners it was the delight of mister Tupman to observe whose sayings and doings it was the habit of mister Snodgrass to note down Most people know what sort of places commercial rooms usually are That of the Peacock differed in no material respect from the generality of such apartments that is to say it was a large bare looking room the furniture of which had no doubt been better when it was newer with a spacious table in the centre and a variety of smaller dittos in the corners an extensive assortment of variously shaped chairs and an old Turkey carpet bearing about the same relative proportion to the size of the room as a lady s pocket handkerchief might to the floor of a watch box The walls were garnished with one or two large maps and several weather beaten rough greatcoats with complicated capes dangled from a long row of pegs in one corner The mantel shelf was ornamented with a wooden inkstand containing one stump of a pen and half a wafer a road book and directory a county history minus the cover and the mortal remains of a trout in a glass coffin The atmosphere was redolent of tobacco smoke the fumes of which had communicated a rather dingy hue to the whole room and more especially to the dusty red curtains which shaded the windows On the sideboard a variety of miscellaneous articles were huddled together the most conspicuous of which were some very cloudy fish sauce cruets a couple of driving boxes two or three whips and as many travelling shawls a tray of knives and forks and the mustard Here it was that mister Tupman and mister Snodgrass were seated on the evening after the conclusion of the election with several other temporary inmates of the house smoking and drinking Well gents said a stout hale personage of about forty with only one eye a very bright black eye which twinkled with a roguish expression of fun and good humour our noble selves gents I always propose that toast to the company and drink Mary to myself Eh Mary Get along with you you wretch said the hand maiden obviously not ill pleased with the compliment however Don t go away Mary said the black eyed man Let me alone imperence said the young lady Never mind said the one eyed man calling after the girl as she left the room I ll step out by and by Mary Keep your spirits up dear Here he went through the not very difficult process of winking upon the company with his solitary eye to the enthusiastic delight of an elderly personage with a dirty face and a clay pipe Rum creeters is women said the dirty faced man after a pause Ah no mistake about that said a very red faced man behind a cigar After this little bit of philosophy there was another pause There s rummer things than women in this world though mind you said the man with the black eye slowly filling a large Dutch pipe with a most capacious bowl Are you married inquired the dirty faced man Can t say I am I thought not Here the dirty faced man fell into ecstasies of mirth at his own retort in which he was joined by a man of bland voice and placid countenance who always made it a point to agree with everybody Women after all gentlemen said the enthusiastic mister Snodgrass are the great props and comforts of our existence So they are said the placid gentleman When they re in a good humour interposed the dirty faced man And that s very true said the placid one I repudiate that qualification said mister Snodgrass whose thoughts were fast reverting to Emily Wardle I repudiate it with disdain with indignation Show me the man who says anything against women as women and I boldly declare he is not a man And mister Snodgrass took his cigar from his mouth and struck the table violently with his clenched fist That s good sound argument said the placid man Containing a position which I deny interrupted he of the dirty countenance And there s certainly a very great deal of truth in what you observe too Sir said the placid gentleman Your health Sir said the bagman with the lonely eye bestowing an approving nod on mister Snodgrass mister Snodgrass acknowledged the compliment I always like to hear a good argument continued the bagman a sharp one like this it s very improving but this little argument about women brought to my mind a story I have heard an old uncle of mine tell the recollection of which just now made me say there were rummer things than women to be met with sometimes I should like to hear that same story said the red faced man with the cigar Should you was the only reply of the bagman who continued to smoke with great vehemence So should I said mister Tupman speaking for the first time He was always anxious to increase his stock of experience Should YOU Well then I ll tell it No I won t I know you won t believe it said the man with the roguish eye making that organ look more roguish than ever If you say it s true of course I shall said mister Tupman Well upon that understanding I ll tell you replied the traveller Did you ever hear of the great commercial house of Bilson Slum But it doesn t matter though whether you did or not because they retired from business long since It s eighty years ago since the circumstance happened to a traveller for that house but he was a particular friend of my uncle s and my uncle told the story to me It s a queer name but he used to call it THE BAGMAN S STORY and he used to tell it something in this way One winter s evening about five o clock just as it began to grow dusk a man in a gig might have been seen urging his tired horse along the road which leads across Marlborough Downs in the direction of Bristol I say he might have been seen and I have no doubt he would have been if anybody but a blind man had happened to pass that way but the weather was so bad and the night so cold and wet that nothing was out but the water and so the traveller jogged along in the middle of the road lonesome and dreary enough If any bagman of that day could have caught sight of the little neck or nothing sort of gig with a clay coloured body and red wheels and the vixenish ill tempered fast going bay mare that looked like a cross between a butcher s horse and a twopenny post office pony he would have known at once that this traveller could have been no other than Tom Smart of the great house of Bilson and Slum Cateaton Street City However as there was no bagman to look on nobody knew anything at all about the matter and so Tom Smart and his clay coloured gig with the red wheels and the vixenish mare with the fast pace went on together keeping the secret among them and nobody was a bit the wiser There are many pleasanter places even in this dreary world than Marlborough Downs when it blows hard and if you throw in beside a gloomy winter s evening a miry and sloppy road and a pelting fall of heavy rain and try the effect by way of experiment in your own proper person you will experience the full force of this observation The wind blew not up the road or down it though that s bad enough but sheer across it sending the rain slanting down like the lines they used to rule in the copy books at school to make the boys slope well For a moment it would die away and the traveller would begin to delude himself into the belief that exhausted with its previous fury it had quietly laid itself down to rest when whoo he could hear it growling and whistling in the distance and on it would come rushing over the hill tops and sweeping along the plain gathering sound and strength as it drew nearer until it dashed with a heavy gust against horse and man driving the sharp rain into their ears and its cold damp breath into their very bones and past them it would scour far far away with a stunning roar as if in ridicule of their weakness and triumphant in the consciousness of its own strength and power The bay mare splashed away through the mud and water with drooping ears now and then tossing her head as if to express her disgust at this very ungentlemanly behaviour of the elements but keeping a good pace notwithstanding until a gust of wind more furious than any that had yet assailed them caused her to stop suddenly and plant her four feet firmly against the ground to prevent her being blown over It s a special mercy that she did this for if she HAD been blown over the vixenish mare was so light and the gig was so light and Tom Smart such a light weight into the bargain that they must infallibly have all gone rolling over and over together until they reached the confines of earth or until the wind fell and in either case the probability is that neither the vixenish mare nor the clay coloured gig with the red wheels nor Tom Smart would ever have been fit for service again Well damn my straps and whiskers says Tom Smart Tom sometimes had an unpleasant knack of swearing damn my straps and whiskers says Tom if this ain t pleasant blow me You ll very likely ask me why as Tom Smart had been pretty well blown already he expressed this wish to be submitted to the same process again I can t say all I know is that Tom Smart said so or at least he always told my uncle he said so and it s just the same thing Blow me says Tom Smart and the mare neighed as if she were precisely of the same opinion Cheer up old girl said Tom patting the bay mare on the neck with the end of his whip It won t do pushing on such a night as this the first house we come to we ll put up at so the faster you go the sooner it s over Soho old girl gently gently Whether the vixenish mare was sufficiently well acquainted with the tones of Tom s voice to comprehend his meaning or whether she found it colder standing still than moving on of course I can t say But I can say that Tom had no sooner finished speaking than she pricked up her ears and started forward at a speed which made the clay coloured gig rattle until you would have supposed every one of the red spokes were going to fly out on the turf of Marlborough Downs and even Tom whip as he was couldn t stop or check her pace until she drew up of her own accord before a roadside inn on the right hand side of the way about half a quarter of a mile from the end of the Downs Tom cast a hasty glance at the upper part of the house as he threw the reins to the hostler and stuck the whip in the box It was a strange old place built of a kind of shingle inlaid as it were with cross beams with gabled topped windows projecting completely over the pathway and a low door with a dark porch and a couple of steep steps leading down into the house instead of the modern fashion of half a dozen shallow ones leading up to it It was a comfortable looking place though for there was a strong cheerful light in the bar window which shed a bright ray across the road and even lighted up the hedge on the other side and there was a red flickering light in the opposite window one moment but faintly discernible and the next gleaming strongly through the drawn curtains which intimated that a rousing fire was blazing within Marking these little evidences with the eye of an experienced traveller Tom dismounted with as much agility as his half frozen limbs would permit and entered the house In less than five minutes time Tom was ensconced in the room opposite the bar the very room where he had imagined the fire blazing before a substantial matter of fact roaring fire composed of something short of a bushel of coals and wood enough to make half a dozen decent gooseberry bushes piled half way up the chimney and roaring and crackling with a sound that of itself would have warmed the heart of any reasonable man This was comfortable but this was not all for a smartly dressed girl with a bright eye and a neat ankle was laying a very clean white cloth on the table and as Tom sat with his slippered feet on the fender and his back to the open door he saw a charming prospect of the bar reflected in the glass over the chimney piece with delightful rows of green bottles and gold labels together with jars of pickles and preserves and cheeses and boiled hams and rounds of beef arranged on shelves in the most tempting and delicious array Well this was comfortable too but even this was not all for in the bar seated at tea at the nicest possible little table drawn close up before the brightest possible little fire was a buxom widow of somewhere about eight and forty or thereabouts with a face as comfortable as the bar who was evidently the landlady of the house and the supreme ruler over all these agreeable possessions There was only one drawback to the beauty of the whole picture and that was a tall man a very tall man in a brown coat and bright basket buttons and black whiskers and wavy black hair who was seated at tea with the widow and who it required no great penetration to discover was in a fair way of persuading her to be a widow no longer but to confer upon him the privilege of sitting down in that bar for and during the whole remainder of the term of his natural life Tom Smart was by no means of an irritable or envious disposition but somehow or other the tall man with the brown coat and the bright basket buttons did rouse what little gall he had in his composition and did make him feel extremely indignant the more especially as he could now and then observe from his seat before the glass certain little affectionate familiarities passing between the tall man and the widow which sufficiently denoted that the tall man was as high in favour as he was in size Tom was fond of hot punch I may venture to say he was VERY fond of hot punch and after he had seen the vixenish mare well fed and well littered down and had eaten every bit of the nice little hot dinner which the widow tossed up for him with her own hands he just ordered a tumbler of it by way of experiment Now if there was one thing in the whole range of domestic art which the widow could manufacture better than another it was this identical article and the first tumbler was adapted to Tom Smart s taste with such peculiar nicety that he ordered a second with the least possible delay Hot punch is a pleasant thing gentlemen an extremely pleasant thing under any circumstances but in that snug old parlour before the roaring fire with the wind blowing outside till every timber in the old house creaked again Tom Smart found it perfectly delightful He ordered another tumbler and then another I am not quite certain whether he didn t order another after that but the more he drank of the hot punch the more he thought of the tall man Confound his impudence said Tom to himself what business has he in that snug bar Such an ugly villain too said Tom If the widow had any taste she might surely pick up some better fellow than that Here Tom s eye wandered from the glass on the chimney piece to the glass on the table and as he felt himself becoming gradually sentimental he emptied the fourth tumbler of punch and ordered a fifth Tom Smart gentlemen had always been very much attached to the public line It had been long his ambition to stand in a bar of his own in a green coat knee cords and tops He had a great notion of taking the chair at convivial dinners and he had often thought how well he could preside in a room of his own in the talking way and what a capital example he could set to his customers in the drinking department All these things passed rapidly through Tom s mind as he sat drinking the hot punch by the roaring fire and he felt very justly and properly indignant that the tall man should be in a fair way of keeping such an excellent house while he Tom Smart was as far off from it as ever So after deliberating over the two last tumblers whether he hadn t a perfect right to pick a quarrel with the tall man for having contrived to get into the good graces of the buxom widow Tom Smart at last arrived at the satisfactory conclusion that he was a very ill used and persecuted individual and had better go to bed Up a wide and ancient staircase the smart girl preceded Tom shading the chamber candle with her hand to protect it from the currents of air which in such a rambling old place might have found plenty of room to disport themselves in without blowing the candle out but which did blow it out nevertheless thus affording Tom s enemies an opportunity of asserting that it was he and not the wind who extinguished the candle and that while he pretended to be blowing it alight again he was in fact kissing the girl Be this as it may another light was obtained and Tom was conducted through a maze of rooms and a labyrinth of passages to the apartment which had been prepared for his reception where the girl bade him good night and left him alone It was a good large room with big closets and a bed which might have served for a whole boarding school to say nothing of a couple of oaken presses that would have held the baggage of a small army but what struck Tom s fancy most was a strange grim looking high backed chair carved in the most fantastic manner with a flowered damask cushion and the round knobs at the bottom of the legs carefully tied up in red cloth as if it had got the gout in its toes Of any other queer chair Tom would only have thought it was a queer chair and there would have been an end of the matter but there was something about this particular chair and yet he couldn t tell what it was so odd and so unlike any other piece of furniture he had ever seen that it seemed to fascinate him He sat down before the fire and stared at the old chair for half an hour Damn the chair it was such a strange old thing he couldn t take his eyes off it Well said Tom slowly undressing himself and staring at the old chair all the while which stood with a mysterious aspect by the bedside I never saw such a rum concern as that in my days Very odd said Tom who had got rather sage with the hot punch very odd Tom shook his head with an air of profound wisdom and looked at the chair again He couldn t make anything of it though so he got into bed covered himself up warm and fell asleep In about half an hour Tom woke up with a start from a confused dream of tall men and tumblers of punch and the first object that presented itself to his waking imagination was the queer chair I won t look at it any more said Tom to himself and he squeezed his eyelids together and tried to persuade himself he was going to sleep again No use nothing but queer chairs danced before his eyes kicking up their legs jumping over each other s backs and playing all kinds of antics I may as well see one real chair as two or three complete sets of false ones said Tom bringing out his head from under the bedclothes There it was plainly discernible by the light of the fire looking as provoking as ever Tom gazed at the chair and suddenly as he looked at it a most extraordinary change seemed to come over it The carving of the back gradually assumed the lineaments and expression of an old shrivelled human face the damask cushion became an antique flapped waistcoat the round knobs grew into a couple of feet encased in red cloth slippers and the whole chair looked like a very ugly old man of the previous century with his arms akimbo Tom sat up in bed and rubbed his eyes to dispel the illusion No The chair was an ugly old gentleman and what was more he was winking at Tom Smart Tom was naturally a headlong careless sort of dog and he had had five tumblers of hot punch into the bargain so although he was a little startled at first he began to grow rather indignant when he saw the old gentleman winking and leering at him with such an impudent air At length he resolved that he wouldn t stand it and as the old face still kept winking away as fast as ever Tom said in a very angry tone What the devil are you winking at me for Because I like it Tom Smart said the chair or the old gentleman whichever you like to call him He stopped winking though when Tom spoke and began grinning like a superannuated monkey How do you know my name old nut cracker face inquired Tom Smart rather staggered though he pretended to carry it off so well Come come Tom said the old gentleman that s not the way to address solid Spanish mahogany Damme you couldn t treat me with less respect if I was veneered When the old gentleman said this he looked so fierce that Tom began to grow frightened I didn t mean to treat you with any disrespect Sir said Tom in a much humbler tone than he had spoken in at first Well well said the old fellow perhaps not perhaps not Tom Sir I know everything about you Tom everything You re very poor Tom I certainly am said Tom Smart But how came you to know that Never mind that said the old gentleman you re much too fond of punch Tom Tom Smart was just on the point of protesting that he hadn t tasted a drop since his last birthday but when his eye encountered that of the old gentleman he looked so knowing that Tom blushed and was silent Tom said the old gentleman the widow s a fine woman remarkably fine woman eh Tom Here the old fellow screwed up his eyes cocked up one of his wasted little legs and looked altogether so unpleasantly amorous that Tom was quite disgusted with the levity of his behaviour at his time of life too I am her guardian Tom said the old gentleman Are you inquired Tom Smart I knew her mother Tom said the old fellow and her grandmother She was very fond of me made me this waistcoat Tom Did she said Tom Smart And these shoes said the old fellow lifting up one of the red cloth mufflers but don t mention it Tom I shouldn t like to have it known that she was so much attached to me It might occasion some unpleasantness in the family When the old rascal said this he looked so extremely impertinent that as Tom Smart afterwards declared he could have sat upon him without remorse I have been a great favourite among the women in my time Tom said the profligate old debauchee hundreds of fine women have sat in my lap for hours together What do you think of that you dog eh The old gentleman was proceeding to recount some other exploits of his youth when he was seized with such a violent fit of creaking that he was unable to proceed Just serves you right old boy thought Tom Smart but he didn t say anything Ah said the old fellow I am a good deal troubled with this now I am getting old Tom and have lost nearly all my rails I have had an operation performed too a small piece let into my back and I found it a severe trial Tom I dare say you did Sir said Tom Smart However said the old gentleman that s not the point Tom I want you to marry the widow Me Sir said Tom You said the old gentleman Bless your reverend locks said Tom he had a few scattered horse hairs left bless your reverend locks she wouldn t have me And Tom sighed involuntarily as he thought of the bar Wouldn t she said the old gentleman firmly No no said Tom there s somebody else in the wind A tall man a confoundedly tall man with black whiskers Tom said the old gentleman she will never have him Won t she said Tom If you stood in the bar old gentleman you d tell another story Pooh pooh said the old gentleman I know all about that About what said Tom The kissing behind the door and all that sort of thing Tom said the old gentleman And here he gave another impudent look which made Tom very wroth because as you all know gentlemen to hear an old fellow who ought to know better talking about these things is very unpleasant nothing more so I know all about that Tom said the old gentleman I have seen it done very often in my time Tom between more people than I should like to mention to you but it never came to anything after all You must have seen some queer things said Tom with an inquisitive look You may say that Tom replied the old fellow with a very complicated wink I am the last of my family Tom said the old gentleman with a melancholy sigh Was it a large one inquired Tom Smart There were twelve of us Tom said the old gentleman fine straight backed handsome fellows as you d wish to see None of your modern abortions all with arms and with a degree of polish though I say it that should not which it would have done your heart good to behold And what s become of the others Sir asked Tom Smart The old gentleman applied his elbow to his eye as he replied Gone Tom gone We had hard service Tom and they hadn t all my constitution They got rheumatic about the legs and arms and went into kitchens and other hospitals and one of em with long service and hard usage positively lost his senses he got so crazy that he was obliged to be burnt Shocking thing that Tom Dreadful said Tom Smart The old fellow paused for a few minutes apparently struggling with his feelings of emotion and then said However Tom I am wandering from the point This tall man Tom is a rascally adventurer The moment he married the widow he would sell off all the furniture and run away What would be the consequence She would be deserted and reduced to ruin and I should catch my death of cold in some broker s shop Yes but Don t interrupt me said the old gentleman Of you Tom I entertain a very different opinion for I well know that if you once settled yourself in a public house you would never leave it as long as there was anything to drink within its walls I am very much obliged to you for your good opinion Sir said Tom Smart Therefore resumed the old gentleman in a dictatorial tone you shall have her and he shall not What is to prevent it said Tom Smart eagerly This disclosure replied the old gentleman he is already married How can I prove it said Tom starting half out of bed The old gentleman untucked his arm from his side and having pointed to one of the oaken presses immediately replaced it in its old position He little thinks said the old gentleman that in the right hand pocket of a pair of trousers in that press he has left a letter entreating him to return to his disconsolate wife with six mark me Tom six babes and all of them small ones As the old gentleman solemnly uttered these words his features grew less and less distinct and his figure more shadowy A film came over Tom Smart s eyes The old man seemed gradually blending into the chair the damask waistcoat to resolve into a cushion the red slippers to shrink into little red cloth bags The light faded gently away and Tom Smart fell back on his pillow and dropped asleep Morning aroused Tom from the lethargic slumber into which he had fallen on the disappearance of the old man He sat up in bed and for some minutes vainly endeavoured to recall the events of the preceding night Suddenly they rushed upon him He looked at the chair it was a fantastic and grim looking piece of furniture certainly but it must have been a remarkably ingenious and lively imagination that could have discovered any resemblance between it and an old man How are you old boy said Tom He was bolder in the daylight most men are The chair remained motionless and spoke not a word Miserable morning said Tom No The chair would not be drawn into conversation Which press did you point to you can tell me that said Tom Devil a word gentlemen the chair would say It s not much trouble to open it anyhow said Tom getting out of bed very deliberately He walked up to one of the presses The key was in the lock he turned it and opened the door There was a pair of trousers there He put his hand into the pocket and drew forth the identical letter the old gentleman had described Queer sort of thing this said Tom Smart looking first at the chair and then at the press and then at the letter and then at the chair again Very queer said Tom But as there was nothing in either to lessen the queerness he thought he might as well dress himself and settle the tall man s business at once just to put him out of his misery Tom surveyed the rooms he passed through on his way downstairs with the scrutinising eye of a landlord thinking it not impossible that before long they and their contents would be his property The tall man was standing in the snug little bar with his hands behind him quite at home He grinned vacantly at Tom A casual observer might have supposed he did it only to show his white teeth but Tom Smart thought that a consciousness of triumph was passing through the place where the tall man s mind would have been if he had had any Tom laughed in his face and summoned the landlady Good morning ma am said Tom Smart closing the door of the little parlour as the widow entered Good morning Sir said the widow What will you take for breakfast sir Tom was thinking how he should open the case so he made no answer There s a very nice ham said the widow and a beautiful cold larded fowl Shall I send em in Sir These words roused Tom from his reflections His admiration of the widow increased as she spoke Thoughtful creature Comfortable provider 
1265_135636_000055_000001	train-clean-360	Who is that 
none	none	gentleman in the bar ma am inquired Tom His name is Jinkins Sir said the widow slightly blushing He s a tall man said Tom He is a very fine man Sir replied the widow and a very nice gentleman Ah said Tom Is there anything more you want Sir inquired the widow rather puzzled by Tom s manner Why yes said Tom My dear ma am will you have the kindness to sit down for one moment The widow looked much amazed but she sat down and Tom sat down too close beside her I don t know how it happened gentlemen indeed my uncle used to tell me that Tom Smart said he didn t know how it happened either but somehow or other the palm of Tom s hand fell upon the back of the widow s hand and remained there while he spoke My dear ma am said Tom Smart he had always a great notion of committing the amiable my dear ma am you deserve a very excellent husband you do indeed Lor Sir said the widow as well she might Tom s mode of commencing the conversation being rather unusual not to say startling the fact of his never having set eyes upon her before the previous night being taken into consideration Lor Sir I scorn to flatter my dear ma am said Tom Smart You deserve a very admirable husband and whoever he is he ll be a very lucky man As Tom said this his eye involuntarily wandered from the widow s face to the comfort around him The widow looked more puzzled than ever and made an effort to rise Tom gently pressed her hand as if to detain her and she kept her seat Widows gentlemen are not usually timorous as my uncle used to say I am sure I am very much obliged to you Sir for your good opinion said the buxom landlady half laughing and if ever I marry again IF said Tom Smart looking very shrewdly out of the right hand corner of his left eye IF Well said the widow laughing outright this time WHEN I do I hope I shall have as good a husband as you describe Jinkins to wit said Tom Lor sir exclaimed the widow Oh don t tell me said Tom I know him I am sure nobody who knows him knows anything bad of him said the widow bridling up at the mysterious air with which Tom had spoken Hem said Tom Smart The widow began to think it was high time to cry so she took out her handkerchief and inquired whether Tom wished to insult her whether he thought it like a gentleman to take away the character of another gentleman behind his back why if he had got anything to say he didn t say it to the man like a man instead of terrifying a poor weak woman in that way and so forth I ll say it to him fast enough said Tom only I want you to hear it first What is it inquired the widow looking intently in Tom s countenance I ll astonish you said Tom putting his hand in his pocket If it is that he wants money said the widow I know that already and you needn t trouble yourself Pooh nonsense that s nothing said Tom Smart I want money Tain t that Oh dear what can it be exclaimed the poor widow Don t be frightened said Tom Smart He slowly drew forth the letter and unfolded it You won t scream said Tom doubtfully No no replied the widow let me see it You won t go fainting away or any of that nonsense said Tom No no returned the widow hastily And don t run out and blow him up said Tom because I ll do all that for you You had better not exert yourself Well well said the widow let me see it I will replied Tom Smart and with these words he placed the letter in the widow s hand Gentlemen I have heard my uncle say that Tom Smart said the widow s lamentations when she heard the disclosure would have pierced a heart of stone Tom was certainly very tender hearted but they pierced his to the very core The widow rocked herself to and fro and wrung her hands Oh the deception and villainy of the man said the widow Frightful my dear ma am but compose yourself said Tom Smart Oh I can t compose myself shrieked the widow I shall never find anyone else I can love so much Oh yes you will my dear soul said Tom Smart letting fall a shower of the largest sized tears in pity for the widow s misfortunes Tom Smart in the energy of his compassion had put his arm round the widow s waist and the widow in a passion of grief had clasped Tom s hand She looked up in Tom s face and smiled through her tears Tom looked down in hers and smiled through his I never could find out gentlemen whether Tom did or did not kiss the widow at that particular moment He used to tell my uncle he didn t but I have my doubts about it Between ourselves gentlemen I rather think he did At all events Tom kicked the very tall man out at the front door half an hour later and married the widow a month after And he used to drive about the country with the clay coloured gig with the red wheels and the vixenish mare with the fast pace till he gave up business many years afterwards and went to France with his wife and then the old house was pulled down Will you allow me to ask you said the inquisitive old gentleman what became of the chair Why replied the one eyed bagman it was observed to creak very much on the day of the wedding but Tom Smart couldn t say for certain whether it was with pleasure or bodily infirmity He rather thought it was the latter though for it never spoke afterwards Everybody believed the story didn t they said the dirty faced man refilling his pipe Except Tom s enemies replied the bagman Some of em said Tom invented it altogether and others said he was drunk and fancied it and got hold of the wrong trousers by mistake before he went to bed But nobody ever minded what THEY said Tom Smart said it was all true Every word And your uncle Every letter They must have been very nice men both of em said the dirty faced man Yes they were replied the bagman very nice men indeed CHAPTER XV IN WHICH IS GIVEN A FAITHFUL PORTRAITURE OF TWO DISTINGUISHED PERSONS AND AN ACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF A PUBLIC BREAKFAST IN THEIR HOUSE AND GROUNDS WHICH PUBLIC BREAKFAST LEADS TO THE RECOGNITION OF AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE AND THE COMMENCEMENT OF ANOTHER CHAPTER mister Pickwick s conscience had been somewhat reproaching him for his recent neglect of his friends at the Peacock and he was just on the point of walking forth in quest of them on the third morning after the election had terminated when his faithful valet put into his hand a card on which was engraved the following inscription missus Leo Hunter THE DEN EATANSWILL Person s a waitin said Sam epigrammatically Does the person want me Sam inquired mister Pickwick He wants you partickler and no one else ll do as the devil s private secretary said ven he fetched avay Doctor Faustus replied mister Weller HE Is it a gentleman said mister Pickwick A wery good imitation o one if it ain t replied mister Weller But this is a lady s card said mister Pickwick Given me by a general l m n howsoever replied Sam and he s a waitin in the drawing room said he d rather wait all day than not see you mister Pickwick on hearing this determination descended to the drawing room where sat a grave man who started up on his entrance and said with an air of profound respect mister Pickwick I presume The same Allow me Sir the honour of grasping your hand Permit me Sir to shake it said the grave man Certainly said mister Pickwick The stranger shook the extended hand and then continued We have heard of your fame sir The noise of your antiquarian discussion has reached the ears of missus Leo Hunter my wife sir I am mister Leo Hunter the stranger paused as if he expected that mister Pickwick would be overcome by the disclosure but seeing that he remained perfectly calm proceeded My wife sir missus Leo Hunter is proud to number among her acquaintance all those who have rendered themselves celebrated by their works and talents Permit me sir to place in a conspicuous part of the list the name of mister Pickwick and his brother members of the club that derives its name from him I shall be extremely happy to make the acquaintance of such a lady sir replied mister Pickwick You SHALL make it sir said the grave man To morrow morning sir we give a public breakfast a FETE CHAMPETRE to a great number of those who have rendered themselves celebrated by their works and talents Permit missus Leo Hunter Sir to have the gratification of seeing you at the Den With great pleasure replied mister Pickwick missus Leo Hunter has many of these breakfasts Sir resumed the new acquaintance feasts of reason sir and flows of soul as somebody who wrote a sonnet to missus Leo Hunter on her breakfasts feelingly and originally observed Was HE celebrated for his works and talents inquired mister Pickwick He was Sir replied the grave man all missus Leo Hunter s acquaintances are it is her ambition sir to have no other acquaintance It is a very noble ambition said mister Pickwick When I inform missus Leo Hunter that that remark fell from your lips sir she will indeed be proud said the grave man You have a gentleman in your train who has produced some beautiful little poems I think sir My friend mister Snodgrass has a great taste for poetry replied mister Pickwick So has missus Leo Hunter Sir She dotes on poetry sir She adores it I may say that her whole soul and mind are wound up and entwined with it She has produced some delightful pieces herself sir You may have met with her Ode to an Expiring Frog sir I don t think I have said mister Pickwick You astonish me Sir said mister Leo Hunter It created an immense sensation It was signed with an L and eight stars and appeared originally in a lady s magazine It commenced Can I view thee panting lying On thy stomach without sighing Can I unmoved see thee dying On a log Expiring frog Beautiful said mister Pickwick Fine said mister Leo Hunter so simple Very said mister Pickwick The next verse is still more touching Shall I repeat it If you please said mister Pickwick It runs thus said the grave man still more gravely Say have fiends in shape of boys With wild halloo and brutal noise Hunted thee from marshy joys With a dog Expiring frog Finely expressed said mister Pickwick All point Sir said mister Leo Hunter but you shall hear missus Leo Hunter repeat it She can do justice to it Sir She will repeat it in character Sir to morrow morning In character As Minerva But I forgot it s a fancy dress DEJEUNE Dear me said mister Pickwick glancing at his own figure I can t possibly Can t sir can t exclaimed mister Leo Hunter Solomon Lucas the Jew in the High Street has thousands of fancy dresses Consider Sir how many appropriate characters are open for your selection Plato Zeno Epicurus Pythagoras all founders of clubs I know that said mister Pickwick but as I cannot put myself in competition with those great men I cannot presume to wear their dresses The grave man considered deeply for a few seconds and then said On reflection Sir I don t know whether it would not afford missus Leo Hunter greater pleasure if her guests saw a gentleman of your celebrity in his own costume rather than in an assumed one I may venture to promise an exception in your case sir yes I am quite certain that on behalf of missus Leo Hunter I may venture to do so In that case said mister Pickwick I shall have great pleasure in coming But I waste your time Sir said the grave man as if suddenly recollecting himself I know its value sir I will not detain you I may tell missus Leo Hunter then that she may confidently expect you and your distinguished friends Good morning Sir I am proud to have beheld so eminent a personage not a step sir not a word And without giving mister Pickwick time to offer remonstrance or denial mister Leo Hunter stalked gravely away mister Pickwick took up his hat and repaired to the Peacock but mister Winkle had conveyed the intelligence of the fancy ball there before him missus Pott s going were the first words with which he saluted his leader Is she said mister Pickwick As Apollo replied Winkle Only Pott objects to the tunic He is right He is quite right said mister Pickwick emphatically Yes so she s going to wear a white satin gown with gold spangles They ll hardly know what she s meant for will they inquired mister Snodgrass Of course they will replied mister Winkle indignantly They ll see her lyre won t they True I forgot that said mister Snodgrass I shall go as a bandit interposed mister Tupman What said mister Pickwick with a sudden start As a bandit repeated mister Tupman mildly You don t mean to say said mister Pickwick gazing with solemn sternness at his friend you don t mean to say mister Tupman that it is your intention to put yourself into a green velvet jacket with a two inch tail Such IS my intention Sir replied mister Tupman warmly And why not sir Because Sir said mister Pickwick considerably excited because you are too old Sir Too old exclaimed mister Tupman And if any further ground of objection be wanting continued mister Pickwick you are too fat sir Sir said mister Tupman his face suffused with a crimson glow this is an insult Sir replied mister Pickwick in the same tone it is not half the insult to you that your appearance in my presence in a green velvet jacket with a two inch tail would be to me Sir said mister Tupman you re a fellow Sir said mister Pickwick you re another mister Tupman advanced a step or two and glared at mister Pickwick mister Pickwick returned the glare concentrated into a focus by means of his spectacles and breathed a bold defiance mister Snodgrass and mister Winkle looked on petrified at beholding such a scene between two such men Sir said mister Tupman after a short pause speaking in a low deep voice you have called me old I have said mister Pickwick And fat I reiterate the charge And a fellow So you are There was a fearful pause My attachment to your person sir said mister Tupman speaking in a voice tremulous with emotion and tucking up his wristbands meanwhile is great very great but upon that person I must take summary vengeance Come on Sir replied mister Pickwick Stimulated by the exciting nature of the dialogue the heroic man actually threw himself into a paralytic attitude confidently supposed by the two bystanders to have been intended as a posture of defence What exclaimed mister Snodgrass suddenly recovering the power of speech of which intense astonishment had previously bereft him and rushing between the two at the imminent hazard of receiving an application on the temple from each what mister Pickwick with the eyes of the world upon you mister Tupman who in common with us all derives a lustre from his undying name For shame gentlemen for shame The unwonted lines which momentary passion had ruled in mister Pickwick s clear and open brow gradually melted away as his young friend spoke like the marks of a black lead pencil beneath the softening influence of india rubber His countenance had resumed its usual benign expression ere he concluded I have been hasty said mister Pickwick very hasty Tupman your hand The dark shadow passed from mister Tupman s face as he warmly grasped the hand of his friend I have been hasty too said he No no interrupted mister Pickwick the fault was mine You will wear the green velvet jacket No no replied mister Tupman To oblige me you will resumed mister Pickwick Well well I will said mister Tupman It was accordingly settled that mister Tupman mister Winkle and mister Snodgrass should all wear fancy dresses Thus mister Pickwick was led by the very warmth of his own good feelings to give his consent to a proceeding from which his better judgment would have recoiled a more striking illustration of his amiable character could hardly have been conceived even if the events recorded in these pages had been wholly imaginary mister Leo Hunter had not exaggerated the resources of mister Solomon Lucas His wardrobe was extensive very extensive not strictly classical perhaps not quite new nor did it contain any one garment made precisely after the fashion of any age or time but everything was more or less spangled and what can be prettier than spangles It may be objected that they are not adapted to the daylight but everybody knows that they would glitter if there were lamps and nothing can be clearer than that if people give fancy balls in the day time and the dresses do not show quite as well as they would by night the fault lies solely with the people who give the fancy balls and is in no wise chargeable on the spangles Such was the convincing reasoning of mister Solomon Lucas and influenced by such arguments did mister Tupman mister Winkle and mister Snodgrass engage to array themselves in costumes which his taste and experience induced him to recommend as admirably suited to the occasion A carriage was hired from the Town Arms for the accommodation of the Pickwickians and a chariot was ordered from the same repository for the purpose of conveying mister and missus Pott to missus Leo Hunter s grounds which mister Pott as a delicate acknowledgment of having received an invitation had already confidently predicted in the Eatanswill GAZETTE would present a scene of varied and delicious enchantment a bewildering coruscation of beauty and talent a lavish and prodigal display of hospitality above all a degree of splendour softened by the most exquisite taste and adornment refined with perfect harmony and the chastest good keeping compared with which the fabled gorgeousness of Eastern fairyland itself would appear to be clothed in as many dark and murky colours as must be the mind of the splenetic and unmanly being who could presume to taint with the venom of his envy the preparations made by the virtuous and highly distinguished lady at whose shrine this humble tribute of admiration was offered This last was a piece of biting sarcasm against the INDEPENDENT who in consequence of not having been invited at all had been through four numbers affecting to sneer at the whole affair in his very largest type with all the adjectives in capital letters The morning came it was a pleasant sight to behold mister Tupman in full brigand s costume with a very tight jacket sitting like a pincushion over his back and shoulders the upper portion of his legs incased in the velvet shorts and the lower part thereof swathed in the complicated bandages to which all brigands are peculiarly attached It was pleasing to see his open and ingenuous countenance well mustachioed and corked looking out from an open shirt collar and to contemplate the sugar loaf hat decorated with ribbons of all colours which he was compelled to carry on his knee inasmuch as no known conveyance with a top to it would admit of any man s carrying it between his head and the roof Equally humorous and agreeable was the appearance of mister Snodgrass in blue satin trunks and cloak white silk tights and shoes and Grecian helmet which everybody knows and if they do not mister Solomon Lucas did to have been the regular authentic everyday costume of a troubadour from the earliest ages down to the time of their final disappearance from the face of the earth All this was pleasant but this was as nothing compared with the shouting of the populace when the carriage drew up behind mister Pott s chariot which chariot itself drew up at mister Pott s door which door itself opened and displayed the great Pott accoutred as a Russian officer of justice with a tremendous knout in his hand tastefully typical of the stern and mighty power of the Eatanswill GAZETTE and the fearful lashings it bestowed on public offenders Bravo shouted mister Tupman and mister Snodgrass from the passage when they beheld the walking allegory Bravo mister Pickwick was heard to exclaim from the passage Hoo roar Pott shouted the populace Amid these salutations mister Pott smiling with that kind of bland dignity which sufficiently testified that he felt his power and knew how to exert it got into the chariot Then there emerged from the house missus Pott who would have looked very like Apollo if she hadn t had a gown on conducted by mister Winkle who in his light red coat could not possibly have been mistaken for anything but a sportsman if he had not borne an equal resemblance to a general postman Last of all came mister Pickwick whom the boys applauded as loud as anybody probably under the impression that his tights and gaiters were some remnants of the dark ages and then the two vehicles proceeded towards missus Leo Hunter s mister Weller who was to assist in waiting being stationed on the box of that in which his master was seated Every one of the men women boys girls and babies who were assembled to see the visitors in their fancy dresses screamed with delight and ecstasy when mister Pickwick with the brigand on one arm and the troubadour on the other walked solemnly up the entrance Never were such shouts heard as those which greeted mister Tupman s efforts to fix the sugar loaf hat on his head by way of entering the garden in style The preparations were on the most delightful scale fully realising the prophetic Pott s anticipations about the gorgeousness of Eastern fairyland and at once affording a sufficient contradiction to the malignant statements of the reptile INDEPENDENT The grounds were more than an acre and a quarter in extent and they were filled with people Never was such a blaze of beauty and fashion and literature There was the young lady who did the poetry in the Eatanswill GAZETTE in the garb of a sultana leaning upon the arm of the young gentleman who did the review department and who was appropriately habited in a field marshal s uniform the boots excepted There were hosts of these geniuses and any reasonable person would have thought it honour enough to meet them But more than these there were half a dozen lions from London authors real authors who had written whole books and printed them afterwards and here you might see em walking about like ordinary men smiling and talking aye and talking pretty considerable nonsense too no doubt with the benign intention of rendering themselves intelligible to the common people about them Moreover there was a band of music in pasteboard caps four something ean singers in the costume of their country and a dozen hired waiters in the costume of THEIR country and very dirty costume too And above all there was missus Leo Hunter in the character of Minerva receiving the company and overflowing with pride and gratification at the notion of having called such distinguished individuals together mister Pickwick ma am said a servant as that gentleman approached the presiding goddess with his hat in his hand and the brigand and troubadour on either arm What Where exclaimed missus Leo Hunter starting up in an affected rapture of surprise Here said mister Pickwick Is it possible that I have really the gratification of beholding mister Pickwick himself ejaculated missus Leo Hunter No other ma am replied mister Pickwick bowing very low Permit me to introduce my friends mister Tupman mister Winkle mister Snodgrass to the authoress of The Expiring Frog Very few people but those who have tried it know what a difficult process it is to bow in green velvet smalls and a tight jacket and high crowned hat or in blue satin trunks and white silks or knee cords and top boots that were never made for the wearer and have been fixed upon him without the remotest reference to the comparative dimensions of himself and the suit Never were such distortions as mister Tupman s frame underwent in his efforts to appear easy and graceful never was such ingenious posturing as his fancy dressed friends exhibited mister Pickwick said missus Leo Hunter I must make you promise not to stir from my side the whole day There are hundreds of people here that I must positively introduce you to You are very kind ma am said mister Pickwick In the first place here are my little girls I had almost forgotten them said Minerva carelessly pointing towards a couple of full grown young ladies of whom one might be about twenty and the other a year or two older and who were dressed in very juvenile costumes whether to make them look young or their mamma younger mister Pickwick does not distinctly inform us They are very beautiful said mister Pickwick as the juveniles turned away after being presented They are very like their mamma Sir said mister Pott majestically Oh you naughty man exclaimed missus Leo Hunter playfully tapping the editor s arm with her fan Minerva with a fan Why now my dear missus Hunter said mister Pott who was trumpeter in ordinary at the Den you know that when your picture was in the exhibition of the Royal Academy last year everybody inquired whether it was intended for you or your youngest daughter for you were so much alike that there was no telling the difference between you Well and if they did why need you repeat it before strangers said missus Leo Hunter bestowing another tap on the slumbering lion of the Eatanswill GAZETTE Count count screamed missus Leo Hunter to a well whiskered individual in a foreign uniform who was passing by Ah you want me said the count turning back I want to introduce two very clever people to each other said missus Leo Hunter mister Pickwick I have great pleasure in introducing you to Count Smorltork She added in a hurried whisper to mister Pickwick The famous foreigner gathering materials for his great work on England hem Count Smorltork mister Pickwick mister Pickwick saluted the count with all the reverence due to so great a man and the count drew forth a set of tablets What you say missus Hunt inquired the count smiling graciously on the gratified missus Leo Hunter Pig Vig or Big Vig what you call lawyer eh I see that is it Big Vig and the count was proceeding to enter mister Pickwick in his tablets as a gentleman of the long robe who derived his name from the profession to which he belonged when missus Leo Hunter interposed No no count said the lady Pick wick Ah ah I see replied the count Peek christian name Weeks surname good ver good Peek Weeks How you do Weeks Quite well I thank you replied mister Pickwick with all his usual affability Have you been long in England Long ver long time fortnight more Do you stay here long One week You will have enough to do said mister Pickwick smiling to gather all the materials you want in that time Eh they are gathered said the count Indeed said mister Pickwick They are here added the count tapping his forehead significantly Large book at home full of notes music picture science potry poltic all tings The word politics sir said mister Pickwick comprises in itself a difficult study of no inconsiderable magnitude Ah said the count drawing out the tablets again ver good fine words to begin a chapter Chapter forty seven Poltics The word poltic surprises by himself And down went mister Pickwick s remark in Count Smorltork s tablets with such variations and additions as the count s exuberant fancy suggested or his imperfect knowledge of the language occasioned Count said missus Leo Hunter missus Hunt replied the count This is mister Snodgrass a friend of mister Pickwick s and a poet Stop exclaimed the count bringing out the tablets once more Head potry chapter literary friends name Snowgrass ver good Introduced to Snowgrass great poet friend of Peek Weeks by missus Hunt which wrote other sweet poem what is that name Fog Perspiring Fog ver good ver good indeed And the count put up his tablets and with sundry bows and acknowledgments walked away thoroughly satisfied that he had made the most important and valuable additions to his stock of information Wonderful man Count Smorltork said missus Leo Hunter Sound philosopher said mister Pott Clear headed strong minded person added mister Snodgrass A chorus of bystanders took up the shout of Count Smorltork s praise shook their heads sagely and unanimously cried Very As the enthusiasm in Count Smorltork s favour ran very high his praises might have been sung until the end of the festivities if the four something ean singers had not ranged themselves in front of a small apple tree to look picturesque and commenced singing their national songs which appeared by no means difficult of execution inasmuch as the grand secret seemed to be that three of the something ean singers should grunt while the fourth howled This interesting performance having concluded amidst the loud plaudits of the whole company a boy forthwith proceeded to entangle himself with the rails of a chair and to jump over it and crawl under it and fall down with it and do everything but sit upon it and then to make a cravat of his legs and tie them round his neck and then to illustrate the ease with which a human being can be made to look like a magnified toad all which feats yielded high delight and satisfaction to the assembled spectators After which the voice of missus Pott was heard to chirp faintly forth something which courtesy interpreted into a song which was all very classical and strictly in character because Apollo was himself a composer and composers can very seldom sing their own music or anybody else s either This was succeeded by missus Leo Hunter s recitation of her far famed Ode to an Expiring Frog which was encored once and would have been encored twice if the major part of the guests who thought it was high time to get something to eat had not said that it was perfectly shameful to take advantage of missus Hunter s good nature So although missus Leo Hunter professed her perfect willingness to recite the ode again her kind and considerate friends wouldn t hear of it on any account and the refreshment room being thrown open all the people who had ever been there before scrambled in with all possible despatch missus Leo Hunter s usual course of proceedings being to issue cards for a hundred and breakfast for fifty or in other words to feed only the very particular lions and let the smaller animals take care of themselves Where is mister Pott said missus Leo Hunter as she placed the aforesaid lions around her Here I am said the editor from the remotest end of the room far beyond all hope of food unless something was done for him by the hostess Won t you come up here Oh pray don t mind him said missus Pott in the most obliging voice you give yourself a great deal of unnecessary trouble missus Hunter You ll do very well there won t you dear Certainly love replied the unhappy Pott with a grim smile Alas for the knout The nervous arm that wielded it with such a gigantic force on public characters was paralysed beneath the glance of the imperious missus Pott missus Leo Hunter looked round her in triumph Count Smorltork was busily engaged in taking notes of the contents of the dishes mister Tupman was doing the honours of the lobster salad to several lionesses with a degree of grace which no brigand ever exhibited before mister Snodgrass having cut out the young gentleman who cut up the books for the Eatanswill GAZETTE was engaged in an impassioned argument with the young lady who did the poetry and mister Pickwick was making himself universally agreeable Nothing seemed wanting to render the select circle complete when mister Leo Hunter whose department on these occasions was to stand about in doorways and talk to the less important people suddenly called out My dear here s mister Charles Fitz Marshall Oh dear said missus Leo Hunter how anxiously I have been expecting him Pray make room to let mister Fitz Marshall pass Tell mister Fitz Marshall my dear to come up to me directly to be scolded for coming so late Coming my dear ma am cried a voice as quick as I can crowds of people full room hard work very mister Pickwick s knife and fork fell from his hand He stared across the table at mister Tupman who had dropped his knife and fork and was looking as if he were about to sink into the ground without further notice Ah cried the voice as its owner pushed his way among the last five and twenty Turks officers cavaliers and Charles the Seconds that remained between him and the table regular mangle Baker s patent not a crease in my coat after all this squeezing might have got up my linen as I came along ha ha not a bad idea that queer thing to have it mangled when it s upon one though trying process very With these broken words a young man dressed as a naval officer made his way up to the table and presented to the astonished Pickwickians the identical form and features of mister Alfred Jingle The offender had barely time to take missus Leo Hunter s proffered hand when his eyes encountered the indignant orbs of mister Pickwick Hollo said Jingle Quite forgot no directions to postillion give em at once back in a minute The servant or mister Hunter will do it in a moment mister Fitz Marshall said missus Leo Hunter No no I ll do it shan t be long back in no time replied Jingle With these words he disappeared among the crowd Will you allow me to ask you ma am said the excited mister Pickwick rising from his seat who that young man is and where he resides He is a gentleman of fortune mister Pickwick said missus Leo Hunter to whom I very much want to introduce you The count will be delighted with him Yes yes said mister Pickwick hastily His residence Is at present at the Angel at Bury At Bury At Bury saint Edmunds not many miles from here But dear me mister Pickwick you are not going to leave us surely mister Pickwick you cannot think of going so soon But long before missus Leo Hunter had finished speaking mister Pickwick had plunged through the throng and reached the garden whither he was shortly afterwards joined by mister Tupman who had followed his friend closely It s of no use said mister Tupman He has gone I know it said mister Pickwick and I will follow him Follow him Where inquired mister Tupman To the Angel at Bury replied mister Pickwick speaking very quickly How do we know whom he is deceiving there He deceived a worthy man once and we were the innocent cause He shall not do it again if I can help it I ll expose him Sam Where s my servant Here you are Sir said mister Weller emerging from a sequestered spot where he had been engaged in discussing a bottle of Madeira which he had abstracted from the breakfast table an hour or two before Here s your servant Sir Proud o the title as the living skellinton said ven they show d him Follow me instantly said mister Pickwick Tupman if I stay at Bury you can join me there when I write Till then good bye Remonstrances were useless mister Pickwick was roused and his mind was made up mister Tupman returned to his companions and in another hour had drowned all present recollection of mister Alfred Jingle or mister Charles Fitz Marshall in an exhilarating quadrille and a bottle of champagne By that time mister Pickwick and Sam Weller perched on the outside of a stage coach were every succeeding minute placing a less and less distance between themselves and the good old town of Bury saint Edmunds CHAPTER XVI TOO FULL OF ADVENTURE TO BE BRIEFLY DESCRIBED There is no month in the whole year in which nature wears a more beautiful appearance than in the month of August Spring has many beauties and May is a fresh and blooming month but the charms of this time of year are enhanced by their contrast with the winter season August has no such advantage It comes when we remember nothing but clear skies green fields and sweet smelling flowers when the recollection of snow and ice and bleak winds has faded from our minds as completely as they have disappeared from the earth and yet what a pleasant time it is Orchards and cornfields ring with the hum of labour trees bend beneath the thick clusters of rich fruit which bow their branches to the ground and the corn piled in graceful sheaves or waving in every light breath that sweeps above it as if it wooed the sickle tinges the landscape with a golden hue A mellow softness appears to hang over the whole earth the influence of the season seems to extend itself to the very wagon whose slow motion across the well reaped field is perceptible only to the eye but strikes with no harsh sound upon the ear As the coach rolls swiftly past the fields and orchards which skirt the road groups of women and children piling the fruit in sieves or gathering the scattered ears of corn pause for an instant from their labour and shading the sun burned face with a still browner hand gaze upon the passengers with curious eyes while some stout urchin too small to work but too mischievous to be left at home scrambles over the side of the basket in which he has been deposited for security and kicks and screams with delight The reaper stops in his work and stands with folded arms looking at the vehicle as it whirls past and the rough cart horses bestow a sleepy glance upon the smart coach team which says as plainly as a horse s glance can It s all very fine to look at but slow going over a heavy field is better than warm work like that upon a dusty road after all You cast a look behind you as you turn a corner of the road The women and children have resumed their labour the reaper once more stoops to his work the cart horses have moved on and all are again in motion The influence of a scene like this was not lost upon the well regulated mind of mister Pickwick Intent upon the resolution he had formed of exposing the real character of the nefarious Jingle in any quarter in which he might be pursuing his fraudulent designs he sat at first taciturn and contemplative brooding over the means by which his purpose could be best attained By degrees his attention grew more and more attracted by the objects around him and at last he derived as much enjoyment from the ride as if it had been undertaken for the pleasantest reason in the world Delightful prospect Sam said mister Pickwick Beats the chimbley pots Sir replied mister Weller touching his hat I suppose you have hardly seen anything but chimney pots and bricks and mortar all your life Sam said mister Pickwick smiling I worn t always a boots sir said mister Weller with a shake of the head I wos a vaginer s boy once When was that inquired mister Pickwick When I wos first pitched neck and crop into the world to play at leap frog with its troubles replied Sam I wos a carrier s boy at startin then a vaginer s then a helper then a boots Now I m a general l m n s servant I shall be a general l m n myself one of these days perhaps with a pipe in my mouth and a summer house in the back garden Who knows I shouldn t be surprised for one You are quite a philosopher Sam said mister Pickwick It runs in the family I b lieve sir replied mister Weller My father s wery much in that line now If my mother in law blows him up he whistles She flies in a passion and breaks his pipe he steps out and gets another Then she screams wery loud and falls into sterics and he smokes wery comfortably till she comes to agin That s philosophy Sir ain t it A very good substitute for it at all events replied mister Pickwick laughing It must have been of great service to you in the course of your rambling life Sam Service sir exclaimed Sam You may say that Arter I run away from the carrier and afore I took up with the vaginer I had unfurnished lodgin s for a fortnight Unfurnished lodgings said mister Pickwick Yes the dry arches of Waterloo Bridge Fine sleeping place vithin ten minutes walk of all the public offices only if there is any objection to it it is that the sitivation s rayther too airy I see some queer sights there Ah I suppose you did said mister Pickwick with an air of considerable interest Sights sir resumed mister Weller as ud penetrate your benevolent heart and come out on the other side You don t see the reg lar wagrants there trust em they knows better than that Young beggars male and female as hasn t made a rise in their profession takes up their quarters there sometimes but it s generally the worn out starving houseless creeturs as roll themselves in the dark corners o them lonesome places poor creeturs as ain t up to the twopenny rope And pray Sam what is the twopenny rope inquired mister Pickwick The twopenny rope sir replied mister Weller is just a cheap lodgin house where the beds is twopence a night What do they call a bed a rope for said mister Pickwick Bless your innocence sir that ain t it replied Sam Ven the lady and general l m n as keeps the hot el first begun business they used to make the beds on the floor but this wouldn t do at no price cos instead o taking a moderate twopenn orth o sleep the lodgers used to lie there half the day So now they has two ropes bout six foot apart and three from the floor which goes right down the room and the beds are made of slips of coarse sacking stretched across em Well said mister Pickwick Well said mister Weller the adwantage o the plan s hobvious At six o clock every mornin they let s go the ropes at one end and down falls the lodgers Consequence is that being thoroughly waked they get up wery quietly and walk away Beg your pardon sir said Sam suddenly breaking off in his loquacious discourse Is this Bury saint Edmunds It is replied mister Pickwick The coach rattled through the well paved streets of a handsome little town of thriving and cleanly appearance and stopped before a large inn situated in a wide open street nearly facing the old abbey And this said mister Pickwick looking up Is the Angel We alight here Sam But some caution is necessary Order a private room and do not mention my name You understand Right as a trivet sir replied mister Weller with a wink of intelligence and having dragged mister Pickwick s portmanteau from the hind boot into which it had been hastily thrown when they joined the coach at Eatanswill mister Weller disappeared on his errand A private room was speedily engaged and into it mister Pickwick was ushered without delay Now Sam said mister Pickwick the first thing to be done is to Order dinner Sir interposed mister Weller It s wery late sir Ah so it is said mister Pickwick looking at his watch You are right Sam And if I might adwise Sir added mister Weller I d just have a good night s rest arterwards and not begin inquiring arter this here deep un till the mornin There s nothin so refreshen as sleep sir as the servant girl said afore she drank the egg cupful of laudanum I think you are right Sam said mister Pickwick But I must first ascertain that he is in the house and not likely to go away Leave that to me Sir said Sam Let me order you a snug little dinner and make my inquiries below while it s a getting ready I could worm ev ry secret out O the boots s heart in five minutes Sir Do so said mister Pickwick and mister Weller at once retired In half an hour mister Pickwick was seated at a very satisfactory dinner and in three quarters mister Weller returned with the intelligence that mister Charles Fitz Marshall had ordered his private room to be retained for him until further notice He was going to spend the evening at some private house in the neighbourhood had ordered the boots to sit up until his return and had taken his servant with him Now sir argued mister Weller when he had concluded his report if I can get a talk with this here servant in the mornin he ll tell me all his master s concerns How do you know that interposed mister Pickwick Bless your heart sir servants always do replied mister Weller Oh ah I forgot that said mister Pickwick Well Then you can arrange what s best to be done sir and we can act accordingly As it appeared that this was the best arrangement that could be made it was finally agreed upon mister Weller by his master s permission retired to spend the evening in his own way and was shortly afterwards elected by the unanimous voice of the assembled company into the taproom chair in which honourable post he acquitted himself so much to the satisfaction of the gentlemen frequenters that their roars of laughter and approbation penetrated to mister Pickwick s bedroom and shortened the term of his natural rest by at least three hours Early on the ensuing morning mister Weller was dispelling all the feverish remains of the previous evening s conviviality through the instrumentality of a halfpenny shower bath having induced a young gentleman attached to the stable department by the offer of that coin to pump over his head and face until he was perfectly restored when he was attracted by the appearance of a young fellow in mulberry coloured livery who was sitting on a bench in the yard reading what appeared to be a hymn book with an air of deep abstraction but who occasionally stole a glance at the individual under the pump as if he took some interest in his proceedings nevertheless You re a rum un to look at you are thought mister Weller the first time his eyes encountered the glance of the stranger in the mulberry suit who had a large sallow ugly face very sunken eyes and a gigantic head from which depended a quantity of lank black hair You re a rum un thought mister Weller and thinking this he went on washing himself and thought no more about him Still the man kept glancing from his hymn book to Sam and from Sam to his hymn book as if he wanted to open a conversation So at last Sam by way of giving him an opportunity said with a familiar nod How are you governor I am happy to say I am pretty well Sir said the man speaking with great deliberation and closing the book I hope you are the same Sir Why if I felt less like a walking brandy bottle I shouldn t be quite so staggery this mornin replied Sam Are you stoppin in this house old un The mulberry man replied in the affirmative How was it you worn t one of us last night inquired Sam scrubbing his face with the towel You seem one of the jolly sort looks as conwivial as a live trout in a lime basket added mister Weller in an undertone I was out last night with my master replied the stranger What s his name inquired mister Weller colouring up very red with sudden excitement and the friction of the towel combined Fitz Marshall said the mulberry man Give us your hand said mister Weller advancing I should like to know you I like your appearance old fellow Well that is very strange said the mulberry man with great simplicity of manner I like yours so much that I wanted to speak to you from the very first moment I saw you under the pump Did you though Upon my word Now isn t that curious Wery sing ler said Sam inwardly congratulating himself upon the softness of the stranger What s your name my patriarch Job And a wery good name it is only one I know that ain t got a nickname to it What s the other name Trotter said the stranger What is yours Sam bore in mind his master s caution and replied My name s Walker my master s name s Wilkins Will you take a drop o somethin this mornin mister Trotter mister Trotter acquiesced in this agreeable proposal and having deposited his book in his coat pocket accompanied mister Weller to the tap where they were soon occupied in discussing an exhilarating compound formed by mixing together in a pewter vessel certain quantities of British Hollands and the fragrant essence of the clove And what sort of a place have you got inquired Sam as he filled his companion s glass for the second time Bad said Job smacking his lips very bad You don t mean that said Sam I do indeed Worse than that my master s going to be married No Yes and worse than that too he s going to run away with an immense rich heiress from boarding school What a dragon said Sam refilling his companion s glass It s some boarding school in this town I suppose ain t it Now although this question was put in the most careless tone imaginable mister Job Trotter plainly showed by gestures that he perceived his new friend s anxiety to draw forth an answer to it He emptied his glass looked mysteriously at his companion winked both of his small eyes one after the other and finally made a motion with his arm as if he were working an imaginary pump handle thereby intimating that he mister Trotter considered himself as undergoing the process of being pumped by mister Samuel Weller No no said mister Trotter in conclusion that s not to be told to everybody That is a secret a great secret mister Walker As the mulberry man said this he turned his glass upside down by way of reminding his companion that he had nothing left wherewith to slake his thirst Sam observed the hint and feeling the delicate manner in which it was conveyed ordered the pewter vessel to be refilled whereat the small eyes of the mulberry man glistened And so it s a secret said Sam I should rather suspect it was said the mulberry man sipping his liquor with a complacent face I suppose your mas r s wery rich said Sam mister Trotter smiled and holding his glass in his left hand gave four distinct slaps on the pockets of his mulberry indescribables with his right as if to intimate that his master might have done the same without alarming anybody much by the chinking of coin Ah said Sam that s the game is it The mulberry man nodded significantly Well and don t you think old feller remonstrated mister Weller that if you let your master take in this here young lady you re a precious rascal I know that said Job Trotter turning upon his companion a countenance of deep contrition and groaning slightly I know that and that s what it is that preys upon my mind But what am I to do Do said Sam di wulge to the missis and give up your master Who d believe me replied Job Trotter The young lady s considered the very picture of innocence and discretion She d deny it and so would my master Who d believe me I should lose my place and get indicted for a conspiracy or some such thing that s all I should take by my motion There s somethin in that said Sam ruminating there s somethin in that If I knew any respectable gentleman who would take the matter up continued mister Trotter I might have some hope of preventing the elopement but there s the same difficulty mister Walker just the same I know no gentleman in this strange place and ten to one if I did whether he would believe my story Come this way said Sam suddenly jumping up and grasping the mulberry man by the arm My mas r s the man you want I see And after a slight resistance on the part of Job Trotter Sam led his newly found friend to the apartment of mister Pickwick to whom he presented him together with a brief summary of the dialogue we have just repeated I am very sorry to betray my master sir said Job Trotter applying to his eyes a pink checked pocket handkerchief about six inches square The feeling does you a great deal of honour replied mister Pickwick but it is your duty nevertheless I know it is my duty Sir replied Job with great emotion We should all try to discharge our duty Sir and I humbly endeavour to discharge mine Sir but it is a hard trial to betray a master Sir whose clothes you wear and whose bread you eat even though he is a scoundrel Sir You are a very good fellow said mister Pickwick much affected an honest fellow Come come interposed Sam who had witnessed mister Trotter s tears with considerable impatience blow this ere water cart bis ness It won t do no good this won t Sam said mister Pickwick reproachfully I am sorry to find that you have so little respect for this young man s feelings His feelin s is all wery well Sir replied mister Weller and as they re so wery fine and it s a pity he should lose em I think he d better keep em in his own buzzum than let em ewaporate in hot water specially as they do no good Tears never yet wound up a clock or worked a steam ingin The next time you go out to a smoking party young fellow fill your pipe with that ere reflection and for the present just put that bit of pink gingham into your pocket Tain t so handsome that you need keep waving it about as if you was a tight rope dancer My man is in the right said mister Pickwick accosting Job although his mode of expressing his opinion is somewhat homely and occasionally incomprehensible He is sir very right said mister Trotter and I will give way no longer Very well said mister Pickwick Now where is this boarding school It is a large old red brick house just outside the town Sir replied Job Trotter And when said mister Pickwick when is this villainous design to be carried into execution when is this elopement to take place To night Sir replied Job To night exclaimed mister Pickwick This very night sir replied Job Trotter That is what alarms me so much Instant measures must be taken said mister Pickwick I will see the lady who keeps the establishment immediately I beg your pardon Sir said Job but that course of proceeding will never do Why not inquired mister Pickwick My master sir is a very artful man I know he is said mister Pickwick And he has so wound himself round the old lady s heart Sir resumed Job that she would believe nothing to his prejudice if you went down on your bare knees and swore it especially as you have no proof but the word of a servant who for anything she knows and my master would be sure to say so was discharged for some fault and does this in revenge What had better be done then said mister Pickwick Nothing but taking him in the very act of eloping will convince the old lady sir replied Job All them old cats WILL run their heads agin milestones observed mister Weller in a parenthesis But this taking him in the very act of elopement would be a very difficult thing to accomplish I fear said mister Pickwick I don t know sir said mister Trotter after a few moments reflection I think it might be very easily done How was mister Pickwick s inquiry Why replied mister Trotter my master and I being in the confidence of the two servants will be secreted in the kitchen at ten o clock When the family have retired to rest we shall come out of the kitchen and the young lady out of her bedroom A post chaise will be waiting and away we go Well said mister Pickwick Well sir I have been thinking that if you were in waiting in the garden behind alone Alone said mister Pickwick Why alone I thought it very natural replied Job that the old lady wouldn t like such an unpleasant discovery to be made before more persons than can possibly be helped The young lady too sir consider her feelings You are very right said mister Pickwick The consideration evinces your delicacy of feeling Go on you are very right Well sir I have been thinking that if you were waiting in the back garden alone and I was to let you in at the door which opens into it from the end of the passage at exactly half past eleven o clock you would be just in the very moment of time to assist me in frustrating the designs of this bad man by whom I have been unfortunately ensnared Here mister Trotter sighed deeply Don t distress yourself on that account said mister Pickwick if he had one grain of the delicacy of feeling which distinguishes you humble as your station is I should have some hopes of him Job Trotter bowed low and in spite of mister Weller s previous remonstrance the tears again rose to his eyes I never see such a feller said Sam Blessed if I don t think he s got a main in his head as is always turned on Sam said mister Pickwick with great severity hold your tongue Wery well sir replied mister Weller I don t like this plan said mister Pickwick after deep meditation Why cannot I communicate with the young lady s friends Because they live one hundred miles from here sir responded Job Trotter That s a clincher said mister Weller aside Then this garden resumed mister Pickwick How am I to get into it The wall is very low sir and your servant will give you a leg up My servant will give me a leg up repeated mister Pickwick mechanically You will be sure to be near this door that you speak of You cannot mistake it Sir it s the only one that opens into the garden Tap at it when you hear the clock strike and I will open it instantly I don t like the plan said mister Pickwick but as I see no other and as the happiness of this young lady s whole life is at stake I adopt it I shall be sure to be there Thus for the second time did mister Pickwick s innate good feeling involve him in an enterprise from which he would most willingly have stood aloof What is the name of the house inquired mister Pickwick Westgate House Sir You turn a little to the right when you get to the end of the town it stands by itself some little distance off the high road with the name on a brass plate on the gate I know it said mister Pickwick I observed it once before when I was in this town You may depend upon me mister Trotter made another bow and turned to depart when mister Pickwick thrust a guinea into his hand You re a fine fellow said mister Pickwick and I admire your goodness of heart No thanks Remember eleven o clock There is no fear of my forgetting it sir replied Job Trotter With these words he left the room followed by Sam I say said the latter not a bad notion that ere crying I d cry like a rain water spout in a shower on such good terms How do you do it It comes from the heart mister Walker replied Job solemnly Good morning sir You re a soft customer you are we ve got it all out o you anyhow thought mister Weller as Job walked away We cannot state the precise nature of the thoughts which passed through mister Trotter s mind because we don t know what they were The day wore on evening came and at a little before ten o clock Sam Weller reported that mister Jingle and Job had gone out together that their luggage was packed up and that they had ordered a chaise The plot was evidently in execution as mister Trotter had foretold Half past ten o clock arrived and it was time for mister Pickwick to issue forth on his delicate errand Resisting Sam s tender of his greatcoat in order that he might have no encumbrance in scaling the wall he set forth followed by his attendant There was a bright moon but it was behind the clouds It was a fine dry night but it was most uncommonly dark Paths hedges fields houses and trees were enveloped in one deep shade The atmosphere was hot and sultry the summer lightning quivered faintly on the verge of the horizon and was the only sight that varied the dull gloom in which everything was wrapped sound there was none except the distant barking of some restless house dog They found the house read the brass plate walked round the wall and stopped at that portion of it which divided them from the bottom of the garden You will return to the inn Sam when you have assisted me over said mister Pickwick Wery well Sir And you will sit up till I return Cert nly Sir Take hold of my leg and when I say Over raise me gently All right sir Having settled these preliminaries mister Pickwick grasped the top of the wall and gave the word Over which was literally obeyed Whether his body partook in some degree of the elasticity of his mind or whether mister Weller s notions of a gentle push were of a somewhat rougher description than mister Pickwick s the immediate effect of his assistance was to jerk that immortal gentleman completely over the wall on to the bed beneath where after crushing three gooseberry bushes and a rose tree he finally alighted at full length You ha n t hurt yourself I hope Sir said Sam in a loud whisper as soon as he had recovered from the surprise consequent upon the mysterious disappearance of his master I have not hurt MYSELF Sam certainly replied mister Pickwick from the other side of the wall but I rather think that YOU have hurt me I hope not Sir said Sam Never mind said mister Pickwick rising it s nothing but a few scratches Go away or we shall be overheard Good bye Sir Good bye With stealthy steps Sam Weller departed leaving mister Pickwick alone in the garden Lights occasionally appeared in the different windows of the house or glanced from the staircases as if the inmates were retiring to rest Not caring to go too near the door until the appointed time mister Pickwick crouched into an angle of the wall and awaited its arrival It was a situation which might well have depressed the spirits of many a man mister Pickwick however felt neither depression nor misgiving He knew that his purpose was in the main a good one and he placed implicit reliance on the high minded Job It was dull certainly not to say dreary but a contemplative man can always employ himself in meditation mister Pickwick had meditated himself into a doze when he was roused by the chimes of the neighbouring church ringing out the hour half past eleven That s the time thought mister Pickwick getting cautiously on his feet He looked up at the house The lights had disappeared and the shutters were closed all in bed no doubt He walked on tiptoe to the door and gave a gentle tap Two or three minutes passing without any reply he gave another tap rather louder and then another rather louder than that At length the sound of feet was audible upon the stairs and then the light of a candle shone through the keyhole of the door There was a good deal of unchaining and unbolting and the door was slowly opened Now the door opened outwards and as the door opened wider and wider mister Pickwick receded behind it more and more What was his astonishment when he just peeped out by way of caution to see that the person who had opened it was not Job Trotter but a servant girl with a candle in her hand mister Pickwick drew in his head again with the swiftness displayed by that admirable melodramatic performer Punch when he lies in wait for the flat headed comedian with the tin box of music It must have been the cat Sarah said the girl addressing herself to some one in the house Puss puss puss tit tit tit But no animal being decoyed by these blandishments the girl slowly closed the door and re fastened it leaving mister Pickwick drawn up straight against the wall This is very curious thought mister Pickwick They are sitting up beyond their usual hour I suppose Extremely unfortunate that they should have chosen this night of all others for such a purpose exceedingly And with these thoughts mister Pickwick cautiously retired to the angle of the wall in which he had been before ensconced waiting until such time as he might deem it safe to repeat the signal He had not been here five minutes when a vivid flash of lightning was followed by a loud peal of thunder that crashed and rolled away in the distance with a terrific noise then came another flash of lightning brighter than the other and a second peal of thunder louder than the first and then down came the rain with a force and fury that swept everything before it mister Pickwick was perfectly aware that a tree is a very dangerous neighbour in a thunderstorm He had a tree on his right a tree on his left a third before him and a fourth behind If he remained where he was he might fall the victim of an accident if he showed himself in the centre of the garden he might be consigned to a constable Once or twice he tried to scale the wall but having no other legs this time than those with which Nature had furnished him the only effect of his struggles was to inflict a variety of very unpleasant gratings on his knees and shins and to throw him into a state of the most profuse perspiration What a dreadful situation said mister Pickwick pausing to wipe his brow after this exercise He looked up at the house all was dark They must be gone to bed now He would try the signal again He walked on tiptoe across the moist gravel and tapped at the door He held his breath and listened at the key hole No reply very odd Another knock He listened again There was a low whispering inside and then a voice cried Who s there That s not Job thought mister Pickwick hastily drawing himself straight up against the wall again It s a woman He had scarcely had time to form this conclusion when a window above stairs was thrown up and three or four female voices repeated the query Who s there mister Pickwick dared not move hand or foot It was clear that the whole establishment was roused He made up his mind to remain where he was until the alarm had subsided and then by a supernatural effort to get over the wall or perish in the attempt Like all mister Pickwick s determinations this was the best that could be made under the circumstances but unfortunately it was founded upon the assumption that they would not venture to open the door again What was his discomfiture when he heard the chain and bolts withdrawn and saw the door slowly opening wider and wider He retreated into the corner step by step but do what he would the interposition of his own person prevented its being opened to its utmost width Who s there screamed a numerous chorus of treble voices from the staircase inside consisting of the spinster lady of the establishment three teachers five female servants and thirty boarders all half dressed and in a forest of curl papers Of course mister Pickwick didn t say who was there and then the burden of the chorus changed into Lor I am so frightened Cook said the lady abbess who took care to be on the top stair the very last of the group cook why don t you go a little way into the garden Please ma am I don t like responded the cook Lor what a stupid thing that cook is said the thirty boarders Cook said the lady abbess with great dignity don t answer me if you please I insist upon your looking into the garden immediately Here the cook began to cry and the housemaid said it was a shame for which partisanship she received a month s warning on the spot 
1265_135636_000092_000002	train-clean-360	Do you hear 
none	none	cook said the lady abbess stamping her foot impatiently Don t you hear your missis cook said the three teachers What an impudent thing that cook is said the thirty boarders The unfortunate cook thus strongly urged advanced a step or two and holding her candle just where it prevented her from seeing at all declared there was nothing there and it must have been the wind The door was just going to be closed in consequence when an inquisitive boarder who had been peeping between the hinges set up a fearful screaming which called back the cook and housemaid and all the more adventurous in no time What is the matter with Miss Smithers said the lady abbess as the aforesaid Miss Smithers proceeded to go into hysterics of four young lady power Lor Miss Smithers dear said the other nine and twenty boarders Oh the man the man behind the door screamed Miss Smithers The lady abbess no sooner heard this appalling cry than she retreated to her own bedroom double locked the door and fainted away comfortably The boarders and the teachers and the servants fell back upon the stairs and upon each other and never was such a screaming and fainting and struggling beheld In the midst of the tumult mister Pickwick emerged from his concealment and presented himself amongst them Ladies dear ladies said mister Pickwick Oh he says we re dear cried the oldest and ugliest teacher Oh the wretch Ladies roared mister Pickwick rendered desperate by the danger of his situation Hear me I am no robber I want the lady of the house Oh what a ferocious monster screamed another teacher He wants Miss Tomkins Here there was a general scream Ring the alarm bell somebody cried a dozen voices Don t don t shouted mister Pickwick Look at me Do I look like a robber My dear ladies you may bind me hand and leg or lock me up in a closet if you like Only hear what I have got to say only hear me How did you come in our garden faltered the housemaid Call the lady of the house and I ll tell her everything said mister Pickwick exerting his lungs to the utmost pitch Call her only be quiet and call her and you shall hear everything It might have been mister Pickwick s appearance or it might have been his manner or it might have been the temptation irresistible to a female mind of hearing something at present enveloped in mystery that reduced the more reasonable portion of the establishment some four individuals to a state of comparative quiet By them it was proposed as a test of mister Pickwick s sincerity that he should immediately submit to personal restraint and that gentleman having consented to hold a conference with Miss Tomkins from the interior of a closet in which the day boarders hung their bonnets and sandwich bags he at once stepped into it of his own accord and was securely locked in This revived the others and Miss Tomkins having been brought to and brought down the conference began What did you do in my garden man said Miss Tomkins in a faint voice I came to warn you that one of your young ladies was going to elope to night replied mister Pickwick from the interior of the closet Elope exclaimed Miss Tomkins the three teachers the thirty boarders and the five servants Who with Your friend mister Charles Fitz Marshall MY friend I don t know any such person Well mister Jingle then I never heard the name in my life Then I have been deceived and deluded said mister Pickwick I have been the victim of a conspiracy a foul and base conspiracy Send to the Angel my dear ma am if you don t believe me Send to the Angel for mister Pickwick s manservant I implore you ma am He must be respectable he keeps a manservant said Miss Tomkins to the writing and ciphering governess It s my opinion Miss Tomkins said the writing and ciphering governess that his manservant keeps him I think he s a madman Miss Tomkins and the other s his keeper I think you are very right Miss Gwynn responded Miss Tomkins Let two of the servants repair to the Angel and let the others remain here to protect us So two of the servants were despatched to the Angel in search of mister Samuel Weller and the remaining three stopped behind to protect Miss Tomkins and the three teachers and the thirty boarders And mister Pickwick sat down in the closet beneath a grove of sandwich bags and awaited the return of the messengers with all the philosophy and fortitude he could summon to his aid An hour and a half elapsed before they came back and when they did come mister Pickwick recognised in addition to the voice of mister Samuel Weller two other voices the tones of which struck familiarly on his ear but whose they were he could not for the life of him call to mind A very brief conversation ensued The door was unlocked mister Pickwick stepped out of the closet and found himself in the presence of the whole establishment of Westgate House mister Samuel Weller and old Wardle and his destined son in law mister Trundle My dear friend said mister Pickwick running forward and grasping Wardle s hand my dear friend pray for Heaven s sake explain to this lady the unfortunate and dreadful situation in which I am placed You must have heard it from my servant say at all events my dear fellow that I am neither a robber nor a madman I have said so my dear friend I have said so already replied mister Wardle shaking the right hand of his friend while mister Trundle shook the left And whoever says or has said he is interposed mister Weller stepping forward says that which is not the truth but so far from it on the contrary quite the rewerse And if there s any number o men on these here premises as has said so I shall be wery happy to give em all a wery convincing proof o their being mistaken in this here wery room if these wery respectable ladies ll have the goodness to retire and order em up one at a time Having delivered this defiance with great volubility mister Weller struck his open palm emphatically with his clenched fist and winked pleasantly on Miss Tomkins the intensity of whose horror at his supposing it within the bounds of possibility that there could be any men on the premises of Westgate House Establishment for Young Ladies it is impossible to describe mister Pickwick s explanation having already been partially made was soon concluded But neither in the course of his walk home with his friends nor afterwards when seated before a blazing fire at the supper he so much needed could a single observation be drawn from him He seemed bewildered and amazed Once and only once he turned round to mister Wardle and said How did you come here Trundle and I came down here for some good shooting on the first replied Wardle We arrived to night and were astonished to hear from your servant that you were here too But I am glad you are said the old fellow slapping him on the back I am glad you are We shall have a jovial party on the first and we ll give Winkle another chance eh old boy mister Pickwick made no reply he did not even ask after his friends at Dingley Dell and shortly afterwards retired for the night desiring Sam to fetch his candle when he rung The bell did ring in due course and mister Weller presented himself Sam said mister Pickwick looking out from under the bed clothes Sir said mister Weller mister Pickwick paused and mister Weller snuffed the candle Sam said mister Pickwick again as if with a desperate effort Sir said mister Weller once more Where is that Trotter Job sir Yes Gone sir With his master I suppose Friend or master or whatever he is he s gone with him replied mister Weller There s a pair on em sir Jingle suspected my design and set that fellow on you with this story I suppose said mister Pickwick half choking Just that sir replied mister Weller It was all false of course All sir replied mister Weller Reg lar do sir artful dodge I don t think he ll escape us quite so easily the next time Sam said mister Pickwick I don t think he will Sir Whenever I meet that Jingle again wherever it is said mister Pickwick raising himself in bed and indenting his pillow with a tremendous blow I ll inflict personal chastisement on him in addition to the exposure he so richly merits I will or my name is not Pickwick And venever I catches hold o that there melan cholly chap with the black hair said Sam if I don t bring some real water into his eyes for once in a way my name ain t Weller Good night Sir CHAPTER XVII SHOWING THAT AN ATTACK OF RHEUMATISM IN SOME CASES ACTS AS A QUICKENER TO INVENTIVE GENIUS The constitution of mister Pickwick though able to sustain a very considerable amount of exertion and fatigue was not proof against such a combination of attacks as he had undergone on the memorable night recorded in the last chapter The process of being washed in the night air and rough dried in a closet is as dangerous as it is peculiar mister Pickwick was laid up with an attack of rheumatism But although the bodily powers of the great man were thus impaired his mental energies retained their pristine vigour His spirits were elastic his good humour was restored Even the vexation consequent upon his recent adventure had vanished from his mind and he could join in the hearty laughter which any allusion to it excited in mister Wardle without anger and without embarrassment Nay more During the two days mister Pickwick was confined to bed Sam was his constant attendant On the first he endeavoured to amuse his master by anecdote and conversation on the second mister Pickwick demanded his writing desk and pen and ink and was deeply engaged during the whole day On the third being able to sit up in his bedchamber he despatched his valet with a message to mister Wardle and mister Trundle intimating that if they would take their wine there that evening they would greatly oblige him The invitation was most willingly accepted and when they were seated over their wine mister Pickwick with sundry blushes produced the following little tale as having been edited by himself during his recent indisposition from his notes of mister Weller s unsophisticated recital THE PARISH CLERK A TALE OF TRUE LOVE Once upon a time in a very small country town at a considerable distance from London there lived a little man named Nathaniel Pipkin who was the parish clerk of the little town and lived in a little house in the little High Street within ten minutes walk from the little church and who was to be found every day from nine till four teaching a little learning to the little boys Nathaniel Pipkin was a harmless inoffensive good natured being with a turned up nose and rather turned in legs a cast in his eye and a halt in his gait and he divided his time between the church and his school verily believing that there existed not on the face of the earth so clever a man as the curate so imposing an apartment as the vestry room or so well ordered a seminary as his own Once and only once in his life Nathaniel Pipkin had seen a bishop a real bishop with his arms in lawn sleeves and his head in a wig He had seen him walk and heard him talk at a confirmation on which momentous occasion Nathaniel Pipkin was so overcome with reverence and awe when the aforesaid bishop laid his hand on his head that he fainted right clean away and was borne out of church in the arms of the beadle This was a great event a tremendous era in Nathaniel Pipkin s life and it was the only one that had ever occurred to ruffle the smooth current of his quiet existence when happening one fine afternoon in a fit of mental abstraction to raise his eyes from the slate on which he was devising some tremendous problem in compound addition for an offending urchin to solve they suddenly rested on the blooming countenance of Maria Lobbs the only daughter of old Lobbs the great saddler over the way Now the eyes of mister Pipkin had rested on the pretty face of Maria Lobbs many a time and oft before at church and elsewhere but the eyes of Maria Lobbs had never looked so bright the cheeks of Maria Lobbs had never looked so ruddy as upon this particular occasion No wonder then that Nathaniel Pipkin was unable to take his eyes from the countenance of Miss Lobbs no wonder that Miss Lobbs finding herself stared at by a young man withdrew her head from the window out of which she had been peeping and shut the casement and pulled down the blind no wonder that Nathaniel Pipkin immediately thereafter fell upon the young urchin who had previously offended and cuffed and knocked him about to his heart s content All this was very natural and there s nothing at all to wonder at about it It IS matter of wonder though that anyone of mister Nathaniel Pipkin s retiring disposition nervous temperament and most particularly diminutive income should from this day forth have dared to aspire to the hand and heart of the only daughter of the fiery old Lobbs of old Lobbs the great saddler who could have bought up the whole village at one stroke of his pen and never felt the outlay old Lobbs who was well known to have heaps of money invested in the bank at the nearest market town who was reported to have countless and inexhaustible treasures hoarded up in the little iron safe with the big keyhole over the chimney piece in the back parlour and who it was well known on festive occasions garnished his board with a real silver teapot cream ewer and sugar basin which he was wont in the pride of his heart to boast should be his daughter s property when she found a man to her mind I repeat it to be matter of profound astonishment and intense wonder that Nathaniel Pipkin should have had the temerity to cast his eyes in this direction But love is blind and Nathaniel had a cast in his eye and perhaps these two circumstances taken together prevented his seeing the matter in its proper light Now if old Lobbs had entertained the most remote or distant idea of the state of the affections of Nathaniel Pipkin he would just have razed the school room to the ground or exterminated its master from the surface of the earth or committed some other outrage and atrocity of an equally ferocious and violent description for he was a terrible old fellow was Lobbs when his pride was injured or his blood was up Swear Such trains of oaths would come rolling and pealing over the way sometimes when he was denouncing the idleness of the bony apprentice with the thin legs that Nathaniel Pipkin would shake in his shoes with horror and the hair of the pupils heads would stand on end with fright Well Day after day when school was over and the pupils gone did Nathaniel Pipkin sit himself down at the front window and while he feigned to be reading a book throw sidelong glances over the way in search of the bright eyes of Maria Lobbs and he hadn t sat there many days before the bright eyes appeared at an upper window apparently deeply engaged in reading too This was delightful and gladdening to the heart of Nathaniel Pipkin It was something to sit there for hours together and look upon that pretty face when the eyes were cast down but when Maria Lobbs began to raise her eyes from her book and dart their rays in the direction of Nathaniel Pipkin his delight and admiration were perfectly boundless At last one day when he knew old Lobbs was out Nathaniel Pipkin had the temerity to kiss his hand to Maria Lobbs and Maria Lobbs instead of shutting the window and pulling down the blind kissed HERS to him and smiled Upon which Nathaniel Pipkin determined that come what might he would develop the state of his feelings without further delay A prettier foot a gayer heart a more dimpled face or a smarter form never bounded so lightly over the earth they graced as did those of Maria Lobbs the old saddler s daughter There was a roguish twinkle in her sparkling eyes that would have made its way to far less susceptible bosoms than that of Nathaniel Pipkin and there was such a joyous sound in her merry laugh that the sternest misanthrope must have smiled to hear it Even old Lobbs himself in the very height of his ferocity couldn t resist the coaxing of his pretty daughter and when she and her cousin Kate an arch impudent looking bewitching little person made a dead set upon the old man together as to say the truth they very often did he could have refused them nothing even had they asked for a portion of the countless and inexhaustible treasures which were hidden from the light in the iron safe Nathaniel Pipkin s heart beat high within him when he saw this enticing little couple some hundred yards before him one summer s evening in the very field in which he had many a time strolled about till night time and pondered on the beauty of Maria Lobbs But though he had often thought then how briskly he would walk up to Maria Lobbs and tell her of his passion if he could only meet her he felt now that she was unexpectedly before him all the blood in his body mounting to his face manifestly to the great detriment of his legs which deprived of their usual portion trembled beneath him When they stopped to gather a hedge flower or listen to a bird Nathaniel Pipkin stopped too and pretended to be absorbed in meditation as indeed he really was for he was thinking what on earth he should ever do when they turned back as they inevitably must in time and meet him face to face But though he was afraid to make up to them he couldn t bear to lose sight of them so when they walked faster he walked faster when they lingered he lingered and when they stopped he stopped and so they might have gone on until the darkness prevented them if Kate had not looked slyly back and encouragingly beckoned Nathaniel to advance There was something in Kate s manner that was not to be resisted and so Nathaniel Pipkin complied with the invitation and after a great deal of blushing on his part and immoderate laughter on that of the wicked little cousin Nathaniel Pipkin went down on his knees on the dewy grass and declared his resolution to remain there for ever unless he were permitted to rise the accepted lover of Maria Lobbs Upon this the merry laughter of Miss Lobbs rang through the calm evening air without seeming to disturb it though it had such a pleasant sound and the wicked little cousin laughed more immoderately than before and Nathaniel Pipkin blushed deeper than ever At length Maria Lobbs being more strenuously urged by the love worn little man turned away her head and whispered her cousin to say or at all events Kate did say that she felt much honoured by mister Pipkin s addresses that her hand and heart were at her father s disposal but that nobody could be insensible to mister Pipkin s merits As all this was said with much gravity and as Nathaniel Pipkin walked home with Maria Lobbs and struggled for a kiss at parting he went to bed a happy man and dreamed all night long of softening old Lobbs opening the strong box and marrying Maria The next day Nathaniel Pipkin saw old Lobbs go out upon his old gray pony and after a great many signs at the window from the wicked little cousin the object and meaning of which he could by no means understand the bony apprentice with the thin legs came over to say that his master wasn t coming home all night and that the ladies expected mister Pipkin to tea at six o clock precisely How the lessons were got through that day neither Nathaniel Pipkin nor his pupils knew any more than you do but they were got through somehow and after the boys had gone Nathaniel Pipkin took till full six o clock to dress himself to his satisfaction Not that it took long to select the garments he should wear inasmuch as he had no choice about the matter but the putting of them on to the best advantage and the touching of them up previously was a task of no inconsiderable difficulty or importance There was a very snug little party consisting of Maria Lobbs and her cousin Kate and three or four romping good humoured rosy cheeked girls Nathaniel Pipkin had ocular demonstration of the fact that the rumours of old Lobbs s treasures were not exaggerated There were the real solid silver teapot cream ewer and sugar basin on the table and real silver spoons to stir the tea with and real china cups to drink it out of and plates of the same to hold the cakes and toast in The only eye sore in the whole place was another cousin of Maria Lobbs s and a brother of Kate whom Maria Lobbs called Henry and who seemed to keep Maria Lobbs all to himself up in one corner of the table It s a delightful thing to see affection in families but it may be carried rather too far and Nathaniel Pipkin could not help thinking that Maria Lobbs must be very particularly fond of her relations if she paid as much attention to all of them as to this individual cousin After tea too when the wicked little cousin proposed a game at blind man s buff it somehow or other happened that Nathaniel Pipkin was nearly always blind and whenever he laid his hand upon the male cousin he was sure to find that Maria Lobbs was not far off And though the wicked little cousin and the other girls pinched him and pulled his hair and pushed chairs in his way and all sorts of things Maria Lobbs never seemed to come near him at all and once once Nathaniel Pipkin could have sworn he heard the sound of a kiss followed by a faint remonstrance from Maria Lobbs and a half suppressed laugh from her female friends All this was odd very odd and there is no saying what Nathaniel Pipkin might or might not have done in consequence if his thoughts had not been suddenly directed into a new channel The circumstance which directed his thoughts into a new channel was a loud knocking at the street door and the person who made this loud knocking at the street door was no other than old Lobbs himself who had unexpectedly returned and was hammering away like a coffin maker for he wanted his supper The alarming intelligence was no sooner communicated by the bony apprentice with the thin legs than the girls tripped upstairs to Maria Lobbs s bedroom and the male cousin and Nathaniel Pipkin were thrust into a couple of closets in the sitting room for want of any better places of concealment and when Maria Lobbs and the wicked little cousin had stowed them away and put the room to rights they opened the street door to old Lobbs who had never left off knocking since he first began Now it did unfortunately happen that old Lobbs being very hungry was monstrous cross Nathaniel Pipkin could hear him growling away like an old mastiff with a sore throat and whenever the unfortunate apprentice with the thin legs came into the room so surely did old Lobbs commence swearing at him in a most Saracenic and ferocious manner though apparently with no other end or object than that of easing his bosom by the discharge of a few superfluous oaths At length some supper which had been warming up was placed on the table and then old Lobbs fell to in regular style and having made clear work of it in no time kissed his daughter and demanded his pipe Nature had placed Nathaniel Pipkin s knees in very close juxtaposition but when he heard old Lobbs demand his pipe they knocked together as if they were going to reduce each other to powder for depending from a couple of hooks in the very closet in which he stood was a large brown stemmed silver bowled pipe which pipe he himself had seen in the mouth of old Lobbs regularly every afternoon and evening for the last five years The two girls went downstairs for the pipe and upstairs for the pipe and everywhere but where they knew the pipe was and old Lobbs stormed away meanwhile in the most wonderful manner At last he thought of the closet and walked up to it It was of no use a little man like Nathaniel Pipkin pulling the door inwards when a great strong fellow like old Lobbs was pulling it outwards Old Lobbs gave it one tug and open it flew disclosing Nathaniel Pipkin standing bolt upright inside and shaking with apprehension from head to foot Bless us what an appalling look old Lobbs gave him as he dragged him out by the collar and held him at arm s length Why what the devil do you want here said old Lobbs in a fearful voice Nathaniel Pipkin could make no reply so old Lobbs shook him backwards and forwards for two or three minutes by way of arranging his ideas for him What do you want here roared Lobbs I suppose you have come after my daughter now Old Lobbs merely said this as a sneer for he did not believe that mortal presumption could have carried Nathaniel Pipkin so far What was his indignation when that poor man replied Yes I did mister Lobbs I did come after your daughter I love her mister Lobbs Why you snivelling wry faced puny villain gasped old Lobbs paralysed by the atrocious confession what do you mean by that Say this to my face Damme I ll throttle you It is by no means improbable that old Lobbs would have carried his threat into execution in the excess of his rage if his arm had not been stayed by a very unexpected apparition to wit the male cousin who stepping out of his closet and walking up to old Lobbs said I cannot allow this harmless person Sir who has been asked here in some girlish frolic to take upon himself in a very noble manner the fault if fault it is which I am guilty of and am ready to avow I love your daughter sir and I came here for the purpose of meeting her Old Lobbs opened his eyes very wide at this but not wider than Nathaniel Pipkin You did said Lobbs at last finding breath to speak I did And I forbade you this house long ago You did or I should not have been here clandestinely to night I am sorry to record it of old Lobbs but I think he would have struck the cousin if his pretty daughter with her bright eyes swimming in tears had not clung to his arm Don t stop him Maria said the young man if he has the will to strike me let him I would not hurt a hair of his gray head for the riches of the world The old man cast down his eyes at this reproof and they met those of his daughter I have hinted once or twice before that they were very bright eyes and though they were tearful now their influence was by no means lessened Old Lobbs turned his head away as if to avoid being persuaded by them when as fortune would have it he encountered the face of the wicked little cousin who half afraid for her brother and half laughing at Nathaniel Pipkin presented as bewitching an expression of countenance with a touch of slyness in it too as any man old or young need look upon She drew her arm coaxingly through the old man s and whispered something in his ear and do what he would old Lobbs couldn t help breaking out into a smile while a tear stole down his cheek at the same time Five minutes after this the girls were brought down from the bedroom with a great deal of giggling and modesty and while the young people were making themselves perfectly happy old Lobbs got down the pipe and smoked it and it was a remarkable circumstance about that particular pipe of tobacco that it was the most soothing and delightful one he ever smoked Nathaniel Pipkin thought it best to keep his own counsel and by so doing gradually rose into high favour with old Lobbs who taught him to smoke in time and they used to sit out in the garden on the fine evenings for many years afterwards smoking and drinking in great state He soon recovered the effects of his attachment for we find his name in the parish register as a witness to the marriage of Maria Lobbs to her cousin and it also appears by reference to other documents that on the night of the wedding he was incarcerated in the village cage for having in a state of extreme intoxication committed sundry excesses in the streets in all of which he was aided and abetted by the bony apprentice with the thin legs CHAPTER XVIII BRIEFLY ILLUSTRATIVE OF TWO POINTS FIRST THE POWER OF HYSTERICS AND SECONDLY THE FORCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES For two days after the DEJEUNE at missus Hunter s the Pickwickians remained at Eatanswill anxiously awaiting the arrival of some intelligence from their revered leader mister Tupman and mister Snodgrass were once again left to their own means of amusement for mister Winkle in compliance with a most pressing invitation continued to reside at mister Pott s house and to devote his time to the companionship of his amiable lady Nor was the occasional society of mister Pott himself wanting to complete their felicity Deeply immersed in the intensity of his speculations for the public weal and the destruction of the INDEPENDENT it was not the habit of that great man to descend from his mental pinnacle to the humble level of ordinary minds On this occasion however and as if expressly in compliment to any follower of mister Pickwick s he unbent relaxed stepped down from his pedestal and walked upon the ground benignly adapting his remarks to the comprehension of the herd and seeming in outward form if not in spirit to be one of them Such having been the demeanour of this celebrated public character towards mister Winkle it will be readily imagined that considerable surprise was depicted on the countenance of the latter gentleman when as he was sitting alone in the breakfast room the door was hastily thrown open and as hastily closed on the entrance of mister Pott who stalking majestically towards him and thrusting aside his proffered hand ground his teeth as if to put a sharper edge on what he was about to utter and exclaimed in a saw like voice Serpent Sir exclaimed mister Winkle starting from his chair Serpent Sir repeated mister Pott raising his voice and then suddenly depressing it I said serpent sir make the most of it When you have parted with a man at two o clock in the morning on terms of the utmost good fellowship and he meets you again at half past nine and greets you as a serpent it is not unreasonable to conclude that something of an unpleasant nature has occurred meanwhile So mister Winkle thought He returned mister Pott s gaze of stone and in compliance with that gentleman s request proceeded to make the most he could of the serpent The most however was nothing at all so after a profound silence of some minutes duration he said Serpent Sir Serpent mister Pott What can you mean Sir this is pleasantry Pleasantry sir exclaimed Pott with a motion of the hand indicative of a strong desire to hurl the Britannia metal teapot at the head of the visitor Pleasantry sir But no I will be calm I will be calm Sir in proof of his calmness mister Pott flung himself into a chair and foamed at the mouth My dear sir interposed mister Winkle DEAR Sir replied Pott How dare you address me as dear Sir Sir How dare you look me in the face and do it sir Well Sir if you come to that responded mister Winkle how dare you look me in the face and call me a serpent sir Because you are one replied mister Pott Prove it Sir said mister Winkle warmly Prove it A malignant scowl passed over the profound face of the editor as he drew from his pocket the INDEPENDENT of that morning and laying his finger on a particular paragraph threw the journal across the table to mister Winkle That gentleman took it up and read as follows Our obscure and filthy contemporary in some disgusting observations on the recent election for this borough has presumed to violate the hallowed sanctity of private life and to refer in a manner not to be misunderstood to the personal affairs of our late candidate aye and notwithstanding his base defeat we will add our future member mister Fizkin What does our dastardly contemporary mean What would the ruffian say if we setting at naught like him the decencies of social intercourse were to raise the curtain which happily conceals His private life from general ridicule not to say from general execration What if we were even to point out and comment on facts and circumstances which are publicly notorious and beheld by every one but our mole eyed contemporary what if we were to print the following effusion which we received while we were writing the commencement of this article from a talented fellow townsman and correspondent LINES TO A BRASS POT Oh Pott if you d known How false she d have grown When you heard the marriage bells tinkle You d have done then I vow What you cannot help now And handed her over to W What said mister Pott solemnly what rhymes to tinkle villain What rhymes to tinkle said missus Pott whose entrance at the moment forestalled the reply What rhymes to tinkle Why Winkle I should conceive Saying this missus Pott smiled sweetly on the disturbed Pickwickian and extended her hand towards him The agitated young man would have accepted it in his confusion had not Pott indignantly interposed Back ma am back said the editor Take his hand before my very face mister P said his astonished lady Wretched woman look here exclaimed the husband Look here ma am Lines to a Brass Pot Brass Pot that s me ma am False SHE D have grown that s you ma am you With this ebullition of rage which was not unaccompanied with something like a tremble at the expression of his wife s face mister Pott dashed the current number of the Eatanswill INDEPENDENT at her feet Upon my word Sir said the astonished missus Pott stooping to pick up the paper Upon my word Sir mister Pott winced beneath the contemptuous gaze of his wife He had made a desperate struggle to screw up his courage but it was fast coming unscrewed again There appears nothing very tremendous in this little sentence Upon my word sir when it comes to be read but the tone of voice in which it was delivered and the look that accompanied it both seeming to bear reference to some revenge to be thereafter visited upon the head of Pott produced their effect upon him The most unskilful observer could have detected in his troubled countenance a readiness to resign his Wellington boots to any efficient substitute who would have consented to stand in them at that moment missus Pott read the paragraph uttered a loud shriek and threw herself at full length on the hearth rug screaming and tapping it with the heels of her shoes in a manner which could leave no doubt of the propriety of her feelings on the occasion My dear said the terrified Pott I didn t say I believed it I but the unfortunate man s voice was drowned in the screaming of his partner missus Pott let me entreat you my dear ma am to compose yourself said mister Winkle but the shrieks and tappings were louder and more frequent than ever My dear said mister Pott I m very sorry If you won t consider your own health consider me my dear We shall have a crowd round the house But the more strenuously mister Pott entreated the more vehemently the screams poured forth Very fortunately however attached to missus Pott s person was a bodyguard of one a young lady whose ostensible employment was to preside over her toilet but who rendered herself useful in a variety of ways and in none more so than in the particular department of constantly aiding and abetting her mistress in every wish and inclination opposed to the desires of the unhappy Pott The screams reached this young lady s ears in due course and brought her into the room with a speed which threatened to derange materially the very exquisite arrangement of her cap and ringlets Oh my dear dear mistress exclaimed the bodyguard kneeling frantically by the side of the prostrate missus Pott Oh my dear mistress what is the matter Your master your brutal master murmured the patient Pott was evidently giving way It s a shame said the bodyguard reproachfully I know he ll be the death on you ma am Poor dear thing He gave way more The opposite party followed up the attack Oh don t leave me don t leave me Goodwin murmured missus Pott clutching at the wrist of the said Goodwin with an hysteric jerk You re the only person that s kind to me Goodwin At this affecting appeal Goodwin got up a little domestic tragedy of her own and shed tears copiously Never ma am never said Goodwin Oh sir you should be careful you should indeed you don t know what harm you may do missis you ll be sorry for it one day I know I ve always said so The unlucky Pott looked timidly on but said nothing Goodwin said missus Pott in a soft voice Ma am said Goodwin If you only knew how I have loved that man Don t distress yourself by recollecting it ma am said the bodyguard Pott looked very frightened It was time to finish him And now sobbed missus Pott now after all to be treated in this way to be reproached and insulted in the presence of a third party and that party almost a stranger But I will not submit to it Goodwin continued missus Pott raising herself in the arms of her attendant my brother the lieutenant shall interfere I ll be separated Goodwin It would certainly serve him right ma am said Goodwin Whatever thoughts the threat of a separation might have awakened in mister Pott s mind he forbore to give utterance to them and contented himself by saying with great humility My dear will you hear me A fresh train of sobs was the only reply as missus Pott grew more hysterical requested to be informed why she was ever born and required sundry other pieces of information of a similar description My dear remonstrated mister Pott do not give way to these sensitive feelings I never believed that the paragraph had any foundation my dear impossible I was only angry my dear I may say outrageous with the INDEPENDENT people for daring to insert it that s all mister Pott cast an imploring look at the innocent cause of the mischief as if to entreat him to say nothing about the serpent And what steps sir do you mean to take to obtain redress inquired mister Winkle gaining courage as he saw Pott losing it Oh Goodwin observed missus Pott does he mean to horsewhip the editor of the INDEPENDENT does he Goodwin Hush hush ma am pray keep yourself quiet replied the bodyguard I dare say he will if you wish it ma am Certainly said Pott as his wife evinced decided symptoms of going off again Of course I shall When Goodwin when said missus Pott still undecided about the going off Immediately of course said mister Pott before the day is out Oh Goodwin resumed missus Pott it s the only way of meeting the slander and setting me right with the world Certainly ma am replied Goodwin No man as is a man ma am could refuse to do it So as the hysterics were still hovering about mister Pott said once more that he would do it but missus Pott was so overcome at the bare idea of having ever been suspected that she was half a dozen times on the very verge of a relapse and most unquestionably would have gone off had it not been for the indefatigable efforts of the assiduous Goodwin and repeated entreaties for pardon from the conquered Pott and finally when that unhappy individual had been frightened and snubbed down to his proper level missus Pott recovered and they went to breakfast You will not allow this base newspaper slander to shorten your stay here mister Winkle said missus Pott smiling through the traces of her tears I hope not said mister Pott actuated as he spoke by a wish that his visitor would choke himself with the morsel of dry toast which he was raising to his lips at the moment and so terminate his stay effectually I hope not You are very good said mister Winkle but a letter has been received from mister Pickwick so I learn by a note from mister Tupman which was brought up to my bedroom door this morning in which he requests us to join him at Bury to day and we are to leave by the coach at noon But you will come back said missus Pott Oh certainly replied mister Winkle You are quite sure said missus Pott stealing a tender look at her visitor Quite responded mister Winkle The breakfast passed off in silence for each of the party was brooding over his or her own personal grievances missus Pott was regretting the loss of a beau mister Pott his rash pledge to horsewhip the INDEPENDENT mister Winkle his having innocently placed himself in so awkward a situation Noon approached and after many adieux and promises to return he tore himself away If he ever comes back I ll poison him thought mister Pott as he turned into the little back office where he prepared his thunderbolts If I ever do come back and mix myself up with these people again thought mister Winkle as he wended his way to the Peacock I shall deserve to be horsewhipped myself that s all His friends were ready the coach was nearly so and in half an hour they were proceeding on their journey along the road over which mister Pickwick and Sam had so recently travelled and of which as we have already said something we do not feel called upon to extract mister Snodgrass s poetical and beautiful description mister Weller was standing at the door of the Angel ready to receive them and by that gentleman they were ushered to the apartment of mister Pickwick where to the no small surprise of mister Winkle and mister Snodgrass and the no small embarrassment of mister Tupman they found old Wardle and Trundle How are you said the old man grasping mister Tupman s hand Don t hang back or look sentimental about it it can t be helped old fellow For her sake I wish you d had her for your own I m very glad you have not A young fellow like you will do better one of these days eh With this conclusion Wardle slapped mister Tupman on the back and laughed heartily Well and how are you my fine fellows said the old gentleman shaking hands with mister Winkle and mister Snodgrass at the same time I have just been telling Pickwick that we must have you all down at Christmas We re going to have a wedding a real wedding this time A wedding exclaimed mister Snodgrass turning very pale Yes a wedding But don t be frightened said the good humoured old man it s only Trundle there and Bella Oh is that all said mister Snodgrass relieved from a painful doubt which had fallen heavily on his breast Give you joy Sir How is Joe Very well replied the old gentleman Sleepy as ever And your mother and the clergyman and all of em Quite well Where said mister Tupman with an effort where is SHE Sir and he turned away his head and covered his eyes with his hand SHE said the old gentleman with a knowing shake of the head Do you mean my single relative eh mister Tupman by a nod intimated that his question applied to the disappointed Rachael Oh she s gone away said the old gentleman She s living at a relation s far enough off She couldn t bear to see the girls so I let her go But come Here s the dinner You must be hungry after your ride I am without any ride at all so let us fall to Ample justice was done to the meal and when they were seated round the table after it had been disposed of mister Pickwick to the intense horror and indignation of his followers related the adventure he had undergone and the success which had attended the base artifices of the diabolical Jingle And the attack of rheumatism which I caught in that garden said mister Pickwick in conclusion renders me lame at this moment I too have had something of an adventure said mister Winkle with a smile and at the request of mister Pickwick he detailed the malicious libel of the Eatanswill INDEPENDENT and the consequent excitement of their friend the editor mister Pickwick s brow darkened during the recital His friends observed it and when mister Winkle had concluded maintained a profound silence mister Pickwick struck the table emphatically with his clenched fist and spoke as follows Is it not a wonderful circumstance said mister Pickwick that we seem destined to enter no man s house without involving him in some degree of trouble Does it not I ask bespeak the indiscretion or worse than that the blackness of heart that I should say so of my followers that beneath whatever roof they locate they disturb the peace of mind and happiness of some confiding female Is it not I say mister Pickwick would in all probability have gone on for some time had not the entrance of Sam with a letter caused him to break off in his eloquent discourse He passed his handkerchief across his forehead took off his spectacles wiped them and put them on again and his voice had recovered its wonted softness of tone when he said What have you there Sam Called at the post office just now and found this here letter as has laid there for two days replied mister Weller It s sealed vith a vafer and directed in round hand I don t know this hand said mister Pickwick opening the letter Mercy on us what s this It must be a jest it it can t be true What s the matter was the general inquiry Nobody dead is there said Wardle alarmed at the horror in mister Pickwick s countenance mister Pickwick made no reply but pushing the letter across the table and desiring mister Tupman to read it aloud fell back in his chair with a look of vacant astonishment quite alarming to behold mister Tupman with a trembling voice read the letter of which the following is a copy Freeman s Court Cornhill August twenty eighth eighteen twenty seven Bardell against Pickwick Sir Having been instructed by missus Martha Bardell to commence an action against you for a breach of promise of marriage for which the plaintiff lays her damages at fifteen hundred pounds we beg to inform you that a writ has been issued against you in this suit in the Court of Common Pleas and request to know by return of post the name of your attorney in London who will accept service thereof We are Sir Your obedient servants Dodson Fogg mister Samuel Pickwick There was something so impressive in the mute astonishment with which each man regarded his neighbour and every man regarded mister Pickwick that all seemed afraid to speak The silence was at length broken by mister Tupman Dodson and Fogg he repeated mechanically Bardell and Pickwick said mister Snodgrass musing Peace of mind and happiness of confiding females murmured mister Winkle with an air of abstraction It s a conspiracy said mister Pickwick at length recovering the power of speech a base conspiracy between these two grasping attorneys Dodson and Fogg missus Bardell would never do it she hasn t the heart to do it she hasn t the case to do it Ridiculous ridiculous Of her heart said Wardle with a smile you should certainly be the best judge I don t wish to discourage you but I should certainly say that of her case Dodson and Fogg are far better judges than any of us can be It s a vile attempt to extort money said mister Pickwick I hope it is said Wardle with a short dry cough Who ever heard me address her in any way but that in which a lodger would address his landlady continued mister Pickwick with great vehemence Who ever saw me with her Not even my friends here Except on one occasion said mister Tupman mister Pickwick changed colour Ah said mister Wardle Well that s important There was nothing suspicious then I suppose mister Tupman glanced timidly at his leader Why said he there was nothing suspicious but I don t know how it happened mind she certainly was reclining in his arms Gracious powers ejaculated mister Pickwick as the recollection of the scene in question struck forcibly upon him what a dreadful instance of the force of circumstances So she was so she was And our friend was soothing her anguish said mister Winkle rather maliciously So I was said mister Pickwick I don t deny it So I was Hollo said Wardle for a case in which there s nothing suspicious this looks rather queer eh Pickwick Ah sly dog sly dog and he laughed till the glasses on the sideboard rang again What a dreadful conjunction of appearances exclaimed mister Pickwick resting his chin upon his hands Winkle Tupman I beg your pardon for the observations I made just now We are all the victims of circumstances and I the greatest With this apology mister Pickwick buried his head in his hands and ruminated while Wardle measured out a regular circle of nods and winks addressed to the other members of the company I ll have it explained though said mister Pickwick raising his head and hammering the table I ll see this Dodson and Fogg I ll go to London to morrow Not to morrow said Wardle you re too lame Well then next day Next day is the first of September and you re pledged to ride out with us as far as Sir Geoffrey Manning s grounds at all events and to meet us at lunch if you don t take the field Well then the day after said mister Pickwick Thursday Sam Sir replied mister Weller Take two places outside to London on Thursday morning for yourself and me Wery well Sir mister Weller left the room and departed slowly on his errand with his hands in his pocket and his eyes fixed on the ground Rum feller the hemperor said mister Weller as he walked slowly up the street Think o his makin up to that ere missus Bardell vith a little boy too Always the vay vith these here old uns howsoever as is such steady goers to look at I didn t think he d ha done it though I didn t think he d ha done it Moralising in this strain mister Samuel Weller bent his steps towards the booking office CHAPTER XIX A PLEASANT DAY WITH AN UNPLEASANT TERMINATION The birds who happily for their own peace of mind and personal comfort were in blissful ignorance of the preparations which had been making to astonish them on the first of September hailed it no doubt as one of the pleasantest mornings they had seen that season Many a young partridge who strutted complacently among the stubble with all the finicking coxcombry of youth and many an older one who watched his levity out of his little round eye with the contemptuous air of a bird of wisdom and experience alike unconscious of their approaching doom basked in the fresh morning air with lively and blithesome feelings and a few hours afterwards were laid low upon the earth But we grow affecting let us proceed In plain commonplace matter of fact then it was a fine morning so fine that you would scarcely have believed that the few months of an English summer had yet flown by Hedges fields and trees hill and moorland presented to the eye their ever varying shades of deep rich green scarce a leaf had fallen scarce a sprinkle of yellow mingled with the hues of summer warned you that autumn had begun The sky was cloudless the sun shone out bright and warm the songs of birds the hum of myriads of summer insects filled the air and the cottage gardens crowded with flowers of every rich and beautiful tint sparkled in the heavy dew like beds of glittering jewels Everything bore the stamp of summer and none of its beautiful colour had yet faded from the die Such was the morning when an open carriage in which were three Pickwickians mister Snodgrass having preferred to remain at home mister Wardle and mister Trundle with Sam Weller on the box beside the driver pulled up by a gate at the roadside before which stood a tall raw boned gamekeeper and a half booted leather legginged boy each bearing a bag of capacious dimensions and accompanied by a brace of pointers I say whispered mister Winkle to Wardle as the man let down the steps they don t suppose we re going to kill game enough to fill those bags do they Fill them exclaimed old Wardle Bless you yes You shall fill one and I the other and when we ve done with them the pockets of our shooting jackets will hold as much more mister Winkle dismounted without saying anything in reply to this observation but he thought within himself that if the party remained in the open air till he had filled one of the bags they stood a considerable chance of catching colds in their heads Hi Juno lass hi old girl down Daph down said Wardle caressing the dogs Sir Geoffrey still in Scotland of course Martin The tall gamekeeper replied in the affirmative and looked with some surprise from mister Winkle who was holding his gun as if he wished his coat pocket to save him the trouble of pulling the trigger to mister Tupman who was holding his as if he was afraid of it as there is no earthly reason to doubt he really was My friends are not much in the way of this sort of thing yet Martin said Wardle noticing the look Live and learn you know They ll be good shots one of these days I beg my friend Winkle s pardon though he has had some practice mister Winkle smiled feebly over his blue neckerchief in acknowledgment of the compliment and got himself so mysteriously entangled with his gun in his modest confusion that if the piece had been loaded he must inevitably have shot himself dead upon the spot You mustn t handle your piece in that ere way when you come to have the charge in it Sir said the tall gamekeeper gruffly or I m damned if you won t make cold meat of some on us mister Winkle thus admonished abruptly altered his position and in so doing contrived to bring the barrel into pretty smart contact with mister Weller s head Hollo said Sam picking up his hat which had been knocked off and rubbing his temple Hollo sir if you comes it this vay you ll fill one o them bags and something to spare at one fire Here the leather legginged boy laughed very heartily and then tried to look as if it was somebody else whereat mister Winkle frowned majestically Where did you tell the boy to meet us with the snack Martin inquired Wardle Side of One tree Hill at twelve o clock Sir That s not Sir Geoffrey s land is it No Sir but it s close by it It s Captain Boldwig s land but there ll be nobody to interrupt us and there s a fine bit of turf there Very well said old Wardle Now the sooner we re off the better Will you join us at twelve then Pickwick mister Pickwick was particularly desirous to view the sport the more especially as he was rather anxious in respect of mister Winkle s life and limbs On so inviting a morning too it was very tantalising to turn back and leave his friends to enjoy themselves It was therefore with a very rueful air that he replied Why I suppose I must Ain t the gentleman a shot Sir inquired the long gamekeeper No replied Wardle and he s lame besides I should very much like to go said mister Pickwick very much There was a short pause of commiseration There s a barrow t other side the hedge said the boy If the gentleman s servant would wheel along the paths he could keep nigh us and we could lift it over the stiles and that The wery thing said mister Weller who was a party interested inasmuch as he ardently longed to see the sport The wery thing Well said Smallcheek I ll have it out in a minute But here a difficulty arose The long gamekeeper resolutely protested against the introduction into a shooting party of a gentleman in a barrow as a gross violation of all established rules and precedents It was a great objection but not an insurmountable one The gamekeeper having been coaxed and feed and having moreover eased his mind by punching the head of the inventive youth who had first suggested the use of the machine mister Pickwick was placed in it and off the party set Wardle and the long gamekeeper leading the way and mister Pickwick in the barrow propelled by Sam bringing up the rear Stop Sam said mister Pickwick when they had got half across the first field What s the matter now said Wardle I won t suffer this barrow to be moved another step said mister Pickwick resolutely unless Winkle carries that gun of his in a different manner How AM I to carry it said the wretched Winkle Carry it with the muzzle to the ground replied mister Pickwick It s so unsportsmanlike reasoned Winkle I don t care whether it s unsportsmanlike or not replied mister Pickwick I am not going to be shot in a wheel barrow for the sake of appearances to please anybody I know the gentleman ll put that ere charge into somebody afore he s done growled the long man Well well I don t mind said poor Winkle turning his gun stock uppermost there Anythin for a quiet life said mister Weller and on they went again Stop said mister Pickwick after they had gone a few yards farther What now said Wardle That gun of Tupman s is not safe I know it isn t said mister Pickwick Eh What not safe said mister Tupman in a tone of great alarm Not as you are carrying it said mister Pickwick I am very sorry to make any further objection but I cannot consent to go on unless you carry it as Winkle does his I think you had better sir said the long gamekeeper or you re quite as likely to lodge the charge in yourself as in anything else mister Tupman with the most obliging haste placed his piece in the position required and the party moved on again the two amateurs marching with reversed arms like a couple of privates at a royal funeral The dogs suddenly came to a dead stop and the party advancing stealthily a single pace stopped too What s the matter with the dogs legs whispered mister Winkle How queer they re standing Hush can t you replied Wardle softly Don t you see they re making a point Making a point said mister Winkle staring about him as if he expected to discover some particular beauty in the landscape which the sagacious animals were calling special attention to Making a point What are they pointing at Keep your eyes open said Wardle not heeding the question in the excitement of the moment Now then There was a sharp whirring noise that made mister Winkle start back as if he had been shot himself Bang bang went a couple of guns the smoke swept quickly away over the field and curled into the air Where are they said mister Winkle in a state of the highest excitement turning round and round in all directions Where are they Tell me when to fire Where are they where are they Where are they said Wardle taking up a brace of birds which the dogs had deposited at his feet Why here they are No no I mean the others said the bewildered Winkle Far enough off by this time replied Wardle coolly reloading his gun We shall very likely be up with another covey in five minutes said the long gamekeeper If the gentleman begins to fire now perhaps he ll just get the shot out of the barrel by the time they rise Ha ha ha roared mister Weller Sam said mister Pickwick compassionating his follower s confusion and embarrassment Sir Don t laugh Certainly not Sir So by way of indemnification mister Weller contorted his features from behind the wheel barrow for the exclusive amusement of the boy with the leggings who thereupon burst into a boisterous laugh and was summarily cuffed by the long gamekeeper who wanted a pretext for turning round to hide his own merriment Bravo old fellow said Wardle to mister Tupman you fired that time at all events Oh yes replied mister Tupman with conscious pride I let it off Well done You ll hit something next time if you look sharp Very easy ain t it Yes it s very easy said mister Tupman How it hurts one s shoulder though It nearly knocked me backwards I had no idea these small firearms kicked so Ah said the old gentleman smiling you ll get used to it in time Now then all ready all right with the barrow there All right Sir replied mister Weller Come along then Hold hard Sir said Sam raising the barrow Aye aye replied mister Pickwick and on they went as briskly as need be Keep that barrow back now cried Wardle when it had been hoisted over a stile into another field and mister Pickwick had been deposited in it once more All right sir replied mister Weller pausing Now Winkle said the old gentleman follow me softly and don t be too late this time Never fear said mister Winkle Are they pointing No no not now Quietly now quietly On they crept and very quietly they would have advanced if mister Winkle in the performance of some very intricate evolutions with his gun had not accidentally fired at the most critical moment over the boy s head exactly in the very spot where the tall man s brain would have been had he been there instead Why what on earth did you do that for said old Wardle as the birds flew unharmed away I never saw such a gun in my life replied poor mister Winkle looking at the lock as if that would do any good It goes off of its own accord It WILL do it Will do it echoed Wardle with something of irritation in his manner I wish it would kill something of its own accord It ll do that afore long Sir observed the tall man in a low prophetic voice What do you mean by that observation Sir inquired mister Winkle angrily Never mind Sir never mind replied the long gamekeeper I ve no family myself sir and this here boy s mother will get something handsome from Sir Geoffrey if he s killed on his land Load again Sir load again Take away his gun cried mister Pickwick from the barrow horror stricken at the long man s dark insinuations Take away his gun do you hear somebody Nobody however volunteered to obey the command and mister Winkle after darting a rebellious glance at mister Pickwick reloaded his gun and proceeded onwards with the rest We are bound on the authority of mister Pickwick to state that mister Tupman s mode of proceeding evinced far more of prudence and deliberation than that adopted by mister Winkle Still this by no means detracts from the great authority of the latter gentleman on all matters connected with the field because as mister Pickwick beautifully observes it has somehow or other happened from time immemorial that many of the best and ablest philosophers who have been perfect lights of science in matters of theory have been wholly unable to reduce them to practice mister Tupman s process like many of our most sublime discoveries was extremely simple With the quickness and penetration of a man of genius he had at once observed that the two great points to be attained were first to discharge his piece without injury to himself and secondly to do so without danger to the bystanders obviously the best thing to do after surmounting the difficulty of firing at all was to shut his eyes firmly and fire into the air On one occasion after performing this feat mister Tupman on opening his eyes beheld a plump partridge in the act of falling wounded to the ground He was on the point of congratulating mister Wardle on his invariable success when that gentleman advanced towards him and grasped him warmly by the hand Tupman said the old gentleman you singled out that particular bird No said mister Tupman no You did said Wardle I saw you do it I observed you pick him out I noticed you as you raised your piece to take aim and I will say this that the best shot in existence could not have done it more beautifully You are an older hand at this than I thought you Tupman you have been out before It was in vain for mister Tupman to protest with a smile of self denial that he never had The very smile was taken as evidence to the contrary and from that time forth his reputation was established It is not the only reputation that has been acquired as easily nor are such fortunate circumstances confined to partridge shooting Meanwhile mister Winkle flashed and blazed and smoked away without producing any material results worthy of being noted down sometimes expending his charge in mid air and at others sending it skimming along so near the surface of the ground as to place the lives of the two dogs on a rather uncertain and precarious tenure As a display of fancy shooting it was extremely varied and curious as an exhibition of firing with any precise object it was upon the whole perhaps a failure It is an established axiom that every bullet has its billet If it apply in an equal degree to shot those of mister Winkle were unfortunate foundlings deprived of their natural rights cast loose upon the world and billeted nowhere Well said Wardle walking up to the side of the barrow and wiping the streams of perspiration from his jolly red face smoking day isn t it It is indeed replied mister Pickwick The sun is tremendously hot even to me I don t know how you must feel it Why said the old gentleman pretty hot It s past twelve though You see that green hill there Certainly That s the place where we are to lunch and by Jove there s the boy with the basket punctual as clockwork So he is said mister Pickwick brightening up Good boy that I ll give him a shilling presently Now then Sam wheel away Hold on sir said mister Weller invigorated with the prospect of refreshments Out of the vay young leathers If you walley my precious life don t upset me as the general l m n said to the driver when they was a carryin him to Tyburn And quickening his pace to a sharp run mister Weller wheeled his master nimbly to the green hill shot him dexterously out by the very side of the basket and proceeded to unpack it with the utmost despatch Weal pie said mister Weller soliloquising as he arranged the eatables on the grass Wery good thing is weal pie when you know the lady as made it and is quite sure it ain t kittens and arter all though where s the odds when they re so like weal that the wery piemen themselves don t know the difference Don t they Sam said mister Pickwick Not they sir replied mister Weller touching his hat I lodged in the same house vith a pieman once sir and a wery nice man he was reg lar clever chap too make pies out o anything he could What a number o cats you keep mister Brooks says I when I d got intimate with him Ah says he I do a good many says he You must be wery fond o cats says I Other people is says he a winkin at me they ain t in season till the winter though says he Not in season says I No says he fruits is in cats is out Why what do you mean says I Mean says he That I ll never be a party to the combination o the butchers to keep up the price o meat says he mister Weller says he a squeezing my hand wery hard and vispering in my ear don t mention this here agin but it s the seasonin as does it They re all made o them noble animals says he a pointin to a wery nice little tabby kitten and I seasons em for beefsteak weal or kidney cording to the demand And more than that says he I can make a weal a beef steak or a beef steak a kidney or any one on em a mutton at a minute s notice just as the market changes and appetites wary He must have been a very ingenious young man that Sam said mister Pickwick with a slight shudder Just was sir replied mister Weller continuing his occupation of emptying the basket and the pies was beautiful Tongue well that s a wery good thing when it ain t a woman s Bread knuckle o ham reg lar picter cold beef in slices wery good What s in them stone jars young touch and go Beer in this one replied the boy taking from his shoulder a couple of large stone bottles fastened together by a leathern strap cold punch in t other And a wery good notion of a lunch it is take it altogether said mister Weller surveying his arrangement of the repast with great satisfaction Now general l m n fall on as the English said to the French when they fixed bagginets It needed no second invitation to induce the party to yield full justice to the meal and as little pressing did it require to induce mister Weller the long gamekeeper and the two boys to station themselves on the grass at a little distance and do good execution upon a decent proportion of the viands An old oak afforded a pleasant shelter to the group and a rich prospect of arable and meadow land intersected with luxuriant hedges and richly ornamented with wood lay spread out before them This is delightful thoroughly delightful said mister Pickwick the skin of whose expressive countenance was rapidly peeling off with exposure to the sun So it is so it is old fellow replied Wardle Come a glass of punch With great pleasure said mister Pickwick the satisfaction of whose countenance after drinking it bore testimony to the sincerity of the reply Good said mister Pickwick smacking his lips Very good I ll take another Cool very cool Come gentlemen continued mister Pickwick still retaining his hold upon the jar a toast Our friends at Dingley Dell The toast was drunk with loud acclamations I ll tell you what I shall do to get up my shooting again said mister Winkle who was eating bread and ham with a pocket knife I ll put a stuffed partridge on the top of a post and practise at it beginning at a short distance and lengthening it by degrees I understand it s capital practice I know a general l man Sir said mister Weller as did that and begun at two yards but he never tried it on agin for he blowed the bird right clean away at the first fire and nobody ever seed a feather on him arterwards Sam said mister Pickwick Sir replied mister Weller Have the goodness to reserve your anecdotes till they are called for Cert nly sir Here mister Weller winked the eye which was not concealed by the beer can he was raising to his lips with such exquisite facetiousness that the two boys went into spontaneous convulsions and even the long man condescended to smile Well that certainly is most capital cold punch said mister Pickwick looking earnestly at the stone bottle and the day is extremely warm and Tupman my dear friend a glass of punch With the greatest delight replied mister Tupman and having drank that glass mister Pickwick took another just to see whether there was any orange peel in the punch because orange peel always disagreed with him and finding that there was not mister Pickwick took another glass to the health of their absent friend and then felt himself imperatively called upon to propose another in honour of the punch compounder unknown This constant succession of glasses produced considerable effect upon mister Pickwick his countenance beamed with the most sunny smiles laughter played around his lips and good humoured merriment twinkled in his eye Yielding by degrees to the influence of the exciting liquid rendered more so by the heat mister Pickwick expressed a strong desire to recollect a song which he had heard in his infancy and the attempt proving abortive sought to stimulate his memory with more glasses of punch which appeared to have quite a contrary effect for from forgetting the words of the song he began to forget how to articulate any words at all and finally after rising to his legs to address the company in an eloquent speech he fell into the barrow and fast asleep simultaneously The basket having been repacked and it being found perfectly impossible to awaken mister Pickwick from his torpor some discussion took place whether it would be better for mister Weller to wheel his master back again or to leave him where he was until they should all be ready to return The latter course was at length decided on and as the further expedition was not to exceed an hour s duration and as mister Weller begged very hard to be one of the party it was determined to leave mister Pickwick asleep in the barrow and to call for him on their return So away they went leaving mister Pickwick snoring most comfortably in the shade That mister Pickwick would have continued to snore in the shade until his friends came back or in default thereof until the shades of evening had fallen on the landscape there appears no reasonable cause to doubt always supposing that he had been suffered to remain there in peace But he was NOT suffered to remain there in peace And this was what prevented him Captain Boldwig was a little fierce man in a stiff black neckerchief and blue surtout who when he did condescend to walk about his property did it in company with a thick rattan stick with a brass ferrule and a gardener and sub gardener with meek faces to whom the gardeners not the stick Captain Boldwig gave his orders with all due grandeur and ferocity for Captain Boldwig s wife s sister had married a marquis and the captain s house was a villa and his land grounds and it was all very high and mighty and great mister Pickwick had not been asleep half an hour when little Captain Boldwig followed by the two gardeners came striding along as fast as his size and importance would let him and when he came near the oak tree Captain Boldwig paused and drew a long breath and looked at the prospect as if he thought the prospect ought to be highly gratified at having him to take notice of it and then he struck the ground emphatically with his stick and summoned the head gardener Hunt said Captain Boldwig Yes Sir said the gardener Roll this place to morrow morning do you hear Hunt Yes Sir And take care that you keep this place in good order do you hear Hunt Yes Sir And remind me to have a board done about trespassers and spring guns and all that sort of thing to keep the common people out Do you hear Hunt do you hear I ll not forget it Sir I beg your pardon Sir said the other man advancing with his hand to his hat Well Wilkins what s the matter with you said Captain Boldwig I beg your pardon sir but I think there have been trespassers here to day Ha said the captain scowling around him Yes sir they have been dining here I think sir Why damn their audacity so they have said Captain Boldwig as the crumbs and fragments that were strewn upon the grass met his eye They have actually been devouring their food here I wish I had the vagabonds here said the captain clenching the thick stick I wish I had the vagabonds here said the captain wrathfully Beg your pardon sir said Wilkins but But what Eh roared the captain and following the timid glance of Wilkins his eyes encountered the wheel barrow and mister Pickwick Who are you you rascal said the captain administering several pokes to mister Pickwick s body with the thick stick What s your name Cold punch murmured mister Pickwick as he sank to sleep again What demanded Captain Boldwig No reply What did he say his name was asked the captain Punch I think sir replied Wilkins That s his impudence that s his confounded impudence said Captain Boldwig He s only feigning to be asleep now said the captain in a high passion He s drunk he s a drunken plebeian Wheel him away Wilkins wheel him away directly Where shall I wheel him to sir inquired Wilkins with great timidity Wheel him to the devil replied Captain Boldwig Very well sir said Wilkins Stay said the captain Wilkins stopped accordingly Wheel him said the captain wheel him to the pound and let us see whether he calls himself Punch when he comes to himself He shall not bully me he shall not bully me Wheel him away Away mister Pickwick was wheeled in compliance with this imperious mandate and the great Captain Boldwig swelling with indignation proceeded on his walk Inexpressible was the astonishment of the little party when they returned to find that mister Pickwick had disappeared and taken the wheel barrow with him It was the most mysterious and unaccountable thing that was ever heard of For a lame man to have got upon his legs without any previous notice and walked off would have been most extraordinary but when it came to his wheeling a heavy barrow before him by way of amusement it grew positively miraculous They searched every nook and corner round together and separately they shouted whistled laughed called and all with the same result mister Pickwick was not to be found After some hours of fruitless search they arrived at the unwelcome conclusion that they must go home without him Meanwhile mister Pickwick had been wheeled to the pound and safely deposited therein fast asleep in the wheel barrow to the immeasurable delight and satisfaction not only of all the boys in the village but three fourths of the whole population who had gathered round in expectation of his waking If their most intense gratification had been awakened by seeing him wheeled in how many hundredfold was their joy increased when after a few indistinct cries of Sam he sat up in the barrow and gazed with indescribable astonishment on the faces before him A general shout was of course the signal of his having woke up and his involuntary inquiry of What s the matter occasioned another louder than the first if possible Here s a game roared the populace Where am I exclaimed mister Pickwick In the pound replied the mob How came I here What was I doing Where was I brought from Boldwig Captain Boldwig was the only reply Let me out cried mister Pickwick Where s my servant Where are my friends You ain t got no friends Hurrah Then there came a turnip then a potato and then an egg with a few other little tokens of the playful disposition of the many headed How long this scene might have lasted or how much mister Pickwick might have suffered no one can tell had not a carriage which was driving swiftly by suddenly pulled up from whence there descended old Wardle and Sam Weller the former of whom in far less time than it takes to write it if not to read it had made his way to mister Pickwick s side and placed him in the vehicle just as the latter had concluded the third and last round of a single combat with the town beadle Run to the justice s cried a dozen voices Ah run avay said mister Weller jumping up on the box Give my compliments mister Veller s compliments to the justice and tell him I ve spiled his beadle and that if he ll swear in a new un I ll come back again to morrow and spile him Drive on old feller I ll give directions for the commencement of an action for false imprisonment against this Captain Boldwig directly I get to London said mister Pickwick as soon as the carriage turned out of the town We were trespassing it seems said Wardle I don t care said mister Pickwick I ll bring the action No you won t said Wardle I will by But as there was a humorous expression in Wardle s face mister Pickwick checked himself and said Why not Because said old Wardle half bursting with laughter because they might turn on some of us and say we had taken too much cold punch Do what he would a smile would come into mister Pickwick s face the smile extended into a laugh the laugh into a roar the roar became general So to keep up their good humour they stopped at the first roadside tavern they came to and ordered a glass of brandy and water all round with a magnum of extra strength for mister Samuel Weller CHAPTER XX SHOWING HOW DODSON AND FOGG WERE MEN OF BUSINESS AND THEIR CLERKS MEN OF PLEASURE AND HOW AN AFFECTING INTERVIEW TOOK PLACE BETWEEN mister WELLER AND HIS LONG LOST PARENT SHOWING ALSO WHAT CHOICE SPIRITS ASSEMBLED AT THE MAGPIE AND STUMP AND WHAT A CAPITAL CHAPTER THE NEXT ONE WILL BE In the ground floor front of a dingy house at the very farthest end of Freeman s Court Cornhill sat the four clerks of Messrs Dodson Fogg two of his Majesty s attorneys of the courts of King s Bench and Common Pleas at Westminster and solicitors of the High Court of Chancery the aforesaid clerks catching as favourable glimpses of heaven s light and heaven s sun in the course of their daily labours as a man might hope to do were he placed at the bottom of a reasonably deep well and without the opportunity of perceiving the stars in the day time which the latter secluded situation affords The clerks office of Messrs Dodson Fogg was a dark mouldy earthy smelling room with a high wainscotted partition to screen the clerks from the vulgar gaze a couple of old wooden chairs a very loud ticking clock an almanac an umbrella stand a row of hat pegs and a few shelves on which were deposited several ticketed bundles of dirty papers some old deal boxes with paper labels and sundry decayed stone ink bottles of various shapes and sizes There was a glass door leading into the passage which formed the entrance to the court and on the outer side of this glass door mister Pickwick closely followed by Sam Weller presented himself on the Friday morning succeeding the occurrence of which a faithful narration is given in the last chapter Come in can t you cried a voice from behind the partition in reply to mister Pickwick s gentle tap at the door And mister Pickwick and Sam entered accordingly mister Dodson or mister Fogg at home sir inquired mister Pickwick gently advancing hat in hand towards the partition mister Dodson ain t at home and mister Fogg s particularly engaged replied the voice and at the same time the head to which the voice belonged with a pen behind its ear looked over the partition and at mister Pickwick It was a ragged head the sandy hair of which scrupulously parted on one side and flattened down with pomatum was twisted into little semi circular tails round a flat face ornamented with a pair of small eyes and garnished with a very dirty shirt collar and a rusty black stock mister Dodson ain t at home and mister Fogg s particularly engaged said the man to whom the head belonged When will mister Dodson be back sir inquired mister Pickwick Can t say Will it be long before mister Fogg is disengaged Sir Don t know Here the man proceeded to mend his pen with great deliberation while another clerk who was mixing a Seidlitz powder under cover of the lid of his desk laughed approvingly I think I ll wait said mister Pickwick There was no reply so mister Pickwick sat down unbidden and listened to the loud ticking of the clock and the murmured conversation of the clerks That was a game wasn t it said one of the gentlemen in a brown coat and brass buttons inky drabs and bluchers at the conclusion of some inaudible relation of his previous evening s adventures Devilish good devilish good said the Seidlitz powder man Tom Cummins was in the chair said the man with the brown coat It was half past four when I got to Somers Town and then I was so uncommon lushy that I couldn t find the place where the latch key went in and was obliged to knock up the old ooman I say I wonder what old Fogg ud say if he knew it I should get the sack I s pose eh At this humorous notion all the clerks laughed in concert There was such a game with Fogg here this mornin said the man in the brown coat while Jack was upstairs sorting the papers and you two were gone to the stamp office Fogg was down here opening the letters when that chap as we issued the writ against at Camberwell you know came in what s his name again Ramsey said the clerk who had spoken to mister Pickwick Ah Ramsey a precious seedy looking customer Well sir says old Fogg looking at him very fierce you know his way well Sir have you come to settle Yes I have sir said Ramsey putting his hand in his pocket and bringing out the money the debt s two pound ten and the costs three pound five and here it is Sir and he sighed like bricks as he lugged out the money done up in a bit of blotting paper Old Fogg looked first at the money and then at him and then he coughed in his rum way so that I knew something was coming You don t know there s a declaration filed which increases the costs materially I suppose said Fogg You don t say that sir said Ramsey starting back the time was only out last night Sir I do say it though said Fogg my clerk s just gone to file it Hasn t mister Jackson gone to file that declaration in Bullman and Ramsey mister Wicks Of course I said yes and then Fogg coughed again and looked at Ramsey My God said Ramsey and here have I nearly driven myself mad scraping this money together and all to no purpose None at all said Fogg coolly so you had better go back and scrape some more together and bring it here in time I can t get it by God said Ramsey striking the desk with his fist Don t bully me sir said Fogg getting into a passion on purpose I am not bullying you sir said Ramsey You are said Fogg get out sir get out of this office Sir and come back Sir when you know how to behave yourself Well Ramsey tried to speak but Fogg wouldn t let him so he put the money in his pocket and sneaked out The door was scarcely shut when old Fogg turned round to me with a sweet smile on his face and drew the declaration out of his coat pocket Here Wicks says Fogg take a cab and go down to the Temple as quick as you can and file that The costs are quite safe for he s a steady man with a large family at a salary of five and twenty shillings a week and if he gives us a warrant of attorney as he must in the end I know his employers will see it paid so we may as well get all we can get out of him mister Wicks it s a Christian act to do it mister Wicks for with his large family and small income he ll be all the better for a good lesson against getting into debt won t he mister Wicks won t he and he smiled so good naturedly as he went away that it was delightful to see him He is a capital man of business said Wicks in a tone of the deepest admiration capital isn t he The other three cordially subscribed to this opinion and the anecdote afforded the most unlimited satisfaction Nice men these here Sir whispered mister Weller to his master wery nice notion of fun they has Sir mister Pickwick nodded assent and coughed to attract the attention of the young gentlemen behind the partition who having now relaxed their minds by a little conversation among themselves condescended to take some notice of the stranger I wonder whether Fogg s disengaged now said Jackson I ll see said Wicks dismounting leisurely from his stool What name shall I tell mister Fogg Pickwick replied the illustrious subject of these memoirs mister Jackson departed upstairs on his errand and immediately returned with a message that mister Fogg would see mister Pickwick in five minutes and having delivered it returned again to his desk What did he say his name was whispered Wicks Pickwick replied Jackson it s the defendant in Bardell and Pickwick A sudden scraping of feet mingled with the sound of suppressed laughter was heard from behind the partition They re a twiggin of you Sir whispered mister Weller Twigging of me Sam replied mister Pickwick what do you mean by twigging me mister Weller replied by pointing with his thumb over his shoulder and mister Pickwick on looking up became sensible of the pleasing fact that all the four clerks with countenances expressive of the utmost amusement and with their heads thrust over the wooden screen were minutely inspecting the figure and general appearance of the supposed trifler with female hearts and disturber of female happiness On his looking up the row of heads suddenly disappeared and the sound of pens travelling at a furious rate over paper immediately succeeded A sudden ring at the bell which hung in the office summoned mister Jackson to the apartment of Fogg from whence he came back to say that he Fogg was ready to see mister Pickwick if he would step upstairs Upstairs mister Pickwick did step accordingly leaving Sam Weller below The room door of the one pair back bore inscribed in legible characters the imposing words mister Fogg and having tapped thereat and been desired to come in Jackson ushered mister Pickwick into the presence Is mister Dodson in inquired mister Fogg Just come in Sir replied Jackson Ask him to step here Yes sir Exit Jackson Take a seat sir said Fogg there is the paper sir my partner will be here directly and we can converse about this matter sir mister Pickwick took a seat and the paper but instead of reading the latter peeped over the top of it and took a survey of the man of business who was an elderly pimply faced vegetable diet sort of man in a black coat dark mixture trousers and small black gaiters a kind of being who seemed to be an essential part of the desk at which he was writing and to have as much thought or feeling After a few minutes silence mister Dodson a plump portly stern looking man with a loud voice appeared and the conversation commenced This is mister Pickwick said Fogg Ah You are the defendant Sir in Bardell and Pickwick said Dodson I am sir replied mister Pickwick Well sir said Dodson and what do you propose Ah said Fogg thrusting his hands into his trousers pockets and throwing himself back in his chair what do you propose mister Pickwick Hush Fogg said Dodson let me hear what mister Pickwick has to say I came gentlemen said mister Pickwick gazing placidly on the two partners I came here gentlemen to express the surprise with which I received your letter of the other day and to inquire what grounds of action you can have against me Grounds of Fogg had ejaculated this much when he was stopped by Dodson mister Fogg said Dodson I am going to speak I beg your pardon mister Dodson said Fogg For the grounds of action sir continued Dodson with moral elevation in his air you will consult your own conscience and your own feelings We Sir we are guided entirely by the statement of our client That statement Sir may be true or it may be false it may be credible or it may be incredible but if it be true and if it be credible I do not hesitate to say Sir that our grounds of action Sir are strong and not to be shaken You may be an unfortunate man Sir or you may be a designing one but if I were called upon as a juryman upon my oath Sir to express an opinion of your conduct Sir I do not hesitate to assert that I should have but one opinion about it Here Dodson drew himself up with an air of offended virtue and looked at Fogg who thrust his hands farther in his pockets and nodding his head sagely said in a tone of the fullest concurrence Most certainly Well Sir said mister Pickwick with considerable pain depicted in his countenance you will permit me to assure you that I am a most unfortunate man so far as this case is concerned I hope you are Sir replied Dodson I trust you may be Sir If you are really innocent of what is laid to your charge you are more unfortunate than I had believed any man could possibly be What do you say mister Fogg I say precisely what you say replied Fogg with a smile of incredulity The writ Sir which commences the action continued Dodson was issued regularly mister Fogg where is the PRAECIPE book Here it is said Fogg handing over a square book with a parchment cover Here is the entry resumed Dodson Middlesex Capias MARTHA BARDELL WIDOW v SAMUEL PICKWICK Damages fifteen hundred Dodson Fogg for the plaintiff Aug twenty eight eighteen twenty seven All regular Sir perfectly Dodson coughed and looked at Fogg who said Perfectly also And then they both looked at mister Pickwick I am to understand then said mister Pickwick that it really is your intention to proceed with this action Understand sir that you certainly may replied Dodson with something as near a smile as his importance would allow And that the damages are actually laid at fifteen hundred pounds said mister Pickwick To which understanding you may add my assurance that if we could have prevailed upon our client they would have been laid at treble the amount sir replied Dodson I believe missus Bardell specially said however observed Fogg glancing at Dodson that she would not compromise for a farthing less Unquestionably replied Dodson sternly For the action was only just begun and it wouldn t have done to let mister Pickwick compromise it then even if he had been so disposed As you offer no terms sir said Dodson displaying a slip of parchment in his right hand and affectionately pressing a paper copy of it on mister Pickwick with his left I had better serve you with a copy of this writ sir Here is the original sir Very well gentlemen very well said mister Pickwick rising in person and wrath at the same time you shall hear from my solicitor gentlemen We shall be very happy to do so said Fogg rubbing his hands Very said Dodson opening the door And before I go gentlemen said the excited mister Pickwick turning round on the landing permit me to say that of all the disgraceful and rascally proceedings Stay sir stay interposed Dodson with great politeness mister Jackson mister Wicks Sir said the two clerks appearing at the bottom of the stairs I merely want you to hear what this gentleman says replied Dodson Pray go on sir disgraceful and rascally proceedings I think you said I did said mister Pickwick thoroughly roused I said Sir that of all the disgraceful and rascally proceedings that ever were attempted this is the most so I repeat it sir You hear that mister Wicks said Dodson You won t forget these expressions mister Jackson said Fogg Perhaps you would like to call us swindlers sir said Dodson Pray do Sir if you feel disposed now pray do Sir I do said mister Pickwick You ARE swindlers Very good said Dodson You can hear down there I hope mister Wicks Oh yes Sir said Wicks You had better come up a step or two higher if you can t added mister Fogg Go on Sir do go on You had better call us thieves Sir or perhaps You would like to assault one Of US Pray do it Sir if you would we will not make the smallest resistance Pray do it Sir As Fogg put himself very temptingly within the reach of mister Pickwick s clenched fist there is little doubt that that gentleman would have complied with his earnest entreaty but for the interposition of Sam who hearing the dispute emerged from the office mounted the stairs and seized his master by the arm You just come away said mister Weller Battledore and shuttlecock s a wery good game vhen you ain t the shuttlecock and two lawyers the battledores in which case it gets too excitin to be pleasant Come avay Sir If you want to ease your mind by blowing up somebody come out into the court and blow up me but it s rayther too expensive work to be carried on here And without the slightest ceremony mister Weller hauled his master down the stairs and down the court and having safely deposited him in Cornhill fell behind prepared to follow whithersoever he should lead mister Pickwick walked on abstractedly crossed opposite the Mansion House and bent his steps up Cheapside Sam began to wonder where they were going when his master turned round and said Sam I will go immediately to mister Perker s That s just exactly the wery place vere you ought to have gone last night Sir replied mister Weller I think it is Sam said mister Pickwick I KNOW it is said mister Weller Well well Sam replied mister Pickwick we will go there at once but first as I have been rather ruffled I should like a glass of brandy and water warm Sam Where can I have it Sam mister Weller s knowledge of London was extensive and peculiar He replied without the slightest consideration Second court on the right hand side last house but vun on the same side the vay take the box as stands in the first fireplace cos there ain t no leg in the middle o the table which all the others has and it s wery inconvenient mister Pickwick observed his valet s directions implicitly and bidding Sam follow him entered the tavern he had pointed out where the hot brandy and water was speedily placed before him while mister Weller seated at a respectful distance though at the same table with his master was accommodated with a pint of porter The room was one of a very homely description and was apparently under the especial patronage of stage coachmen for several gentleman who had all the appearance of belonging to that learned profession were drinking and smoking in the different boxes Among the number was one stout red faced elderly man in particular seated in an opposite box who attracted mister Pickwick s attention The stout man was smoking with great vehemence but between every half dozen puffs he took his pipe from his mouth and looked first at mister Weller and then at mister Pickwick Then he would bury in a quart pot as much of his countenance as the dimensions of the quart pot admitted of its receiving and take another look at Sam and mister Pickwick Then he would take another half dozen puffs with an air of profound meditation and look at them again At last the stout man putting up his legs on the seat and leaning his back against the wall began to puff at his pipe without leaving off at all and to stare through the smoke at the new comers as if he had made up his mind to see the most he could of them At first the evolutions of the stout man had escaped mister Weller s observation but by degrees as he saw mister Pickwick s eyes every now and then turning towards him he began to gaze in the same direction at the same time shading his eyes with his hand as if he partially recognised the object before him and wished to make quite sure of its identity His doubts were speedily dispelled however for the stout man having blown a thick cloud from his pipe a hoarse voice like some strange effort of ventriloquism emerged from beneath the capacious shawls which muffled his throat and chest and slowly uttered these sounds Wy Sammy Who s that Sam inquired mister Pickwick Why I wouldn t ha believed it Sir replied mister Weller with astonished eyes It s the old un Old one said mister Pickwick What old one My father sir replied mister Weller How are you my ancient And with this beautiful ebullition of filial affection mister Weller made room on the seat beside him for the stout man who advanced pipe in mouth and pot in hand to greet him Wy Sammy said the father I ha n t seen you for two year and better Nor more you have old codger replied the son How s mother in law Wy I ll tell you what Sammy said mister Weller senior with much solemnity in his manner there never was a nicer woman as a widder than that ere second wentur o mine a sweet creetur she was Sammy all I can say on her now is that as she was such an uncommon pleasant widder it s a great pity she ever changed her condition She don t act as a vife Sammy Don t she though inquired mister Weller junior The elder mister Weller shook his head as he replied with a sigh I ve done it once too often Sammy I ve done it once too often Take example by your father my boy and be wery careful o widders all your life specially if they ve kept a public house Sammy Having delivered this parental advice with great pathos mister Weller senior refilled his pipe from a tin box he carried in his pocket and lighting his fresh pipe from the ashes of the old One commenced smoking at a great rate Beg your pardon sir he said renewing the subject and addressing mister Pickwick after a considerable pause nothin personal I hope sir I hope you ha n t got a widder sir Not I replied mister Pickwick laughing and while mister Pickwick laughed Sam Weller informed his parent in a whisper of the relation in which he stood towards that gentleman Beg your pardon sir said mister Weller senior taking off his hat I hope you ve no fault to find with Sammy Sir None whatever said mister Pickwick Wery glad to hear it sir replied the old man I took a good deal o pains with his eddication sir let him run in the streets when he was wery young and shift for hisself It s the only way to make a boy sharp sir Rather a dangerous process I should imagine said mister Pickwick with a smile And not a wery sure one neither added mister Weller I got reg larly done the other day No said his father I did said the son and he proceeded to relate in as few words as possible how he had fallen a ready dupe to the stratagems of Job Trotter mister Weller senior listened to the tale with the most profound attention and at its termination said Worn t one o these chaps slim and tall with long hair and the gift o the gab wery gallopin mister Pickwick did not quite understand the last item of description but comprehending the first said Yes at a venture T other s a black haired chap in mulberry livery with a wery large head Yes yes he is said mister Pickwick and Sam with great earnestness Then I know where they are and that s all about it said mister Weller they re at Ipswich safe enough them two No said mister Pickwick Fact said mister Weller and I ll tell you how I know it I work an Ipswich coach now and then for a friend o mine I worked down the wery day arter the night as you caught the rheumatic and at the Black Boy at Chelmsford the wery place they d come to I took em up right through to Ipswich where the man servant him in the mulberries told me they was a goin to put up for a long time I ll follow him said mister Pickwick we may as well see Ipswich as any other place I ll follow him You re quite certain it was them governor inquired mister Weller junior Quite Sammy quite replied his father for their appearance is wery sing ler besides that ere I wondered to see the general l m n so formiliar with his servant and more than that as they sat in the front right behind the box I heerd em laughing and saying how they d done old Fireworks Old who said mister Pickwick Old Fireworks Sir by which I ve no doubt they meant you Sir There is nothing positively vile or atrocious in the appellation of old Fireworks but still it is by no means a respectful or flattering designation The recollection of all the wrongs he had sustained at Jingle s hands had crowded on mister Pickwick s mind the moment mister Weller began to speak it wanted but a feather to turn the scale and old Fireworks did it I ll follow him said mister Pickwick with an emphatic blow on the table I shall work down to Ipswich the day arter to morrow Sir said mister Weller the elder from the Bull in Whitechapel and if you really mean to go you d better go with me So we had said mister Pickwick very true I can write to Bury and tell them to meet me at Ipswich We will go with you But don t hurry away mister Weller won t you take anything You re wery good Sir replied mister W stopping short perhaps a small glass of brandy to drink your health and success to Sammy Sir wouldn t be amiss Certainly not replied mister Pickwick A glass of brandy here The brandy was brought and mister Weller after pulling his hair to mister Pickwick and nodding to Sam jerked it down his capacious throat as if it had been a small thimbleful Well done father said Sam take care old fellow or you ll have a touch of your old complaint the gout I ve found a sov rin cure for that Sammy said mister Weller setting down the glass A sovereign cure for the gout said mister Pickwick hastily producing his note book what is it The gout Sir replied mister Weller the gout is a complaint as arises from too much ease and comfort If ever you re attacked with the gout sir jist you marry a widder as has got a good loud woice with a decent notion of usin it and you ll never have the gout agin It s a capital prescription sir I takes it reg lar and I can warrant it to drive away any illness as is caused by too much jollity Having imparted this valuable secret mister Weller drained his glass once more produced a laboured wink sighed deeply and slowly retired Well what do you think of what your father says Sam inquired mister Pickwick with a smile Think Sir replied mister Weller why I think he s the wictim o connubiality as Blue Beard s domestic chaplain said vith a tear of pity ven he buried him There was no replying to this very apposite conclusion and therefore mister Pickwick after settling the reckoning resumed his walk to Gray s Inn By the time he reached its secluded groves however eight o clock had struck and the unbroken stream of gentlemen in muddy high lows soiled white hats and rusty apparel who were pouring towards the different avenues of egress warned him that the majority of the offices had closed for that day After climbing two pairs of steep and dirty stairs he found his anticipations were realised mister Perker s outer door was closed and the dead silence which followed mister Weller s repeated kicks thereat announced that the officials had retired from business for the night This is pleasant Sam said mister Pickwick I shouldn t lose an hour in seeing him I shall not be able to get one wink of sleep to night I know unless I have the satisfaction of reflecting that I have confided this matter to a professional man Here s an old ooman comin upstairs sir replied mister Weller p raps she knows where we can find somebody Hollo old lady vere s mister Perker s people mister Perker s people said a thin miserable looking old woman stopping to recover breath after the ascent of the staircase mister Perker s people s gone and I m a goin to do the office out Are you mister Perker s servant inquired mister Pickwick I am mister Perker s laundress replied the woman Ah said mister Pickwick half aside to Sam it s a curious circumstance Sam that they call the old women in these inns laundresses I wonder what s that for Cos they has a mortal awersion to washing anythin I suppose Sir replied mister Weller I shouldn t wonder said mister Pickwick looking at the old woman whose appearance as well as the condition of the office which she had by this time opened indicated a rooted antipathy to the application of soap and water do you know where I can find mister Perker my good woman No I don t replied the old woman gruffly he s out o town now That s unfortunate said mister Pickwick where s his clerk Do you know Yes I know where he is but he won t thank me for telling you replied the laundress I have very particular business with him said mister Pickwick Won t it do in the morning said the woman Not so well replied mister Pickwick Well said the old woman if it was anything very particular I was to say where he was so I suppose there s no harm in telling If you just go to the Magpie and Stump and ask at the bar for mister Lowten they ll show you in to him and he s mister Perker s clerk With this direction and having been furthermore informed that the hostelry in question was situated in a court happy in the double advantage of being in the vicinity of Clare Market and closely approximating to the back of New Inn mister Pickwick and Sam descended the rickety staircase in safety and issued forth in quest of the Magpie and Stump This favoured tavern sacred to the evening orgies of mister Lowten and his companions was what ordinary people would designate a public house That the landlord was a man of money making turn was sufficiently testified by the fact of a small bulkhead beneath the tap room window in size and shape not unlike a sedan chair being underlet to a mender of shoes and that he was a being of a philanthropic mind was evident from the protection he afforded to a pieman who vended his delicacies without fear of interruption on the very door step In the lower windows which were decorated with curtains of a saffron hue dangled two or three printed cards bearing reference to Devonshire cider and Dantzic spruce while a large blackboard announcing in white letters to an enlightened public that there were five hundred thousand barrels of double stout in the cellars of the establishment left the mind in a state of not unpleasing doubt and uncertainty as to the precise direction in the bowels of the earth in which this mighty cavern might be supposed to extend When we add that the weather beaten signboard bore the half obliterated semblance of a magpie intently eyeing a crooked streak of brown paint which the neighbours had been taught from infancy to consider as the stump we have said all that need be said of the exterior of the edifice On mister Pickwick s presenting himself at the bar an elderly female emerged from behind the screen therein and presented herself before him Is mister Lowten here ma am inquired mister Pickwick Yes he is Sir replied the landlady Here Charley show the gentleman in to mister Lowten The general l m n can t go in just now said a shambling pot boy with a red head cos mister Lowten s a singin a comic song and he ll put him out He ll be done directly Sir The red headed pot boy had scarcely finished speaking when a most unanimous hammering of tables and jingling of glasses announced that the song had that instant terminated and mister Pickwick after desiring Sam to solace himself in the tap suffered himself to be conducted into the presence of mister Lowten At the announcement of A gentleman to speak to you Sir a puffy faced young man who filled the chair at the head of the table looked with some surprise in the direction from whence the voice proceeded and the surprise seemed to be by no means diminished when his eyes rested on an individual whom he had never seen before I beg your pardon Sir said mister Pickwick and I am very sorry to disturb the other gentlemen too but I come on very particular business and if you will suffer me to detain you at this end of the room for five minutes I shall be very much obliged to you The puffy faced young man rose and drawing a chair close to mister Pickwick in an obscure corner of the room listened attentively to his tale of woe Ah he said when mister Pickwick had concluded Dodson and Fogg sharp practice theirs capital men of business Dodson and Fogg sir mister Pickwick admitted the sharp practice of Dodson and Fogg and Lowten resumed Perker ain t in town and he won t be neither before the end of next week but if you want the action defended and will leave the copy with me I can do all that s needful till he comes back That s exactly what I came here for said mister Pickwick handing over the document If anything particular occurs you can write to me at the post office Ipswich That s all right replied mister Perker s clerk and then seeing mister Pickwick s eye wandering curiously towards the table he added will you join us for half an hour or so We are capital company here to night There s Samkin and Green s managing clerk and Smithers and Price s chancery and Pimkin and Thomas s out o doors sings a capital song he does and Jack Bamber and ever so many more You re come out of the country I suppose Would you like to join us mister Pickwick could not resist so tempting an opportunity of studying human nature He suffered himself to be led to the table where after having been introduced to the company in due form he was accommodated with a seat near the chairman and called for a glass of his favourite beverage A profound silence quite contrary to mister Pickwick s expectation succeeded You don t find this sort of thing disagreeable I hope sir said his right hand neighbour a gentleman in a checked shirt and Mosaic studs with a cigar in his mouth Not in the least replied mister Pickwick I like it very much although I am no smoker myself I should be very sorry to say I wasn t interposed another gentleman on the opposite side of the table It s board and lodgings to me is smoke mister Pickwick glanced at the speaker and thought that if it were washing too it would be all the better Here there was another pause mister Pickwick was a stranger and his coming had evidently cast a damp upon the party mister Grundy s going to oblige the company with a song said the chairman No he ain t said mister Grundy Why not said the chairman Because he can t said mister Grundy You had better say he won t replied the chairman Well then he won t retorted mister Grundy mister Grundy s positive refusal to gratify the company occasioned another silence Won t anybody enliven us said the chairman despondingly Why don t you enliven us yourself mister Chairman said a young man with a whisker a squint and an open shirt collar dirty from the bottom of the table Hear hear said the smoking gentleman in the Mosaic jewellery Because I only know one song and I have sung it already and it s a fine of glasses round to sing the same song twice in a night replied the chairman This was an unanswerable reply and silence prevailed again I have been to night gentlemen said mister Pickwick hoping to start a subject which all the company could take a part in discussing I have been to night in a place which you all know very well doubtless but which I have not been in for some years and know very little of I mean Gray s Inn gentlemen Curious little nooks in a great place like London these old inns are By Jove said the chairman whispering across the table to mister Pickwick you have hit upon something that one of us at least would talk upon for ever You ll draw old Jack Bamber out he was never heard to talk about anything else but the inns and he has lived alone in them till he s half crazy The individual to whom Lowten alluded was a little yellow high shouldered man whose countenance from his habit of stooping forward when silent mister Pickwick had not observed before He wondered though when the old man raised his shrivelled face and bent his gray eye upon him with a keen inquiring look that such remarkable features could have escaped his attention for a moment There was a fixed grim smile perpetually on his countenance he leaned his chin on a long skinny hand with nails of extraordinary length and as he inclined his head to one side and looked keenly out from beneath his ragged gray eyebrows there was a strange wild slyness in his leer quite repulsive to behold This was the figure that now started forward and burst into an animated torrent of words As this chapter has been a long one however and as the old man was a remarkable personage it will be more respectful to him and more convenient to us to let him speak for himself in a fresh one CHAPTER XXI IN WHICH THE OLD MAN LAUNCHES FORTH INTO HIS FAVOURITE THEME AND RELATES A STORY ABOUT A QUEER CLIENT Aha said the old man a brief description of whose manner and appearance concluded the last chapter aha who was talking about the inns I was Sir replied mister Pickwick I was observing what singular old places they are YOU said the old man contemptuously What do YOU know of the time when young men shut themselves up in those lonely rooms and read and read hour after hour and night after night till their reason wandered beneath their midnight studies till their mental powers were exhausted till morning s light brought no freshness or health to them and they sank beneath the unnatural devotion of their youthful energies to their dry old books Coming down to a later time and a very different day what do YOU know of the gradual sinking beneath consumption or the quick wasting of fever the grand results of life and dissipation which men have undergone in these same rooms How many vain pleaders for mercy do you think have turned away heart sick from the lawyer s office to find a resting place in the Thames or a refuge in the jail They are no ordinary houses those There is not a panel in the old wainscotting but what if it were endowed with the powers of speech and memory could start from the wall and tell its tale of horror the romance of life Sir the romance of life Common place as they may seem now I tell you they are strange old places and I would rather hear many a legend with a terrific sounding name than the true history of one old set of chambers There was something so odd in the old man s sudden energy and the subject which had called it forth that mister Pickwick was prepared with no observation in reply and the old man checking his impetuosity and resuming the leer which had disappeared during his previous excitement said Look at them in another light their most common place and least romantic What fine places of slow torture they are Think of the needy man who has spent his all beggared himself and pinched his friends to enter the profession which is destined never to yield him a morsel of bread The waiting the hope the disappointment the fear the misery the poverty the blight on his hopes and end to his career the suicide perhaps or the shabby slipshod drunkard Am I not right about them And the old man rubbed his hands and leered as if in delight at having found another point of view in which to place his favourite subject mister Pickwick eyed the old man with great curiosity and the remainder of the company smiled and looked on in silence Talk of your German universities said the little old man Pooh pooh there s romance enough at home without going half a mile for it only people never think of it I never thought of the romance of this particular subject before certainly said mister Pickwick laughing To be sure you didn t said the little old man of course not As a friend of mine used to say to me What is there in chambers in particular Queer old places said I Not at all said he Lonely said I Not a bit of it said he He died one morning of apoplexy as he was going to open his outer door Fell with his head in his own letter box and there he lay for eighteen months Everybody thought he d gone out of town And how was he found out at last inquired mister Pickwick The benchers determined to have his door broken open as he hadn t paid any rent for two years So they did Forced the lock and a very dusty skeleton in a blue coat black knee shorts and silks fell forward in the arms of the porter who opened the door Queer that Rather perhaps rather eh The little old man put his head more on one side and rubbed his hands with unspeakable glee I know another case said the little old man when his chuckles had in some degree subsided It occurred in Clifford s Inn Tenant of a top set bad character shut himself up in his bedroom closet and took a dose of arsenic The steward thought he had run away opened the door and put a bill up Another man came took the chambers furnished them and went to live there Somehow or other he couldn t sleep always restless and uncomfortable Odd says he I ll make the other room my bedchamber and this my sitting room He made the change and slept very well at night but suddenly found that somehow he couldn t read in the evening he got nervous and uncomfortable and used to be always snuffing his candles and staring about him I can t make this out said he when he came home from the play one night and was drinking a glass of cold grog with his back to the wall in order that he mightn t be able to fancy there was any one behind him I can t make it out said he and just then his eyes rested on the little closet that had been always locked up and a shudder ran through his whole frame from top to toe I have felt this strange feeling before said he I cannot help thinking there s something wrong about that closet He made a strong effort plucked up his courage shivered the lock with a blow or two of the poker opened the door and there sure enough standing bolt upright in the corner was the last tenant with a little bottle clasped firmly in his hand and his face well As the little old man concluded he looked round on the attentive faces of his wondering auditory with a smile of grim delight What strange things these are you tell us of Sir said mister Pickwick minutely scanning the old man s countenance by the aid of his glasses Strange said the little old man Nonsense you think them strange because you know nothing about it They are funny but not uncommon Funny exclaimed mister Pickwick involuntarily Yes funny are they not replied the little old man with a diabolical leer and then without pausing for an answer he continued I knew another man let me see forty years ago now who took an old damp rotten set of chambers in one of the most ancient inns that had been shut up and empty for years and years before There were lots of old women s stories about the place and it certainly was very far from being a cheerful one but he was poor and the rooms were cheap and that would have been quite a sufficient reason for him if they had been ten times worse than they really were He was obliged to take some mouldering fixtures that were on the place and among the rest was a great lumbering wooden press for papers with large glass doors and a green curtain inside a pretty useless thing for him for he had no papers to put in it and as to his clothes he carried them about with him and that wasn t very hard work either Well he had moved in all his furniture it wasn t quite a truck full and had sprinkled it about the room so as to make the four chairs look as much like a dozen as possible and was sitting down before the fire at night drinking the first glass of two gallons of whisky he had ordered on credit wondering whether it would ever be paid for and if so in how many years time when his eyes encountered the glass doors of the wooden press Ah says he if I hadn t been obliged to take that ugly article at the old broker s valuation I might have got something comfortable for the money I ll tell you what it is old fellow he said speaking aloud to the press having nothing else to speak to if it wouldn t cost more to break up your old carcass than it would ever be worth afterward I d have a fire out of you in less than no time He had hardly spoken the words when a sound resembling a faint groan appeared to issue from the interior of the case It startled him at first but thinking on a moment s reflection that it must be some young fellow in the next chamber who had been dining out he put his feet on the fender and raised the poker to stir the fire At that moment the sound was repeated and one of the glass doors slowly opening disclosed a pale and emaciated figure in soiled and worn apparel standing erect in the press The figure was tall and thin and the countenance expressive of care and anxiety but there was something in the hue of the skin and gaunt and unearthly appearance of the whole form which no being of this world was ever seen to wear Who are you said the new tenant turning very pale poising the poker in his hand however and taking a very decent aim at the countenance of the figure Who are you Don t throw that poker at me replied the form if you hurled it with ever so sure an aim it would pass through me without resistance and expend its force on the wood behind I am a spirit And pray what do you want here faltered the tenant In this room replied the apparition my worldly ruin was worked and I and my children beggared In this press the papers in a long long suit which accumulated for years were deposited In this room when I had died of grief and long deferred hope two wily harpies divided the wealth for which I had contested during a wretched existence and of which at last not one farthing was left for my unhappy descendants I terrified them from the spot and since that day have prowled by night the only period at which I can revisit the earth about the scenes of my long protracted misery This apartment is mine leave it to me If you insist upon making your appearance here said the tenant who had had time to collect his presence of mind during this prosy statement of the ghost s I shall give up possession with the greatest pleasure but I should like to ask you one question if you will allow me Say on said the apparition sternly Well said the tenant I don t apply the observation personally to you because it is equally applicable to most of the ghosts I ever heard of but it does appear to me somewhat inconsistent that when you have an opportunity of visiting the fairest spots of earth for I suppose space is nothing to you you should always return exactly to the very places where you have been most miserable Egad that s very true I never thought of that before said the ghost You see Sir pursued the tenant this is a very uncomfortable room From the appearance of that press I should be disposed to say that it is not wholly free from bugs and I really think you might find much more comfortable quarters to say nothing of the climate of London which is extremely disagreeable You are very right Sir said the ghost politely it never struck me till now I ll try change of air directly and in fact he began to vanish as he spoke his legs indeed had quite disappeared And if Sir said the tenant calling after him if you WOULD have the goodness to suggest to the other ladies and gentlemen who are now engaged in haunting old empty houses that they might be much more comfortable elsewhere you will confer a very great benefit on society I will replied the ghost we must be dull fellows very dull fellows indeed I can t imagine how we can have been so stupid With these words the spirit disappeared and what is rather remarkable added the old man with a shrewd look round the table he never came back again That ain t bad if it s true said the man in the Mosaic studs lighting a fresh cigar IF exclaimed the old man with a look of excessive contempt I suppose he added turning to Lowten he ll say next that my story about the queer client we had when I was in an attorney s office is not true either I shouldn t wonder I shan t venture to say anything at all about it seeing that I never heard the story observed the owner of the Mosaic decorations I wish you would repeat it Sir said mister Pickwick Ah do said Lowten nobody has heard it but me and I have nearly forgotten it The old man looked round the table and leered more horribly than ever as if in triumph at the attention which was depicted in every face Then rubbing his chin with his hand and looking up to the ceiling as if to recall the circumstances to his memory he began as follows THE OLD MAN S TALE ABOUT THE QUEER CLIENT It matters little said the old man where or how I picked up this brief history If I were to relate it in the order in which it reached me I should commence in the middle and when I had arrived at the conclusion go back for a beginning It is enough for me to say that some of its circumstances passed before my own eyes for the remainder I know them to have happened and there are some persons yet living who will remember them but too well In the Borough High Street near saint George s Church and on the same side of the way stands as most people know the smallest of our debtors prisons the Marshalsea Although in later times it has been a very different place from the sink of filth and dirt it once was even its improved condition holds out but little temptation to the extravagant or consolation to the improvident The condemned felon has as good a yard for air and exercise in Newgate as the insolvent debtor in the Marshalsea Prison Better But this is past in a better age and the prison exists no longer It may be my fancy or it may be that I cannot separate the place from the old recollections associated with it but this part of London I cannot bear The street is broad the shops are spacious the noise of passing vehicles the footsteps of a perpetual stream of people all the busy sounds of traffic resound in it from morn to midnight but the streets around are mean and close poverty and debauchery lie festering in the crowded alleys want and misfortune are pent up in the narrow prison an air of gloom and dreariness seems in my eyes at least to hang about the scene and to impart to it a squalid and sickly hue Many eyes that have long since been closed in the grave have looked round upon that scene lightly enough when entering the gate of the old Marshalsea Prison for the first time for despair seldom comes with the first severe shock of misfortune A man has confidence in untried friends he remembers the many offers of service so freely made by his boon companions when he wanted them not he has hope the hope of happy inexperience and however he may bend beneath the first shock it springs up in his bosom and flourishes there for a brief space until it droops beneath the blight of disappointment and neglect How soon have those same eyes deeply sunken in the head glared from faces wasted with famine and sallow from confinement in days when it was no figure of speech to say that debtors rotted in prison with no hope of release and no prospect of liberty The atrocity in its full extent no longer exists but there is enough of it left to give rise to occurrences that make the heart bleed Twenty years ago that pavement was worn with the footsteps of a mother and child who day by day so surely as the morning came presented themselves at the prison gate often after a night of restless misery and anxious thoughts were they there a full hour too soon and then the young mother turning meekly away would lead the child to the old bridge and raising him in her arms to show him the glistening water tinted with the light of the morning s sun and stirring with all the bustling preparations for business and pleasure that the river presented at that early hour endeavour to interest his thoughts in the objects before him But she would quickly set him down and hiding her face in her shawl give vent to the tears that blinded her for no expression of interest or amusement lighted up his thin and sickly face His recollections were few enough but they were all of one kind all connected with the poverty and misery of his parents Hour after hour had he sat on his mother s knee and with childish sympathy watched the tears that stole down her face and then crept quietly away into some dark corner and sobbed himself to sleep The hard realities of the world with many of its worst privations hunger and thirst and cold and want had all come home to him from the first dawnings of reason and though the form of childhood was there its light heart its merry laugh and sparkling eyes were wanting The father and mother looked on upon this and upon each other with thoughts of agony they dared not breathe in words The healthy strong made man who could have borne almost any fatigue of active exertion was wasting beneath the close confinement and unhealthy atmosphere of a crowded prison The slight and delicate woman was sinking beneath the combined effects of bodily and mental illness The child s young heart was breaking Winter came and with it weeks of cold and heavy rain The poor girl had removed to a wretched apartment close to the spot of her husband s imprisonment and though the change had been rendered necessary by their increasing poverty she was happier now for she was nearer him For two months she and her little companion watched the opening of the gate as usual One day she failed to come for the first time Another morning arrived and she came alone The child was dead They little know who coldly talk of the poor man s bereavements as a happy release from pain to the departed and a merciful relief from expense to the survivor they little know I say what the agony of those bereavements is A silent look of affection and regard when all other eyes are turned coldly away the consciousness that we possess the sympathy and affection of one being when all others have deserted us is a hold a stay a comfort in the deepest affliction which no wealth could purchase or power bestow The child had sat at his parents feet for hours together with his little hands patiently folded in each other and his thin wan face raised towards them They had seen him pine away from day to day and though his brief existence had been a joyless one and he was now removed to that peace and rest which child as he was he had never known in this world they were his parents and his loss sank deep into their souls It was plain to those who looked upon the mother s altered face that death must soon close the scene of her adversity and trial Her husband s fellow prisoners shrank from obtruding on his grief and misery and left to himself alone the small room he had previously occupied in common with two companions She shared it with him and lingering on without pain but without hope her life ebbed slowly away She had fainted one evening in her husband s arms and he had borne her to the open window to revive her with the air when the light of the moon falling full upon her face showed him a change upon her features which made him stagger beneath her weight like a helpless infant Set me down George she said faintly He did so and seating himself beside her covered his face with his hands and burst into tears It is very hard to leave you George she said but it is God s will and you must bear it for my sake Oh how I thank Him for having taken our boy He is happy and in heaven now What would he have done here without his mother You shall not die Mary you shall not die said the husband starting up He paced hurriedly to and fro striking his head with his clenched fists then reseating himself beside her and supporting her in his arms added more calmly Rouse yourself my dear girl Pray pray do You will revive yet Never again George never again said the dying woman Let them lay me by my poor boy now but promise me that if ever you leave this dreadful place and should grow rich you will have us removed to some quiet country churchyard a long long way off very far from here where we can rest in peace Dear George promise me you will I do I do said the man throwing himself passionately on his knees before her Speak to me Mary another word one look but one He ceased to speak for the arm that clasped his neck grew stiff and heavy A deep sigh escaped from the wasted form before him the lips moved and a smile played upon the face but the lips were pallid and the smile faded into a rigid and ghastly stare He was alone in the world That night in the silence and desolation of his miserable room the wretched man knelt down by the dead body of his wife and called on God to witness a terrible oath that from that hour he devoted himself to revenge her death and that of his child that thenceforth to the last moment of his life his whole energies should be directed to this one object that his revenge should be protracted and terrible that his hatred should be undying and inextinguishable and should hunt its object through the world The deepest despair and passion scarcely human had made such fierce ravages on his face and form in that one night that his companions in misfortune shrank affrighted from him as he passed by His eyes were bloodshot and heavy his face a deadly white and his body bent as if with age He had bitten his under lip nearly through in the violence of his mental suffering and the blood which had flowed from the wound had trickled down his chin and stained his shirt and neckerchief No tear or sound of complaint escaped him but the unsettled look and disordered haste with which he paced up and down the yard denoted the fever which was burning within It was necessary that his wife s body should be removed from the prison without delay He received the communication with perfect calmness and acquiesced in its propriety Nearly all the inmates of the prison had assembled to witness its removal they fell back on either side when the widower appeared he walked hurriedly forward and stationed himself alone in a little railed area close to the lodge gate from whence the crowd with an instinctive feeling of delicacy had retired The rude coffin was borne slowly forward on men s shoulders A dead silence pervaded the throng broken only by the audible lamentations of the women and the shuffling steps of the bearers on the stone pavement They reached the spot where the bereaved husband stood and stopped He laid his hand upon the coffin and mechanically adjusting the pall with which it was covered motioned them onward The turnkeys in the prison lobby took off their hats as it passed through and in another moment the heavy gate closed behind it He looked vacantly upon the crowd and fell heavily to the ground Although for many weeks after this he was watched night and day in the wildest ravings of fever neither the consciousness of his loss nor the recollection of the vow he had made ever left him for a moment Scenes changed before his eyes place succeeded place and event followed event in all the hurry of delirium but they were all connected in some way with the great object of his mind He was sailing over a boundless expanse of sea with a blood red sky above and the angry waters lashed into fury beneath boiling and eddying up on every side There was another vessel before them toiling and labouring in the howling storm her canvas fluttering in ribbons from the mast and her deck thronged with figures who were lashed to the sides over which huge waves every instant burst sweeping away some devoted creatures into the foaming sea Onward they bore amidst the roaring mass of water with a speed and force which nothing could resist and striking the stem of the foremost vessel crushed her beneath their keel From the huge whirlpool which the sinking wreck occasioned arose a shriek so loud and shrill the death cry of a hundred drowning creatures blended into one fierce yell that it rung far above the war cry of the elements and echoed and re echoed till it seemed to pierce air sky and ocean But what was that that old gray head that rose above the water s surface and with looks of agony and screams for aid buffeted with the waves One look and he had sprung from the vessel s side and with vigorous strokes was swimming towards it He reached it he was close upon it They were HIS features The old man saw him coming and vainly strove to elude his grasp But he clasped him tight and dragged him beneath the water Down down with him fifty fathoms down his struggles grew fainter and fainter until they wholly ceased He was dead he had killed him and had kept his oath He was traversing the scorching sands of a mighty desert barefoot and alone The sand choked and blinded him its fine thin grains entered the very pores of his skin and irritated him almost to madness Gigantic masses of the same material carried forward by the wind and shone through by the burning sun stalked in the distance like pillars of living fire The bones of men who had perished in the dreary waste lay scattered at his feet a fearful light fell on everything around so far as the eye could reach nothing but objects of dread and horror presented themselves Vainly striving to utter a cry of terror with his tongue cleaving to his mouth he rushed madly forward Armed with supernatural strength he waded through the sand until exhausted with fatigue and thirst he fell senseless on the earth What fragrant coolness revived him what gushing sound was that Water It was indeed a well and the clear fresh stream was running at his feet He drank deeply of it and throwing his aching limbs upon the bank sank into a delicious trance The sound of approaching footsteps roused him An old gray headed man tottered forward to slake his burning thirst It was HE again Fe wound his arms round the old man s body and held him back He struggled and shrieked for water for but one drop of water to save his life But he held the old man firmly and watched his agonies with greedy eyes and when his lifeless head fell forward on his bosom he rolled the corpse from him with his feet When the fever left him and consciousness returned he awoke to find himself rich and free to hear that the parent who would have let him die in jail WOULD who HAD let those who were far dearer to him than his own existence die of want and sickness of heart that medicine cannot cure had been found dead in his bed of down He had had all the heart to leave his son a beggar but proud even of his health and strength had put off the act till it was too late and now might gnash his teeth in the other world at the thought of the wealth his remissness had left him He awoke to this and he awoke to more To recollect the purpose for which he lived and to remember that his enemy was his wife s own father the man who had cast him into prison and who when his daughter and her child sued at his feet for mercy had spurned them from his door Oh how he cursed the weakness that prevented him from being up and active in his scheme of vengeance He caused himself to be carried from the scene of his loss and misery and conveyed to a quiet residence on the sea coast not in the hope of recovering his peace of mind or happiness for both were fled for ever but to restore his prostrate energies and meditate on his darling object And here some evil spirit cast in his way the opportunity for his first most horrible revenge It was summer time and wrapped in his gloomy thoughts he would issue from his solitary lodgings early in the evening and wandering along a narrow path beneath the cliffs to a wild and lonely spot that had struck his fancy in his ramblings seat himself on some fallen fragment of the rock and burying his face in his hands remain there for hours sometimes until night had completely closed in and the long shadows of the frowning cliffs above his head cast a thick black darkness on every object near him He was seated here one calm evening in his old position now and then raising his head to watch the flight of a sea gull or carry his eye along the glorious crimson path which commencing in the middle of the ocean seemed to lead to its very verge where the sun was setting when the profound stillness of the spot was broken by a loud cry for help he listened doubtful of his having heard aright when the cry was repeated with even greater vehemence than before and starting to his feet he hastened in the direction whence it proceeded The tale told itself at once some scattered garments lay on the beach a human head was just visible above the waves at a little distance from the shore and an old man wringing his hands in agony was running to and fro shrieking for assistance The invalid whose strength was now sufficiently restored threw off his coat and rushed towards the sea with the intention of plunging in and dragging the drowning man ashore Hasten here Sir in God s name help help sir for the love of Heaven He is my son Sir my only son said the old man frantically as he advanced to meet him My only son Sir and he is dying before his father s eyes At the first word the old man uttered the stranger checked himself in his career and folding his arms stood perfectly motionless Great God exclaimed the old man recoiling Heyling The stranger smiled and was silent Heyling said the old man wildly my boy Heyling my dear boy look look Gasping for breath the miserable father pointed to the spot where the young man was struggling for life Hark said the old man He cries once more He is alive yet Heyling save him save him The stranger smiled again and remained immovable as a statue I have wronged you shrieked the old man falling on his knees and clasping his hands together Be revenged take my all my life cast me into the water at your feet and if human nature can repress a struggle I will die without stirring hand or foot Do it Heyling do it but save my boy he is so young Heyling so young to die Listen said the stranger grasping the old man fiercely by the wrist I will have life for life and here is ONE MY child died before his father s eyes a far more agonising and painful death than that young slanderer of his sister s worth is meeting while I speak You laughed laughed in your daughter s face where death had already set his hand at our sufferings then What think you of them now See there see there As the stranger spoke he pointed to the sea A faint cry died away upon its surface the last powerful struggle of the dying man agitated the rippling waves for a few seconds and the spot where he had gone down into his early grave was undistinguishable from the surrounding water Three years had elapsed when a gentleman alighted from a private carriage at the door of a London attorney then well known as a man of no great nicety in his professional dealings and requested a private interview on business of importance Although evidently not past the prime of life his face was pale haggard and dejected and it did not require the acute perception of the man of business to discern at a glance that disease or suffering had done more to work a change in his appearance than the mere hand of time could have accomplished in twice the period of his whole life I wish you to undertake some legal business for me said the stranger The attorney bowed obsequiously and glanced at a large packet which the gentleman carried in his hand His visitor observed the look and proceeded It is no common business said he nor have these papers reached my hands without long trouble and great expense The attorney cast a still more anxious look at the packet and his visitor untying the string that bound it disclosed a quantity of promissory notes with copies of deeds and other documents Upon these papers said the client the man whose name they bear has raised as you will see large sums of money for years past There was a tacit understanding between him and the men into whose hands they originally went and from whom I have by degrees purchased the whole for treble and quadruple their nominal value that these loans should be from time to time renewed until a given period had elapsed Such an understanding is nowhere expressed He has sustained many losses of late and these obligations accumulating upon him at once would crush him to the earth The whole amount is many thousands of pounds said the attorney looking over the papers It is said the client What are we to do inquired the man of business Do replied the client with sudden vehemence Put every engine of the law in force every trick that ingenuity can devise and rascality execute fair means and foul the open oppression of the law aided by all the craft of its most ingenious practitioners I would have him die a harassing and lingering death Ruin him seize and sell his lands and goods drive him from house and home and drag him forth a beggar in his old age to die in a common jail But the costs my dear Sir the costs of all this reasoned the attorney when he had recovered from his momentary surprise If the defendant be a man of straw who is to pay the costs Sir Name any sum said the stranger his hand trembling so violently with excitement that he could scarcely hold the pen he seized as he spoke any sum and it is yours Don t be afraid to name it man I shall not think it dear if you gain my object The attorney named a large sum at hazard as the advance he should require to secure himself against the possibility of loss but more with the view of ascertaining how far his client was really disposed to go than with any idea that he would comply with the demand The stranger wrote a cheque upon his banker for the whole amount and left him The draft was duly honoured and the attorney finding that his strange client might be safely relied upon commenced his work in earnest For more than two years afterwards mister Heyling would sit whole days together in the office poring over the papers as they accumulated and reading again and again his eyes gleaming with joy the letters of remonstrance the prayers for a little delay the representations of the certain ruin in which the opposite party must be involved which poured in as suit after suit and process after process was commenced To all applications for a brief indulgence there was but one reply the money must be paid Land house furniture each in its turn was taken under some one of the numerous executions which were issued and the old man himself would have been immured in prison had he not escaped the vigilance of the officers and fled The implacable animosity of Heyling so far from being satiated by the success of his persecution increased a hundredfold with the ruin he inflicted On being informed of the old man s flight his fury was unbounded He gnashed his teeth with rage tore the hair from his head and assailed with horrid imprecations the men who had been intrusted with the writ He was only restored to comparative calmness by repeated assurances of the certainty of discovering the fugitive Agents were sent in quest of him in all directions every stratagem that could be invented was resorted to for the purpose of discovering his place of retreat but it was all in vain Half a year had passed over and he was still undiscovered At length late one night Heyling of whom nothing had been seen for many weeks before appeared at his attorney s private residence and sent up word that a gentleman wished to see him instantly Before the attorney who had recognised his voice from above stairs could order the servant to admit him he had rushed up the staircase and entered the drawing room pale and breathless Having closed the door to prevent being overheard he sank into a chair and said in a low voice Hush I have found him at last No said the attorney Well done my dear sir well done He lies concealed in a wretched lodging in Camden Town said Heyling Perhaps it is as well we DID lose sight of him for he has been living alone there in the most abject misery all the time and he is poor very poor Very good said the attorney You will have the caption made to morrow of course Yes replied Heyling Stay No The next day You are surprised at my wishing to postpone it he added with a ghastly smile but I had forgotten The next day is an anniversary in his life let it be done then Very good said the attorney Will you write down instructions for the officer No let him meet me here at eight in the evening and I will accompany him myself They met on the appointed night and hiring a hackney coach directed the driver to stop at that corner of the old Pancras Road at which stands the parish workhouse By the time they alighted there it was quite dark and proceeding by the dead wall in front of the Veterinary Hospital they entered a small by street which is or was at that time called Little College Street and which whatever it may be now was in those days a desolate place enough surrounded by little else than fields and ditches Having drawn the travelling cap he had on half over his face and muffled himself in his cloak Heyling stopped before the meanest looking house in the street and knocked gently at the door It was at once opened by a woman who dropped a curtsey of recognition and Heyling whispering the officer to remain below crept gently upstairs and opening the door of the front room entered at once The object of his search and his unrelenting animosity now a decrepit old man was seated at a bare deal table on which stood a miserable candle He started on the entrance of the stranger and rose feebly to his feet What now what now said the old man What fresh misery is this What do you want here A word with YOU replied Heyling As he spoke he seated himself at the other end of the table and throwing off his cloak and cap disclosed his features The old man seemed instantly deprived of speech He fell backward in his chair and clasping his hands together gazed on the apparition with a mingled look of abhorrence and fear This day six years said Heyling I claimed the life you owed me for my child s Beside the lifeless form of your daughter old man I swore to live a life of revenge I have never swerved from my purpose for a moment s space but if I had one thought of her uncomplaining suffering look as she drooped away or of the starving face of our innocent child would have nerved me to my task My first act of requital you well remember this is my last The old man shivered and his hands dropped powerless by his side I leave England to morrow said Heyling after a moment s pause To night I consign you to the living death to which you devoted her a hopeless prison He raised his eyes to the old man s countenance and paused He lifted the light to his face set it gently down and left the apartment You had better see to the old man he said to the woman as he opened the door and motioned the officer to follow him into the street I think he is ill The woman closed the door ran hastily upstairs and found him lifeless Beneath a plain gravestone in one of the most peaceful and secluded churchyards in Kent where wild flowers mingle with the grass and the soft landscape around forms the fairest spot in the garden of England lie the bones of the young mother and her gentle child But the ashes of the father do not mingle with theirs nor from that night forward did the attorney ever gain the remotest clue to the subsequent history of his queer client As the old man concluded his tale he advanced to a peg in one corner and taking down his hat and coat put them on with great deliberation and without saying another word walked slowly away As the gentleman with the Mosaic studs had fallen asleep and the major part of the company were deeply occupied in the humorous process of dropping melted tallow grease into his brandy and water mister Pickwick departed unnoticed and having settled his own score and that of mister Weller issued forth in company with that gentleman from beneath the portal of the Magpie and Stump CHAPTER XXII mister PICKWICK JOURNEYS TO IPSWICH AND MEETS WITH A ROMANTIC ADVENTURE WITH A MIDDLE AGED LADY IN YELLOW CURL PAPERS That ere your governor s luggage Sammy inquired mister Weller of his affectionate son as he entered the yard of the Bull Inn Whitechapel with a travelling bag and a

coincidence So am I mister Pickwick bowed Going outside said the red haired man mister Pickwick bowed again Bless my soul how remarkable I am going outside too said the red haired man we are positively going together And the red haired man who was an important looking sharp nosed mysterious spoken personage with a bird like habit of giving his head a jerk every time he said anything smiled as if he had made one of the strangest discoveries that ever fell to the lot of human wisdom I am happy in the prospect of your company Sir said mister Pickwick Ah said the new comer it s a good thing for both of us isn t it Company you see company is is it s a very different thing from solitude ain t it There s no denying that ere said mister Weller joining in the conversation with an affable smile That s what I call a self evident proposition as the dog s meat man said when the housemaid told him he warn t a gentleman Ah said the red haired man surveying mister Weller from head to foot with a supercilious look Friend of yours sir Not exactly a friend replied mister Pickwick in a low tone The fact is he is my servant but I allow him to take a good many liberties for between ourselves I flatter myself he is an original and I am rather proud of him Ah said the red haired man that you see is a matter of taste I am not fond of anything original I don t like it don t see the necessity for it What s your name sir Here is my card sir replied mister Pickwick much amused by the abruptness of the question and the singular manner of the stranger Ah said the red haired man placing the card in his pocket book Pickwick very good I like to know a man s name it saves so much trouble That s my card sir Magnus you will perceive sir Magnus is my name It s rather a good name I think sir A very good name indeed said mister Pickwick wholly unable to repress a smile Yes I think it is resumed mister Magnus There s a good name before it too you will observe Permit me sir if you hold the card a little slanting this way you catch the light upon the up stroke There Peter Magnus sounds well I think sir Very said mister Pickwick Curious circumstance about those initials sir said mister Magnus You will observe P M post meridian In hasty notes to intimate acquaintance I sometimes sign myself Afternoon It amuses my friends very much mister Pickwick It is calculated to afford them the highest gratification I should conceive said mister Pickwick rather envying the ease with which mister Magnus s friends were entertained Now general l m n said the hostler coach is ready if you please Is all my luggage in inquired mister Magnus All right sir Is the red bag in All right Sir And the striped bag Fore boot Sir And the brown paper parcel Under the seat Sir And the leather hat box They re all in Sir Now will you get up said mister Pickwick Excuse me replied Magnus standing on the wheel Excuse me mister Pickwick I cannot consent to get up in this state of uncertainty I am quite satisfied from that man s manner that the leather hat box is not in The solemn protestations of the hostler being wholly unavailing the leather hat box was obliged to be raked up from the lowest depth of the boot to satisfy him that it had been safely packed and after he had been assured on this head he felt a solemn presentiment first that the red bag was mislaid and next that the striped bag had been stolen and then that the brown paper parcel had come untied At length when he had received ocular demonstration of the groundless nature of each and every of these suspicions he consented to climb up to the roof of the coach observing that now he had taken everything off his mind he felt quite comfortable and happy You re given to nervousness ain t you Sir inquired mister Weller senior eyeing the stranger askance as he mounted to his place Yes I always am rather about these little matters said the stranger but I am all right now quite right Well that s a blessin said mister Weller Sammy help your master up to the box t other leg Sir that s it give us your hand Sir Up with you You was a lighter weight when you was a boy sir True enough that mister Weller said the breathless mister Pickwick good humouredly as he took his seat on the box beside him Jump up in front Sammy said mister Weller Now Villam run em out Take care o the archvay general l m n Heads as the pieman says That ll do Villam Let em alone And away went the coach up Whitechapel to the admiration of the whole population of that pretty densely populated quarter Not a wery nice neighbourhood this Sir said Sam with a touch of the hat which always preceded his entering into conversation with his master It is not indeed Sam replied mister Pickwick surveying the crowded and filthy street through which they were passing It s a wery remarkable circumstance Sir said Sam that poverty and oysters always seem to go together I don t understand you Sam said mister Pickwick What I mean sir said Sam is that the poorer a place is the greater call there seems to be for oysters Look here sir here s a oyster stall to every half dozen houses The street s lined vith em Blessed if I don t think that ven a man s wery poor he rushes out of his lodgings and eats oysters in reg lar desperation To be sure he does said mister Weller senior and it s just the same vith pickled salmon Those are two very remarkable facts which never occurred to me before said mister Pickwick The very first place we stop at I ll make a note of them By this time they had reached the turnpike at Mile End a profound silence prevailed until they had got two or three miles farther on when mister Weller senior turning suddenly to mister Pickwick said Wery queer life is a pike keeper s sir A what said mister Pickwick A pike keeper What do you mean by a pike keeper inquired mister Peter Magnus The old un means a turnpike keeper general l m n observed mister Samuel Weller in explanation Oh said mister Pickwick I see Yes very curious life Very uncomfortable They re all on em men as has met vith some disappointment in life said mister Weller senior Ay ay said mister Pickwick Yes Consequence of vich they retires from the world and shuts themselves up in pikes partly with the view of being solitary and partly to rewenge themselves on mankind by takin tolls Dear me said mister Pickwick I never knew that before Fact Sir said mister Weller if they was general l m n you d call em misanthropes but as it is they only takes to pike keepin With such conversation possessing the inestimable charm of blending amusement with instruction did mister Weller beguile the tediousness of the journey during the greater part of the day Topics of conversation were never wanting for even when any pause occurred in mister Weller s loquacity it was abundantly supplied by the desire evinced by mister Magnus to make himself acquainted with the whole of the personal history of his fellow travellers and his loudly expressed anxiety at every stage respecting the safety and well being of the two bags the leather hat box and the brown paper parcel In the main street of Ipswich on the left hand side of the way a short distance after you have passed through the open space fronting the Town Hall stands an inn known far and wide by the appellation of the Great White Horse rendered the more conspicuous by a stone statue of some rampacious animal with flowing mane and tail distantly resembling an insane cart horse which is elevated above the principal door The Great White Horse is famous in the neighbourhood in the same degree as a prize ox or a county paper chronicled turnip or unwieldy pig for its enormous size Never was such labyrinths of uncarpeted passages such clusters of mouldy ill lighted rooms such huge numbers of small dens for eating or sleeping in beneath any one roof as are collected together between the four walls of the Great White Horse at Ipswich It was at the door of this overgrown tavern that the London coach stopped at the same hour every evening and it was from this same London coach that mister Pickwick Sam Weller and mister Peter Magnus dismounted on the particular evening to which this chapter of our history bears reference Do you stop here sir inquired mister Peter Magnus when the striped bag and the red bag and the brown paper parcel and the leather hat box had all been deposited in the passage Do you stop here sir I do said mister Pickwick Dear me said mister Magnus I never knew anything like these extraordinary coincidences Why I stop here too I hope we dine together With pleasure replied mister Pickwick I am not quite certain whether I have any friends here or not though Is there any gentleman of the name of Tupman here waiter A corpulent man with a fortnight s napkin under his arm and coeval stockings on his legs slowly desisted from his occupation of staring down the street on this question being put to him by mister Pickwick and after minutely inspecting that gentleman s appearance from the crown of his hat to the lowest button of his gaiters replied emphatically No Nor any gentleman of the name of Snodgrass inquired mister Pickwick No Nor Winkle No My friends have not arrived to day Sir said mister Pickwick We will dine alone then Show us a private room waiter On this request being preferred the corpulent man condescended to order the boots to bring in the gentlemen s luggage and preceding them down a long dark passage ushered them into a large badly furnished apartment with a dirty grate in which a small fire was making a wretched attempt to be cheerful but was fast sinking beneath the dispiriting influence of the place After the lapse of an hour a bit of fish and a steak was served up to the travellers and when the dinner was cleared away mister Pickwick and mister Peter Magnus drew their chairs up to the fire and having ordered a bottle of the worst possible port wine at the highest possible price for the good of the house drank brandy and water for their own mister Peter Magnus was naturally of a very communicative disposition and the brandy and water operated with wonderful effect in warming into life the deepest hidden secrets of his bosom After sundry accounts of himself his family his connections his friends his jokes his business and his brothers most talkative men have a great deal to say about their brothers mister Peter Magnus took a view of mister Pickwick through his coloured spectacles for several minutes and then said with an air of modesty And what do you think what DO you think mister Pickwick I have come down here for Upon my word said mister Pickwick it is wholly impossible for me to guess on business perhaps Partly right Sir replied mister Peter Magnus but partly wrong at the same time try again mister Pickwick Really said mister Pickwick I must throw myself on your mercy to tell me or not as you may think best for I should never guess if I were to try all night Why then he he he said mister Peter Magnus with a bashful titter what should you think mister Pickwick if I had come down here to make a proposal Sir eh He he he Think That you are very likely to succeed replied mister Pickwick with one of his beaming smiles Ah said mister Magnus But do you really think so mister Pickwick Do you though Certainly said mister Pickwick No but you re joking though I am not indeed Why then said mister Magnus to let you into a little secret I think so too I don t mind telling you mister Pickwick although I m dreadful jealous by nature horrid that the lady is in this house Here mister Magnus took off his spectacles on purpose to wink and then put them on again That s what you were running out of the room for before dinner then so often said mister Pickwick archly Hush Yes you re right that was it not such a fool as to see her though No No wouldn t do you know after having just come off a journey Wait till to morrow sir double the chance then mister Pickwick Sir there is a suit of clothes in that bag and a hat in that box which I expect in the effect they will produce will be invaluable to me sir Indeed said mister Pickwick Yes you must have observed my anxiety about them to day I do not believe that such another suit of clothes and such a hat could be bought for money mister Pickwick mister Pickwick congratulated the fortunate owner of the irresistible garments on their acquisition and mister Peter Magnus remained a few moments apparently absorbed in contemplation She s a fine creature said mister Magnus Is she said mister Pickwick Very said mister Magnus Very She lives about twenty miles from here mister Pickwick I heard she would be here to night and all to morrow forenoon and came down to seize the opportunity I think an inn is a good sort of a place to propose to a single woman in mister Pickwick She is more likely to feel the loneliness of her situation in travelling perhaps than she would be at home What do you think mister Pickwick I think it is very probable replied that gentleman I beg your pardon mister Pickwick said mister Peter Magnus but I am naturally rather curious what may you have come down here for On a far less pleasant errand Sir replied mister Pickwick the colour mounting to his face at the recollection I have come down here Sir to expose the treachery and falsehood of an individual upon whose truth and honour I placed implicit reliance Dear me said mister Peter Magnus that s very unpleasant It is a lady I presume Eh ah Sly mister Pickwick sly Well mister Pickwick sir I wouldn t probe your feelings for the world Painful subjects these sir very painful Don t mind me mister Pickwick if you wish to give vent to your feelings I know what it is to be jilted Sir I have endured that sort of thing three or four times I am much obliged to you for your condolence on what you presume to be my melancholy case said mister Pickwick winding up his watch and laying it on the table but No no said mister Peter Magnus not a word more it s a painful subject I see I see What s the time mister Pickwick Past twelve Dear me it s time to go to bed It will never do sitting here I shall be pale to morrow mister Pickwick At the bare notion of such a calamity mister Peter Magnus rang the bell for the chambermaid and the striped bag the red bag the leathern hat box and the brown paper parcel having been conveyed to his bedroom he retired in company with a japanned candlestick to one side of the house while mister Pickwick and another japanned candlestick were conducted through a multitude of tortuous windings to another This is your room sir said the chambermaid Very well replied mister Pickwick looking round him It was a tolerably large double bedded room with a fire upon the whole a more comfortable looking apartment than mister Pickwick s short experience of the accommodations of the Great White Horse had led him to expect Nobody sleeps in the other bed of course said mister Pickwick Oh no Sir Very good Tell my servant to bring me up some hot water at half past eight in the morning and that I shall not want him any more to night Yes Sir and bidding mister Pickwick good night the chambermaid retired and left him alone mister Pickwick sat himself down in a chair before the fire and fell into a train of rambling meditations First he thought of his friends and wondered when they would join him then his mind reverted to missus Martha Bardell and from that lady it wandered by a natural process to the dingy counting house of Dodson Fogg From Dodson Fogg s it flew off at a tangent to the very centre of the history of the queer client and then it came back to the Great White Horse at Ipswich with sufficient clearness to convince mister Pickwick that he was falling asleep So he roused himself and began to undress when he recollected he had left his watch on the table downstairs Now this watch was a special favourite with mister Pickwick having been carried about beneath the shadow of his waistcoat for a greater number of years than we feel called upon to state at present The possibility of going to sleep unless it were ticking gently beneath his pillow or in the watch pocket over his head had never entered mister Pickwick s brain So as it was pretty late now and he was unwilling to ring his bell at that hour of the night he slipped on his coat of which he had just divested himself and taking the japanned candlestick in his hand walked quietly downstairs The more stairs mister Pickwick went down the more stairs there seemed to be to descend and again and again when mister Pickwick got into some narrow passage and began to congratulate himself on having gained the ground floor did another flight of stairs appear before his astonished eyes At last he reached a stone hall which he remembered to have seen when he entered the house Passage after passage did he explore room after room did he peep into at length as he was on the point of giving up the search in despair he opened the door of the identical room in which he had spent the evening and beheld his missing property on the table mister Pickwick seized the watch in triumph and proceeded to retrace his steps to his bedchamber If his progress downward had been attended with difficulties and uncertainty his journey back was infinitely more perplexing Rows of doors garnished with boots of every shape make and size branched off in every possible direction A dozen times did he softly turn the handle of some bedroom door which resembled his own when a gruff cry from within of Who the devil s that or What do you want here caused him to steal away on tiptoe with a perfectly marvellous celerity He was reduced to the verge of despair when an open door attracted his attention He peeped in Right at last There were the two beds whose situation he perfectly remembered and the fire still burning His candle not a long one when he first received it had flickered away in the drafts of air through which he had passed and sank into the socket as he closed the door after him No matter said mister Pickwick I can undress myself just as well by the light of the fire The bedsteads stood one on each side of the door and on the inner side of each was a little path terminating in a rush bottomed chair just wide enough to admit of a person s getting into or out of bed on that side if he or she thought proper Having carefully drawn the curtains of his bed on the outside mister Pickwick sat down on the rush bottomed chair and leisurely divested himself of his shoes and gaiters He then took off and folded up his coat waistcoat and neckcloth and slowly drawing on his tasselled nightcap secured it firmly on his head by tying beneath his chin the strings which he always had attached to that article of dress It was at this moment that the absurdity of his recent bewilderment struck upon his mind Throwing himself back in the rush bottomed chair mister Pickwick laughed to himself so heartily that it would have been quite delightful to any man of well constituted mind to have watched the smiles that expanded his amiable features as they shone forth from beneath the nightcap It is the best idea said mister Pickwick to himself smiling till he almost cracked the nightcap strings it is the best idea my losing myself in this place and wandering about these staircases that I ever heard of Droll droll very droll Here mister Pickwick smiled again a broader smile than before and was about to continue the process of undressing in the best possible humour when he was suddenly stopped by a most unexpected interruption to wit the entrance into the room of some person with a candle who after locking the door advanced to the dressing table and set down the light upon it The smile that played on mister Pickwick s features was instantaneously lost in a look of the most unbounded and wonder stricken surprise The person whoever it was had come in so suddenly and with so little noise that mister Pickwick had had no time to call out or oppose their entrance Who could it be A robber Some evil minded person who had seen him come upstairs with a handsome watch in his hand perhaps What was he to do The only way in which mister Pickwick could catch a glimpse of his mysterious visitor with the least danger of being seen himself was by creeping on to the bed and peeping out from between the curtains on the opposite side To this manoeuvre he accordingly resorted Keeping the curtains carefully closed with his hand so that nothing more of him could be seen than his face and nightcap and putting on his spectacles he mustered up courage and looked out mister Pickwick almost fainted with horror and dismay Standing before the dressing glass was a middle aged lady in yellow curl papers busily engaged in brushing what ladies call their back hair However the unconscious middle aged lady came into that room it was quite clear that she contemplated remaining there for the night for she had brought a rushlight and shade with her which with praiseworthy precaution against fire she had stationed in a basin on the floor where it was glimmering away like a gigantic lighthouse in a particularly small piece of water Bless my soul thought mister Pickwick what a dreadful thing Hem said the lady and in went mister Pickwick s head with automaton like rapidity I never met with anything so awful as this thought poor mister Pickwick the cold perspiration starting in drops upon his nightcap Never This is fearful It was quite impossible to resist the urgent desire to see what was going forward So out went mister Pickwick s head again The prospect was worse than before The middle aged lady had finished arranging her hair had carefully enveloped it in a muslin nightcap with a small plaited border and was gazing pensively on the fire This matter is growing alarming reasoned mister Pickwick with himself I can t allow things to go on in this way By the self possession of that lady it is clear to me that I must have come into the wrong room If I call out she ll alarm the house but if I remain here the consequences will be still more frightful mister Pickwick it is quite unnecessary to say was one of the most modest and delicate minded of mortals The very idea of exhibiting his nightcap to a lady overpowered him but he had tied those confounded strings in a knot and do what he would he couldn t get it off The disclosure must be made There was only one other way of doing it He shrunk behind the curtains and called out very loudly Ha hum That the lady started at this unexpected sound was evident by her falling up against the rushlight shade that she persuaded herself it must have been the effect of imagination was equally clear for when mister Pickwick under the impression that she had fainted away stone dead with fright ventured to peep out again she was gazing pensively on the fire as before Most extraordinary female this thought mister Pickwick popping in again Ha hum These last sounds so like those in which as legends inform us the ferocious giant Blunderbore was in the habit of expressing his opinion that it was time to lay the cloth were too distinctly audible to be again mistaken for the workings of fancy Gracious Heaven said the middle aged lady what s that It s it s only a gentleman ma am said mister Pickwick from behind the curtains A gentleman said the lady with a terrific scream It s all over thought mister Pickwick A strange man shrieked the lady Another instant and the house would be alarmed Her garments rustled as she rushed towards the door Ma am said mister Pickwick thrusting out his head in the extremity of his desperation ma am Now although mister Pickwick was not actuated by any definite object in putting out his head it was instantaneously productive of a good effect The lady as we have already stated was near the door She must pass it to reach the staircase and she would most undoubtedly have done so by this time had not the sudden apparition of mister Pickwick s nightcap driven her back into the remotest corner of the apartment where she stood staring wildly at mister Pickwick while mister Pickwick in his turn stared wildly at her Wretch said the lady covering her eyes with her hands what do you want here Nothing ma am nothing whatever ma am said mister Pickwick earnestly Nothing said the lady looking up Nothing ma am upon my honour said mister Pickwick nodding his head so energetically that the tassel of his nightcap danced again I am almost ready to sink ma am beneath the confusion of addressing a lady in my nightcap here the lady hastily snatched off hers but I can t get it off ma am here mister Pickwick gave it a tremendous tug in proof of the statement It is evident to me ma am now that I have mistaken this bedroom for my own I had not been here five minutes ma am when you suddenly entered it If this improbable story be really true Sir said the lady sobbing violently you will leave it instantly I will ma am with the greatest pleasure replied mister Pickwick Instantly sir said the lady Certainly ma am interposed mister Pickwick very quickly Certainly ma am I I am very sorry ma am said mister Pickwick making his appearance at the bottom of the bed to have been the innocent occasion of this alarm and emotion deeply sorry ma am The lady pointed to the door One excellent quality of mister Pickwick s character was beautifully displayed at this moment under the most trying circumstances Although he had hastily Put on his hat over his nightcap after the manner of the old patrol although he carried his shoes and gaiters in his hand and his coat and waistcoat over his arm nothing could subdue his native politeness I am exceedingly sorry ma am said mister Pickwick bowing very low If you are Sir you will at once leave the room said the lady Immediately ma am this instant ma am said mister Pickwick opening the door and dropping both his shoes with a crash in so doing I trust ma am resumed mister Pickwick gathering up his shoes and turning round to bow again I trust ma am that my unblemished character and the devoted respect I entertain for your sex will plead as some slight excuse for this But before mister Pickwick could conclude the sentence the lady had thrust him into the passage and locked and bolted the door behind him Whatever grounds of self congratulation mister Pickwick might have for having escaped so quietly from his late awkward situation his present position was by no means enviable He was alone in an open passage in a strange house in the middle of the night half dressed it was not to be supposed that he could find his way in perfect darkness to a room which he had been wholly unable to discover with a light and if he made the slightest noise in his fruitless attempts to do so he stood every chance of being shot at and perhaps killed by some wakeful traveller He had no resource but to remain where he was until daylight appeared So after groping his way a few paces down the passage and to his infinite alarm stumbling over several pairs of boots in so doing mister Pickwick crouched into a little recess in the wall to wait for morning as philosophically as he might He was not destined however to undergo this additional trial of patience for he had not been long ensconced in his present concealment when to his unspeakable horror a man bearing a light appeared at the end of the passage His horror was suddenly converted into joy however when he recognised the form of his faithful attendant It was indeed mister Samuel Weller who after sitting up thus late in conversation with the boots who was sitting up for the mail was now about to retire to rest Sam said mister Pickwick suddenly appearing before him where s my bedroom mister Weller stared at his master with the most emphatic surprise and it was not until the question had been repeated three several times that he turned round and led the way to the long sought apartment Sam said mister Pickwick as he got into bed I have made one of the most extraordinary mistakes to night that ever were heard of Wery likely Sir replied mister Weller drily But of this I am determined Sam said mister Pickwick that if I were to stop in this house for six months I would never trust myself about it alone again That s the wery prudentest resolution as you could come to Sir replied mister Weller You rayther want somebody to look arter you Sir when your judgment goes out a wisitin What do you mean by that Sam said mister Pickwick He raised himself in bed and extended his hand as if he were about to say something more but suddenly checking himself turned round and bade his valet Good night Good night Sir replied mister Weller He paused when he got outside the door shook his head walked on stopped snuffed the candle shook his head again and finally proceeded slowly to his chamber apparently buried in the profoundest meditation CHAPTER XXIII IN WHICH mister SAMUEL WELLER BEGINS TO DEVOTE HIS ENERGIES TO THE RETURN MATCH BETWEEN HIMSELF AND mister TROTTER In a small room in the vicinity of the stableyard betimes in the morning which was ushered in by mister Pickwick s adventure with the middle aged lady in the yellow curl papers sat mister Weller senior preparing himself for his journey to London He was sitting in an excellent attitude for having his portrait taken and here it is It is very possible that at some earlier period of his career mister Weller s profile might have presented a bold and determined outline His face however had expanded under the influence of good living and a disposition remarkable for resignation and its bold fleshy curves had so far extended beyond the limits originally assigned them that unless you took a full view of his countenance in front it was difficult to distinguish more than the extreme tip of a very rubicund nose His chin from the same cause had acquired the grave and imposing form which is generally described by prefixing the word double to that expressive feature and his complexion exhibited that peculiarly mottled combination of colours which is only to be seen in gentlemen of his profession and in underdone roast beef Round his neck he wore a crimson travelling shawl which merged into his chin by such imperceptible gradations that it was difficult to distinguish the folds of the one from the folds of the other Over this he mounted a long waistcoat of a broad pink striped pattern and over that again a wide skirted green coat ornamented with large brass buttons whereof the two which garnished the waist were so far apart that no man had ever beheld them both at the same time His hair which was short sleek and black was just visible beneath the capacious brim of a low crowned brown hat His legs were encased in knee cord breeches and painted top boots and a copper watch chain terminating in one seal and a key of the same material dangled loosely from his capacious waistband We have said that mister Weller was engaged in preparing for his journey to London he was taking sustenance in fact On the table before him stood a pot of ale a cold round of beef and a very respectable looking loaf to each of which he distributed his favours in turn with the most rigid impartiality He had just cut a mighty slice from the latter when the footsteps of somebody entering the room caused him to raise his head and he beheld his son Mornin Sammy said the father The son walked up to the pot of ale and nodding significantly to his parent took a long draught by way of reply Wery good power o suction Sammy said mister Weller the elder looking into the pot when his first born had set it down half empty You d ha made an uncommon fine oyster Sammy if you d been born in that station o life Yes I des say I should ha managed to pick up a respectable livin replied Sam applying himself to the cold beef with considerable vigour I m wery sorry Sammy said the elder mister Weller shaking up the ale by describing small circles with the pot preparatory to drinking I m wery sorry Sammy to hear from your lips as you let yourself be gammoned by that ere mulberry man I always thought up to three days ago that the names of Veller and gammon could never come into contract Sammy never Always exceptin the case of a widder of course said Sam Widders Sammy replied mister Weller slightly changing colour Widders are ceptions to ev ry rule I have heerd how many ordinary women one widder s equal to in pint o comin over you I think it s five and twenty but I don t rightly know vether it ain t more Well that s pretty well said Sam Besides continued mister Weller not noticing the interruption that s a wery different thing You know what the counsel said Sammy as defended the general l m n as beat his wife with the poker venever he got jolly And arter all my Lord says he it s a amiable weakness So I says respectin widders Sammy and so you ll say ven you gets as old as me I ought to ha know d better I know said Sam Ought to ha know d better repeated mister Weller striking the table with his fist Ought to ha know d better why I know a young un as hasn t had half nor quarter your eddication as hasn t slept about the markets no not six months who d ha scorned to be let in in such a vay scorned it Sammy In the excitement of feeling produced by this agonising reflection mister Weller rang the bell and ordered an additional pint of ale Well it s no use talking about it now said Sam It s over and can t be helped and that s one consolation as they always says in Turkey ven they cuts the wrong man s head off It s my innings now gov nor and as soon as I catches hold o this ere Trotter I ll have a good un I hope you will Sammy I hope you will returned mister Weller Here s your health Sammy and may you speedily vipe off the disgrace as you ve inflicted on the family name In honour of this toast mister Weller imbibed at a draught at least two thirds of a newly arrived pint and handed it over to his son to dispose of the remainder which he instantaneously did And now Sammy said mister Weller consulting a large double faced silver watch that hung at the end of the copper chain Now it s time I was up at the office to get my vay bill and see the coach loaded for coaches Sammy is like guns they requires to be loaded with wery great care afore they go off At this parental and professional joke mister Weller junior smiled a filial smile His revered parent continued in a solemn tone I m a goin to leave you Samivel my boy and there s no telling ven I shall see you again Your mother in law may ha been too much for me or a thousand things may have happened by the time you next hears any news o the celebrated mister Veller o the Bell Savage The family name depends wery much upon you Samivel and I hope you ll do wot s right by it Upon all little pints o breedin I know I may trust you as vell as if it was my own self So I ve only this here one little bit of adwice to give you If ever you gets to up ards o fifty and feels disposed to go a marryin anybody no matter who jist you shut yourself up in your own room if you ve got one and pison yourself off hand Hangin s wulgar so don t you have nothin to say to that Pison yourself Samivel my boy pison yourself and you ll be glad on it arterwards With these affecting words mister Weller looked steadfastly on his son and turning slowly upon his heel disappeared from his sight In the contemplative mood which these words had awakened mister Samuel Weller walked forth from the Great White Horse when his father had left him and bending his steps towards saint Clement s Church endeavoured to dissipate his melancholy by strolling among its ancient precincts He had loitered about for some time when he found himself in a retired spot a kind of courtyard of venerable appearance which he discovered had no other outlet than the turning by which he had entered He was about retracing his steps when he was suddenly transfixed to the spot by a sudden appearance and the mode and manner of this appearance we now proceed to relate mister Samuel Weller had been staring up at the old brick houses now and then in his deep abstraction bestowing a wink upon some healthy looking servant girl as she drew up a blind or threw open a bedroom window when the green gate of a garden at the bottom of the yard opened and a man having emerged therefrom closed the green gate very carefully after him and walked briskly towards the very spot where mister Weller was standing Now taking this as an isolated fact unaccompanied by any attendant circumstances there was nothing very extraordinary in it because in many parts of the world men do come out of gardens close green gates after them and even walk briskly away without attracting any particular share of public observation It is clear therefore that there must have been something in the man or in his manner or both to attract mister Weller s particular notice Whether there was or not we must leave the reader to determine when we have faithfully recorded the behaviour of the individual in question When the man had shut the green gate after him he walked as we have said twice already with a brisk pace up the courtyard but he no sooner caught sight of mister Weller than he faltered and stopped as if uncertain for the moment what course to adopt As the green gate was closed behind him and there was no other outlet but the one in front however he was not long in perceiving that he must pass mister Samuel Weller to get away He therefore resumed his brisk pace and advanced staring straight before him The most extraordinary thing about the man was that he was contorting his face into the most fearful and astonishing grimaces that ever were beheld Nature s handiwork never was disguised with such extraordinary artificial carving as the man had overlaid his countenance with in one moment Well said mister Weller to himself as the man approached This is wery odd I could ha swore it was him Up came the man and his face became more frightfully distorted than ever as he drew nearer I could take my oath to that ere black hair and mulberry suit said mister Weller only I never see such a face as that afore As mister Weller said this the man s features assumed an unearthly twinge perfectly hideous He was obliged to pass very near Sam however and the scrutinising glance of that gentleman enabled him to detect under all these appalling twists of feature something too like the small eyes of mister Job Trotter to be easily mistaken Hollo you Sir shouted Sam fiercely The stranger stopped Hollo repeated Sam still more gruffly The man with the horrible face looked with the greatest surprise up the court and down the court and in at the windows of the houses everywhere but at Sam Weller and took another step forward when he was brought to again by another shout Hollo you sir said Sam for the third time There was no pretending to mistake where the voice came from now so the stranger having no other resource at last looked Sam Weller full in the face It won t do Job Trotter said Sam Come None o that ere nonsense You ain t so wery andsome that you can afford to throw avay many o your good looks Bring them ere eyes o yourn back into their proper places or I ll knock em out of your head D ye hear As mister Weller appeared fully disposed to act up to the spirit of this address mister Trotter gradually allowed his face to resume its natural expression and then giving a start of joy exclaimed What do I see mister Walker Ah replied Sam You re wery glad to see me ain t you Glad exclaimed Job Trotter oh mister Walker if you had but known how I have looked forward to this meeting It is too much mister Walker I cannot bear it indeed I cannot And with these words mister Trotter burst into a regular inundation of tears and flinging his arms around those of mister Weller embraced him closely in an ecstasy of joy Get off cried Sam indignant at this process and vainly endeavouring to extricate himself from the grasp of his enthusiastic acquaintance Get off I tell you What are you crying over me for you portable engine Because I am so glad to see you replied Job Trotter gradually releasing mister Weller as the first symptoms of his pugnacity disappeared Oh mister Walker this is too much Too much echoed Sam I think it is too much rayther Now what have you got to say to me eh mister Trotter made no reply for the little pink pocket handkerchief was in full force What have you got to say to me afore I knock your head off repeated mister Weller in a threatening manner Eh said mister Trotter with a look of virtuous surprise What have you got to say to me I mister Walker Don t call me Valker my name s Veller you know that vell enough What have you got to say to me Bless you mister Walker Weller I mean a great many things if you will come away somewhere where we can talk comfortably If you knew how I have looked for you mister Weller Wery hard indeed I s pose said Sam drily Very very Sir replied mister Trotter without moving a muscle of his face But shake hands mister Weller Sam eyed his companion for a few seconds and then as if actuated by a sudden impulse complied with his request How said Job Trotter as they walked away how is your dear good master Oh he is a worthy gentleman mister Weller I hope he didn t catch cold that dreadful night Sir There was a momentary look of deep slyness in Job Trotter s eye as he said this which ran a thrill through mister Weller s clenched fist as he burned with a desire to make a demonstration on his ribs Sam constrained himself however and replied that his master was extremely well Oh I am so glad replied mister Trotter is he here Is yourn asked Sam by way of reply Oh yes he is here and I grieve to say mister Weller he is going on worse than ever Ah ah said Sam Oh shocking terrible At a boarding school said Sam No not at a boarding school replied Job Trotter with the same sly look which Sam had noticed before not at a boarding school At the house with the green gate said Sam eyeing his companion closely No no oh not there replied Job with a quickness very unusual to him not there What was you a doin there asked Sam with a sharp glance Got inside the gate by accident perhaps Why mister Weller replied Job I don t mind telling you my little secrets because you know we took such a fancy for each other when we first met You recollect how pleasant we were that morning Oh yes said Sam impatiently I remember Well Well replied Job speaking with great precision and in the low tone of a man who communicates an important secret in that house with the green gate mister Weller they keep a good many servants So I should think from the look on it interposed Sam Yes continued mister Trotter and one of them is a cook who has saved up a little money mister Weller and is desirous if she can establish herself in life to open a little shop in the chandlery way you see Yes Yes mister Weller Well Sir I met her at a chapel that I go to a very neat little chapel in this town mister Weller where they sing the number four collection of hymns which I generally carry about with me in a little book which you may perhaps have seen in my hand and I got a little intimate with her mister Weller and from that an acquaintance sprung up between us and I may venture to say mister Weller that I am to be the chandler Ah and a wery amiable chandler you ll make replied Sam eyeing Job with a side look of intense dislike The great advantage of this mister Weller continued Job his eyes filling with tears as he spoke will be that I shall be able to leave my present disgraceful service with that bad man and to devote myself to a better and more virtuous life more like the way in which I was brought up mister Weller You must ha been wery nicely brought up said Sam Oh very mister Weller very replied Job At the recollection of the purity of his youthful days mister Trotter pulled forth the pink handkerchief and wept copiously You must ha been an uncommon nice boy to go to school vith said Sam I was sir replied Job heaving a deep sigh I was the idol of the place Ah said Sam I don t wonder at it What a comfort you must ha been to your blessed mother At these words mister Job Trotter inserted an end of the pink handkerchief into the corner of each eye one after the other and began to weep copiously Wot s the matter with the man said Sam indignantly Chelsea water works is nothin to you What are you melting vith now The consciousness o willainy I cannot keep my feelings down mister Weller said Job after a short pause To think that my master should have suspected the conversation I had with yours and so dragged me away in a post chaise and after persuading the sweet young lady to say she knew nothing of him and bribing the school mistress to do the same deserted her for a better speculation Oh mister Weller it makes me shudder Oh that was the vay was it said mister Weller To be sure it was replied Job Vell said Sam as they had now arrived near the hotel I vant to have a little bit o talk with you Job so if you re not partickler engaged I should like to see you at the Great White Horse to night somewheres about eight o clock I shall be sure to come said Job Yes you d better replied Sam with a very meaning look or else I shall perhaps be askin arter you at the other side of the green gate and then I might cut you out you know I shall be sure to be with you sir said mister Trotter and wringing Sam s hand with the utmost fervour he walked away Take care Job Trotter take care said Sam looking after him or I shall be one too many for you this time I shall indeed Having uttered this soliloquy and looked after Job till he was to be seen no more mister Weller made the best of his way to his master s bedroom It s all in training Sir said Sam What s in training Sam inquired mister Pickwick I ve found em out Sir said Sam Found out who That ere queer customer and the melan cholly chap with the black hair Impossible Sam said mister Pickwick with the greatest energy Where are they Sam where are they Hush hush replied mister Weller and as he assisted mister Pickwick to dress he detailed the plan of action on which he proposed to enter But when is this to be done Sam inquired mister Pickwick All in good time Sir replied Sam Whether it was done in good time or not will be seen hereafter CHAPTER XXIV WHEREIN mister PETER MAGNUS GROWS JEALOUS AND THE MIDDLE AGED LADY APPREHENSIVE WHICH BRINGS THE PICKWICKIANS WITHIN THE GRASP OF THE LAW When mister Pickwick descended to the room in which he and mister Peter Magnus had spent the preceding evening he found that gentleman with the major part of the contents of the two bags the leathern hat box and the brown paper parcel displaying to all possible advantage on his person while he himself was pacing up and down the room in a state of the utmost excitement and agitation Good morning Sir said mister Peter Magnus What do you think of this Sir Very effective indeed replied mister Pickwick surveying the garments of mister Peter Magnus with a good natured smile Yes I think it ll do said mister Magnus mister Pickwick Sir I have sent up my card Have you said mister Pickwick And the waiter brought back word that she would see me at eleven at eleven Sir it only wants a quarter now Very near the time said mister Pickwick Yes it is rather near replied mister Magnus rather too near to be pleasant eh mister Pickwick sir Confidence is a great thing in these cases observed mister Pickwick I believe it is Sir said mister Peter Magnus I am very confident Sir Really mister Pickwick I do not see why a man should feel any fear in such a case as this sir What is it Sir There s nothing to be ashamed of it s a matter of mutual accommodation nothing more Husband on one side wife on the other That s my view of the matter mister Pickwick It is a very philosophical one replied mister Pickwick But breakfast is waiting mister Magnus Come Down they sat to breakfast but it was evident notwithstanding the boasting of mister Peter Magnus that he laboured under a very considerable degree of nervousness of which loss of appetite a propensity to upset the tea things a spectral attempt at drollery and an irresistible inclination to look at the clock every other second were among the principal symptoms He he he tittered mister Magnus affecting cheerfulness and gasping with agitation It only wants two minutes mister Pickwick Am I pale Sir Not very replied mister Pickwick There was a brief pause I beg your pardon mister Pickwick but have you ever done this sort of thing in your time said mister Magnus You mean proposing said mister Pickwick Yes Never said mister Pickwick with great energy never You have no idea then how it s best to begin said mister Magnus Why said mister Pickwick I may have formed some ideas upon the subject but as I have never submitted them to the test of experience I should be sorry if you were induced to regulate your proceedings by them I should feel very much obliged to you for any advice Sir said mister Magnus taking another look at the clock the hand of which was verging on the five minutes past Well sir said mister Pickwick with the profound solemnity with which that great man could when he pleased render his remarks so deeply impressive I should commence sir with a tribute to the lady s beauty and excellent qualities from them Sir I should diverge to my own unworthiness Very good said mister Magnus Unworthiness for HER only mind sir resumed mister Pickwick for to show that I was not wholly unworthy sir I should take a brief review of my past life and present condition I should argue by analogy that to anybody else I must be a very desirable object I should then expatiate on the warmth of my love and the depth of my devotion Perhaps I might then be tempted to seize her hand Yes I see said mister Magnus that would be a very great point I should then Sir continued mister Pickwick growing warmer as the subject presented itself in more glowing colours before him I should then Sir come to the plain and simple question Will you have me I think I am justified in assuming that upon this she would turn away her head You think that may be taken for granted said mister Magnus because if she did not do that at the right place it would be embarrassing I think she would said mister Pickwick Upon this sir I should squeeze her hand and I think I think mister Magnus that after I had done that supposing there was no refusal I should gently draw away the handkerchief which my slight knowledge of human nature leads me to suppose the lady would be applying to her eyes at the moment and steal a respectful kiss I think I should kiss her mister Magnus and at this particular point I am decidedly of opinion that if the lady were going to take me at all she would murmur into my ears a bashful acceptance mister Magnus started gazed on mister Pickwick s intelligent face for a short time in silence and then the dial pointing to the ten minutes past shook him warmly by the hand and rushed desperately from the room mister Pickwick had taken a few strides to and fro and the small hand of the clock following the latter part of his example had arrived at the figure which indicates the half hour when the door suddenly opened He turned round to meet mister Peter Magnus and encountered in his stead the joyous face of mister Tupman the serene countenance of mister Winkle and the intellectual lineaments of mister Snodgrass As mister Pickwick greeted them mister Peter Magnus tripped into the room My friends the gentleman I was speaking of mister Magnus said mister Pickwick Your servant gentlemen said mister Magnus evidently in a high state of excitement mister Pickwick allow me to speak to you one moment sir As he said this mister Magnus harnessed his forefinger to mister Pickwick s buttonhole and drawing him to a window recess said Congratulate me mister Pickwick I followed your advice to the very letter And it was all correct was it inquired mister Pickwick It was Sir Could not possibly have been better replied mister Magnus mister Pickwick she is mine I congratulate you with all my heart replied mister Pickwick warmly shaking his new friend by the hand You must see her Sir said mister Magnus this way if you please Excuse us for one instant gentlemen Hurrying on in this way mister Peter Magnus drew mister Pickwick from the room He paused at the next door in the passage and tapped gently thereat Come in said a female voice And in they went Miss Witherfield said mister Magnus allow me to introduce my very particular friend mister Pickwick mister Pickwick I beg to make you known to Miss Witherfield The lady was at the upper end of the room As mister Pickwick bowed he took his spectacles from his waistcoat pocket and put them on a process which he had no sooner gone through than uttering an exclamation of surprise mister Pickwick retreated several paces and the lady with a half suppressed scream hid her face in her hands and dropped into a chair whereupon mister Peter Magnus was stricken motionless on the spot and gazed from one to the other with a countenance expressive of the extremities of horror and surprise This certainly was to all appearance very unaccountable behaviour but the fact is that mister Pickwick no sooner put on his spectacles than he at once recognised in the future missus Magnus the lady into whose room he had so unwarrantably intruded on the previous night and the spectacles had no sooner crossed mister Pickwick s nose than the lady at once identified the countenance which she had seen surrounded by all the horrors of a nightcap So the lady screamed and mister Pickwick started mister Pickwick exclaimed mister Magnus lost in astonishment what is the meaning of this Sir What is the meaning of it Sir added mister Magnus in a threatening and a louder tone Sir said mister Pickwick somewhat indignant at the very sudden manner in which mister Peter Magnus had conjugated himself into the imperative mood I decline answering that question You decline it Sir said mister Magnus I do Sir replied mister Pickwick I object to say anything which may compromise that lady or awaken unpleasant recollections in her breast without her consent and permission Miss Witherfield said mister Peter Magnus do you know this person Know him repeated the middle aged lady hesitating Yes know him ma am I said know him replied mister Magnus with ferocity I have seen him replied the middle aged lady Where inquired mister Magnus where That said the middle aged lady rising from her seat and averting her head that I would not reveal for worlds I understand you ma am said mister Pickwick and respect your delicacy it shall never be revealed by ME depend upon it Upon my word ma am said mister Magnus considering the situation in which I am placed with regard to yourself you carry this matter off with tolerable coolness tolerable coolness ma am Cruel mister Magnus said the middle aged lady here she wept very copiously indeed Address your observations to me sir interposed mister Pickwick I alone am to blame if anybody be Oh you alone are to blame are you sir said mister Magnus I I see through this sir You repent of your determination now do you My determination said mister Pickwick Your determination Sir Oh don t stare at me Sir said mister Magnus I recollect your words last night Sir You came down here sir to expose the treachery and falsehood of an individual on whose truth and honour you had placed implicit reliance eh Here mister Peter Magnus indulged in a prolonged sneer and taking off his green spectacles which he probably found superfluous in his fit of jealousy rolled his little eyes about in a manner frightful to behold Eh said mister Magnus and then he repeated the sneer with increased effect But you shall answer it Sir Answer what said mister Pickwick Never mind sir replied mister Magnus striding up and down the room Never mind There must be something very comprehensive in this phrase of Never mind for we do not recollect to have ever witnessed a quarrel in the street at a theatre public room or elsewhere in which it has not been the standard reply to all belligerent inquiries Do you call yourself a gentleman sir Never mind sir Did I offer to say anything to the young woman sir Never mind sir Do you want your head knocked up against that wall sir Never mind sir It is observable too that there would appear to be some hidden taunt in this universal Never mind which rouses more indignation in the bosom of the individual addressed than the most lavish abuse could possibly awaken We do not mean to assert that the application of this brevity to himself struck exactly that indignation to mister Pickwick s soul which it would infallibly have roused in a vulgar breast We merely record the fact that mister Pickwick opened the room door and abruptly called out Tupman come here mister Tupman immediately presented himself with a look of very considerable surprise Tupman said mister Pickwick a secret of some delicacy in which that lady is concerned is the cause of a difference which has just arisen between this gentleman and myself When I assure him in your presence that it has no relation to himself and is not in any way connected with his affairs I need hardly beg you to take notice that if he continue to dispute it he expresses a doubt of my veracity which I shall consider extremely insulting As mister Pickwick said this he looked encyclopedias at mister Peter Magnus mister Pickwick s upright and honourable bearing coupled with that force and energy of speech which so eminently distinguished him would have carried conviction to any reasonable mind but unfortunately at that particular moment the mind of mister Peter Magnus was in anything but reasonable order Consequently instead of receiving mister Pickwick s explanation as he ought to have done he forthwith proceeded to work himself into a red hot scorching consuming passion and to talk about what was due to his own feelings and all that sort of thing adding force to his declamation by striding to and fro and pulling his hair amusements which he would vary occasionally by shaking his fist in mister Pickwick s philanthropic countenance mister Pickwick in his turn conscious of his own innocence and rectitude and irritated by having unfortunately involved the middle aged lady in such an unpleasant affair was not so quietly disposed as was his wont The consequence was that words ran high and voices higher and at length mister Magnus told mister Pickwick he should hear from him to which mister Pickwick replied with laudable politeness that the sooner he heard from him the better whereupon the middle aged lady rushed in terror from the room out of which mister Tupman dragged mister Pickwick leaving mister Peter Magnus to himself and meditation If the middle aged lady had mingled much with the busy world or had profited at all by the manners and customs of those who make the laws and set the fashions she would have known that this sort of ferocity is the most harmless thing in nature but as she had lived for the most part in the country and never read the parliamentary debates she was little versed in these particular refinements of civilised life Accordingly when she had gained her bedchamber bolted herself in and began to meditate on the scene she had just witnessed the most terrific pictures of slaughter and destruction presented themselves to her imagination among which a full length portrait of mister Peter Magnus borne home by four men with the embellishment of a whole barrelful of bullets in his left side was among the very least The more the middle aged lady meditated the more terrified she became and at length she determined to repair to the house of the principal magistrate of the town and request him to secure the persons of mister Pickwick and mister Tupman without delay To this decision the middle aged lady was impelled by a variety of considerations the chief of which was the incontestable proof it would afford of her devotion to mister Peter Magnus and her anxiety for his safety She was too well acquainted with his jealous temperament to venture the slightest allusion to the real cause of her agitation on beholding mister Pickwick and she trusted to her own influence and power of persuasion with the little man to quell his boisterous jealousy supposing that mister Pickwick were removed and no fresh quarrel could arise Filled with these reflections the middle aged lady arrayed herself in her bonnet and shawl and repaired to the mayor s dwelling straightway Now George Nupkins Esquire the principal magistrate aforesaid was as grand a personage as the fastest walker would find out between sunrise and sunset on the twenty first of June which being according to the almanacs the longest day in the whole year would naturally afford him the longest period for his search On this particular morning mister Nupkins was in a state of the utmost excitement and irritation for there had been a rebellion in the town all the day scholars at the largest day school had conspired to break the windows of an obnoxious apple seller and had hooted the beadle and pelted the constabulary an elderly gentleman in top boots who had been called out to repress the tumult and who had been a peace officer man and boy for half a century at least And mister Nupkins was sitting in his easy chair frowning with majesty and boiling with rage when a lady was announced on pressing private and particular business mister Nupkins looked calmly terrible and commanded that the lady should be shown in which command like all the mandates of emperors and magistrates and other great potentates of the earth was forthwith obeyed and Miss Witherfield interestingly agitated was ushered in accordingly Muzzle said the magistrate Muzzle was an undersized footman with a long body and short legs Muzzle Yes your Worship Place a chair and leave the room Yes your Worship Now ma am will you state your business said the magistrate It is of a very painful kind Sir said Miss Witherfield Very likely ma am said the magistrate Compose your feelings ma am Here mister Nupkins looked benignant And then tell me what legal business brings you here ma am Here the magistrate triumphed over the man and he looked stern again It is very distressing to me Sir to give this information said Miss Witherfield but I fear a duel is going to be fought here Here ma am said the magistrate Where ma am In Ipswich In Ipswich ma am A duel in Ipswich said the magistrate perfectly aghast at the notion Impossible ma am nothing of the kind can be contemplated in this town I am persuaded Bless my soul ma am are you aware of the activity of our local magistracy Do you happen to have heard ma am that I rushed into a prize ring on the fourth of May last attended by only sixty special constables and at the hazard of falling a sacrifice to the angry passions of an infuriated multitude prohibited a pugilistic contest between the Middlesex Dumpling and the Suffolk Bantam A duel in Ipswich ma am I don t think I do not think said the magistrate reasoning with himself that any two men can have had the hardihood to plan such a breach of the peace in this town My information is unfortunately but too correct said the middle aged lady I was present at the quarrel It s a most extraordinary thing said the astounded magistrate Muzzle Yes your Worship Send mister Jinks here directly Instantly Yes your Worship Muzzle retired and a pale sharp nosed half fed shabbily clad clerk of middle age entered the room mister Jinks said the magistrate mister Jinks Sir said mister Jinks This lady mister Jinks has come here to give information of an intended duel in this town mister Jinks not knowing exactly what to do smiled a dependent s smile What are you laughing at mister Jinks said the magistrate mister Jinks looked serious instantly mister Jinks said the magistrate you re a fool mister Jinks looked humbly at the great man and bit the top of his pen You may see something very comical in this information Sir but I can tell you this mister Jinks that you have very little to laugh at said the magistrate The hungry looking Jinks sighed as if he were quite aware of the fact of his having very little indeed to be merry about and being ordered to take the lady s information shambled to a seat and proceeded to write it down This man Pickwick is the principal I understand said the magistrate when the statement was finished He is said the middle aged lady And the other rioter what s his name mister Jinks Tupman Sir Tupman is the second Yes The other principal you say has absconded ma am Yes replied Miss Witherfield with a short cough Very well said the magistrate These are two cut throats from London who have come down here to destroy his Majesty s population thinking that at this distance from the capital the arm of the law is weak and paralysed They shall be made an example of Draw up the warrants mister Jinks Muzzle Yes your Worship Is Grummer downstairs Yes your Worship Send him up The obsequious Muzzle retired and presently returned introducing the elderly gentleman in the top boots who was chiefly remarkable for a bottle nose a hoarse voice a snuff coloured surtout and a wandering eye Grummer said the magistrate Your Wash up Is the town quiet now Pretty well your Wash up replied Grummer Pop lar feeling has in a measure subsided consekens o the boys having dispersed to cricket Nothing but vigorous measures will do in these times Grummer said the magistrate in a determined manner If the authority of the king s officers is set at naught we must have the riot act read If the civil power cannot protect these windows Grummer the military must protect the civil power and the windows too I believe that is a maxim of the constitution mister Jinks Certainly sir said Jinks Very good said the magistrate signing the warrants Grummer you will bring these persons before me this afternoon You will find them at the Great White Horse You recollect the case of the Middlesex Dumpling and the Suffolk Bantam Grummer mister Grummer intimated by a retrospective shake of the head that he should never forget it as indeed it was not likely he would so long as it continued to be cited daily This is even more unconstitutional said the magistrate this is even a greater breach of the peace and a grosser infringement of his Majesty s prerogative I believe duelling is one of his Majesty s most undoubted prerogatives mister Jinks Expressly stipulated in Magna Charta sir said mister Jinks One of the brightest jewels in the British crown wrung from his Majesty by the barons I believe mister Jinks said the magistrate Just so Sir replied mister Jinks Very well said the magistrate drawing himself up proudly it shall not be violated in this portion of his dominions Grummer procure assistance and execute these warrants with as little delay as possible Muzzle Yes your Worship Show the lady out Miss Witherfield retired deeply impressed with the magistrate s learning and research mister Nupkins retired to lunch mister Jinks retired within himself that being the only retirement he had except the sofa bedstead in the small parlour which was occupied by his landlady s family in the daytime and mister Grummer retired to wipe out by his mode of discharging his present commission the insult which had been fastened upon himself and the other representative of his Majesty the beadle in the course of the morning While these resolute and determined preparations for the conservation of the king s peace were pending mister Pickwick and his friends wholly unconscious of the mighty events in progress had sat quietly down to dinner and very talkative and companionable they all were mister Pickwick was in the very act of relating his adventure of the preceding night to the great amusement of his followers mister Tupman especially when the door opened and a somewhat forbidding countenance peeped into the room The eyes in the forbidding countenance looked very earnestly at mister Pickwick for several seconds and were to all appearance satisfied with their investigation for the body to which the forbidding countenance belonged slowly brought itself into the apartment and presented the form of an elderly individual in top boots not to keep the reader any longer in suspense in short the eyes were the wandering eyes of mister Grummer and the body was the body of the same gentleman mister Grummer s mode of proceeding was professional but peculiar His first act was to bolt the door on the inside his second to polish his head and countenance very carefully with a cotton handkerchief his third to place his hat with the cotton handkerchief in it on the nearest chair and his fourth to produce from the breast pocket of his coat a short truncheon surmounted by a brazen crown with which he beckoned to mister Pickwick with a grave and ghost like air mister Snodgrass was the first to break the astonished silence He looked steadily at mister Grummer for a brief space and then said emphatically This is a private room Sir A private room mister Grummer shook his head and replied No room s private to his Majesty when the street door s once passed That s law Some people maintains that an Englishman s house is his castle That s gammon The Pickwickians gazed on each other with wondering eyes Which is mister Tupman inquired mister Grummer He had an intuitive perception of mister Pickwick he knew him at once My name s Tupman said that gentleman My name s Law said mister Grummer What said mister Tupman Law replied mister Grummer Law civil power and exekative them s my titles here s my authority Blank Tupman blank Pickwick against the peace of our sufferin lord the king stattit in the case made and purwided and all regular I apprehend you Pickwick Tupman the aforesaid What do you mean by this insolence said mister Tupman starting up leave the room Hollo said mister Grummer retreating very expeditiously to the door and opening it an inch or two Dubbley Well said a deep voice from the passage Come for ard Dubbley At the word of command a dirty faced man something over six feet high and stout in proportion squeezed himself through the half open door making his face very red in the process and entered the room Is the other specials outside Dubbley inquired mister Grummer mister Dubbley who was a man of few words nodded assent Order in the diwision under your charge Dubbley said mister Grummer mister Dubbley did as he was desired and half a dozen men each with a short truncheon and a brass crown flocked into the room mister Grummer pocketed his staff and looked at mister Dubbley mister Dubbley pocketed his staff and looked at the division the division pocketed their staves and looked at Messrs Tupman and Pickwick mister Pickwick and his followers rose as one man What is the meaning of this atrocious intrusion upon my privacy said mister Pickwick Who dares apprehend me said mister Tupman What do you want here scoundrels said mister Snodgrass mister Winkle said nothing but he fixed his eyes on Grummer and bestowed a look upon him which if he had had any feeling must have pierced his brain As it was however it had no visible effect on him whatever When the executive perceived that mister Pickwick and his friends were disposed to resist the authority of the law they very significantly turned up their coat sleeves as if knocking them down in the first instance and taking them up afterwards were a mere professional act which had only to be thought of to be done as a matter of course This demonstration was not lost upon mister Pickwick He conferred a few moments with mister Tupman apart and then signified his readiness to proceed to the mayor s residence merely begging the parties then and there assembled to take notice that it was his firm intention to resent this monstrous invasion of his privileges as an Englishman the instant he was at liberty whereat the parties then and there assembled laughed very heartily with the single exception of mister Grummer who seemed to consider that any slight cast upon the divine right of magistrates was a species of blasphemy not to be tolerated But when mister Pickwick had signified his readiness to bow to the laws of his country and just when the waiters and hostlers and chambermaids and post boys who had anticipated a delightful commotion from his threatened obstinacy began to turn away disappointed and disgusted a difficulty arose which had not been foreseen With every sentiment of veneration for the constituted authorities mister Pickwick resolutely protested against making his appearance in the public streets surrounded and guarded by the officers of justice like a common criminal mister Grummer in the then disturbed state of public feeling for it was half holiday and the boys had not yet gone home as resolutely protested against walking on the opposite side of the way and taking mister Pickwick s parole that he would go straight to the magistrate s and both mister Pickwick and mister Tupman as strenuously objected to the expense of a post coach which was the only respectable conveyance that could be obtained The dispute ran high and the dilemma lasted long and just as the executive were on the point of overcoming mister Pickwick s objection to walking to the magistrate s by the trite expedient of carrying him thither it was recollected that there stood in the inn yard an old sedan chair which having been originally built for a gouty gentleman with funded property would hold mister Pickwick and mister Tupman at least as conveniently as a modern post chaise The chair was hired and brought into the hall mister Pickwick and mister Tupman squeezed themselves inside and pulled down the blinds a couple of chairmen were speedily found and the procession started in grand order The specials surrounded the body of the vehicle mister Grummer and mister Dubbley marched triumphantly in front mister Snodgrass and mister Winkle walked arm in arm behind and the unsoaped of Ipswich brought up the rear The shopkeepers of the town although they had a very indistinct notion of the nature of the offence could not but be much edified and gratified by this spectacle Here was the strong arm of the law coming down with twenty gold beater force upon two offenders from the metropolis itself the mighty engine was directed by their own magistrate and worked by their own officers and both the criminals by their united efforts were securely shut up in the narrow compass of one sedan chair Many were the expressions of approval and admiration which greeted mister Grummer as he headed the cavalcade staff in hand loud and long were the shouts raised by the unsoaped and amidst these united testimonials of public approbation the procession moved slowly and majestically along mister Weller habited in his morning jacket with the black calico sleeves was returning in a rather desponding state from an unsuccessful survey of the mysterious house with the green gate when raising his eyes he beheld a crowd pouring down the street surrounding an object which had very much the appearance of a sedan chair Willing to divert his thoughts from the failure of his enterprise he stepped aside to see the crowd pass and finding that they were cheering away very much to their own satisfaction forthwith began by way of raising his spirits to cheer too with all his might and main mister Grummer passed and mister Dubbley passed and the sedan passed and the bodyguard of specials passed and Sam was still responding to the enthusiastic cheers of the mob and waving his hat about as if he were in the very last extreme of the wildest joy though of course he had not the faintest idea of the matter in hand when he was suddenly stopped by the unexpected appearance of mister Winkle and mister Snodgrass What s the row general l m n cried Sam Who have they got in this here watch box in mournin Both gentlemen replied together but their words were lost in the tumult Who is it cried Sam again once more was a joint reply returned and though the words were inaudible Sam saw by the motion of the two pairs of lips that they had uttered the magic word Pickwick This was enough In another minute mister Weller had made his way through the crowd stopped the chairmen and confronted the portly Grummer Hollo old general l m n said Sam Who have you got in this here conweyance Stand back said mister Grummer whose dignity like the dignity of a great many other men had been wondrously augmented by a little popularity Knock him down if he don t said mister Dubbley I m wery much obliged to you old general l m n replied Sam for consulting my conwenience and I m still more obliged to the other general l m n who looks as if he d just escaped from a giant s carrywan for his wery andsome suggestion but I should prefer your givin me a answer to my question if it s all the same to you How are you Sir This last observation was addressed with a patronising air to mister Pickwick who was peeping through the front window mister Grummer perfectly speechless with indignation dragged the truncheon with the brass crown from its particular pocket and flourished it before Sam s eyes Ah said Sam it s wery pretty specially the crown which is uncommon like the real one Stand back said the outraged mister Grummer By way of adding force to the command he thrust the brass emblem of royalty into Sam s neckcloth with one hand and seized Sam s collar with the other a compliment which mister Weller returned by knocking him down out of hand having previously with the utmost consideration knocked down a chairman for him to lie upon Whether mister Winkle was seized with a temporary attack of that species of insanity which originates in a sense of injury or animated by this display of mister Weller s valour is uncertain but certain it is that he no sooner saw mister Grummer fall than he made a terrific onslaught on a small boy who stood next him whereupon mister Snodgrass in a truly Christian spirit and in order that he might take no one unawares announced in a very loud tone that he was going to begin and proceeded to take off his coat with the utmost deliberation He was immediately surrounded and secured and it is but common justice both to him and mister Winkle to say that they did not make the slightest attempt to rescue either themselves or mister Weller who after a most vigorous resistance was overpowered by numbers and taken prisoner The procession then reformed the chairmen resumed their stations and the march was re commenced mister Pickwick s indignation during the whole of this proceeding was beyond all bounds He could just see Sam upsetting the specials and flying about in every direction and that was all he could see for the sedan doors wouldn t open and the blinds wouldn t pull up At length with the assistance of mister Tupman he managed to push open the roof and mounting on the seat and steadying himself as well as he could by placing his hand on that gentleman s shoulder mister Pickwick proceeded to address the multitude to dwell upon the unjustifiable manner in which he had been treated and to call upon them to take notice that his servant had been first assaulted In this order they reached the magistrate s house the chairmen trotting the prisoners following mister Pickwick oratorising and the crowd shouting CHAPTER XXV SHOWING AMONG A VARIETY OF PLEASANT MATTERS HOW MAJESTIC AND IMPARTIAL mister NUPKINS WAS AND HOW mister WELLER RETURNED mister JOB TROTTER S SHUTTLECOCK AS HEAVILY AS IT CAME WITH ANOTHER MATTER WHICH WILL BE FOUND IN ITS PLACE Violent was mister Weller s indignation as he was borne along numerous were the allusions to the personal appearance and demeanour of mister Grummer and his companion and valorous were the defiances to any six of the gentlemen present in which he vented his dissatisfaction mister Snodgrass and mister Winkle listened with gloomy respect to the torrent of eloquence which their leader poured forth from the sedan chair and the rapid course of which not all mister Tupman s earnest entreaties to have the lid of the vehicle closed were able to check for an instant But mister Weller s anger quickly gave way to curiosity when the procession turned down the identical courtyard in which he had met with the runaway Job Trotter and curiosity was exchanged for a feeling of the most gleeful astonishment when the all important mister Grummer commanding the sedan bearers to halt advanced with dignified and portentous steps to the very green gate from which Job Trotter had emerged and gave a mighty pull at the bell handle which hung at the side thereof The ring was answered by a very smart and pretty faced servant girl who after holding up her hands in astonishment at the rebellious appearance of the prisoners and the impassioned language of mister Pickwick summoned mister Muzzle mister Muzzle opened one half of the carriage gate to admit the sedan the captured ones and the specials and immediately slammed it in the faces of the mob who indignant at being excluded and anxious to see what followed relieved their feelings by kicking at the gate and ringing the bell for an hour or two afterwards In this amusement they all took part by turns except three or four fortunate individuals who having discovered a grating in the gate which commanded a view of nothing stared through it with the indefatigable perseverance with which people will flatten their noses against the front windows of a chemist s shop when a drunken man who has been run over by a dog cart in the street is undergoing a surgical inspection in the back parlour At the foot of a flight of steps leading to the house door which was guarded on either side by an American aloe in a green tub the sedan chair stopped mister Pickwick and his friends were conducted into the hall whence having been previously announced by Muzzle and ordered in by mister Nupkins they were ushered into the worshipful presence of that public spirited officer The scene was an impressive one well calculated to strike terror to the hearts of culprits and to impress them with an adequate idea of the stern majesty of the law In front of a big book case in a big chair behind a big table and before a big volume sat mister Nupkins looking a full size larger than any one of them big as they were The table was adorned with piles of papers and above the farther end of it appeared the head and shoulders of mister Jinks who was busily engaged in looking as busy as possible The party having all entered Muzzle carefully closed the door and placed himself behind his master s chair to await his orders mister Nupkins threw himself back with thrilling solemnity and scrutinised the faces of his unwilling visitors Now Grummer who is that person said mister Nupkins pointing to mister Pickwick who as the spokesman of his friends stood hat in hand bowing with the utmost politeness and respect This here s Pickvick your Wash up said Grummer Come none o that ere old Strike a light interposed mister Weller elbowing himself into the front rank Beg your pardon sir but this here officer o yourn in the gambooge tops ull never earn a decent livin as a master o the ceremonies any vere This here sir continued mister Weller thrusting Grummer aside and addressing the magistrate with pleasant familiarity this here is S Pickvick Esquire this here s mister Tupman that ere s mister Snodgrass and farder on next him on the t other side mister Winkle all wery nice general l m n Sir as you ll be wery happy to have the acquaintance on so the sooner you commits these here officers o yourn to the tread mill for a month or two the sooner we shall begin to be on a pleasant understanding Business first pleasure arterwards as King Richard the Third said when he stabbed the t other king in the Tower afore he smothered the babbies At the conclusion of this address mister Weller brushed his hat with his right elbow and nodded benignly to Jinks who had heard him throughout with unspeakable awe Who is this man Grummer said the magistrate Wery desp rate ch racter your Wash up replied Grummer He attempted to rescue the prisoners and assaulted the officers so we took him into custody and brought him here You did quite right replied the magistrate He is evidently a desperate ruffian He is my servant Sir said mister Pickwick angrily Oh he is your servant is he said mister Nupkins A conspiracy to defeat the ends of justice and murder its officers Pickwick s servant Put that down mister Jinks mister Jinks did so What s your name fellow thundered mister Nupkins Veller replied Sam A very good name for the Newgate Calendar said mister Nupkins This was a joke so Jinks Grummer Dubbley all the specials and Muzzle went into fits of laughter of five minutes duration Put down his name mister Jinks said the magistrate Two L s old feller said Sam Here an unfortunate special laughed again whereupon the magistrate threatened to commit him instantly It is a dangerous thing to laugh at the wrong man in these cases Where do you live said the magistrate Vere ever I can replied Sam Put down that mister Jinks said the magistrate who was fast rising into a rage Score it under said Sam He is a vagabond mister Jinks said the magistrate He is a vagabond on his own statement is he not mister Jinks Certainly Sir Then I ll commit him I ll commit him as such said mister Nupkins This is a wery impartial country for justice said Sam There ain t a magistrate goin as don t commit himself twice as he commits other people At this sally another special laughed and then tried to look so supernaturally solemn that the magistrate detected him immediately Grummer said mister Nupkins reddening with passion how dare you select such an inefficient and disreputable person for a special constable as that man How dare you do it Sir I am very sorry your Wash up stammered Grummer Very sorry said the furious magistrate You shall repent of this neglect of duty mister Grummer you shall be made an example of Take that fellow s staff away He s drunk You re drunk fellow I am not drunk your Worship said the man You ARE drunk returned the magistrate How dare you say you are not drunk Sir when I say you are Doesn t he smell of spirits Grummer Horrid your Wash up replied Grummer who had a vague impression that there was a smell of rum somewhere I knew he did said mister Nupkins I saw he was drunk when he first came into the room by his excited eye Did you observe his excited eye mister Jinks Certainly Sir I haven t touched a drop of spirits this morning said the man who was as sober a fellow as need be How dare you tell me a falsehood said mister Nupkins Isn t he drunk at this moment mister Jinks Certainly Sir replied Jinks mister Jinks said the magistrate I shall commit that man for contempt Make out his committal mister Jinks And committed the special would have been only Jinks who was the magistrate s adviser having had a legal education of three years in a country attorney s office whispered the magistrate that he thought it wouldn t do so the magistrate made a speech and said that in consideration of the special s family he would merely reprimand and discharge him Accordingly the special was abused vehemently for a quarter of an hour and sent about his business and Grummer Dubbley Muzzle and all the other specials murmured their admiration of the magnanimity of mister Nupkins Now mister Jinks said the magistrate swear Grummer Grummer was sworn directly but as Grummer wandered and mister Nupkins s dinner was nearly ready mister Nupkins cut the matter short by putting leading questions to Grummer which Grummer answered as nearly in the affirmative as he could So the examination went off all very smooth and comfortable and two assaults were proved against mister Weller and a threat against mister Winkle and a push against mister Snodgrass When all this was done to the magistrate s satisfaction the magistrate and mister Jinks consulted in whispers The consultation having lasted about ten minutes mister Jinks retired to his end of the table and the magistrate with a preparatory cough drew himself up in his chair and was proceeding to commence his address when mister Pickwick interposed I beg your pardon sir for interrupting you said mister Pickwick but before you proceed to express and act upon any opinion you may have formed on the statements which have been made here I must claim my right to be heard so far as I am personally concerned Hold your tongue Sir said the magistrate peremptorily I must submit to you Sir said mister Pickwick Hold your tongue sir interposed the magistrate or I shall order an officer to remove you You may order your officers to do whatever you please Sir said mister Pickwick and I have no doubt from the specimen I have had of the subordination preserved amongst them that whatever you order they will execute Sir but I shall take the liberty Sir of claiming my right to be heard until I am removed by force Pickvick and principle exclaimed mister Weller in a very audible voice Sam be quiet said mister Pickwick Dumb as a drum vith a hole in it Sir replied Sam mister Nupkins looked at mister Pickwick with a gaze of intense astonishment at his displaying such unwonted temerity and was apparently about to return a very angry reply when mister Jinks pulled him by the sleeve and whispered something in his ear To this the magistrate returned a half audible answer and then the whispering was renewed Jinks was evidently remonstrating At length the magistrate gulping down with a very bad grace his disinclination to hear anything more turned to mister Pickwick and said sharply What do you want to say First said mister Pickwick sending a look through his spectacles under which even Nupkins quailed first I wish to know what I and my friend have been brought here for Must I tell him whispered the magistrate to Jinks I think you had better sir whispered Jinks to the magistrate An information has been sworn before me said the magistrate that it is apprehended you are going to fight a duel and that the other man Tupman is your aider and abettor in it Therefore eh mister Jinks Certainly sir Therefore I call upon you both to I think that s the course mister Jinks Certainly Sir To to what mister Jinks said the magistrate pettishly To find bail sir Yes Therefore I call upon you both as I was about to say when I was interrupted by my clerk to find bail Good bail whispered mister Jinks I shall require good bail said the magistrate Town s people whispered Jinks They must be townspeople said the magistrate Fifty pounds each whispered Jinks and householders of course I shall require two sureties of fifty pounds each said the magistrate aloud with great dignity and they must be householders of course But bless my heart Sir said mister Pickwick who together with mister Tupman was all amazement and indignation we are perfect strangers in this town I have as little knowledge of any householders here as I have intention of fighting a duel with anybody I dare say replied the magistrate I dare say don t you mister Jinks Certainly Sir Have you anything more to say inquired the magistrate mister Pickwick had a great deal more to say which he would no doubt have said very little to his own advantage or the magistrate s satisfaction if he had not the moment he ceased speaking been pulled by the sleeve by mister Weller with whom he was immediately engaged in so earnest a conversation that he suffered the magistrate s inquiry to pass wholly unnoticed mister Nupkins was not the man to ask a question of the kind twice over and so with another preparatory cough he proceeded amidst the reverential and admiring silence of the constables to pronounce his decision He should fine Weller two pounds for the first assault and three pounds for the second He should fine Winkle two pounds and Snodgrass one pound besides requiring them to enter into their own recognisances to keep the peace towards all his Majesty s subjects and especially towards his liege servant Daniel Grummer Pickwick and Tupman he had already held to bail Immediately on the magistrate ceasing to speak mister Pickwick with a smile mantling on his again good humoured countenance stepped forward and said I beg the magistrate s pardon but may I request a few minutes private conversation with him on a matter of deep importance to himself What said the magistrate mister Pickwick repeated his request This is a most extraordinary request said the magistrate A private interview A private interview replied mister Pickwick firmly only as a part of the information which I wish to communicate is derived from my servant I should wish him to be present The magistrate looked at mister Jinks mister Jinks looked at the magistrate the officers looked at each other in amazement mister Nupkins turned suddenly pale Could the man Weller in a moment of remorse have divulged some secret conspiracy for his assassination It was a dreadful thought He was a public man and he turned paler as he thought of Julius Caesar and mister Perceval The magistrate looked at mister Pickwick again and beckoned mister Jinks What do you think of this request mister Jinks murmured mister Nupkins mister Jinks who didn t exactly know what to think of it and was afraid he might offend smiled feebly after a dubious fashion and screwing up the corners of his mouth shook his head slowly from side to side mister Jinks said the magistrate gravely you are an ass At this little expression of opinion mister Jinks smiled again rather more feebly than before and edged himself by degrees back into his own corner mister Nupkins debated the matter within himself for a few seconds and then rising from his chair and requesting mister Pickwick and Sam to follow him led the way into a small room which opened into the justice parlour Desiring mister Pickwick to walk to the upper end of the little apartment and holding his hand upon the half closed door that he might be able to effect an immediate escape in case there was the least tendency to a display of hostilities mister Nupkins expressed his readiness to hear the communication whatever it might be I will come to the point at once sir said mister Pickwick it affects yourself and your credit materially I have every reason to believe Sir that you are harbouring in your house a gross impostor Two interrupted Sam Mulberry agin all natur for tears and willainny Sam said mister Pickwick if I am to render myself intelligible to this gentleman I must beg you to control your feelings Wery sorry Sir replied mister Weller but when I think o that ere Job I can t help opening the walve a inch or two In one word Sir said mister Pickwick is my servant right in suspecting that a certain Captain Fitz Marshall is in the habit of visiting here Because added mister Pickwick as he saw that mister Nupkins was about to offer a very indignant interruption because if he be I know that person to be a Hush hush said mister Nupkins closing the door Know him to be what Sir An unprincipled adventurer a dishonourable character a man who preys upon society and makes easily deceived people his dupes Sir his absurd his foolish his wretched dupes Sir said the excited mister Pickwick Dear me said mister Nupkins turning very red and altering his whole manner directly Dear me mister Pickvick said Sam Pickwick said the magistrate dear me mister Pickwick pray take a seat you cannot mean this Captain Fitz Marshall Don t call him a cap en said Sam nor Fitz Marshall neither he ain t neither one nor t other He s a strolling actor he is and his name s Jingle and if ever there was a wolf in a mulberry suit that ere Job Trotter s him It is very true Sir said mister Pickwick replying to the magistrate s look of amazement my only business in this town is to expose the person of whom we now speak mister Pickwick proceeded to pour into the horror stricken ear of mister Nupkins an abridged account of all mister Jingle s atrocities He related how he had first met him how he had eloped with Miss Wardle how he had cheerfully resigned the lady for a pecuniary consideration how he had entrapped himself into a lady s boarding school at midnight and how he mister Pickwick now felt it his duty to expose his assumption of his present name and rank As the narrative proceeded all the warm blood in the body of mister Nupkins tingled up into the very tips of his ears He had picked up the captain at a neighbouring race course Charmed with his long list of aristocratic acquaintance his extensive travel and his fashionable demeanour missus Nupkins and Miss Nupkins had exhibited Captain Fitz Marshall and quoted Captain Fitz Marshall and hurled Captain Fitz Marshall at the devoted heads of their select circle of acquaintance until their bosom friends missus Porkenham and the Misses Porkenhams and mister Sidney Porkenham were ready to burst with jealousy and despair And now to hear after all that he was a needy adventurer a strolling player and if not a swindler something so very like it that it was hard to tell the difference Heavens what would the Porkenhams say What would be the triumph of mister Sidney Porkenham when he found that his addresses had been slighted for such a rival How should he Nupkins meet the eye of old Porkenham at the next quarter sessions And what a handle would it be for the opposition magisterial party if the story got abroad But after all said mister Nupkins brightening for a moment after a long pause after all this is a mere statement Captain Fitz Marshall is a man of very engaging manners and I dare say has many enemies What proof have you of the truth of these representations Confront me with him said mister Pickwick that is all I ask and all I require Confront him with me and my friends here you will want no further proof Why said mister Nupkins that might be very easily done for he will be here to night and then there would be no occasion to make the matter public just just for the young man s own sake you know I I should like to consult missus Nupkins on the propriety of the step in the first instance though At all events mister Pickwick we must despatch this legal business before we can do anything else Pray step back into the next room Into the next room they went Grummer said the magistrate in an awful voice Your Wash up replied Grummer with the smile of a favourite Come come Sir said the magistrate sternly don t let me see any of this levity here It is very unbecoming and I can assure you that you have very little to smile at Was the account you gave me just now strictly true Now be careful sir Your Wash up stammered Grummer I Oh you are confused are you said the magistrate mister Jinks you observe this confusion Certainly Sir replied Jinks Now said the magistrate repeat your statement Grummer and again I warn you to be careful mister Jinks take his words down The unfortunate Grummer proceeded to re state his complaint but what between mister Jinks s taking down his words and the magistrate s taking them up his natural tendency to rambling and his extreme confusion he managed to get involved in something under three minutes in such a mass of entanglement and contradiction that mister Nupkins at once declared he didn t believe him So the fines were remitted and mister Jinks found a couple of bail in no time And all these solemn proceedings having been satisfactorily concluded mister Grummer was ignominiously ordered out an awful instance of the instability of human greatness and the uncertain tenure of great men s favour missus Nupkins was a majestic female in a pink gauze turban and a light brown wig Miss Nupkins possessed all her mamma s haughtiness without the turban and all her ill nature without the wig and whenever the exercise of these two amiable qualities involved mother and daughter in some unpleasant dilemma as they not infrequently did they both concurred in laying the blame on the shoulders of mister Nupkins Accordingly when mister Nupkins sought missus Nupkins and detailed the communication which had been made by mister Pickwick missus Nupkins suddenly recollected that she had always expected something of the kind that she had always said it would be so that her advice was never taken that she really did not know what mister Nupkins supposed she was and so forth The idea said Miss Nupkins forcing a tear of very scanty proportions into the corner of each eye the idea of my being made such a fool of Ah you may thank your papa my dear said missus Nupkins how I have implored and begged that man to inquire into the captain s family connections how I have urged and entreated him to take some decisive step I am quite certain nobody would believe it quite But my dear said mister Nupkins Don t talk to me you aggravating thing don t said missus Nupkins My love said mister Nupkins you professed yourself very fond of Captain Fitz Marshall You have constantly asked him here my dear and you have lost no opportunity of introducing him elsewhere Didn t I say so Henrietta cried missus Nupkins appealing to her daughter with the air of a much injured female Didn t I say that your papa would turn round and lay all this at my door Didn t I say so Here missus Nupkins sobbed Oh pa remonstrated Miss Nupkins And here she sobbed too Isn t it too much when he has brought all this disgrace and ridicule upon us to taunt me with being the cause of it exclaimed missus Nupkins How can we ever show ourselves in society said Miss Nupkins How can we face the Porkenhams cried missus Nupkins Or the Griggs cried Miss Nupkins Or the Slummintowkens cried missus Nupkins But what does your papa care What is it to HIM At this dreadful reflection missus Nupkins wept mental anguish and Miss Nupkins followed on the same side missus Nupkins s tears continued to gush forth with great velocity until she had gained a little time to think the matter over when she decided in her own mind that the best thing to do would be to ask mister Pickwick and his friends to remain until the captain s arrival and then to give mister Pickwick the opportunity he sought If it appeared that he had spoken truly the captain could be turned out of the house without noising the matter abroad and they could easily account to the Porkenhams for his disappearance by saying that he had been appointed through the Court influence of his family to the governor generalship of Sierra Leone of Saugur Point or any other of those salubrious climates which enchant Europeans so much that when they once get there they can hardly ever prevail upon themselves to come back again When missus Nupkins dried up her tears Miss Nupkins dried up hers and mister Nupkins was very glad to settle the matter as missus Nupkins had proposed So mister Pickwick and his friends having washed off all marks of their late encounter were introduced to the ladies and soon afterwards to their dinner and mister Weller whom the magistrate with his peculiar sagacity had discovered in half an hour to be one of the finest fellows alive was consigned to the care and guardianship of mister Muzzle who was specially enjoined to take him below and make much of him How de do sir said mister Muzzle as he conducted mister Weller down the kitchen stairs Why no considerable change has taken place in the state of my system since I see you cocked up behind your governor s chair in the parlour a little vile ago replied Sam You will excuse my not taking more notice of you then said mister Muzzle You see master hadn t introduced us then Lord how fond he is of you mister Weller to be sure Ah said Sam what a pleasant chap he is Ain t he replied mister Muzzle So much humour said Sam And such a man to speak said mister Muzzle How his ideas flow don t they Wonderful replied Sam they comes a pouring out knocking each other s heads so fast that they seems to stun one another you hardly know what he s arter do you That s the great merit of his style of speaking rejoined mister Muzzle Take care of the last step mister Weller Would you like to wash your hands sir before we join the ladies Here s a sink with the water laid on Sir and a clean jack towel behind the door Ah perhaps I may as well have a rinse replied mister Weller applying plenty of yellow soap to the towel and rubbing away till his face shone again How many ladies are there Only two in our kitchen said mister Muzzle cook and ouse maid We keep a boy to do the dirty work and a gal besides but they dine in the wash us Oh they dines in the wash us do they said mister Weller Yes replied mister Muzzle we tried em at our table when they first come but we couldn t keep em The gal s manners is dreadful vulgar and the boy breathes so very hard while he s eating that we found it impossible to sit at table with him Young grampus said mister Weller Oh dreadful rejoined mister Muzzle but that is the worst of country service mister Weller the juniors is always so very savage This way sir if you please this way Preceding mister Weller with the utmost politeness mister Muzzle conducted him into the kitchen Mary said mister Muzzle to the pretty servant girl this is mister Weller a gentleman as master has sent down to be made as comfortable as possible And your master s a knowin hand and has just sent me to the right place said mister Weller with a glance of admiration at Mary If I wos master o this here house I should alvays find the materials for comfort vere Mary wos Lor mister Weller said Mary blushing Well I never ejaculated the cook Bless me cook I forgot you said mister Muzzle mister Weller let me introduce you How are you ma am said mister Weller Wery glad to see you indeed and hope our acquaintance may be a long un as the general l m n said to the fi pun note When this ceremony of introduction had been gone through the cook and Mary retired into the back kitchen to titter for ten minutes then returning all giggles and blushes they sat down to dinner mister Weller s easy manners and conversational powers had such irresistible influence with his new friends that before the dinner was half over they were on a footing of perfect intimacy and in possession of a full account of the delinquency of Job Trotter I never could a bear that Job said Mary No more you never ought to my dear replied mister Weller Why not inquired Mary Cos ugliness and svindlin never ought to be formiliar with elegance and wirtew replied mister Weller Ought they mister Muzzle Not by no means replied that gentleman Here Mary laughed and said the cook had made her and the cook laughed and said she hadn t I ha n t got a glass said Mary Drink with me my dear said mister Weller Put your lips to this here tumbler and then I can kiss you by deputy For shame mister Weller said Mary What s a shame my dear Talkin in that way Nonsense it ain t no harm It s natur ain t it cook Don t ask me imperence replied the cook in a high state of delight and hereupon the cook and Mary laughed again till what between the beer and the cold meat and the laughter combined the latter young lady was brought to the verge of choking an alarming crisis from which she was only recovered by sundry pats on the back and other necessary attentions most delicately administered by mister Samuel Weller In the midst of all this jollity and conviviality a loud ring was heard at the garden gate to which the young gentleman who took his meals in the wash house immediately responded mister Weller was in the height of his attentions to the pretty house maid mister Muzzle was busy doing the honours of the table and the cook had just paused to laugh in the very act of raising a huge morsel to her lips when the kitchen door opened and in walked mister Job Trotter We have said in walked mister Job Trotter but the statement is not distinguished by our usual scrupulous adherence to fact The door opened and mister Trotter appeared He would have walked in and was in the very act of doing so indeed when catching sight of mister Weller he involuntarily shrank back a pace or two and stood gazing on the unexpected scene before him perfectly motionless with amazement and terror Here he is said Sam rising with great glee Why we were that wery moment a speaking o you How are you Where have you been Come in Laying his hand on the mulberry collar of the unresisting Job mister Weller dragged him into the kitchen and locking the door handed the key to mister Muzzle who very coolly buttoned it up in a side pocket Well here s a game cried Sam Only think o my master havin the pleasure o meeting yourn upstairs and me havin the joy o meetin you down here How are you gettin on and how is the chandlery bis ness likely to do Well I am so glad to see you How happy you look It s quite a treat to see you ain t it mister Muzzle Quite said mister Muzzle So cheerful he is said Sam In such good spirits said Muzzle And so glad to see us that makes it so much more comfortable said Sam Sit down sit down mister Trotter suffered himself to be forced into a chair by the fireside He cast his small eyes first on mister Weller and then on mister Muzzle but said nothing Well now said Sam afore these here ladies I should jest like to ask you as a sort of curiosity whether you don t consider yourself as nice and well behaved a young general l m n as ever used a pink check pocket handkerchief and the number four collection And as was ever a going to be married to a cook said that lady indignantly The willin And leave off his evil ways and set up in the chandlery line arterwards said the housemaid Now I ll tell you what it is young man said mister Muzzle solemnly enraged at the last two allusions this here lady pointing to the cook keeps company with me and when you presume Sir to talk of keeping chandlers shops with her you injure me in one of the most delicatest points in which one man can injure another Do you understand that Sir Here mister Muzzle who had a great notion of his eloquence in which he imitated his master paused for a reply But mister Trotter made no reply So mister Muzzle proceeded in a solemn manner It s very probable sir that you won t be wanted upstairs for several minutes Sir because MY master is at this moment particularly engaged in settling the hash of YOUR master Sir and therefore you ll have leisure Sir for a little private talk with me Sir Do you understand that Sir mister Muzzle again paused for a reply and again mister Trotter disappointed him Well then said mister Muzzle I m very sorry to have to explain myself before ladies but the urgency of the case will be my excuse The back kitchen s empty Sir If you will step in there Sir mister Weller will see fair and we can have mutual satisfaction till the bell rings Follow me Sir As mister Muzzle uttered these words he took a step or two towards the door and by way of saving time began to pull off his coat as he walked along Now the cook no sooner heard the concluding words of this desperate challenge and saw mister Muzzle about to put it into execution than she uttered a loud and piercing shriek and rushing on mister Job Trotter who rose from his chair on the instant tore and buffeted his large flat face with an energy peculiar to excited females and twining her hands in his long black hair tore therefrom about enough to make five or six dozen of the very largest sized mourning rings Having accomplished this feat with all the ardour which her devoted love for mister Muzzle inspired she staggered back and being a lady of very excitable and delicate feelings she instantly fell under the dresser and fainted away At this moment the bell rang That s for you Job Trotter said Sam and before mister Trotter could offer remonstrance or reply even before he had time to stanch the wounds inflicted by the insensible lady Sam seized one arm and mister Muzzle the other and one pulling before and the other pushing behind they conveyed him upstairs and into the parlour It was an impressive tableau Alfred Jingle Esquire alias Captain Fitz Marshall was standing near the door with his hat in his hand and a smile on his face wholly unmoved by his very unpleasant situation Confronting him stood mister Pickwick who had evidently been inculcating some high moral lesson for his left hand was beneath his coat tail and his right extended in air as was his wont when delivering himself of an impressive address At a little distance stood mister Tupman with indignant countenance carefully held back by his two younger friends at the farther end of the room were mister Nupkins missus Nupkins and Miss Nupkins gloomily grand and savagely vexed What prevents me said mister Nupkins with magisterial dignity as Job was brought in what prevents me from detaining these men as rogues and impostors It is a foolish mercy What prevents me Pride old fellow pride replied Jingle quite at his ease Wouldn t do no go caught a captain eh ha ha very good husband for daughter biter bit make it public not for worlds look stupid very Wretch said mister Nupkins we scorn your base insinuations I always hated him added Henrietta Oh of course said Jingle Tall young man old lover Sidney Porkenham rich fine fellow not so rich as captain though eh turn him away off with him anything for captain nothing like captain anywhere all the girls raving mad eh Job eh Here mister Jingle laughed very heartily and Job rubbing his hands with delight uttered the first sound he had given vent to since he entered the house a low noiseless chuckle which seemed to intimate that he enjoyed his laugh too much to let any of it escape in sound mister Nupkins said the elder lady this is not a fit conversation for the servants to overhear Let these wretches be removed Certainly my dear Said mister Nupkins Muzzle Your Worship Open the front door Yes your Worship Leave the house said mister Nupkins waving his hand emphatically Jingle smiled and moved towards the door Stay said mister Pickwick Jingle stopped I might said mister Pickwick have taken a much greater revenge for the treatment I have experienced at your hands and that of your hypocritical friend there Job Trotter bowed with great politeness and laid his hand upon his heart I say said mister Pickwick growing gradually angry that I might have taken a greater revenge but I content myself with exposing you which I consider a duty I owe to society This is a leniency Sir which I hope you will remember When mister Pickwick arrived at this point Job Trotter with facetious gravity applied his hand to his ear as if desirous not to lose a syllable he uttered And I have only to add sir said mister Pickwick now thoroughly angry that I consider you a rascal and a a ruffian and and worse than any man I ever saw or heard of except that pious and sanctified vagabond in the mulberry livery Ha ha said Jingle good fellow Pickwick fine heart stout old boy but must NOT be passionate bad thing very bye bye see you again some day keep up your spirits now Job trot With these words mister Jingle stuck on his hat in his old fashion and strode out of the room Job Trotter paused looked round smiled and then with a bow of mock solemnity to mister Pickwick and a wink to mister Weller the audacious slyness of which baffles all description followed the footsteps of his hopeful master Sam said mister Pickwick as mister Weller was following Sir Stay here mister Weller seemed uncertain Stay here repeated mister Pickwick Mayn t I polish that ere Job off in the front garden said mister Weller Certainly not replied mister Pickwick Mayn t I kick him out o the gate Sir said mister Weller Not on any account replied his master For the first time since his engagement mister Weller looked for a moment discontented and unhappy But his countenance immediately cleared up for the wily mister Muzzle by concealing himself behind the street door and rushing violently out at the right instant contrived with great dexterity to overturn both mister Jingle and his attendant down the flight of steps into the American aloe tubs that stood beneath Having discharged my duty Sir said mister Pickwick to mister Nupkins I will with my friends bid you farewell While we thank you for such hospitality as we have received permit me to assure you in our joint names that we should not have accepted it or have consented to extricate ourselves in this way from our previous dilemma had we not been impelled by a strong sense of duty We return to London to morrow Your secret is safe with us Having thus entered his protest against their treatment of the morning mister Pickwick bowed low to the ladies and notwithstanding the solicitations of the family left the room with his friends Get your hat Sam said mister Pickwick It s below stairs Sir said Sam and he ran down after it Now there was nobody in the kitchen but the pretty housemaid and as Sam s hat was mislaid he had to look for it and the pretty housemaid lighted him They had to look all over the place for the hat The pretty housemaid in her anxiety to find it went down on her knees and turned over all the things that were heaped together in a little corner by the door It was an awkward corner You couldn t get at it without shutting the door first Here it is said the pretty housemaid This is it ain t it Let me look said Sam The pretty housemaid had stood the candle on the floor and as it gave a very dim light Sam was obliged to go down on HIS knees before he could see whether it really was his own hat or not It was a remarkably small corner and so it was nobody s fault but the man s who built the house Sam and the pretty housemaid were necessarily very close together Yes this is it said Sam Good bye Good bye said the pretty housemaid Good bye said Sam and as he said it he dropped the hat that had cost so much trouble in looking for How awkward you are said the pretty housemaid You ll lose it again if you don t take care So just to prevent his losing it again she put it on for him Whether it was that the pretty housemaid s face looked prettier still when it was raised towards Sam s or whether it was the accidental consequence of their being so near to each other is matter of uncertainty to this day but Sam kissed her You don t mean to say you did that on purpose said the pretty housemaid blushing No I didn t then said Sam but I will now So he kissed her again Sam said mister Pickwick calling over the banisters Coming Sir replied Sam running upstairs How long you have been said mister Pickwick There was something behind the door Sir which perwented our getting it open for ever so long Sir replied Sam And this was the first passage of mister Weller s first love CHAPTER XXVI WHICH CONTAINS A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE PROGRESS OF THE ACTION OF BARDELL AGAINST PICKWICK Having accomplished the main end and object of his journey by the exposure of Jingle mister Pickwick resolved on immediately returning to London with the view of becoming acquainted with the proceedings which had been taken against him in the meantime by Messrs Dodson and Fogg Acting upon this resolution with all the energy and decision of his character he mounted to the back seat of the first coach which left Ipswich on the morning after the memorable occurrences detailed at length in the two preceding chapters and accompanied by his three friends and mister Samuel Weller arrived in the metropolis in perfect health and safety the same evening Here the friends for a short time separated Messrs Tupman Winkle and Snodgrass repaired to their several homes to make such preparations as might be requisite for their forthcoming visit to Dingley Dell and mister Pickwick and Sam took up their present abode in very good old fashioned and comfortable quarters to wit the George and Vulture Tavern and Hotel George Yard Lombard Street mister Pickwick had dined finished his second pint of particular port pulled his silk handkerchief over his head put his feet on the fender and thrown himself back in an easy chair when the entrance of mister Weller with his carpet bag aroused him from his tranquil meditation Sam said mister Pickwick Sir said mister Weller I have just been thinking Sam said mister Pickwick that having left a good many things at missus Bardell s in Goswell Street I ought to arrange for taking them away before I leave town again Wery good sir replied mister Weller I could send them to mister Tupman s for the present Sam continued mister Pickwick but before we take them away it is necessary that they should be looked up and put together I wish you would step up to Goswell Street Sam and arrange about it At once Sir inquired mister Weller At once replied mister Pickwick And stay Sam added mister Pickwick pulling out his purse there is some rent to pay The quarter is not due till Christmas but you may pay it and have done with it A month s notice terminates my tenancy Here it is written out Give it and tell missus Bardell she may put a bill up as soon as she likes Wery good sir replied mister Weller anythin more sir Nothing more Sam mister Weller stepped slowly to the door as if he expected something more slowly opened it slowly stepped out and had slowly closed it within a couple of inches when mister Pickwick called out Sam Yes sir said mister Weller stepping quickly back and closing the door behind him I have no objection Sam to your endeavouring to ascertain how missus Bardell herself seems disposed towards me and whether it is really probable that this vile and groundless action is to be carried to extremity I say I do not object to you doing this if you wish it Sam said mister Pickwick Sam gave a short nod of intelligence and left the room mister Pickwick drew the silk handkerchief once more over his head And composed himself for a nap mister Weller promptly walked forth to execute his commission It was nearly nine o clock when he reached Goswell Street A couple of candles were burning in the little front parlour and a couple of caps were reflected on the window blind missus Bardell had got company mister Weller knocked at the door and after a pretty long interval occupied by the party without in whistling a tune and by the party within in persuading a refractory flat candle to allow itself to be lighted a pair of small boots pattered over the floor cloth and Master Bardell presented himself Well young townskip said Sam how s mother She s pretty well replied Master Bardell so am I Well that s a mercy said Sam tell her I want to speak to her will you my hinfant fernomenon Master Bardell thus adjured placed the refractory flat candle on the bottom stair and vanished into the front parlour with his message The two caps reflected on the window blind were the respective head dresses of a couple of missus Bardell s most particular acquaintance who had just stepped in to have a quiet cup of tea and a little warm supper of a couple of sets of pettitoes and some toasted cheese The cheese was simmering and browning away most delightfully in a little Dutch oven before the fire the pettitoes were getting on deliciously in a little tin saucepan on the hob and missus Bardell and her two friends were getting on very well also in a little quiet conversation about and concerning all their particular friends and acquaintance when Master Bardell came back from answering the door and delivered the message intrusted to him by mister Samuel Weller mister Pickwick s servant said missus Bardell turning pale Bless my soul said missus Cluppins Well I raly would not ha believed it unless I had ha happened to ha been here said missus Sanders missus Cluppins was a little brisk busy looking woman missus Sanders was a big fat heavy faced personage and the two were the company missus Bardell felt it proper to be agitated and as none of the three exactly knew whether under existing circumstances any communication otherwise than through Dodson Fogg ought to be held with mister Pickwick s servant they were all rather taken by surprise In this state of indecision obviously the first thing to be done was to thump the boy for finding mister Weller at the door So his mother thumped him and he cried melodiously Hold your noise do you naughty creetur said missus Bardell Yes don t worrit your poor mother said missus Sanders She s quite enough to worrit her as it is without you Tommy said missus Cluppins with sympathising resignation Ah worse luck poor lamb said missus Sanders At all which moral reflections Master Bardell howled the louder Now what shall I do said missus Bardell to missus Cluppins I think you ought to see him replied missus Cluppins But on no account without a witness I think two witnesses would be more lawful said missus Sanders who like the other friend was bursting with curiosity Perhaps he d better come in here said missus Bardell To be sure replied missus Cluppins eagerly catching at the idea walk in young man and shut the street door first please mister Weller immediately took the hint and presenting himself in the parlour explained his business to missus Bardell thus Wery sorry to casion any personal inconwenience ma am as the housebreaker said to the old lady when he put her on the fire but as me and my governor s only jest come to town and is jest going away agin it can t be helped you see Of course the young man can t help the faults of his master said missus Cluppins much struck by mister Weller s appearance and conversation Certainly not chimed in missus Sanders who from certain wistful glances at the little tin saucepan seemed to be engaged in a mental calculation of the probable extent of the pettitoes in the event of Sam s being asked to stop to supper So all I ve come about is jest this here said Sam disregarding the interruption first to give my governor s notice there it is Secondly to pay the rent here it is Thirdly to say as all his things is to be put together and give to anybody as we sends for em Fourthly that you may let the place as soon as you like and that s all Whatever has happened said missus Bardell I always have said and always will say that in every respect but one mister Pickwick has always behaved himself like a perfect gentleman His money always as good as the bank always As missus Bardell said this she applied her handkerchief to her eyes and went out of the room to get the receipt Sam well knew that he had only to remain quiet and the women were sure to talk so he looked alternately at the tin saucepan the toasted cheese the wall and the ceiling in profound silence Poor dear said missus Cluppins Ah poor thing replied missus Sanders Sam said nothing He saw they were coming to the subject I raly cannot contain myself said missus Cluppins when I think of such perjury I don t wish to say anything to make you uncomfortable young man but your master s an old brute and I wish I had him here to 
1265_135636_000016_000002	train-clean-360	tell him so 
none	none	I wish you had said Sam To see how dreadful she takes on going moping about and taking no pleasure in nothing except when her friends comes in out of charity to sit with her and make her comfortable resumed missus Cluppins glancing at the tin saucepan and the Dutch oven it s shocking Barbareous said missus Sanders And your master young man A gentleman with money as could never feel the expense of a wife no more than nothing continued missus Cluppins with great volubility why there ain t the faintest shade of an excuse for his behaviour Why don t he marry her Ah said Sam to be sure that s the question Question indeed retorted missus Cluppins she d question him if she d my spirit Hows ever there is law for us women mis rable creeturs as they d make us if they could and that your master will find out young man to his cost afore he s six months older At this consolatory reflection missus Cluppins bridled up and smiled at missus Sanders who smiled back again The action s going on and no mistake thought Sam as missus Bardell re entered with the receipt Here s the receipt mister Weller said missus Bardell and here s the change and I hope you ll take a little drop of something to keep the cold out if it s only for old acquaintance sake mister Weller Sam saw the advantage he should gain and at once acquiesced whereupon missus Bardell produced from a small closet a black bottle and a wine glass and so great was her abstraction in her deep mental affliction that after filling mister Weller s glass she brought out three more wine glasses and filled them too Lauk missus Bardell said missus Cluppins see what you ve been and done Well that is a good one ejaculated missus Sanders Ah my poor head said missus Bardell with a faint smile Sam understood all this of course so he said at once that he never could drink before supper unless a lady drank with him A great deal of laughter ensued and missus Sanders volunteered to humour him so she took a slight sip out of her glass Then Sam said it must go all round so they all took a slight sip Then little missus Cluppins proposed as a toast Success to Bardell agin Pickwick and then the ladies emptied their glasses in honour of the sentiment and got very talkative directly I suppose you ve heard what s going forward mister Weller said missus Bardell I ve heerd somethin on it replied Sam It s a terrible thing to be dragged before the public in that way mister Weller said missus Bardell but I see now that it s the only thing I ought to do and my lawyers mister Dodson and Fogg tell me that with the evidence as we shall call we must succeed I don t know what I should do mister Weller if I didn t The mere idea of missus Bardell s failing in her action affected missus Sanders so deeply that she was under the necessity of refilling and re emptying her glass immediately feeling as she said afterwards that if she hadn t had the presence of mind to do so she must have dropped Ven is it expected to come on inquired Sam Either in February or March replied missus Bardell What a number of witnesses there ll be won t there said missus Cluppins Ah won t there replied missus Sanders And won t mister Dodson and Fogg be wild if the plaintiff shouldn t get it added missus Cluppins when they do it all on speculation Ah won t they said missus Sanders But the plaintiff must get it resumed missus Cluppins I hope so said missus Bardell Oh there can t be any doubt about it rejoined missus Sanders Vell said Sam rising and setting down his glass all I can say is that I vish you MAY get it Thank ee mister Weller said missus Bardell fervently And of them Dodson and Foggs as does these sort o things on spec continued mister Weller as vell as for the other kind and general rous people o the same purfession as sets people by the ears free gratis for nothin and sets their clerks to work to find out little disputes among their neighbours and acquaintances as vants settlin by means of lawsuits all I can say o them is that I vish they had the reward I d give em Ah I wish they had the reward that every kind and generous heart would be inclined to bestow upon them said the gratified missus Bardell Amen to that replied Sam and a fat and happy liven they d get out of it Wish you good night ladies To the great relief of missus Sanders Sam was allowed to depart without any reference on the part of the hostess to the pettitoes and toasted cheese to which the ladies with such juvenile assistance as Master Bardell could afford soon afterwards rendered the amplest justice indeed they wholly vanished before their strenuous exertions mister Weller wended his way back to the George and Vulture and faithfully recounted to his master such indications of the sharp practice of Dodson Fogg as he had contrived to pick up in his visit to missus Bardell s An interview with mister Perker next day more than confirmed mister Weller s statement and mister Pickwick was fain to prepare for his Christmas visit to Dingley Dell with the pleasant anticipation that some two or three months afterwards an action brought against him for damages sustained by reason of a breach of promise of marriage would be publicly tried in the Court of Common Pleas the plaintiff having all the advantages derivable not only from the force of circumstances but from the sharp practice of Dodson Fogg to boot CHAPTER XXVII SAMUEL WELLER MAKES A PILGRIMAGE TO DORKING AND BEHOLDS HIS MOTHER IN LAW There still remaining an interval of two days before the time agreed upon for the departure of the Pickwickians to Dingley Dell mister Weller sat himself down in a back room at the George and Vulture after eating an early dinner to muse on the best way of disposing of his time It was a remarkably fine day and he had not turned the matter over in his mind ten minutes when he was suddenly stricken filial and affectionate and it occurred to him so strongly that he ought to go down and see his father and pay his duty to his mother in law that he was lost in astonishment at his own remissness in never thinking of this moral obligation before Anxious to atone for his past neglect without another hour s delay he straightway walked upstairs to mister Pickwick and requested leave of absence for this laudable purpose Certainly Sam certainly said mister Pickwick his eyes glistening with delight at this manifestation of filial feeling on the part of his attendant certainly Sam mister Weller made a grateful bow I am very glad to see that you have so high a sense of your duties as a son Sam said mister Pickwick I always had sir replied mister Weller That s a very gratifying reflection Sam said mister Pickwick approvingly Wery Sir replied mister Weller if ever I wanted anythin o my father I always asked for it in a wery spectful and obligin manner If he didn t give it me I took it for fear I should be led to do anythin wrong through not havin it I saved him a world o trouble this vay Sir That s not precisely what I meant Sam said mister Pickwick shaking his head with a slight smile All good feelin sir the wery best intentions as the general l m n said ven he run away from his wife cos she seemed unhappy with him replied mister Weller You may go Sam said mister Pickwick Thank ee Sir replied mister Weller and having made his best bow and put on his best clothes Sam planted himself on the top of the Arundel coach and journeyed on to Dorking The Marquis of Granby in missus Weller s time was quite a model of a roadside public house of the better class just large enough to be convenient and small enough to be snug On the opposite side of the road was a large sign board on a high post representing the head and shoulders of a gentleman with an apoplectic countenance in a red coat with deep blue facings and a touch of the same blue over his three cornered hat for a sky Over that again were a pair of flags beneath the last button of his coat were a couple of cannon and the whole formed an expressive and undoubted likeness of the Marquis of Granby of glorious memory The bar window displayed a choice collection of geranium plants and a well dusted row of spirit phials The open shutters bore a variety of golden inscriptions eulogistic of good beds and neat wines and the choice group of countrymen and hostlers lounging about the stable door and horse trough afforded presumptive proof of the excellent quality of the ale and spirits which were sold within Sam Weller paused when he dismounted from the coach to note all these little indications of a thriving business with the eye of an experienced traveller and having done so stepped in at once highly satisfied with everything he had observed Now then said a shrill female voice the instant Sam thrust his head in at the door what do you want young man Sam looked round in the direction whence the voice proceeded It came from a rather stout lady of comfortable appearance who was seated beside the fireplace in the bar blowing the fire to make the kettle boil for tea She was not alone for on the other side of the fireplace sitting bolt upright in a high backed chair was a man in threadbare black clothes with a back almost as long and stiff as that of the chair itself who caught Sam s most particular and especial attention at once He was a prim faced red nosed man with a long thin countenance and a semi rattlesnake sort of eye rather sharp but decidedly bad He wore very short trousers and black cotton stockings which like the rest of his apparel were particularly rusty His looks were starched but his white neckerchief was not and its long limp ends straggled over his closely buttoned waistcoat in a very uncouth and unpicturesque fashion A pair of old worn beaver gloves a broad brimmed hat and a faded green umbrella with plenty of whalebone sticking through the bottom as if to counterbalance the want of a handle at the top lay on a chair beside him and being disposed in a very tidy and careful manner seemed to imply that the red nosed man whoever he was had no intention of going away in a hurry To do the red nosed man justice he would have been very far from wise if he had entertained any such intention for to judge from all appearances he must have been possessed of a most desirable circle of acquaintance if he could have reasonably expected to be more comfortable anywhere else The fire was blazing brightly under the influence of the bellows and the kettle was singing gaily under the influence of both A small tray of tea things was arranged on the table a plate of hot buttered toast was gently simmering before the fire and the red nosed man himself was busily engaged in converting a large slice of bread into the same agreeable edible through the instrumentality of a long brass toasting fork Beside him stood a glass of reeking hot pine apple rum and water with a slice of lemon in it and every time the red nosed man stopped to bring the round of toast to his eye with the view of ascertaining how it got on he imbibed a drop or two of the hot pine apple rum and water and smiled upon the rather stout lady as she blew the fire Sam was so lost in the contemplation of this comfortable scene that he suffered the first inquiry of the rather stout lady to pass unheeded It was not until it had been twice repeated each time in a shriller tone that he became conscious of the impropriety of his behaviour Governor in inquired Sam in reply to the question No he isn t replied missus Weller for the rather stout lady was no other than the quondam relict and sole executrix of the dead and gone mister Clarke no he isn t and I don t expect him either I suppose he s drivin up to day said Sam He may be or he may not replied missus Weller buttering the round of toast which the red nosed man had just finished I don t know and what s more I don t care Ask a blessin mister Stiggins The red nosed man did as he was desired and instantly commenced on the toast with fierce voracity The appearance of the red nosed man had induced Sam at first sight to more than half suspect that he was the deputy shepherd of whom his estimable parent had spoken The moment he saw him eat all doubt on the subject was removed and he perceived at once that if he purposed to take up his temporary quarters where he was he must make his footing good without delay He therefore commenced proceedings by putting his arm over the half door of the bar coolly unbolting it and leisurely walking in Mother in law said Sam how are you Why I do believe he is a Weller said missus W raising her eyes to Sam s face with no very gratified expression of countenance I rayther think he is said the imperturbable Sam and I hope this here reverend general l m n ll excuse me saying that I wish I was THE Weller as owns you mother in law This was a double barrelled compliment It implied that missus Weller was a most agreeable female and also that mister Stiggins had a clerical appearance It made a visible impression at once and Sam followed up his advantage by kissing his mother in law Get along with you said missus Weller pushing him away For shame young man said the gentleman with the red nose No offence sir no offence replied Sam you re wery right though it ain t the right sort o thing ven mothers in law is young and good looking is it Sir It s all vanity said mister Stiggins Ah so it is said missus Weller setting her cap to rights Sam thought it was too but he held his peace The deputy shepherd seemed by no means best pleased with Sam s arrival and when the first effervescence of the compliment had subsided even missus Weller looked as if she could have spared him without the smallest inconvenience However there he was and as he couldn t be decently turned out they all three sat down to tea And how s father said Sam At this inquiry missus Weller raised her hands and turned up her eyes as if the subject were too painful to be alluded to mister Stiggins groaned What s the matter with that ere general l m n inquired Sam He s shocked at the way your father goes on in replied missus Weller Oh he is is he said Sam And with too good reason added missus Weller gravely mister Stiggins took up a fresh piece of toast and groaned heavily He is a dreadful reprobate said missus Weller A man of wrath exclaimed mister Stiggins He took a large semi circular bite out of the toast and groaned again Sam felt very strongly disposed to give the reverend mister Stiggins something to groan for but he repressed his inclination and merely asked What s the old un up to now Up to indeed said missus Weller Oh he has a hard heart Night after night does this excellent man don t frown mister Stiggins I WILL say you ARE an excellent man come and sit here for hours together and it has not the least effect upon him Well that is odd said Sam it ud have a wery considerable effect upon me if I wos in his place I know that The fact is my young friend said mister Stiggins solemnly he has an obderrate bosom Oh my young friend who else could have resisted the pleading of sixteen of our fairest sisters and withstood their exhortations to subscribe to our noble society for providing the infant negroes in the West Indies with flannel waistcoats and moral pocket handkerchiefs What s a moral pocket ankercher said Sam I never see one o them articles o furniter Those which combine amusement With instruction my young friend replied mister Stiggins blending select tales with wood cuts Oh I know said Sam them as hangs up in the linen drapers shops with beggars petitions and all that ere upon em mister Stiggins began a third round of toast and nodded assent And he wouldn t be persuaded by the ladies wouldn t he said Sam Sat and smoked his pipe and said the infant negroes were what did he say the infant negroes were said missus Weller Little humbugs replied mister Stiggins deeply affected Said the infant negroes were little humbugs repeated missus Weller And they both groaned at the atrocious conduct of the elder mister Weller A great many more iniquities of a similar nature might have been disclosed only the toast being all eaten the tea having got very weak and Sam holding out no indications of meaning to go mister Stiggins suddenly recollected that he had a most pressing appointment with the shepherd and took himself off accordingly The tea things had been scarcely put away and the hearth swept up when the London coach deposited mister Weller senior at the door his legs deposited him in the bar and his eyes showed him his son What Sammy exclaimed the father What old Nobs ejaculated the son And they shook hands heartily Wery glad to see you Sammy said the elder mister Weller though how you ve managed to get over your mother in law is a mystery to me I only vish you d write me out the receipt that s all Hush said Sam she s at home old feller She ain t vithin hearin replied mister Weller she always goes and blows up downstairs for a couple of hours arter tea so we ll just give ourselves a damp Sammy Saying this mister Weller mixed two glasses of spirits and water and produced a couple of pipes The father and son sitting down opposite each other Sam on one side of the fire in the high backed chair and mister Weller senior on the other in an easy ditto they proceeded to enjoy themselves with all due gravity Anybody been here Sammy asked mister Weller senior dryly after a long silence Sam nodded an expressive assent Red nosed chap inquired mister Weller Sam nodded again Amiable man that ere Sammy said mister Weller smoking violently Seems so observed Sam Good hand at accounts said mister Weller Is he said Sam Borrows eighteenpence on Monday and comes on Tuesday for a shillin to make it up half a crown calls again on Vensday for another half crown to make it five shillin s and goes on doubling till he gets it up to a five pund note in no time like them sums in the rithmetic book bout the nails in the horse s shoes Sammy Sam intimated by a nod that he recollected the problem alluded to by his parent So you vouldn t subscribe to the flannel veskits said Sam after another interval of smoking Cert nly not replied mister Weller what s the good o flannel veskits to the young niggers abroad But I ll tell you what it is Sammy said mister Weller lowering his voice and bending across the fireplace I d come down wery handsome towards strait veskits for some people at home As mister Weller said this he slowly recovered his former position and winked at his first born in a profound manner It cert nly seems a queer start to send out pocket ankerchers to people as don t know the use on em observed Sam They re alvays a doin some gammon of that sort Sammy replied his father T other Sunday I wos walkin up the road wen who should I see a standin at a chapel door with a blue soup plate in her hand but your mother in law I werily believe there was change for a couple o suv rins in it then Sammy all in ha pence and as the people come out they rattled the pennies in it till you d ha thought that no mortal plate as ever was baked could ha stood the wear and tear What d ye think it was all for For another tea drinkin perhaps said Sam Not a bit on it replied the father for the shepherd s water rate Sammy The shepherd s water rate said Sam Ay replied mister Weller there was three quarters owin and the shepherd hadn t paid a farden not he perhaps it might be on account that the water warn t o much use to him for it s wery little o that tap he drinks Sammy wery he knows a trick worth a good half dozen of that he does Hows ever it warn t paid and so they cuts the water off Down goes the shepherd to chapel gives out as he s a persecuted saint and says he hopes the heart of the turncock as cut the water off ll be softened and turned in the right vay but he rayther thinks he s booked for somethin uncomfortable Upon this the women calls a meetin sings a hymn wotes your mother in law into the chair wolunteers a collection next Sunday and hands it all over to the shepherd And if he ain t got enough out on em Sammy to make him free of the water company for life said mister Weller in conclusion I m one Dutchman and you re another and that s all about it mister Weller smoked for some minutes in silence and then resumed The worst o these here shepherds is my boy that they reg larly turns the heads of all the young ladies about here Lord bless their little hearts they thinks it s all right and don t know no better but they re the wictims o gammon Samivel they re the wictims o gammon I s pose they are said Sam Nothin else said mister Weller shaking his head gravely and wot aggrawates me Samivel is to see em a wastin all their time and labour in making clothes for copper coloured people as don t want em and taking no notice of flesh coloured Christians as do If I d my vay Samivel I d just stick some o these here lazy shepherds behind a heavy wheelbarrow and run em up and down a fourteen inch wide plank all day That ud shake the nonsense out of em if anythin vould mister Weller having delivered this gentle recipe with strong emphasis eked out by a variety of nods and contortions of the eye emptied his glass at a draught and knocked the ashes out of his pipe with native dignity He was engaged in this operation when a shrill voice was heard in the passage Here s your dear relation Sammy said mister Weller and missus W hurried into the room Oh you ve come back have you said missus Weller Yes my dear replied mister Weller filling a fresh pipe Has mister Stiggins been back said missus Weller No my dear he hasn t replied mister Weller lighting the pipe by the ingenious process of holding to the bowl thereof between the tongs a red hot coal from the adjacent fire and what s more my dear I shall manage to surwive it if he don t come back at all Ugh you wretch said missus Weller Thank ee my love said mister Weller Come come father said Sam none o these little lovin s afore strangers Here s the reverend general l m n a comin in now At this announcement missus Weller hastily wiped off the tears which she had just begun to force on and mister W drew his chair sullenly into the chimney corner mister Stiggins was easily prevailed on to take another glass of the hot pine apple rum and water and a second and a third and then to refresh himself with a slight supper previous to beginning again He sat on the same side as mister Weller senior and every time he could contrive to do so unseen by his wife that gentleman indicated to his son the hidden emotions of his bosom by shaking his fist over the deputy shepherd s head a process which afforded his son the most unmingled delight and satisfaction the more especially as mister Stiggins went on quietly drinking the hot pine apple rum and water wholly unconscious of what was going forward The major part of the conversation was confined to missus Weller and the reverend mister Stiggins and the topics principally descanted on were the virtues of the shepherd the worthiness of his flock and the high crimes and misdemeanours of everybody beside dissertations which the elder mister Weller occasionally interrupted by half suppressed references to a gentleman of the name of Walker and other running commentaries of the same kind At length mister Stiggins with several most indubitable symptoms of having quite as much pine apple rum and water about him as he could comfortably accommodate took his hat and his leave and Sam was immediately afterwards shown to bed by his father The respectable old gentleman wrung his hand fervently and seemed disposed to address some observation to his son but on missus Weller advancing towards him he appeared to relinquish that intention and abruptly bade him good night Sam was up betimes next day and having partaken of a hasty breakfast prepared to return to London He had scarcely set foot without the house when his father stood before him Goin Sammy inquired mister Weller Off at once replied Sam I vish you could muffle that ere Stiggins and take him vith you said mister Weller I am ashamed on you said Sam reproachfully what do you let him show his red nose in the Markis o Granby at all for mister Weller the elder fixed on his son an earnest look and replied Cause I m a married man Samivel cause I m a married man Ven you re a married man Samivel you ll understand a good many things as you don t understand now but vether it s worth while goin through so much to learn so little as the charity boy said ven he got to the end of the alphabet is a matter o taste I rayther think it isn t Well said Sam good bye Tar tar Sammy replied his father I ve only got to say this here said Sam stopping short that if I was the properiator o the Markis o Granby and that ere Stiggins came and made toast in my bar I d What interposed mister Weller with great anxiety What Pison his rum and water said Sam No said mister Weller shaking his son eagerly by the hand would you raly Sammy would you though I would said Sam I wouldn t be too hard upon him at first I d drop him in the water butt and put the lid on and if I found he was insensible to kindness I d try the other persvasion The elder mister Weller bestowed a look of deep unspeakable admiration on his son and having once more grasped his hand walked slowly away revolving in his mind the numerous reflections to which his advice had given rise Sam looked after him until he turned a corner of the road and then set forward on his walk to London He meditated at first on the probable consequences of his own advice and the likelihood of his father s adopting it He dismissed the subject from his mind however with the consolatory reflection that time alone would show and this is the reflection we would impress upon the reader CHAPTER XXVIII A GOOD HUMOURED CHRISTMAS CHAPTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF A WEDDING AND SOME OTHER SPORTS BESIDE WHICH ALTHOUGH IN THEIR WAY EVEN AS GOOD CUSTOMS AS MARRIAGE ITSELF ARE NOT QUITE SO RELIGIOUSLY KEPT UP IN THESE DEGENERATE TIMES As brisk as bees if not altogether as light as fairies did the four Pickwickians assemble on the morning of the twenty second day of December in the year of grace in which these their faithfully recorded adventures were undertaken and accomplished Christmas was close at hand in all his bluff and hearty honesty it was the season of hospitality merriment and open heartedness the old year was preparing like an ancient philosopher to call his friends around him and amidst the sound of feasting and revelry to pass gently and calmly away Gay and merry was the time and right gay and merry were at least four of the numerous hearts that were gladdened by its coming And numerous indeed are the hearts to which Christmas brings a brief season of happiness and enjoyment How many families whose members have been dispersed and scattered far and wide in the restless struggles of life are then reunited and meet once again in that happy state of companionship and mutual goodwill which is a source of such pure and unalloyed delight and one so incompatible with the cares and sorrows of the world that the religious belief of the most civilised nations and the rude traditions of the roughest savages alike number it among the first joys of a future condition of existence provided for the blessed and happy How many old recollections and how many dormant sympathies does Christmas time awaken We write these words now many miles distant from the spot at which year after year we met on that day a merry and joyous circle Many of the hearts that throbbed so gaily then have ceased to beat many of the looks that shone so brightly then have ceased to glow the hands we grasped have grown cold the eyes we sought have hid their lustre in the grave and yet the old house the room the merry voices and smiling faces the jest the laugh the most minute and trivial circumstances connected with those happy meetings crowd upon our mind at each recurrence of the season as if the last assemblage had been but yesterday Happy happy Christmas that can win us back to the delusions of our childish days that can recall to the old man the pleasures of his youth that can transport the sailor and the traveller thousands of miles away back to his own fireside and his quiet home But we are so taken up and occupied with the good qualities of this saint Christmas that we are keeping mister Pickwick and his friends waiting in the cold on the outside of the Muggleton coach which they have just attained well wrapped up in great coats shawls and comforters The portmanteaus and carpet bags have been stowed away and mister Weller and the guard are endeavouring to insinuate into the fore boot a huge cod fish several sizes too large for it which is snugly packed up in a long brown basket with a layer of straw over the top and which has been left to the last in order that he may repose in safety on the half dozen barrels of real native oysters all the property of mister Pickwick which have been arranged in regular order at the bottom of the receptacle The interest displayed in mister Pickwick s countenance is most intense as mister Weller and the guard try to squeeze the cod fish into the boot first head first and then tail first and then top upward and then bottom upward and then side ways and then long ways all of which artifices the implacable cod fish sturdily resists until the guard accidentally hits him in the very middle of the basket whereupon he suddenly disappears into the boot and with him the head and shoulders of the guard himself who not calculating upon so sudden a cessation of the passive resistance of the cod fish experiences a very unexpected shock to the unsmotherable delight of all the porters and bystanders Upon this mister Pickwick smiles with great good humour and drawing a shilling from his waistcoat pocket begs the guard as he picks himself out of the boot to drink his health in a glass of hot brandy and water at which the guard smiles too and Messrs Snodgrass Winkle and Tupman all smile in company The guard and mister Weller disappear for five minutes most probably to get the hot brandy and water for they smell very strongly of it when they return the coachman mounts to the box mister Weller jumps up behind the Pickwickians pull their coats round their legs and their shawls over their noses the helpers pull the horse cloths off the coachman shouts out a cheery All right and away they go They have rumbled through the streets and jolted over the stones and at length reach the wide and open country The wheels skim over the hard and frosty ground and the horses bursting into a canter at a smart crack of the whip step along the road as if the load behind them coach passengers cod fish oyster barrels and all were but a feather at their heels They have descended a gentle slope and enter upon a level as compact and dry as a solid block of marble two miles long Another crack of the whip and on they speed at a smart gallop the horses tossing their heads and rattling the harness as if in exhilaration at the rapidity of the motion while the coachman holding whip and reins in one hand takes off his hat with the other and resting it on his knees pulls out his handkerchief and wipes his forehead partly because he has a habit of doing it and partly because it s as well to show the passengers how cool he is and what an easy thing it is to drive four in hand when you have had as much practice as he has Having done this very leisurely otherwise the effect would be materially impaired he replaces his handkerchief pulls on his hat adjusts his gloves squares his elbows cracks the whip again and on they speed more merrily than before A few small houses scattered on either side of the road betoken the entrance to some town or village The lively notes of the guard s key bugle vibrate in the clear cold air and wake up the old gentleman inside who carefully letting down the window sash half way and standing sentry over the air takes a short peep out and then carefully pulling it up again informs the other inside that they re going to change directly on which the other inside wakes himself up and determines to postpone his next nap until after the stoppage Again the bugle sounds lustily forth and rouses the cottager s wife and children who peep out at the house door and watch the coach till it turns the corner when they once more crouch round the blazing fire and throw on another log of wood against father comes home while father himself a full mile off has just exchanged a friendly nod with the coachman and turned round to take a good long stare at the vehicle as it whirls away And now the bugle plays a lively air as the coach rattles through the ill paved streets of a country town and the coachman undoing the buckle which keeps his ribands together prepares to throw them off the moment he stops mister Pickwick emerges from his coat collar and looks about him with great curiosity perceiving which the coachman informs mister Pickwick of the name of the town and tells him it was market day yesterday both of which pieces of information mister Pickwick retails to his fellow passengers whereupon they emerge from their coat collars too and look about them also mister Winkle who sits at the extreme edge with one leg dangling in the air is nearly precipitated into the street as the coach twists round the sharp corner by the cheesemonger s shop and turns into the market place and before mister Snodgrass who sits next to him has recovered from his alarm they pull up at the inn yard where the fresh horses with cloths on are already waiting The coachman throws down the reins and gets down himself and the other outside passengers drop down also except those who have no great confidence in their ability to get up again and they remain where they are and stamp their feet against the coach to warm them looking with longing eyes and red noses at the bright fire in the inn bar and the sprigs of holly with red berries which ornament the window But the guard has delivered at the corn dealer s shop the brown paper packet he took out of the little pouch which hangs over his shoulder by a leathern strap and has seen the horses carefully put to and has thrown on the pavement the saddle which was brought from London on the coach roof and has assisted in the conference between the coachman and the hostler about the gray mare that hurt her off fore leg last Tuesday and he and mister Weller are all right behind and the coachman is all right in front and the old gentleman inside who has kept the window down full two inches all this time has pulled it up again and the cloths are off and they are all ready for starting except the two stout gentlemen whom the coachman inquires after with some impatience Hereupon the coachman and the guard and Sam Weller and mister Winkle and mister Snodgrass and all the hostlers and every one of the idlers who are more in number than all the others put together shout for the missing gentlemen as loud as they can bawl A distant response is heard from the yard and mister Pickwick and mister Tupman come running down it quite out of breath for they have been having a glass of ale a piece and mister Pickwick s fingers are so cold that he has been full five minutes before he could find the sixpence to pay for it The coachman shouts an admonitory Now then general l m n the guard re echoes it the old gentleman inside thinks it a very extraordinary thing that people WILL get down when they know there isn t time for it mister Pickwick struggles up on one side mister Tupman on the other mister Winkle cries All right and off they start Shawls are pulled up coat collars are readjusted the pavement ceases the houses disappear and they are once again dashing along the open road with the fresh clear air blowing in their faces and gladdening their very hearts within them Such was the progress of mister Pickwick and his friends by the Muggleton Telegraph on their way to Dingley Dell and at three o clock that afternoon they all stood high and dry safe and sound hale and hearty upon the steps of the Blue Lion having taken on the road quite enough of ale and brandy to enable them to bid defiance to the frost that was binding up the earth in its iron fetters and weaving its beautiful network upon the trees and hedges mister Pickwick was busily engaged in counting the barrels of oysters and superintending the disinterment of the cod fish when he felt himself gently pulled by the skirts of the coat Looking round he discovered that the individual who resorted to this mode of catching his attention was no other than mister Wardle s favourite page better known to the readers of this unvarnished history by the distinguishing appellation of the fat boy Aha said mister Pickwick Aha said the fat boy As he said it he glanced from the cod fish to the oyster barrels and chuckled joyously He was fatter than ever Well you look rosy enough my young friend said mister Pickwick I ve been asleep right in front of the taproom fire replied the fat boy who had heated himself to the colour of a new chimney pot in the course of an hour s nap Master sent me over with the shay cart to carry your luggage up to the house He d ha sent some saddle horses but he thought you d rather walk being a cold day Yes yes said mister Pickwick hastily for he remembered how they had travelled over nearly the same ground on a previous occasion Yes we would rather walk Here Sam Sir said mister Weller Help mister Wardle s servant to put the packages into the cart and then ride on with him We will walk forward at once Having given this direction and settled with the coachman mister Pickwick and his three friends struck into the footpath across the fields and walked briskly away leaving mister Weller and the fat boy confronted together for the first time Sam looked at the fat boy with great astonishment but without saying a word and began to stow the luggage rapidly away in the cart while the fat boy stood quietly by and seemed to think it a very interesting sort of thing to see mister Weller working by himself There said Sam throwing in the last carpet bag there they are Yes said the fat boy in a very satisfied tone there they are Vell young twenty stun said Sam you re a nice specimen of a prize boy you are Thank ee said the fat boy You ain t got nothin on your mind as makes you fret yourself have you inquired Sam Not as I knows on replied the fat boy I should rayther ha thought to look at you that you was a labourin under an unrequited attachment to some young ooman said Sam The fat boy shook his head Vell said Sam I am glad to hear it Do you ever drink anythin I likes eating better replied the boy Ah said Sam I should ha s posed that but what I mean is should you like a drop of anythin as d warm you but I s pose you never was cold with all them elastic fixtures was you Sometimes replied the boy and I likes a drop of something when it s good Oh you do do you said Sam come this way then The Blue Lion tap was soon gained and the fat boy swallowed a glass of liquor without so much as winking a feat which considerably advanced him in mister Weller s good opinion mister Weller having transacted a similar piece of business on his own account they got into the cart Can you drive said the fat boy I should rayther think so replied Sam There then said the fat boy putting the reins in his hand and pointing up a lane it s as straight as you can go you can t miss it With these words the fat boy laid himself affectionately down by the side of the cod fish and placing an oyster barrel under his head for a pillow fell asleep instantaneously Well said Sam of all the cool boys ever I set my eyes on this here young general l m n is the coolest Come wake up young dropsy But as young dropsy evinced no symptoms of returning animation Sam Weller sat himself down in front of the cart and starting the old horse with a jerk of the rein jogged steadily on towards the Manor Farm Meanwhile mister Pickwick and his friends having walked their blood into active circulation proceeded cheerfully on The paths were hard the grass was crisp and frosty the air had a fine dry bracing coldness and the rapid approach of the gray twilight slate coloured is a better term in frosty weather made them look forward with pleasant anticipation to the comforts which awaited them at their hospitable entertainer s It was the sort of afternoon that might induce a couple of elderly gentlemen in a lonely field to take off their greatcoats and play at leap frog in pure lightness of heart and gaiety and we firmly believe that had mister Tupman at that moment proffered a back mister Pickwick would have accepted his offer with the utmost avidity However mister Tupman did not volunteer any such accommodation and the friends walked on conversing merrily As they turned into a lane they had to cross the sound of many voices burst upon their ears and before they had even had time to form a guess to whom they belonged they walked into the very centre of the party who were expecting their arrival a fact which was first notified to the Pickwickians by the loud Hurrah which burst from old Wardle s lips when they appeared in sight First there was Wardle himself looking if that were possible more jolly than ever then there were Bella and her faithful Trundle and lastly there were Emily and some eight or ten young ladies who had all come down to the wedding which was to take place next day and who were in as happy and important a state as young ladies usually are on such momentous occasions and they were one and all startling the fields and lanes far and wide with their frolic and laughter The ceremony of introduction under such circumstances was very soon performed or we should rather say that the introduction was soon over without any ceremony at all In two minutes thereafter mister Pickwick was joking with the young ladies who wouldn t come over the stile while he looked or who having pretty feet and unexceptionable ankles preferred standing on the top rail for five minutes or so declaring that they were too frightened to move with as much ease and absence of reserve or constraint as if he had known them for life It is worthy of remark too that mister Snodgrass offered Emily far more assistance than the absolute terrors of the stile although it was full three feet high and had only a couple of stepping stones would seem to require while one black eyed young lady in a very nice little pair of boots with fur round the top was observed to scream very loudly when mister Winkle offered to help her over All this was very snug and pleasant And when the difficulties of the stile were at last surmounted and they once more entered on the open field old Wardle informed mister Pickwick how they had all been down in a body to inspect the furniture and fittings up of the house which the young couple were to tenant after the Christmas holidays at which communication Bella and Trundle both coloured up as red as the fat boy after the taproom fire and the young lady with the black eyes and the fur round the boots whispered something in Emily s ear and then glanced archly at mister Snodgrass to which Emily responded that she was a foolish girl but turned very red notwithstanding and mister Snodgrass who was as modest as all great geniuses usually are felt the crimson rising to the crown of his head and devoutly wished in the inmost recesses of his own heart that the young lady aforesaid with her black eyes and her archness and her boots with the fur round the top were all comfortably deposited in the adjacent county But if they were social and happy outside the house what was the warmth and cordiality of their reception when they reached the farm The very servants grinned with pleasure at sight of mister Pickwick and Emma bestowed a half demure half impudent and all pretty look of recognition on mister Tupman which was enough to make the statue of Bonaparte in the passage unfold his arms and clasp her within them The old lady was seated with customary state in the front parlour but she was rather cross and by consequence most particularly deaf She never went out herself and like a great many other old ladies of the same stamp she was apt to consider it an act of domestic treason if anybody else took the liberty of doing what she couldn t So bless her old soul she sat as upright as she could in her great chair and looked as fierce as might be and that was benevolent after all Mother said Wardle mister Pickwick You recollect him Never mind replied the old lady with great dignity Don t trouble mister Pickwick about an old creetur like me Nobody cares about me now and it s very nat ral they shouldn t Here the old lady tossed her head and smoothed down her lavender coloured silk dress with trembling hands Come come ma am said mister Pickwick I can t let you cut an old friend in this way I have come down expressly to have a long talk and another rubber with you and we ll show these boys and girls how to dance a minuet before they re eight and forty hours older The old lady was rapidly giving way but she did not like to do it all at once so she only said Ah I can t hear him Nonsense mother said Wardle Come come don t be cross there s a good soul Recollect Bella come you must keep her spirits up poor girl The good old lady heard this for her lip quivered as her son said it But age has its little infirmities of temper and she was not quite brought round yet So she smoothed down the lavender coloured dress again and turning to mister Pickwick said Ah mister Pickwick young people was very different when I was a girl No doubt of that ma am said mister Pickwick and that s the reason why I would make much of the few that have any traces of the old stock and saying this mister Pickwick gently pulled Bella towards him and bestowing a kiss upon her forehead bade her sit down on the little stool at her grandmother s feet Whether the expression of her countenance as it was raised towards the old lady s face called up a thought of old times or whether the old lady was touched by mister Pickwick s affectionate good nature or whatever was the cause she was fairly melted so she threw herself on her granddaughter s neck and all the little ill humour evaporated in a gush of silent tears A happy party they were that night Sedate and solemn were the score of rubbers in which mister Pickwick and the old lady played together uproarious was the mirth of the round table Long after the ladies had retired did the hot elder wine well qualified with brandy and spice go round and round and round again and sound was the sleep and pleasant were the dreams that followed It is a remarkable fact that those of mister Snodgrass bore constant reference to Emily Wardle and that the principal figure in mister Winkle s visions was a young lady with black eyes and arch smile and a pair of remarkably nice boots with fur round the tops mister Pickwick was awakened early in the morning by a hum of voices and a pattering of feet sufficient to rouse even the fat boy from his heavy slumbers He sat up in bed and listened The female servants and female visitors were running constantly to and fro and there were such multitudinous demands for hot water such repeated outcries for needles and thread and so many half suppressed entreaties of Oh do come and tie me there s a dear that mister Pickwick in his innocence began to imagine that something dreadful must have occurred when he grew more awake and remembered the wedding The occasion being an important one he dressed himself with peculiar care and descended to the breakfast room There were all the female servants in a bran new uniform of pink muslin gowns with white bows in their caps running about the house in a state of excitement and agitation which it would be impossible to describe The old lady was dressed out in a brocaded gown which had not seen the light for twenty years saving and excepting such truant rays as had stolen through the chinks in the box in which it had been laid by during the whole time mister Trundle was in high feather and spirits but a little nervous withal The hearty old landlord was trying to look very cheerful and unconcerned but failing signally in the attempt All the girls were in tears and white muslin except a select two or three who were being honoured with a private view of the bride and bridesmaids upstairs All the Pickwickians were in most blooming array and there was a terrific roaring on the grass in front of the house occasioned by all the men boys and hobbledehoys attached to the farm each of whom had got a white bow in his button hole and all of whom were cheering with might and main being incited thereto and stimulated therein by the precept and example of mister Samuel Weller who had managed to become mighty popular already and was as much at home as if he had been born on the land A wedding is a licensed subject to joke upon but there really is no great joke in the matter after all we speak merely of the ceremony and beg it to be distinctly understood that we indulge in no hidden sarcasm upon a married life Mixed up with the pleasure and joy of the occasion are the many regrets at quitting home the tears of parting between parent and child the consciousness of leaving the dearest and kindest friends of the happiest portion of human life to encounter its cares and troubles with others still untried and little known natural feelings which we would not render this chapter mournful by describing and which we should be still more unwilling to be supposed to ridicule Let us briefly say then that the ceremony was performed by the old clergyman in the parish church of Dingley Dell and that mister Pickwick s name is attached to the register still preserved in the vestry thereof that the young lady with the black eyes signed her name in a very unsteady and tremulous manner that Emily s signature as the other bridesmaid is nearly illegible that it all went off in very admirable style that the young ladies generally thought it far less shocking than they had expected and that although the owner of the black eyes and the arch smile informed mister Wardle that she was sure she could never submit to anything so dreadful we have the very best reasons for thinking she was mistaken To all this we may add that mister Pickwick was the first who saluted the bride and that in so doing he threw over her neck a rich gold watch and chain which no mortal eyes but the jeweller s had ever beheld before Then the old church bell rang as gaily as it could and they all returned to breakfast Vere does the mince pies go young opium eater said mister Weller to the fat boy as he assisted in laying out such articles of consumption as had not been duly arranged on the previous night The fat boy pointed to the destination of the pies Wery good said Sam stick a bit o Christmas in em T other dish opposite There now we look compact and comfortable as the father said ven he cut his little boy s head off to cure him o squintin As mister Weller made the comparison he fell back a step or two to give full effect to it and surveyed the preparations with the utmost satisfaction Wardle said mister Pickwick almost as soon as they were all seated a glass of wine in honour of this happy occasion I shall be delighted my boy said Wardle Joe damn that boy he s gone to sleep No I ain t sir replied the fat boy starting up from a remote corner where like the patron saint of fat boys the immortal Horner he had been devouring a Christmas pie though not with the coolness and deliberation which characterised that young gentleman s proceedings Fill mister Pickwick s glass Yes sir The fat boy filled mister Pickwick s glass and then retired behind his master s chair from whence he watched the play of the knives and forks and the progress of the choice morsels from the dishes to the mouths of the company with a kind of dark and gloomy joy that was most impressive God bless you old fellow said mister Pickwick Same to you my boy replied Wardle and they pledged each other heartily missus Wardle said mister Pickwick we old folks must have a glass of wine together in honour of this joyful event The old lady was in a state of great grandeur just then for she was sitting at the top of the table in the brocaded gown with her newly married granddaughter on one side and mister Pickwick on the other to do the carving mister Pickwick had not spoken in a very loud tone but she understood him at once and drank off a full glass of wine to his long life and happiness after which the worthy old soul launched forth into a minute and particular account of her own wedding with a dissertation on the fashion of wearing high heeled shoes and some particulars concerning the life and adventures of the beautiful Lady Tollimglower deceased at all of which the old lady herself laughed very heartily indeed and so did the young ladies too for they were wondering among themselves what on earth grandma was talking about When they laughed the old lady laughed ten times more heartily and said that these always had been considered capital stories which caused them all to laugh again and put the old lady into the very best of humours Then the cake was cut and passed through the ring the young ladies saved pieces to put under their pillows to dream of their future husbands on and a great deal of blushing and merriment was thereby occasioned mister Miller said mister Pickwick to his old acquaintance the hard headed gentleman a glass of wine With great satisfaction mister Pickwick replied the hard headed gentleman solemnly You ll take me in said the benevolent old clergyman And me interposed his wife And me and me said a couple of poor relations at the bottom of the table who had eaten and drunk very heartily and laughed at everything mister Pickwick expressed his heartfelt delight at every additional suggestion and his eyes beamed with hilarity and cheerfulness Ladies and gentlemen said mister Pickwick suddenly rising Hear hear Hear hear Hear hear cried mister Weller in the excitement of his feelings Call in all the servants cried old Wardle interposing to prevent the public rebuke which mister Weller would otherwise most indubitably have received from his master Give them a glass of wine each to drink the toast in Now Pickwick Amidst the silence of the company the whispering of the women servants and the awkward embarrassment of the men mister Pickwick proceeded Ladies and gentlemen no I won t say ladies and gentlemen I ll call you my friends my dear friends if the ladies will allow me to take so great a liberty Here mister Pickwick was interrupted by immense applause from the ladies echoed by the gentlemen during which the owner of the eyes was distinctly heard to state that she could kiss that dear mister Pickwick Whereupon mister Winkle gallantly inquired if it couldn t be done by deputy to which the young lady with the black eyes replied Go away and accompanied the request with a look which said as plainly as a look could do if you can My dear friends resumed mister Pickwick I am going to propose the health of the bride and bridegroom God bless em cheers and tears My young friend Trundle I believe to be a very excellent and manly fellow and his wife I know to be a very amiable and lovely girl well qualified to transfer to another sphere of action the happiness which for twenty years she has diffused around her in her father s house Here the fat boy burst forth into stentorian blubberings and was led forth by the coat collar by mister Weller I wish added mister Pickwick I wish I was young enough to be her sister s husband cheers but failing that I am happy to be old enough to be her father for being so I shall not be suspected of any latent designs when I say that I admire esteem and love them both cheers and sobs The bride s father our good friend there is a noble person and I am proud to know him great uproar He is a kind excellent independent spirited fine hearted hospitable liberal man enthusiastic shouts from the poor relations at all the adjectives and especially at the two last That his daughter may enjoy all the happiness even he can desire and that he may derive from the contemplation of her felicity all the gratification of heart and peace of mind which he so well deserves is I am persuaded our united wish So let us drink their healths and wish them prolonged life and every blessing mister Pickwick concluded amidst a whirlwind of applause and once more were the lungs of the supernumeraries under mister Weller s command brought into active and efficient operation mister Wardle proposed mister Pickwick mister Pickwick proposed the old lady mister Snodgrass proposed mister Wardle mister Wardle proposed mister Snodgrass One of the poor relations proposed mister Tupman and the other poor relation proposed mister Winkle all was happiness and festivity until the mysterious disappearance of both the poor relations beneath the table warned the party that it was time to adjourn At dinner they met again after a five and twenty mile walk undertaken by the males at Wardle s recommendation to get rid of the effects of the wine at breakfast The poor relations had kept in bed all day with the view of attaining the same happy consummation but as they had been unsuccessful they stopped there mister Weller kept the domestics in a state of perpetual hilarity and the fat boy divided his time into small alternate allotments of eating and sleeping The dinner was as hearty an affair as the breakfast and was quite as noisy without the tears Then came the dessert and some more toasts Then came the tea and coffee and then the ball The best sitting room at Manor Farm was a good long dark panelled room with a high chimney piece and a capacious chimney up which you could have driven one of the new patent cabs wheels and all At the upper end of the room seated in a shady bower of holly and evergreens were the two best fiddlers and the only harp in all Muggleton In all sorts of recesses and on all kinds of brackets stood massive old silver candlesticks with four branches each The carpet was up the candles burned bright the fire blazed and crackled on the hearth and merry voices and light hearted laughter rang through the room If any of the old English yeomen had turned into fairies when they died it was just the place in which they would have held their revels If anything could have added to the interest of this agreeable scene it would have been the remarkable fact of mister Pickwick s appearing without his gaiters for the first time within the memory of his oldest friends You mean to dance said Wardle Of course I do replied mister Pickwick Don t you see I am dressed for the purpose mister Pickwick called attention to his speckled silk stockings and smartly tied pumps YOU in silk stockings exclaimed mister Tupman jocosely And why not sir why not said mister Pickwick turning warmly upon him Oh of course there is no reason why you shouldn t wear them responded mister Tupman I imagine not sir I imagine not said mister Pickwick in a very peremptory tone mister Tupman had contemplated a laugh but he found it was a serious matter so he looked grave and said they were a pretty pattern I hope they are said mister Pickwick fixing his eyes upon his friend You see nothing extraordinary in the stockings AS stockings I trust Sir Certainly not Oh certainly not replied mister Tupman He walked away and mister Pickwick s countenance resumed its customary benign expression We are all ready I believe said mister Pickwick who was stationed with the old lady at the top of the dance and had already made four false starts in his excessive anxiety to commence Then begin at once said Wardle Now Up struck the two fiddles and the one harp and off went mister Pickwick into hands across when there was a general clapping of hands and a cry of Stop stop What s the matter said mister Pickwick who was only brought to by the fiddles and harp desisting and could have been stopped by no other earthly power if the house had been on fire Where s Arabella Allen cried a dozen voices And Winkle added mister Tupman Here we are exclaimed that gentleman emerging with his pretty companion from the corner as he did so it would have been hard to tell which was the redder in the face he or the young lady with the black eyes What an extraordinary thing it is Winkle said mister Pickwick rather pettishly that you couldn t have taken your place before Not at all extraordinary said mister Winkle Well said mister Pickwick with a very expressive smile as his eyes rested on Arabella well I don t know that it WAS extraordinary either after all However there was no time to think more about the matter for the fiddles and harp began in real earnest Away went mister Pickwick hands across down the middle to the very end of the room and half way up the chimney back again to the door poussette everywhere loud stamp on the ground ready for the next couple off again all the figure over once more another stamp to beat out the time next couple and the next and the next again never was such going at last after they had reached the bottom of the dance and full fourteen couple after the old lady had retired in an exhausted state and the clergyman s wife had been substituted in her stead did that gentleman when there was no demand whatever on his exertions keep perpetually dancing in his place to keep time to the music smiling on his partner all the while with a blandness of demeanour which baffles all description Long before mister Pickwick was weary of dancing the newly married couple had retired from the scene There was a glorious supper downstairs notwithstanding and a good long sitting after it and when mister Pickwick awoke late the next morning he had a confused recollection of having severally and confidentially invited somewhere about five and forty people to dine with him at the George and Vulture the very first time they came to London which mister Pickwick rightly considered a pretty certain indication of his having taken something besides exercise on the previous night And so your family has games in the kitchen to night my dear has they inquired Sam of Emma Yes mister Weller replied Emma we always have on Christmas Eve Master wouldn t neglect to keep it up on any account Your master s a wery pretty notion of keeping anythin up my dear said mister Weller I never see such a sensible sort of man as he is or such a reg lar general l m n Oh that he is said the fat boy joining in the conversation don t he breed nice pork The fat youth gave a semi cannibalic leer at mister Weller as he thought of the roast legs and gravy Oh you ve woke up at last have you said Sam The fat boy nodded I ll tell you what it is young boa constructer said mister Weller impressively if you don t sleep a little less and exercise a little more wen you comes to be a man you ll lay yourself open to the same sort of personal inconwenience as was inflicted on the old general l m n as wore the pigtail What did they do to him inquired the fat boy in a faltering voice I m a going to tell you replied mister Weller he was one o the largest patterns as was ever turned out reg lar fat man as hadn t caught a glimpse of his own shoes for five and forty year Lor exclaimed Emma No that he hadn t my dear said mister Weller and if you d put an exact model of his own legs on the dinin table afore him he wouldn t ha known em Well he always walks to his office with a wery handsome gold watch chain hanging out about a foot and a quarter and a gold watch in his fob pocket as was worth I m afraid to say how much but as much as a watch can be a large heavy round manufacter as stout for a watch as he was for a man and with a big face in proportion You d better not carry that ere watch says the old general l m n s friends you ll be robbed on it says they Shall I says he Yes you will says they Well says he I should like to see the thief as could get this here watch out for I m blessed if I ever can it s such a tight fit says he and wenever I vants to know what s o clock I m obliged to stare into the bakers shops he says Well then he laughs as hearty as if he was a goin to pieces and out he walks agin with his powdered head and pigtail and rolls down the Strand with the chain hangin out furder than ever and the great round watch almost bustin through his gray kersey smalls There warn t a pickpocket in all London as didn t take a pull at that chain but the chain ud never break and the watch ud never come out so they soon got tired of dragging such a heavy old general l m n along the pavement and he d go home and laugh till the pigtail wibrated like the penderlum of a Dutch clock At last one day the old general l m n was a rollin along and he sees a pickpocket as he know d by sight a coming up arm in arm with a little boy with a wery large head Here s a game says the old general l m n to himself they re a goin to have another try but it won t do So he begins a chucklin wery hearty wen all of a sudden the little boy leaves hold of the pickpocket s arm and rushes head foremost straight into the old general l m n s stomach and for a moment doubles him right up with the pain Murder says the old general l m n All right Sir says the pickpocket a wisperin in his ear And wen he come straight agin the watch and chain was gone and what s worse than that the old general l m n s digestion was all wrong ever afterwards to the wery last day of his life so just you look about you young feller and take care you don t get too fat As mister Weller concluded this moral tale with which the fat boy appeared much affected they all three repaired to the large kitchen in which the family were by this time assembled according to annual custom on Christmas Eve observed by old Wardle s forefathers from time immemorial From the centre of the ceiling of this kitchen old Wardle had just suspended with his own hands a huge branch of mistletoe and this same branch of mistletoe instantaneously gave rise to a scene of general and most delightful struggling and confusion in the midst of which mister Pickwick with a gallantry that would have done honour to a descendant of Lady Tollimglower herself took the old lady by the hand led her beneath the mystic branch and saluted her in all courtesy and decorum The old lady submitted to this piece of practical politeness with all the dignity which befitted so important and serious a solemnity but the younger ladies not being so thoroughly imbued with a superstitious veneration for the custom or imagining that the value of a salute is very much enhanced if it cost a little trouble to obtain it screamed and struggled and ran into corners and threatened and remonstrated and did everything but leave the room until some of the less adventurous gentlemen were on the point of desisting when they all at once found it useless to resist any longer and submitted to be kissed with a good grace mister Winkle kissed the young lady with the black eyes and mister Snodgrass kissed Emily and mister Weller not being particular about the form of being under the mistletoe kissed Emma and the other female servants just as he caught them As to the poor relations they kissed everybody not even excepting the plainer portions of the young lady visitors who in their excessive confusion ran right under the mistletoe as soon as it was hung up without knowing it Wardle stood with his back to the fire surveying the whole scene with the utmost satisfaction and the fat boy took the opportunity of appropriating to his own use and summarily devouring a particularly fine mince pie that had been carefully put by for somebody else Now the screaming had subsided and faces were in a glow and curls in a tangle and mister Pickwick after kissing the old lady as before mentioned was standing under the mistletoe looking with a very pleased countenance on all that was passing around him when the young lady with the black eyes after a little whispering with the other young ladies made a sudden dart forward and putting her arm round mister Pickwick s neck saluted him affectionately on the left cheek and before mister Pickwick distinctly knew what was the matter he was surrounded by the whole body and kissed by every one of them It was a pleasant thing to see mister Pickwick in the centre of the group now pulled this way and then that and first kissed on the chin and then on the nose and then on the spectacles and to hear the peals of laughter which were raised on every side but it was a still more pleasant thing to see mister Pickwick blinded shortly afterwards with a silk handkerchief falling up against the wall and scrambling into corners and going through all the mysteries of blind man s buff with the utmost relish for the game until at last he caught one of the poor relations and then had to evade the blind man himself which he did with a nimbleness and agility that elicited the admiration and applause of all beholders The poor relations caught the people who they thought would like it and when the game flagged got caught themselves When they all tired of blind man s buff there was a great game at snap dragon and when fingers enough were burned with that and all the raisins were gone they sat down by the huge fire of blazing logs to a substantial supper and a mighty bowl of wassail something smaller than an ordinary wash house copper in which the hot apples were hissing and bubbling with a rich look and a jolly sound that were perfectly irresistible This said mister Pickwick looking round him this is indeed comfort Our invariable custom replied mister Wardle Everybody sits down with us on Christmas Eve as you see them now servants and all and here we wait until the clock strikes twelve to usher Christmas in and beguile the time with forfeits and old stories Trundle my boy rake up the fire Up flew the bright sparks in myriads as the logs were stirred The deep red blaze sent forth a rich glow that penetrated into the farthest corner of the room and cast its cheerful tint on every face Come said Wardle a song a Christmas song I ll give you one in default of a better Bravo said mister Pickwick Fill up cried Wardle It will be two hours good before you see the bottom of the bowl through the deep rich colour of the wassail fill up all round and now for the song Thus saying the merry old gentleman in a good round sturdy voice commenced without more ado A CHRISTMAS CAROL I care not for Spring on his fickle wing Let the blossoms and buds be borne He woos them amain with his treacherous rain And he scatters them ere the morn An inconstant elf he knows not himself Nor his own changing mind an hour He ll smile in your face and with wry grimace He ll wither your youngest flower Let the Summer sun to his bright home run He shall never be sought by me When he s dimmed by a cloud I can laugh aloud And care not how sulky he be For his darling child is the madness wild That sports in fierce fever s train And when love is too strong it don t last long As many have found to their pain A mild harvest night by the tranquil light Of the modest and gentle moon Has a far sweeter sheen for me I ween Than the broad and unblushing noon But every leaf awakens my grief As it lieth beneath the tree So let Autumn air be never so fair It by no means agrees with me But my song I troll out for CHRISTMAS Stout The hearty the true and the bold A bumper I drain and with might and main Give three cheers for this Christmas old We ll usher him in with a merry din That shall gladden his joyous heart And we ll keep him up while there s bite or sup And in fellowship good we ll part In his fine honest pride he scorns to hide One jot of his hard weather scars They re no disgrace for there s much the same trace On the cheeks of our bravest tars Then again I sing till the roof doth ring And it echoes from wall to wall To the stout old wight fair welcome to night As the King of the Seasons all This song was tumultuously applauded for friends and dependents make a capital audience and the poor relations especially were in perfect ecstasies of rapture Again was the fire replenished and again went the wassail round How it snows said one of the men in a low tone Snows does it said Wardle Rough cold night Sir replied the man and there s a wind got up that drifts it across the fields in a thick white cloud What does Jem say inquired the old lady There ain t anything the matter is there No no mother replied Wardle he says there s a snowdrift and a wind that s piercing cold I should know that by the way it rumbles in the chimney Ah said the old lady there was just such a wind and just such a fall of snow a good many years back I recollect just five years before your poor father died It was a Christmas Eve too and I remember that on that very night he told us the story about the goblins that carried away old Gabriel Grub The story about what said mister Pickwick Oh nothing nothing replied Wardle About an old sexton that the good people down here suppose to have been carried away by goblins Suppose ejaculated the old lady Is there anybody hardy enough to disbelieve it Suppose Haven t you heard ever since you were a child that he WAS carried away by the goblins and don t you know he was Very well mother he was if you like said Wardle laughing He WAS carried away by goblins Pickwick and there s an end of the matter No no said mister Pickwick not an end of it I assure you for I must hear how and why and all about it Wardle smiled as every head was bent forward to hear and filling out the wassail with no stinted hand nodded a health to mister Pickwick and began as follows But bless our editorial heart what a long chapter we have been betrayed into We had quite forgotten all such petty restrictions as chapters we solemnly declare So here goes to give the goblin a fair start in a new one A clear stage and no favour for the goblins ladies and gentlemen if you please CHAPTER XXIX THE STORY OF THE GOBLINS WHO STOLE A SEXTON In an old abbey town down in this part of the country a long long while ago so long that the story must be a true one because our great grandfathers implicitly believed it there officiated as sexton and grave digger in the churchyard one Gabriel Grub It by no means follows that because a man is a sexton and constantly surrounded by the emblems of mortality therefore he should be a morose and melancholy man your undertakers are the merriest fellows in the world and I once had the honour of being on intimate terms with a mute who in private life and off duty was as comical and jocose a little fellow as ever chirped out a devil may care song without a hitch in his memory or drained off a good stiff glass without stopping for breath But notwithstanding these precedents to the contrary Gabriel Grub was an ill conditioned cross grained surly fellow a morose and lonely man who consorted with nobody but himself and an old wicker bottle which fitted into his large deep waistcoat pocket and who eyed each merry face as it passed him by with such a deep scowl of malice and ill humour as it was difficult to meet without feeling something the worse for A little before twilight one Christmas Eve Gabriel shouldered his spade lighted his lantern and betook himself towards the old churchyard for he had got a grave to finish by next morning and feeling very low he thought it might raise his spirits perhaps if he went on with his work at once As he went his way up the ancient street he saw the cheerful light of the blazing fires gleam through the old casements and heard the loud laugh and the cheerful shouts of those who were assembled around them he marked the bustling preparations for next day s cheer and smelled the numerous savoury odours consequent thereupon as they steamed up from the kitchen windows in clouds All this was gall and wormwood to the heart of Gabriel Grub and when groups of children bounded out of the houses tripped across the road and were met before they could knock at the opposite door by half a dozen curly headed little rascals who crowded round them as they flocked upstairs to spend the evening in their Christmas games Gabriel smiled grimly and clutched the handle of his spade with a firmer grasp as he thought of measles scarlet fever thrush whooping cough and a good many other sources of consolation besides In this happy frame of mind Gabriel strode along returning a short sullen growl to the good humoured greetings of such of his neighbours as now and then passed him until he turned into the dark lane which led to the churchyard Now Gabriel had been looking forward to reaching the dark lane because it was generally speaking a nice gloomy mournful place into which the townspeople did not much care to go except in broad daylight and when the sun was shining consequently he was not a little indignant to hear a young urchin roaring out some jolly song about a merry Christmas in this very sanctuary which had been called Coffin Lane ever since the days of the old abbey and the time of the shaven headed monks As Gabriel walked on and the voice drew nearer he found it proceeded from a small boy who was hurrying along to join one of the little parties in the old street and who partly to keep himself company and partly to prepare himself for the occasion was shouting out the song at the highest pitch of his lungs So Gabriel waited until the boy came up and then dodged him into a corner and rapped him over the head with his lantern five or six times just to teach him to modulate his voice And as the boy hurried away with his hand to his head singing quite a different sort of tune Gabriel Grub chuckled very heartily to himself and entered the churchyard locking the gate behind him He took off his coat set down his lantern and getting into the unfinished grave worked at it for an hour or so with right good will But the earth was hardened with the frost and it was no very easy matter to break it up and shovel it out and although there was a moon it was a very young one and shed little light upon the grave which was in the shadow of the church At any other time these obstacles would have made Gabriel Grub very moody and miserable but he was so well pleased with having stopped the small boy s singing that he took little heed of the scanty progress he had made and looked down into the grave when he had finished work for the night with grim satisfaction murmuring as he gathered up his things Brave lodgings for one brave lodgings for one A few feet of cold earth when life is done A stone at the head a stone at the feet A rich juicy meal for the worms to eat Rank grass overhead and damp clay around Brave lodgings for one these in holy ground Ho ho laughed Gabriel Grub as he sat himself down on a flat tombstone which was a favourite resting place of his and drew forth his wicker bottle A coffin at Christmas A Christmas box Ho ho ho Ho ho ho repeated a voice which sounded close behind him Gabriel paused in some alarm in the act of raising the wicker bottle to his lips and looked round The bottom of the oldest grave about him was not more still and quiet than the churchyard in the pale moonlight The cold hoar frost glistened on the tombstones and sparkled like rows of gems among the stone carvings of the old church The snow lay hard and crisp upon the ground and spread over the thickly strewn mounds of earth so white and smooth a cover that it seemed as if corpses lay there hidden only by their winding sheets Not the faintest rustle broke the profound tranquillity of the solemn scene Sound itself appeared to be frozen up all was so cold and still It was the echoes said Gabriel Grub raising the bottle to his lips again It was NOT said a deep voice Gabriel started up and stood rooted to the spot with astonishment and terror for his eyes rested on a form that made his blood run cold Seated on an upright tombstone close to him was a strange unearthly figure whom Gabriel felt at once was no being of this world His long fantastic legs which might have reached the ground were cocked up and crossed after a quaint fantastic fashion his sinewy arms were bare and his hands rested on his knees On his short round body he wore a close covering ornamented with small slashes a short cloak dangled at his back the collar was cut into curious peaks which served the goblin in lieu of ruff or neckerchief and his shoes curled up at his toes into long points On his head he wore a broad brimmed sugar loaf hat garnished with a single feather The hat was covered with the white frost and the goblin looked as if he had sat on the same tombstone very comfortably for two or three hundred years He was sitting perfectly still his tongue was put out as if in derision and he was grinning at Gabriel Grub with such a grin as only a goblin could call up It was NOT the echoes said the goblin Gabriel Grub was paralysed and could make no reply What do you do here on Christmas Eve said the goblin sternly I came to dig a grave Sir stammered Gabriel Grub What man wanders among graves and churchyards on such a night as this cried the goblin Gabriel Grub Gabriel Grub screamed a wild chorus of voices that seemed to fill the churchyard Gabriel looked fearfully round nothing was to be seen What have you got in that bottle said the goblin Hollands sir replied the sexton trembling more than ever for he had bought it of the smugglers and he thought that perhaps his questioner might be in the excise department of the goblins Who drinks Hollands alone and in a churchyard on such a night as this said the goblin Gabriel Grub Gabriel Grub exclaimed the wild voices again The goblin leered maliciously at the terrified sexton and then raising his voice exclaimed And who then is our fair and lawful prize To this inquiry the invisible chorus replied in a strain that sounded like the voices of many choristers singing to the mighty swell of the old church organ a strain that seemed borne to the sexton s ears upon a wild wind and to die away as it passed onward but the burden of the reply was still the same Gabriel Grub Gabriel Grub The goblin grinned a broader grin than before as he said Well Gabriel what do you say to this The sexton gasped for breath What do you think of this Gabriel said the goblin kicking up his feet in the air on either side of the tombstone and looking at the turned up points with as much complacency as if he had been contemplating the most fashionable pair of Wellingtons in all Bond Street It s it s very curious Sir replied the sexton half dead with fright very curious and very pretty but I think I ll go back and finish my work Sir if you please Work said the goblin what work The grave Sir making the grave stammered the sexton Oh the grave eh said the goblin who makes graves at a time when all other men are merry and takes a pleasure in it Again the mysterious voices replied Gabriel Grub Gabriel Grub I am afraid my friends want you Gabriel said the goblin thrusting his tongue farther into his cheek than ever and a most astonishing tongue it was I m afraid my friends want you Gabriel said the goblin Under favour Sir replied the horror stricken sexton I don t think they can Sir they don t know me Sir I don t think the gentlemen have ever seen me Sir Oh yes they have replied the goblin we know the man with the sulky face and grim scowl that came down the street to night throwing his evil looks at the children and grasping his burying spade the tighter We know the man who struck the boy in the envious malice of his heart because the boy could be merry and he could not We know him we know him Here the goblin gave a loud shrill laugh which the echoes returned twentyfold and throwing his legs up in the air stood upon his head or rather upon the very point of his sugar loaf hat on the narrow edge of the tombstone whence he threw a Somerset with extraordinary agility right to the sexton s feet at which he planted himself in the attitude in which tailors generally sit upon the shop board I I am afraid I must leave you Sir said the sexton making an effort to move Leave us said the goblin Gabriel Grub going to leave us Ho ho ho As the goblin laughed the sexton observed for one instant a brilliant illumination within the windows of the church as if the whole building were lighted up it disappeared the organ pealed forth a lively air and whole troops of goblins the very counterpart of the first one poured into the churchyard and began playing at leap frog with the tombstones never stopping for an instant to take breath but overing the highest among them one after the other with the most marvellous dexterity The first goblin was a most astonishing leaper and none of the others could come near him even in the extremity of his terror the sexton could not help observing that while his friends were content to leap over the common sized gravestones the first one took the family vaults iron railings and all with as much ease as if they had been so many street posts At last the game reached to a most exciting pitch the organ played quicker and quicker and the goblins leaped faster and faster coiling themselves up rolling head over heels upon the ground and bounding over the tombstones like footballs The sexton s brain whirled round with the rapidity of the motion he beheld and his legs reeled beneath him as the spirits flew before his eyes when the goblin king suddenly darting towards him laid his hand upon his collar and sank with him through the earth When Gabriel Grub had had time to fetch his breath which the rapidity of his descent had for the moment taken away he found himself in what appeared to be a large cavern surrounded on all sides by crowds of goblins ugly and grim in the centre of the room on an elevated seat was stationed his friend of the churchyard and close behind him stood Gabriel Grub himself without power of motion Cold to night said the king of the goblins very cold A glass of something warm here At this command half a dozen officious goblins with a perpetual smile upon their faces whom Gabriel Grub imagined to be courtiers on that account hastily disappeared and presently returned with a goblet of liquid fire which they presented to the king Ah cried the goblin whose cheeks and throat were transparent as he tossed down the flame this warms one indeed Bring a bumper of the same for mister Grub It was in vain for the unfortunate sexton to protest that he was not in the habit of taking anything warm at night one of the goblins held him while another poured the blazing liquid down his throat the whole assembly screeched with laughter as he coughed and choked and wiped away the tears which gushed plentifully from his eyes after swallowing the burning draught And now said the king fantastically poking the taper corner of his sugar loaf hat into the sexton s eye and thereby occasioning him the most exquisite pain and now show the man of misery and gloom a few of the pictures from our own great storehouse As the goblin said this a thick cloud which obscured the remoter end of the cavern rolled gradually away and disclosed apparently at a great distance a small and scantily furnished but neat and clean apartment A crowd of little children were gathered round a bright fire clinging to their mother s gown and gambolling around her chair The mother occasionally rose and drew aside the window curtain as if to look for some expected object a frugal meal was ready spread upon the table and an elbow chair was placed near the fire A knock was heard at the door the mother opened it and the children crowded round her and clapped their hands for joy as their father entered He was wet and weary and shook the snow from his garments as the children crowded round him and seizing his cloak hat stick and gloves with busy zeal ran with them from the room Then as he sat down to his meal before the fire the children climbed about his knee and the mother sat by his side and all seemed happiness and comfort But a change came upon the view almost imperceptibly The scene was altered to a small bedroom where the fairest and youngest child lay dying the roses had fled from his cheek and the light from his eye and even as the sexton looked upon him with an interest he had never felt or known before he died His young brothers and sisters crowded round his little bed and seized his tiny hand so cold and heavy but they shrank back from its touch and looked with awe on his infant face for calm and tranquil as it was and sleeping in rest and peace as the beautiful child seemed to be they saw that he was dead and they knew that he was an angel looking down upon and blessing them from a bright and happy Heaven Again the light cloud passed across the picture and again the subject changed The father and mother were old and helpless now and the number of those about them was diminished more than half but content and cheerfulness sat on every face and beamed in every eye as they crowded round the fireside and told and listened to old stories of earlier and bygone days Slowly and peacefully the father sank into the grave and soon after the sharer of all his cares and troubles followed him to a place of rest The few who yet survived them kneeled by their tomb and watered the green turf which covered it with their tears then rose and turned away sadly and mournfully but not with bitter cries or despairing lamentations for they knew that they should one day meet again and once more they mixed with the busy world and their content and cheerfulness were restored The cloud settled upon the picture and concealed it from the sexton s view What do you think of THAT said the goblin turning his large face towards Gabriel Grub Gabriel murmured out something about its being very pretty and looked somewhat ashamed as the goblin bent his fiery eyes upon him You miserable man said the goblin in a tone of excessive contempt You He appeared disposed to add more but indignation choked his utterance so he lifted up one of his very pliable legs and flourishing it above his head a little to insure his aim administered a good sound kick to Gabriel Grub immediately after which all the goblins in waiting crowded round the wretched sexton and kicked him without mercy according to the established and invariable custom of courtiers upon earth who kick whom royalty kicks and hug whom royalty hugs Show him some more said the king of the goblins At these words the cloud was dispelled and a rich and beautiful landscape was disclosed to view there is just such another to this day within half a mile of the old abbey town The sun shone from out the clear blue sky the water sparkled beneath his rays and the trees looked greener and the flowers more gay beneath its cheering influence The water rippled on with a pleasant sound the trees rustled in the light wind that murmured among their leaves the birds sang upon the boughs and the lark carolled on high her welcome to the morning Yes it was morning the bright balmy morning of summer the minutest leaf the smallest blade of grass was instinct with life The ant crept forth to her daily toil the butterfly fluttered and basked in the warm rays of the sun myriads of insects spread their transparent wings and revelled in their brief but happy existence Man walked forth elated with the scene and all was brightness and splendour YOU a miserable man said the king of the goblins in a more contemptuous tone than before And again the king of the goblins gave his leg a flourish again it descended on the shoulders of the sexton and again the attendant goblins imitated the example of their chief Many a time the cloud went and came and many a lesson it taught to Gabriel Grub who although his shoulders smarted with pain from the frequent applications of the goblins feet thereunto looked on with an interest that nothing could diminish He saw that men who worked hard and earned their scanty bread with lives of labour were cheerful and happy and that to the most ignorant the sweet face of Nature was a never failing source of cheerfulness and joy He saw those who had been delicately nurtured and tenderly brought up cheerful under privations and superior to suffering that would have crushed many of a rougher grain because they bore within their own bosoms the materials of happiness contentment and peace He saw that women the tenderest and most fragile of all God s creatures were the oftenest superior to sorrow adversity and distress and he saw that it was because they bore in their own hearts an inexhaustible well spring of affection and devotion Above all he saw that men like himself who snarled at the mirth and cheerfulness of others were the foulest weeds on the fair surface of the earth and setting all the good of the world against the evil he came to the conclusion that it was a very decent and respectable sort of world after all No sooner had he formed it than the cloud which had closed over the last picture seemed to settle on his senses and lull him to repose One by one the goblins faded from his sight and as the last one disappeared he sank to sleep The day had broken when Gabriel Grub awoke and found himself lying at full length on the flat gravestone in the churchyard with the wicker bottle lying empty by his side and his coat spade and lantern all well whitened by the last night s frost scattered on the ground The stone on which he had first seen the goblin seated stood bolt upright before him and the grave at which he had worked the night before was not far off At first he began to doubt the reality of his adventures but the acute pain in his shoulders when he attempted to rise assured him that the kicking of the goblins was certainly not ideal He was staggered again by observing no traces of footsteps in the snow on which the goblins had played at leap frog with the gravestones but he speedily accounted for this circumstance when he remembered that being spirits they would leave no visible impression behind them So Gabriel Grub got on his feet as well as he could for the pain in his back and brushing the frost off his coat put it on and turned his face towards the town But he was an altered man and he could not bear the thought of returning to a place where his repentance would be scoffed at and his reformation disbelieved He hesitated for a few moments and then turned away to wander where he might and seek his bread elsewhere The lantern the spade and the wicker bottle were found that day in the churchyard There were a great many speculations about the sexton s fate at first but it was speedily determined that he had been carried away by the goblins and there were not wanting some very credible witnesses who had distinctly seen him whisked through the air on the back of a chestnut horse blind of one eye with the hind quarters of a lion and the tail of a bear At length all this was devoutly believed and the new sexton used to exhibit to the curious for a trifling emolument a good sized piece of the church weathercock which had been accidentally kicked off by the aforesaid horse in his aerial flight and picked up by himself in the churchyard a year or two afterwards Unfortunately these stories were somewhat disturbed by the unlooked for reappearance of Gabriel Grub himself some ten years afterwards a ragged contented rheumatic old man He told his story to the clergyman and also to the mayor and in course of time it began to be received as a matter of history in which form it has continued down to this very day The believers in the weathercock tale having misplaced their confidence once were not easily prevailed upon to part with it again so they looked as wise as they could shrugged their shoulders touched their foreheads and murmured something about Gabriel Grub having drunk all the Hollands and then fallen asleep on the flat tombstone and they affected to explain what he supposed he had witnessed in the goblin s cavern by saying that he had seen the world and grown wiser But this opinion which was by no means a popular one at any time gradually died off and be the matter how it may as Gabriel Grub was afflicted with rheumatism to the end of his days this story has at least one moral if it teach no better one and that is that if a man turn sulky and drink by himself at Christmas time he may make up his mind to be not a bit the better for it let the spirits be never so good or let them be even as many degrees beyond proof as those which Gabriel Grub saw in the goblin s cavern CHAPTER XXX HOW THE PICKWICKIANS MADE AND CULTIVATED THE ACQUAINTANCE OF A COUPLE OF NICE YOUNG MEN BELONGING TO ONE OF THE LIBERAL PROFESSIONS HOW THEY DISPORTED THEMSELVES ON THE ICE AND HOW THEIR VISIT CAME TO A CONCLUSION Well Sam said mister Pickwick as that favoured servitor entered his bed chamber with his warm water on the morning of Christmas Day still frosty Water in the wash hand basin s a mask o ice Sir responded Sam Severe weather Sam observed mister Pickwick Fine time for them as is well wropped up as the Polar bear said to himself ven he was practising his skating replied mister Weller I shall be down in a quarter of an hour Sam said mister Pickwick untying his nightcap Wery good sir replied Sam There s a couple o sawbones downstairs A couple of what exclaimed mister Pickwick sitting up in bed A couple o sawbones said Sam What s a sawbones inquired mister Pickwick not quite certain whether it was a live animal or something to eat What Don t you know what a sawbones is sir inquired mister Weller I thought everybody know d as a sawbones was a surgeon Oh a surgeon eh said mister Pickwick with a smile Just that sir replied Sam These here ones as is below though ain t reg lar thoroughbred sawbones they re only in trainin In other words they re medical students I suppose said mister Pickwick Sam Weller nodded assent I am glad of it said mister Pickwick casting his nightcap energetically on the counterpane They are fine fellows very fine fellows with judgments matured by observation and reflection and tastes refined by reading and study I am very glad of it They re a smokin cigars by the kitchen fire said Sam Ah observed mister Pickwick rubbing his hands overflowing with kindly feelings and animal spirits Just what I like to see And one on em said Sam not noticing his master s interruption one on em s got his legs on the table and is a drinking brandy neat vile the t other one him in the barnacles has got a barrel o oysters atween his knees which he s a openin like steam and as fast as he eats em he takes a aim vith the shells at young dropsy who s a sittin down fast asleep in the chimbley corner Eccentricities of genius Sam said mister Pickwick You may retire Sam did retire accordingly mister Pickwick at the expiration of the quarter of an hour went down to breakfast Here he is at last said old mister Wardle Pickwick this is Miss Allen s brother mister Benjamin Allen Ben we call him and so may you if you like This gentleman is his very particular friend mister mister Bob Sawyer interposed mister Benjamin Allen whereupon mister Bob Sawyer and mister Benjamin Allen laughed in concert mister Pickwick bowed to Bob Sawyer and Bob Sawyer bowed to mister Pickwick Bob and his very particular friend then applied themselves most assiduously to the eatables before them and mister Pickwick had an opportunity of glancing at them both mister Benjamin Allen was a coarse stout thick set young man with black hair cut rather short and a white face cut rather long He was embellished with spectacles and wore a white neckerchief Below his single breasted black surtout which was buttoned up to his chin appeared the usual number of pepper and salt coloured legs terminating in a pair of imperfectly polished boots Although his coat was short in the sleeves it disclosed no vestige of a linen wristband and although there was quite enough of his face to admit of the encroachment of a shirt collar it was not graced by the smallest approach to that appendage He presented altogether rather a mildewy appearance and emitted a fragrant odour of full flavoured Cubas mister Bob Sawyer who was habited in a coarse blue coat which without being either a greatcoat or a surtout partook of the nature and qualities of both had about him that sort of slovenly smartness and swaggering gait which is peculiar to young gentlemen who smoke in the streets by day shout and scream in the same by night call waiters by their Christian names and do various other acts and deeds of an equally facetious description He wore a pair of plaid trousers and a large rough double breasted waistcoat out of doors he carried a thick stick with a big top He eschewed gloves and looked upon the whole something like a dissipated Robinson Crusoe Such were the two worthies to whom mister Pickwick was introduced as he took his seat at the breakfast table on Christmas morning Splendid morning gentlemen said mister Pickwick mister Bob Sawyer slightly nodded his assent to the proposition and asked mister Benjamin Allen for the mustard Have you come far this morning gentlemen inquired mister Pickwick Blue Lion at Muggleton briefly responded mister Allen You should have joined us last night said mister Pickwick So we should replied Bob Sawyer but the brandy was too good to leave in a hurry wasn t it Ben Certainly said mister Benjamin Allen and the cigars were not bad or the pork chops either were they Bob Decidedly not said Bob The particular friends resumed their attack upon the breakfast more freely than before as if the recollection of last night s supper had imparted a new relish to the meal Peg away Bob said mister Allen to his companion encouragingly So I do replied Bob Sawyer And so to do him justice he did Nothing like dissecting to give one an appetite said mister Bob Sawyer looking round the table mister Pickwick slightly shuddered By the bye Bob said mister Allen have you finished that leg yet Nearly replied Sawyer helping himself to half a fowl as he spoke It s a very muscular one for a child s Is it inquired mister Allen carelessly Very said Bob Sawyer with his mouth full I ve put my name down for an arm at our place said mister Allen We re clubbing for a subject and the list is nearly full only we can t get hold of any fellow that wants a head I wish you d take it No replied Bob Sawyer can t afford expensive luxuries Nonsense said Allen Can t indeed rejoined Bob Sawyer I wouldn t mind a brain but I couldn t stand a whole head Hush hush gentlemen pray said mister Pickwick I hear the ladies As mister Pickwick spoke the ladies gallantly escorted by Messrs Snodgrass Winkle and Tupman returned from an early walk Why Ben said Arabella in a tone which expressed more surprise than pleasure at the sight of her brother Come to take you home to morrow replied Benjamin mister Winkle turned pale Don t you see Bob Sawyer Arabella inquired mister Benjamin Allen somewhat reproachfully Arabella gracefully held out her hand in acknowledgment of Bob Sawyer s presence A thrill of hatred struck to mister Winkle s heart as Bob Sawyer inflicted on the proffered hand a perceptible squeeze Ben dear said Arabella blushing have have you been introduced to mister Winkle I have not been but I shall be very happy to be Arabella replied her brother gravely Here mister Allen bowed grimly to mister Winkle while mister Winkle and mister Bob Sawyer glanced mutual distrust out of the corners of their eyes The arrival of the two new visitors and the consequent check upon mister Winkle and the young lady with the fur round her boots would in all probability have proved a very unpleasant interruption to the hilarity of the party had not the cheerfulness of mister Pickwick and the good humour of the host been exerted to the very utmost for the common weal mister Winkle gradually insinuated himself into the good graces of mister Benjamin Allen and even joined in a friendly conversation with mister Bob Sawyer who enlivened with the brandy and the breakfast and the talking gradually ripened into a state of extreme facetiousness and related with much glee an agreeable anecdote about the removal of a tumour on some gentleman s head which he illustrated by means of an oyster knife and a half quartern loaf to the great edification of the assembled company Then the whole train went to church where mister Benjamin Allen fell fast asleep while mister Bob Sawyer abstracted his thoughts from worldly matters by the ingenious process of carving his name on the seat of the pew in corpulent letters of four inches long Now said Wardle after a substantial lunch with the agreeable items of strong beer and cherry brandy had been done ample justice to what say you to an hour on the ice We shall have plenty of time Capital said mister Benjamin Allen Prime ejaculated mister Bob Sawyer You skate of course Winkle said Wardle Ye yes oh yes replied mister Winkle I I am RATHER out of practice Oh DO skate mister Winkle said Arabella I like to see it so much Oh it is SO graceful said another young lady A third young lady said it was elegant and a fourth expressed her opinion that it was swan like I should be very happy I m sure said mister Winkle reddening but I have no skates This objection was at once overruled Trundle had a couple of pair and the fat boy announced that there were half a dozen more downstairs whereat mister Winkle expressed exquisite delight and looked exquisitely uncomfortable Old Wardle led the way to a pretty large sheet of ice and the fat boy and mister Weller having shovelled and swept away the snow which had fallen on it during the night mister Bob Sawyer adjusted his skates with a dexterity which to mister Winkle was perfectly marvellous and described circles with his left leg and cut figures of eight and inscribed upon the ice without once stopping for breath a great many other pleasant and astonishing devices to the excessive satisfaction of mister Pickwick mister Tupman and the ladies which reached a pitch of positive enthusiasm when old Wardle and Benjamin Allen assisted by the aforesaid Bob Sawyer performed some mystic evolutions which they called a reel All this time mister Winkle with his face and hands blue with the cold had been forcing a gimlet into the sole of his feet and putting his skates on with the points behind and getting the straps into a very complicated and entangled state with the assistance of mister Snodgrass who knew rather less about skates than a Hindoo At length however with the assistance of mister Weller the unfortunate skates were firmly screwed and buckled on and mister Winkle was raised to his feet Now then Sir said Sam in an encouraging tone off vith you and show em how to do it Stop Sam stop said mister Winkle trembling violently and clutching hold of Sam s arms with the grasp of a drowning man How slippery it is Sam Not an uncommon thing upon ice Sir replied mister Weller Hold up Sir This last observation of mister Weller s bore reference to a demonstration mister Winkle made at the instant of a frantic desire to throw his feet in the air and dash the back of his head on the ice These these are very awkward skates ain t they Sam inquired mister Winkle staggering I m afeerd there s a orkard general l m n in em Sir replied Sam Now Winkle cried mister Pickwick quite unconscious that there was anything the matter Come the ladies are all anxiety Yes yes replied mister Winkle with a ghastly smile I m coming Just a goin to begin said Sam endeavouring to disengage himself Now Sir start off Stop an instant Sam gasped mister Winkle clinging most affectionately to mister Weller I find I ve got a couple of coats at home that I don t want Sam You may have them Sam Thank ee Sir replied mister Weller Never mind touching your hat Sam said mister Winkle hastily You needn t take your hand away to do that I meant to have given you five shillings this morning for a Christmas box Sam I ll give it you this afternoon Sam You re wery good sir replied mister Weller Just hold me at first Sam will you said mister Winkle There that s right I shall soon get in the way of it Sam Not too fast Sam not too fast mister Winkle stooping forward with his body half doubled up was being assisted over the ice by mister Weller in a very singular and un swan like manner when mister Pickwick most innocently shouted from the opposite bank Sam Sir Here I want you Let go Sir said Sam Don t you hear the governor a callin Let go sir With a violent effort mister Weller disengaged himself from the grasp of the agonised Pickwickian and in so doing administered a considerable impetus to the unhappy mister Winkle With an accuracy which no degree of dexterity or practice could have insured that unfortunate gentleman bore swiftly down into the centre of the reel at the very moment when mister Bob Sawyer was performing a flourish of unparalleled beauty mister Winkle struck wildly against him and with a loud crash they both fell heavily down mister Pickwick ran to the spot Bob Sawyer had risen to his feet but mister Winkle was far too wise to do anything of the kind in skates He was seated on the ice making spasmodic efforts to smile but anguish was depicted on every lineament of his countenance Are you hurt inquired mister Benjamin Allen with great anxiety Not much said mister Winkle rubbing his back very hard I wish you d let me bleed you said mister Benjamin with great eagerness No thank you replied mister Winkle hurriedly I really think you had better said Allen Thank you replied mister Winkle I d rather not What do YOU think mister Pickwick inquired Bob Sawyer mister Pickwick was excited and indignant He beckoned to mister Weller and said in a stern voice Take his skates off No but really I had scarcely begun remonstrated mister Winkle Take his skates off repeated mister Pickwick firmly The command was not to be resisted mister Winkle allowed Sam to obey it in silence Lift him up said mister Pickwick Sam assisted him to rise mister Pickwick retired a few paces apart from the bystanders and beckoning his friend to approach fixed a searching look upon him and uttered in a low but distinct and emphatic tone these remarkable words You re a humbug sir A what said mister Winkle starting A humbug Sir I will speak plainer if you wish it An impostor sir With those words mister Pickwick turned slowly on his heel and rejoined his friends While mister Pickwick was delivering himself of the sentiment just recorded mister Weller and the fat boy having by their joint endeavours cut out a slide were exercising themselves thereupon in a very masterly and brilliant manner Sam Weller in particular was displaying that beautiful feat of fancy sliding which is currently denominated knocking at the cobbler s door and which is achieved by skimming over the ice on one foot and occasionally giving a postman s knock upon it with the other It was a good long slide and there was something in the motion which mister Pickwick who was very cold with standing still could not help envying It looks a nice warm exercise that doesn t it he inquired of Wardle when that gentleman was thoroughly out of breath by reason of the indefatigable manner in which he had converted his legs into a pair of compasses and drawn complicated problems on the ice Ah it does indeed replied Wardle Do you slide I used to do so on the gutters when I was a boy replied mister Pickwick Try it now said Wardle Oh do please mister Pickwick cried all the ladies I should be very happy to afford you any amusement replied mister Pickwick but I haven t done such a thing these thirty years Pooh pooh Nonsense said Wardle dragging off his skates with the impetuosity which characterised all his proceedings Here I ll keep you company come along And away went the good tempered old fellow down the slide with a rapidity which came very close upon mister Weller and beat the fat boy all to nothing mister Pickwick paused considered pulled off his gloves and put them in his hat took two or three short runs baulked himself as often and at last took another run and went slowly and gravely down the slide with his feet about a yard and a quarter apart amidst the gratified shouts of all the spectators Keep the pot a bilin Sir said Sam and down went Wardle again and then mister Pickwick and then Sam and then mister Winkle and then mister Bob Sawyer and then the fat boy and then mister Snodgrass following closely upon each other s heels and running after each other with as much eagerness as if their future prospects in life depended on their expedition It was the most intensely interesting thing to observe the manner in which mister Pickwick performed his share in the ceremony to watch the torture of anxiety with which he viewed the person behind gaining upon him at the imminent hazard of tripping him up to see him gradually expend the painful force he had put on at first and turn slowly round on the slide with his face towards the point from which he had started to contemplate the playful smile which mantled on his face when he had accomplished the distance and the eagerness with which he turned round when he had done so and ran after his predecessor his black gaiters tripping pleasantly through the snow and his eyes beaming cheerfulness and gladness through his spectacles And when he was knocked down which happened upon the average every third round it was the most invigorating sight that can possibly be imagined to behold him gather up his hat gloves and handkerchief with a glowing countenance and resume his station in the rank with an ardour and enthusiasm that nothing Could abate The sport was at its height the sliding was at the quickest the laughter was at the loudest when a sharp smart crack was heard There was a quick rush towards the bank a wild scream from the ladies and a shout from mister Tupman A large mass of ice disappeared the water bubbled up over it mister Pickwick s hat gloves and handkerchief were floating on the surface and this was all of mister Pickwick that anybody could see Dismay and anguish were depicted on every countenance the males turned pale and the females fainted mister Snodgrass and mister Winkle grasped each other by the hand and gazed at the spot where their leader had gone down with frenzied eagerness while mister Tupman by way of rendering the promptest assistance and at the same time conveying to any persons who might be within hearing the clearest possible notion of the catastrophe ran off across the country at his utmost speed screaming Fire with all his might It was at this moment when old Wardle and Sam Weller were approaching the hole with cautious steps and mister Benjamin Allen was holding a hurried consultation with mister Bob Sawyer on the advisability of bleeding the company generally as an improving little bit of professional practice it was at this very moment that a face head and shoulders emerged from beneath the water and disclosed the features and spectacles of mister Pickwick Keep yourself up for an instant for only one instant bawled mister Snodgrass Yes do let me implore you for my sake roared mister Winkle deeply affected The adjuration was rather unnecessary the probability being that if mister Pickwick had declined to keep himself up for anybody else s sake it would have occurred to him that he might as well do so for his own Do you feel the bottom there old fellow said Wardle Yes certainly replied mister Pickwick wringing the water from his head and face and gasping for breath I fell upon my back I couldn t get on my feet at first The clay upon so much of mister Pickwick s coat as was yet visible bore testimony to the accuracy of this statement and as the fears of the spectators were still further relieved by the fat boy s suddenly recollecting that the water was nowhere more than five feet deep prodigies of valour were performed to get him out After a vast quantity of splashing and cracking and struggling mister Pickwick was at length fairly extricated from his unpleasant position and once more stood on dry land Oh he ll catch his death of cold said Emily Dear old thing said Arabella Let me wrap this shawl round you mister Pickwick Ah that s the best thing you can do said Wardle and when you ve got it on run home as fast as your legs can carry you and jump into bed directly A dozen shawls were offered on the instant Three or four of the thickest having been selected mister Pickwick was wrapped up and started off under the guidance of mister Weller presenting the singular phenomenon of an elderly gentleman dripping wet and without a hat with his arms bound down to his sides skimming over the ground without any clearly defined purpose at the rate of six good English miles an hour But mister Pickwick cared not for appearances in such an extreme case and urged on by Sam Weller he kept at the very top of his speed until he reached the door of Manor Farm where mister Tupman had arrived some five minutes before and had frightened the old lady into palpitations of the heart by impressing her with the unalterable conviction that the kitchen chimney was on fire a calamity which always presented itself in glowing colours to the old lady s mind when anybody about her evinced the smallest agitation mister Pickwick paused not an instant until he was snug in bed Sam Weller lighted a blazing fire in the room and took up his dinner a bowl of punch was carried up afterwards and a grand carouse held in honour of his safety Old Wardle would not hear of his rising so they made the bed the chair and mister Pickwick presided A second and a third bowl were ordered in and when mister Pickwick awoke next morning there was not a symptom of rheumatism about him which proves as mister Bob Sawyer very justly observed that there is nothing like hot punch in such cases and that if ever hot punch did fail to act as a preventive it was merely because the patient fell into the vulgar error of not taking enough of it The jovial party broke up next morning Breakings up are capital things in our school days but in after life they are painful enough Death self interest and fortune s changes are every day breaking up many a happy group and scattering them far and wide and the boys and girls never come back again We do not mean to say that it was exactly the case in this particular instance all we wish to inform the reader is that the different members of the party dispersed to their several homes that mister Pickwick and his friends once more took their seats on the top of the Muggleton coach and that Arabella Allen repaired to her place of destination wherever it might have been we dare say mister Winkle knew but we confess we don t under the care and guardianship of her brother Benjamin and his most intimate and particular friend mister Bob Sawyer Before they separated however that gentleman and mister Benjamin Allen drew mister Pickwick aside with an air of some mystery and mister Bob Sawyer thrusting his forefinger between two of mister Pickwick s ribs and thereby displaying his native drollery and his knowledge of the anatomy of the human frame at one and the same time inquired I say old boy where do you hang out mister Pickwick replied that he was at present suspended at the George and Vulture I wish you d come and see me said Bob Sawyer Nothing would give me greater pleasure replied mister Pickwick There s my lodgings said mister Bob Sawyer producing a card Lant Street Borough it s near Guy s and handy for me you know Little distance after you ve passed saint George s Church turns out of the High Street on the right hand side the way I shall find it said mister Pickwick Come on Thursday fortnight and bring the other chaps with you said mister Bob Sawyer I m going to have a few medical fellows that night mister Pickwick expressed the pleasure it would afford him to meet the medical fellows and after mister Bob Sawyer had informed him that he meant to be very cosy and that his friend Ben was to be one of the party they shook hands and separated We feel that in this place we lay ourself open to the inquiry whether mister Winkle was whispering during this brief conversation to Arabella Allen and if so what he said and furthermore whether mister Snodgrass was conversing apart with Emily Wardle and if so what HE said To this we reply that whatever they might have said to the ladies they said nothing at all to mister Pickwick or mister Tupman for eight and twenty miles and that they sighed very often refused ale and brandy and looked gloomy If our observant lady readers can deduce any satisfactory inferences from these facts we beg them by all means to do so CHAPTER XXXI WHICH IS ALL ABOUT THE LAW AND SUNDRY GREAT AUTHORITIES LEARNED THEREIN Scattered about in various holes and corners of the Temple are certain dark and dirty chambers in and out of which all the morning in vacation and half the evening too in term time there may be seen constantly hurrying with bundles of papers under their arms and protruding from their pockets an almost uninterrupted succession of lawyers clerks There are several grades of lawyers clerks There is the articled clerk who has paid a premium and is an attorney in perspective who runs a tailor s bill receives invitations to parties knows a family in Gower Street and another in Tavistock Square who goes out of town every long vacation to see his father who keeps live horses innumerable and who is in short the very aristocrat of clerks There is the salaried clerk out of door or in door as the case may be who devotes the major part of his thirty shillings a week to his Personal pleasure and adornments repairs half price to the Adelphi Theatre at least three times a week dissipates majestically at the cider cellars afterwards and is a dirty caricature of the fashion which expired six months ago There is the middle aged copying clerk with a large family who is always shabby and often drunk And there are the office lads in their first surtouts who feel a befitting contempt for boys at day schools club as they go home at night for saveloys and porter and think there s nothing like life There are varieties of the genus too numerous to recapitulate but however numerous they may be they are all to be seen at certain regulated business hours hurrying to and from the places we have just mentioned These sequestered nooks are the public offices of the legal profession where writs are issued judgments signed declarations filed and numerous other ingenious machines put in motion for the torture and torment of His Majesty s liege subjects and the comfort and emolument of the practitioners of the law They are for the most part low roofed mouldy rooms where innumerable rolls of parchment which have been perspiring in secret for the last century send forth an agreeable odour which is mingled by day with the scent of the dry rot and by night with the various exhalations which arise from damp cloaks festering umbrellas and the coarsest tallow candles About half past seven o clock in the evening some ten days or a fortnight after mister Pickwick and his friends returned to London there hurried into one of these offices an individual in a brown coat and brass buttons whose long hair was scrupulously twisted round the rim of his napless hat and whose soiled drab trousers were so tightly strapped over his Blucher boots that his knees threatened every moment to start from their concealment He produced from his coat pockets a long and narrow strip of parchment on which the presiding functionary impressed an illegible black stamp He then drew forth four scraps of paper of similar dimensions each containing a printed copy of the strip of parchment with blanks for a name and having filled up the blanks put all the five documents in his pocket and hurried away The man in the brown coat with the cabalistic documents in his pocket was no other than our old acquaintance mister Jackson of the house of Dodson Fogg Freeman s Court Cornhill Instead of returning to the office whence he came however he bent his steps direct to Sun Court and walking straight into the George and Vulture demanded to know whether one mister Pickwick was within Call mister Pickwick s servant Tom said the barmaid of the George and Vulture Don t trouble yourself said mister Jackson I ve come on business If you ll show me mister Pickwick s room I ll step up myself What name Sir said the waiter Jackson replied the clerk The waiter stepped upstairs to announce mister Jackson but mister Jackson saved him the trouble by following close at his heels and walking into the apartment before he could articulate a syllable mister Pickwick had that day invited his three friends to dinner they were all seated round the fire drinking their wine when mister Jackson presented himself as above described How de do sir said mister Jackson nodding to mister Pickwick That gentleman bowed and looked somewhat surprised for the physiognomy of mister Jackson dwelt not in his recollection I have called from Dodson and Fogg s said mister Jackson in an explanatory tone mister Pickwick roused at the name I refer you to my attorney Sir mister Perker of Gray s Inn said he Waiter show this gentleman out Beg your pardon mister Pickwick said Jackson deliberately depositing his hat on the floor and drawing from his pocket the strip of parchment But personal service by clerk or agent in these cases you know mister Pickwick nothing like caution sir in all legal forms eh Here mister Jackson cast his eye on the parchment and resting his hands on the table and looking round with a winning and persuasive smile said Now come don t let s have no words about such a little matter as this Which of you gentlemen s name s Snodgrass At this inquiry mister Snodgrass gave such a very undisguised and palpable start that no further reply was needed Ah I thought so said mister Jackson more affably than before I ve a little something to trouble you with Sir Me exclaimed mister Snodgrass It s only a subpoena in Bardell and Pickwick on behalf of the plaintiff replied Jackson singling out one of the slips of paper and producing a shilling from his waistcoat pocket It ll come on in the settens after Term fourteenth of Febooary we expect we ve marked it a special jury cause and it s only ten down the paper That s yours mister Snodgrass As Jackson said this he presented the parchment before the eyes of mister Snodgrass and slipped the paper and the shilling into his hand mister Tupman had witnessed this process in silent astonishment when Jackson turning sharply upon him said I think I ain t mistaken when I say your name s Tupman am I mister Tupman looked at mister Pickwick but perceiving no encouragement in that gentleman s widely opened eyes to deny his name said Yes my name is Tupman Sir And that other gentleman s mister Winkle I think said Jackson mister Winkle faltered out a reply in the affirmative and both gentlemen were forthwith invested with a slip of paper and a shilling each by the dexterous mister Jackson Now said Jackson I m afraid you ll think me rather troublesome but I want somebody else if it ain t inconvenient I have Samuel Weller s name here mister Pickwick Send my servant here waiter said mister Pickwick The waiter retired considerably astonished and mister Pickwick motioned Jackson to a seat There was a painful pause which was at length broken by the innocent defendant I suppose Sir said mister Pickwick his indignation rising while he spoke I suppose Sir that it is the intention of your employers to seek to criminate me upon the testimony of my own friends mister Jackson struck his forefinger several times against the left side of his nose to intimate that he was not there to disclose the secrets of the prison house and playfully rejoined Not knowin can t say For what other reason Sir pursued mister Pickwick are these subpoenas served upon them if not for this Very good plant mister Pickwick replied Jackson slowly shaking his head But it won t do No harm in trying but there s little to be got out of me Here mister Jackson smiled once more upon the company and applying his left thumb to the tip of his nose worked a visionary coffee mill with his right hand thereby performing a very graceful piece of pantomime then much in vogue but now unhappily almost obsolete which was familiarly denominated taking a grinder No no mister Pickwick said Jackson in conclusion Perker s people must guess what we ve served these subpoenas for If they can t they must wait till the action comes on and then they ll find out mister Pickwick bestowed a look of excessive disgust on his unwelcome visitor and would probably have hurled some tremendous anathema at the heads of Messrs Dodson Fogg had not Sam s entrance at the instant interrupted him Samuel Weller said mister Jackson inquiringly Vun o the truest things as you ve said for many a long year replied Sam in a most composed manner Here s a subpoena for you mister Weller said Jackson What s that in English inquired Sam Here s the original said Jackson declining the required explanation Which said Sam This replied Jackson shaking the parchment Oh that s the rig nal is it said Sam Well I m wery glad I ve seen the rig nal cos it s a gratifyin sort o thing and eases vun s mind so much And here s the shilling said Jackson It s from Dodson and Fogg s And it s uncommon handsome o Dodson and Fogg as knows so little of me to come down vith a present said Sam I feel it as a wery high compliment sir it s a wery honorable thing to them as they knows how to reward merit werever they meets it Besides which it s affectin to one s feelin s As mister Weller said this he inflicted a little friction on his right eyelid with the sleeve of his coat after the most approved manner of actors when they are in domestic pathetics mister Jackson seemed rather puzzled by Sam s proceedings but as he had served the subpoenas and had nothing more to say he made a feint of putting on the one glove which he usually carried in his hand for the sake of appearances and returned to the office to report progress mister Pickwick slept little that night his memory had received a very disagreeable refresher on the subject of missus Bardell s action He breakfasted betimes next morning and desiring Sam to accompany him set forth towards Gray s Inn Square Sam said mister Pickwick looking round when they got to the end of Cheapside Sir said Sam stepping up to his master Which way Up Newgate Street mister Pickwick did not turn round immediately but looked vacantly in Sam s face for a few seconds and heaved a deep sigh What s the matter sir inquired Sam This action Sam said mister Pickwick is expected to come on on the fourteenth of next month Remarkable coincidence that ere sir replied Sam Why remarkable Sam inquired mister Pickwick Walentine s day sir responded Sam reg lar good day for a breach o promise trial mister Weller s smile awakened no gleam of mirth in his master s countenance mister Pickwick turned abruptly round and led the way in silence They had walked some distance mister Pickwick trotting on before plunged in profound meditation and Sam following behind with a countenance expressive of the most enviable and easy defiance of everything and everybody when the latter who was always especially anxious to impart to his master any exclusive information he possessed quickened his pace until he was close at mister Pickwick s heels and pointing up at a house they were passing said Wery nice pork shop that ere sir Yes it seems so said mister Pickwick Celebrated sassage factory said Sam Is it said mister Pickwick Is it reiterated Sam with some indignation I should rayther think it was Why sir bless your innocent eyebrows that s where the mysterious disappearance of a spectable tradesman took place four years ago You don t mean to say he was burked Sam said mister Pickwick looking hastily round No I don t indeed sir replied mister Weller I wish I did far worse than that He was the master o that ere shop sir and the inwentor o the patent never leavin off sassage steam ingin as ud swaller up a pavin stone if you put it too near and grind it into sassages as easy as if it was a tender young babby Wery proud o that machine he was as it was nat ral he should be and he d stand down in the celler a lookin at it wen it was in full play till he got quite melancholy with joy A wery happy man he d ha been Sir in the procession o that ere ingin and two more lovely hinfants besides if it hadn t been for his wife who was a most owdacious wixin She was always a follerin him about and dinnin in his ears till at last he couldn t stand it no longer I ll tell you what it is my dear he says one day if you persewere in this here sort of amusement he says I m blessed if I don t go away to Merriker and that s all about it You re a idle willin says she and I wish the Merrikins joy of their bargain Arter which she keeps on abusin of him for half an hour and then runs into the little parlour behind the shop sets to a screamin says he ll be the death on her and falls in a fit which lasts for three good hours one o them fits wich is all screamin and kickin Well next mornin the husband was missin He hadn t taken nothin from the till hadn t even put on his greatcoat so it was quite clear he warn t gone to Merriker Didn t come back next day didn t come back next week missis had bills printed sayin that if he d come back he should be forgiven everythin which was very liberal seein that he hadn t done nothin at all the canals was dragged and for two months arterwards wenever a body turned up it was carried as a reg lar thing straight off to the sassage shop Hows ever none on em answered so they gave out that he d run away and she kep on the bis ness One Saturday night a little thin old general l m n comes into the shop in a great passion and says Are you the missis o this here shop Yes I am says she Well ma am says he then I ve just looked in to say that me and my family ain t a goin to be choked for nothin and more than that ma am he says you ll allow me to observe that as you don t use the primest parts of the meat in the manafacter o sassages I d think you d find beef come nearly as cheap as buttons As buttons Sir says she Buttons ma am says the little old gentleman unfolding a bit of paper and showin twenty or thirty halves o buttons Nice seasonin for sassages is trousers buttons ma am They re my husband s buttons says the widder beginnin to faint What screams the little old general l m n turnin wery pale I see it all says the widder in a fit of temporary insanity he rashly converted hisself into sassages And so he had Sir said mister Weller looking steadily into mister Pickwick s horror stricken countenance or else he d been draw d into the ingin but however that might ha been the little old general l m n who had been remarkably partial to sassages all his life rushed out o the shop in a wild state and was never heerd on arterwards The relation of this affecting incident of private life brought master and man to mister Perker s chambers Lowten holding the door half open was in conversation with a rustily clad miserable looking man in boots without toes and gloves without fingers There were traces of privation and suffering almost of despair in his lank and care worn countenance he felt his poverty for he shrank to the dark side of the staircase as mister Pickwick approached It s very unfortunate said the stranger with a sigh Very said Lowten scribbling his name on the doorpost with his pen and rubbing it out again with the feather Will you leave a message for him When do you think he ll be back inquired the stranger Quite uncertain replied Lowten winking at mister Pickwick as the stranger cast his eyes towards the ground You don t think it would be of any use my waiting for him said the stranger looking wistfully into the office Oh no I m sure it wouldn t replied the clerk moving a little more into the centre of the doorway He s certain not to be back this week and it s a chance whether he will be next for when Perker once gets out of town he s never in a hurry to come back again Out of town said mister Pickwick dear me how unfortunate Don t go away mister Pickwick said Lowten I ve got a letter for you The stranger seeming to hesitate once more looked towards the ground and the clerk winked slyly at mister PickwiCK as if to intimate that some exquisite piece of humour was going forward though what it was mister Pickwick could not for the life of him divine Step in mister Pickwick said Lowten Well will you leave a message mister Watty or will you call again Ask him to be so kind as to leave out word what has been done in my business said the man for God s sake don t neglect it mister Lowten No no I won t forget it replied the clerk Walk in mister Pickwick Good morning mister Watty it s a fine day for walking isn t it Seeing that the stranger still lingered he beckoned Sam Weller to follow his master in and shut the door in his face There never was such a pestering bankrupt as that since the world began I do believe said Lowten throwing down his pen with the air of an injured man His affairs haven t been in Chancery quite four years yet and I m d d if he don t come worrying here twice a week Step this way mister Pickwick Perker IS in and he ll see you I know Devilish cold he added pettishly standing at that door wasting one s time with such seedy vagabonds Having very vehemently stirred a particularly large fire with a particularly small poker the clerk led the way to his principal s private room and announced mister Pickwick Ah my dear Sir said little mister Perker bustling up from his chair Well my dear sir and what s the news about your matter eh Anything more about our friends in Freeman s Court They ve not been sleeping I know that Ah they re very smart fellows very smart indeed As the little man concluded he took an emphatic pinch of snuff as a tribute to the smartness of Messrs Dodson and Fogg They are great scoundrels said mister Pickwick Aye aye said the little man that s a matter of opinion you know and we won t dispute about terms because of course you can t be expected to view these subjects with a professional eye Well we ve done everything that s necessary I have retained Serjeant Snubbin Is he a good man inquired mister Pickwick Good man replied Perker bless your heart and soul my dear Sir Serjeant Snubbin is at the very top of his profession Gets treble the business of any man in court engaged in every case You needn t mention it abroad but we say we of the profession that Serjeant Snubbin leads the court by the nose The little man took another pinch of snuff as he made this communication and nodded mysteriously to mister Pickwick They have subpoenaed my three friends said mister Pickwick Ah of course they would replied Perker Important witnesses saw you in a delicate situation But she fainted of her own accord said mister Pickwick She threw herself into my arms Very likely my dear Sir replied Perker very likely and very natural Nothing more so my dear Sir nothing But who s to prove it They have subpoenaed my servant too said mister Pickwick quitting the other point for there mister Perker s question had somewhat staggered him Sam said Perker mister Pickwick replied in the affirmative Of course my dear Sir of course I knew they would I could have told you that a month ago You know my dear Sir if you WILL take the management of your affairs into your own hands after entrusting them to your solicitor you must also take the consequences Here mister Perker drew himself up with conscious dignity and brushed some stray grains of snuff from his shirt frill And what do they want him to prove asked mister Pickwick after two or three minutes silence That you sent him up to the plaintiff s to make some offer of a compromise I suppose replied Perker It don t matter much though I don t think many counsel could get a great deal out of HIM I don t think they could said mister Pickwick smiling despite his vexation at the idea of Sam s appearance as a witness What course do we pursue We have only one to adopt my dear Sir replied Perker cross examine the witnesses trust to Snubbin s eloquence throw dust in the eyes of the judge throw ourselves on the jury And suppose the verdict is against me said mister Pickwick mister Perker smiled took a very long pinch of snuff stirred the fire shrugged his shoulders and remained expressively silent You mean that in that case I must pay the damages said mister Pickwick who had watched this telegraphic answer with considerable sternness Perker gave the fire another very unnecessary poke and said I am afraid so Then I beg to announce to you my unalterable determination to pay no damages whatever said mister Pickwick most emphatically None Perker Not a pound not a penny of my money shall find its way into the pockets of Dodson and Fogg That is my deliberate and irrevocable determination mister Pickwick gave a heavy blow on the table before him in confirmation of the irrevocability of his intention Very well my dear Sir very well said Perker You know best of course Of course replied mister Pickwick hastily Where does Serjeant Snubbin live In Lincoln s Inn Old Square replied Perker I should like to see him said mister Pickwick See Serjeant Snubbin my dear Sir rejoined Perker in utter amazement Pooh pooh my dear Sir impossible See Serjeant Snubbin Bless you my dear Sir such a thing was never heard of without a consultation fee being previously paid and a consultation fixed It couldn t be done my dear Sir it couldn t be done mister Pickwick however had made up his mind not only that it could be done but that it should be done and the consequence was that within ten minutes after he had received the assurance that the thing was impossible he was conducted by his solicitor into the outer office of the great Serjeant Snubbin himself It was an uncarpeted room of tolerable dimensions with a large writing table drawn up near the fire the baize top of which had long since lost all claim to its original hue of green and had gradually grown gray with dust and age except where all traces of its natural colour were obliterated by ink stains Upon the table were numerous little bundles of papers tied with red tape and behind it sat an elderly clerk whose sleek appearance and heavy gold watch chain presented imposing indications of the extensive and lucrative practice of mister Serjeant Snubbin Is the Serjeant in his room mister Mallard inquired Perker offering his box with all imaginable courtesy Yes he is was the reply but he s very busy Look here not an opinion given yet on any one of these cases and an expedition fee paid with all of em The clerk smiled as he said this and inhaled the pinch of snuff with a zest which seemed to be compounded of a fondness for snuff and a relish for fees Something like practice that said Perker Yes said the barrister s clerk producing his own box and offering it with the greatest cordiality and the best of it is that as nobody alive except myself can read the serjeant s writing they are obliged to wait for the opinions when he has given them till I have copied em ha ha ha Which makes good for we know who besides the serjeant and draws a little more out of the clients eh said Perker ha ha ha At this the serjeant s clerk laughed again not a noisy boisterous laugh but a silent internal chuckle which mister Pickwick disliked to hear When a man bleeds inwardly it is a dangerous thing for himself but when he laughs inwardly it bodes no good to other people You haven t made me out that little list of the fees that I m in your debt have you said Perker No I have not replied the clerk I wish you would said Perker Let me have them and I ll send you a cheque But I suppose you re too busy pocketing the ready money to think of the debtors eh ha ha ha This sally seemed to tickle the clerk amazingly and he once more enjoyed a little quiet laugh to himself But mister Mallard my dear friend said Perker suddenly recovering his gravity and drawing the great man s great man into a Corner by the lappel of his coat you must persuade the Serjeant to see me and my client here Come come said the clerk that s not bad either See the Serjeant come that s too absurd Notwithstanding the absurdity of the proposal however the clerk allowed himself to be gently drawn beyond the hearing of mister Pickwick and after a short conversation conducted in whispers walked softly down a little dark passage and disappeared into the legal luminary s sanctum whence he shortly returned on tiptoe and informed mister Perker and mister Pickwick that the Serjeant had been prevailed upon in violation of all established rules and customs to admit them at once mister Serjeant Snubbins was a lantern faced sallow complexioned man of about five and forty or as the novels say he might be fifty He had that dull looking boiled eye which is often to be seen in the heads of people who have applied themselves during many years to a weary and laborious course of study and which would have been sufficient without the additional eyeglass which dangled from a broad black riband round his neck to warn a stranger that he was very near sighted His hair was thin and weak which was partly attributable to his having never devoted much time to its arrangement and partly to his having worn for five and twenty years the forensic wig which hung on a block beside him The marks of hairpowder on his coat collar and the ill washed and worse tied white neckerchief round his throat showed that he had not found leisure since he left the court to make any alteration in his dress while the slovenly style of the remainder of his costume warranted the inference that his personal appearance would not have been very much improved if he had Books of practice heaps of papers and opened letters were scattered over the table without any attempt at order or arrangement the furniture of the room was old and rickety the doors of the book case were rotting in their hinges the dust flew out from the carpet in little clouds at every step the blinds were yellow with age and dirt the state of everything in the room showed with a clearness not to be mistaken that mister Serjeant Snubbin was far too much occupied with his professional pursuits to take any great heed or regard of his personal comforts The Serjeant was writing when his clients entered he bowed abstractedly when mister Pickwick was introduced by his solicitor and then motioning them to a seat put his pen carefully in the inkstand nursed his left leg and waited to be spoken to mister Pickwick is the defendant in Bardell and Pickwick Serjeant Snubbin said Perker I am retained in that am I said the Serjeant You are Sir replied Perker The Serjeant nodded his head and waited for something else mister Pickwick was anxious to call upon you Serjeant Snubbin said Perker to state to you before you entered upon the case that he denies there being any ground or pretence whatever for the action against him and that unless he came into court with clean hands and without the most conscientious conviction that he was right in resisting the plaintiff s demand he would not be there at all I believe I state your views correctly do I not my dear Sir said the little man turning to mister Pickwick Quite so replied that gentleman mister Serjeant Snubbin unfolded his glasses raised them to his eyes and after looking at mister Pickwick for a few seconds with great curiosity turned to mister Perker and said smiling slightly as he spoke Has mister Pickwick a strong case The attorney shrugged his shoulders Do you propose calling witnesses No The smile on the Serjeant s countenance became more defined he rocked his leg with increased violence and throwing himself back in his easy chair coughed dubiously These tokens of the Serjeant s presentiments on the subject slight as they were were not lost on mister Pickwick He settled the spectacles through which he had attentively regarded such demonstrations of the barrister s feelings as he had permitted himself to exhibit more firmly on his nose and said with great energy and in utter disregard of all mister Perker s admonitory winkings and frownings My wishing to wait upon you for such a purpose as this Sir appears I have no doubt to a gentleman who sees so much of these matters as you must necessarily do a very extraordinary circumstance The Serjeant tried to look gravely at the fire but the smile came back again Gentlemen of your profession Sir continued mister Pickwick see the worst side of human nature All its disputes all its ill will and bad blood rise up before you You know from your experience of juries I mean no disparagement to you or them how much depends upon effect and you are apt to attribute to others a desire to use for purposes of deception and Self interest the very instruments which you in pure honesty and honour of purpose and with a laudable desire to do your utmost for your client know the temper and worth of so well from constantly employing them yourselves I really believe that to this circumstance may be attributed the vulgar but very general notion of your being as a body suspicious distrustful and over cautious Conscious as I am sir of the disadvantage of making such a declaration to you under such circumstances I have come here because I wish you distinctly to understand as my friend mister Perker has said that I am innocent of the falsehood laid to my charge and although I am very well aware of the inestimable value of your assistance Sir I must beg to add that unless you sincerely believe this I would rather be deprived of the aid of your talents than have the advantage of them Long before the close of this address which we are bound to say was of a very prosy character for mister Pickwick the Serjeant had relapsed into a state of abstraction After some minutes however during which he had reassumed his pen he appeared to be again aware of the presence of his clients raising his head from the paper he said rather snappishly Who is with me in this case mister Phunky Serjeant Snubbin replied the attorney Phunky Phunky said the Serjeant I never heard the name before He must be a very young man Yes he is a very young man replied the attorney He was only called the other day Let me see he has not been at the Bar eight years yet Ah I thought not said the Serjeant in that sort of pitying tone in which ordinary folks would speak of a very helpless little child mister Mallard send round to mister mister Phunky s Holborn Court Gray s Inn interposed Perker Holborn Court by the bye is South Square now mister Phunky and say I should be glad if he d step here a moment mister Mallard departed to execute his commission and Serjeant Snubbin relapsed into abstraction until mister Phunky himself was introduced Although an infant barrister he was a full grown man He had a very nervous manner and a painful hesitation in his speech it did not appear to be a natural defect but seemed rather the result of timidity arising from the consciousness of being kept down by want of means or interest or connection or impudence as the case might be He was overawed by the Serjeant and profoundly courteous to the attorney I have not had the pleasure of seeing you before mister Phunky said Serjeant Snubbin with haughty condescension mister Phunky bowed He HAD had the pleasure of seeing the Serjeant and of envying him too with all a poor man s envy for eight years and a quarter You are with me in this case I understand said the Serjeant If mister Phunky had been a rich man he would have instantly sent for his clerk to remind him if he had been a wise one he would have applied his forefinger to his forehead and endeavoured to recollect whether in the multiplicity of his engagements he had undertaken this one or not but as he was neither rich nor wise in this sense at all events he turned red and bowed Have you read the papers mister Phunky inquired the Serjeant Here again mister Phunky should have professed to have forgotten all about the merits of the case but as he had read such papers as had been laid before him in the course of the action and had thought of nothing else waking or sleeping throughout the two months during which he had been retained as mister Serjeant Snubbin s junior he turned a deeper red and bowed again This is mister Pickwick said the Serjeant waving his pen in the direction in which that gentleman was standing mister Phunky bowed to mister Pickwick with a reverence which a first client must ever awaken and again inclined his head towards his leader Perhaps you will take mister Pickwick away said the Serjeant and and and hear anything mister Pickwick may wish to communicate We shall have a consultation of course With that hint that he had been interrupted quite long enough mister Serjeant Snubbin who had been gradually growing more and more abstracted applied his glass to his eyes for an instant bowed slightly round and was once more deeply immersed in the case before him which arose out of an interminable lawsuit originating in the act of an individual deceased a century or so ago who had stopped up a pathway leading from some place which nobody ever came from to some other place which nobody ever went to mister Phunky would not hear of passing through any door until mister Pickwick and his solicitor had passed through before him so it was some time before they got into the Square and when they did reach it they walked up and down and held a long conference the result of which was that it was a very difficult matter to say how the verdict would go that nobody could presume to calculate on the issue of an action that it was very lucky they had prevented the other party from getting Serjeant Snubbin and other topics of doubt and consolation common in such a position of affairs mister Weller was then roused by his master from a sweet sleep of an hour s duration and bidding adieu to Lowten they returned to the city CHAPTER XXXII DESCRIBES FAR MORE FULLY THAN THE COURT NEWSMAN EVER DID A BACHELOR S PARTY GIVEN BY mister BOB SAWYER AT HIS LODGINGS IN THE BOROUGH 
1772-135621-0001	train-other-500	There is a repose about Lant Street in the Borough which sheds a gentle melancholy upon the soul There are always a good many houses to let in the street
1772-135621-0002	train-other-500	it is a by street too and its dulness is soothing A house in Lant Street would not come within the denomination of a first rate residence in the strict
1772-135621-0003	train-other-500	acceptation of the term but it is a most desirable spot nevertheless If a man wished to abstract himself from the world to remove himself from within the reach of temptation
1772-135621-0004	train-other-500	to place himself beyond the possibility of any inducement to look out of the window we should recommend him by all means go to Lant Street In this happy retreat are colonised
1772-135621-0005	train-other-500	a few clear starchers a sprinkling of journeymen bookbinders one or two prison agents for the Insolvent Court several small housekeepers who are employed in the Docks
1772-135621-0006	train-other-500	a handful of mantua makers and a seasoning of jobbing tailors The majority of the inhabitants either direct their energies to the letting of furnished apartments
1772-135621-0007	train-other-500	or devote themselves to the healthful and invigorating pursuit of mangling The chief features in the still life of the street are green shutters lodging bills brass door plates and bell handles
1772-135621-0008	train-other-500	the principal specimens of animated nature the pot boy the muffin youth and the baked potato man The population is migratory usually disappearing on the verge of quarter day
1772-135621-0009	train-other-500	and generally by night His Majesty s revenues are seldom collected in this happy valley the rents are dubious and the water communication is very frequently cut off
1772-135621-0010	train-other-500	mister Bob Sawyer embellished one side of the fire in his first floor front
none	none	 early on the evening for which he had invited mister Pickwick and mister Ben Allen the other The preparations for the reception of visitors appeared to be completed The umbrellas in the passage had been heaped into the little corner outside the back parlour door 
1772-135621-0011	train-other-500	the bonnet and shawl of the landlady s servant had been removed from the bannisters there were not more than two pairs of pattens on the street door mat and a kitchen candle with a very long snuff
1772-135621-0012	train-other-500	burned cheerfully on the ledge of the staircase window mister Bob Sawyer had himself purchased the spirits at a wine vaults in High Street and had returned home preceding the bearer thereof
1772-135621-0013	train-other-500	to preclude the possibility of their delivery at the wrong house The punch was ready made in a red pan in the bedroom a little table covered with a green baize cloth had been borrowed from the parlour
none	none	 to play at cards on and the glasses of the establishment 
1772-135621-0014	train-other-500	together with those which had been borrowed for the occasion from the public house were all drawn up in a tray which was deposited on the landing outside the door
1772-135621-0015	train-other-500	Notwithstanding the highly satisfactory nature of all these arrangements there was a cloud on the countenance of mister Bob Sawyer as he sat by the fireside There was a sympathising expression too
1772-135621-0016	train-other-500	in the features of mister Ben Allen as he gazed intently on the coals
none	none	 and a tone of melancholy in his voice as he 
1772-135621-0017	train-other-500	said after a long silence
none	none	 Well 
1772-135621-0018	train-other-500	it is unlucky
none	none	 she should have taken it in her head to turn sour 
1772-135621-0019	train-other-500	just on this occasion She might at least have waited till to morrow That s her malevolence that s her malevolence returned mister
none	none	 Bob Sawyer vehemently She says that if I can afford to give a party 
1772-135621-0020	train-other-500	I ought to be able to pay her confounded little bill How long has it been running inquired mister Ben Allen
1772-135621-0021	train-other-500	A bill by the bye is the most extraordinary locomotive engine that the genius of man ever produced It would keep on running during the longest lifetime without ever once stopping of its own accord
1772-135621-0022	train-other-500	Only a quarter and a month or so replied mister Bob Sawyer Ben Allen coughed hopelessly and directed a searching look between the two top bars
1772-135621-0023	train-other-500	of the stove It ll be a
none	none	 deuced unpleasant thing if she takes it into her head 
1772-135621-0024	train-other-500	to let out when those fellows are here won t it said mister Ben Allen at length Horrible replied Bob Sawyer horrible A low tap was heard at the room door
1772-135621-0025	train-other-500	mister Bob Sawyer looked expressively at his friend and bade the tapper come in whereupon a dirty slipshod girl in black cotton stockings
1772-135621-0026	train-other-500	who might have passed for the neglected daughter of a superannuated dustman in very reduced circumstances
none	none	 thrust in her head 
1772-135621-0027	train-other-500	and said Please Mister Sawyer Missis Raddle wants to speak to you
none	none	 Before mister Bob Sawyer could return any answer the girl suddenly disappeared with a jerk 
1772-135621-0028	train-other-500	as if somebody had given her a violent pull behind this mysterious exit was no sooner accomplished than there was another tap at the door a smart pointed tap which seemed to say
1772-135621-0029	train-other-500	Here I am and in I m coming mister Bob Sawyer glanced at his friend with a look of abject apprehension and once more cried Come in
1772-135621-0030	train-other-500	The permission was not at all necessary for before mister Bob Sawyer had uttered the words a little fierce woman bounced into the room
1772-135621-0031	train-other-500	all in a tremble with passion and pale with rage Now mister Sawyer said the little fierce woman trying to appear very calm
none	none	 if you ll have the 
1772-135621-0032	train-other-500	kindness to settle that little bill of mine I ll thank you because I ve got my rent to pay this afternoon and my landlord s a waiting below now
1772-135621-0033	train-other-500	Here the little woman rubbed her hands and looked steadily over mister Bob Sawyer s head at the wall behind him I am very sorry to put you to
1772-135621-0034	train-other-500	any inconvenience missus Raddle said Bob Sawyer deferentially but Oh it isn t any inconvenience replied the little woman with a shrill titter I didn t want it particular before to day
1772-135621-0035	train-other-500	leastways as it has to go to my landlord directly it was as well for you to keep it as me You promised me this afternoon mister Sawyer and every gentleman as has ever lived here has kept his word Sir
1772-135621-0036	train-other-500	as of course anybody as calls himself a gentleman does missus Raddle tossed her head bit her lips rubbed her hands harder and looked at the wall more steadily than ever
1772-135621-0037	train-other-500	It was plain to see as mister Bob Sawyer remarked in a style of Eastern allegory on a subsequent occasion that she was getting the steam up
1772-135621-0038	train-other-500	I am very sorry missus Raddle said Bob Sawyer with all imaginable humility but the fact is that
1772-135621-0039	train-other-500	I have been disappointed in the City to day Extraordinary place that City An astonishing number of men always ARE getting disappointed there
1772-135621-0040	train-other-500	Well mister Sawyer said missus Raddle planting herself firmly on a purple cauliflower in the Kidderminster carpet and what s that to me
none	none	 Sir I I have no doubt missus Raddle said Bob Sawyer blinking this last question that before the middle of next week we shall 
1772-135621-0041	train-other-500	be able to set ourselves quite square and go on on a better system afterwards This was
none	none	 all missus Raddle 
1772-135621-0042	train-other-500	wanted She had bustled up to the apartment of the unlucky Bob Sawyer so bent upon going into a passion that in all probability payment would have rather disappointed her than otherwise
none	none	 She was in excellent order for a little relaxation of the kind having just exchanged a few introductory compliments with mister R in the front kitchen Do you suppose mister Sawyer said missus Raddle elevating her voice for the information of the neighbours do you suppose that I m a going day after day to let a fellar occupy my lodgings as never thinks of paying his rent nor even the very money laid out for the fresh butter and lump sugar that s bought for his breakfast and the very milk that s took in at the street door Do you suppose a hard working and industrious woman as has lived in this street for twenty year ten year over the way and nine year and three quarters in this very house has nothing else to do but to work herself to death after a parcel of lazy idle fellars that are always smoking and drinking and lounging when they ought to be glad to turn their hands to anything that would help em to pay their bills Do you My good soul 
1772-135621-0043	train-other-500	interposed mister Benjamin Allen soothingly
none	none	 Have 
1772-135621-0044	train-other-500	the goodness to keep
none	none	 your observashuns to yourself Sir 
1772-135621-0045	train-other-500	I beg said missus Raddle suddenly arresting the rapid torrent of her speech and addressing the third party with impressive slowness and solemnity
none	none	 I am not aweer Sir that you have any right to address your conversation to me I don t think I let these apartments to you Sir No you certainly did not said mister Benjamin Allen Very good Sir responded missus Raddle with lofty politeness Then p raps Sir you ll confine yourself to breaking the arms and legs of the poor people in the hospitals and keep yourself TO yourself Sir or there may be some persons here as will make you Sir But you are such an unreasonable woman remonstrated mister Benjamin Allen I beg your parding young man said missus Raddle 
1772-135621-0046	train-other-500	in a cold perspiration of anger But will you have the goodness just to call me that again sir I didn t
none	none	 make use of the word in any invidious sense ma am replied mister Benjamin Allen growing somewhat uneasy on his own account I beg your parding young man demanded missus Raddle in a louder and more imperative tone 
1772-135621-0047	train-other-500	But who do you call a woman
none	none	 Did you make that remark to me sir Why bless my heart said mister Benjamin Allen Did you apply that name to me I ask of you sir interrupted missus Raddle with intense fierceness throwing the door wide open Why of course I did replied mister Benjamin Allen Yes of course you did said 
1772-135621-0048	train-other-500	missus Raddle backing gradually to the door and raising her voice to its loudest pitch
none	none	 for the special behoof of mister Raddle in the kitchen 
1772-135621-0049	train-other-500	Yes of course you did And everybody knows that they may safely insult me in my own ouse while my husband sits sleeping downstairs and taking no more notice
none	none	 than if I was a dog in the streets He ought to be ashamed of himself here missus Raddle sobbed to allow his wife to be treated in this way by a parcel of young cutters and carvers 
1772-135621-0050	train-other-500	of live people s bodies that disgraces the lodgings another sob and leaving her exposed to all manner of abuse a base faint
none	none	 hearted timorous wretch that s afraid to come upstairs and face the ruffinly creatures that s afraid that s afraid to come missus Raddle paused to listen whether the repetition of the taunt had roused her better half and finding that it had not 
1772-135621-0051	train-other-500	been successful proceeded to descend the stairs with sobs innumerable when there came a loud double knock at the street door whereupon she burst into an
1772-135621-0052	train-other-500	hysterical fit of weeping
none	none	 accompanied with dismal moans which was prolonged until the knock had been repeated six times 
1772-135621-0053	train-other-500	when in an uncontrollable burst of mental agony she threw down all the umbrellas and disappeared into the back parlour closing the door after her with an awful crash
1772-135621-0054	train-other-500	Does mister Sawyer live here said mister Pickwick when the door was opened Yes said the girl first floor It s the door straight afore you
1772-135621-0055	train-other-500	when you gets to the top of the stairs Having given this instruction the handmaid who had been brought up among the aboriginal inhabitants of Southwark
1772-135621-0056	train-other-500	disappeared with the candle in her hand down the kitchen stairs perfectly satisfied that she had done everything that could possibly be required
none	none	 of her under the circumstances 
1772-135621-0057	train-other-500	mister Snodgrass who entered last secured the street door after several ineffectual efforts by putting up the chain and the friends stumbled upstairs where they were
none	none	 received by mister Bob Sawyer who had been afraid to go down lest he should be waylaid by missus Raddle How are you 
1772-135621-0058	train-other-500	said the discomfited student Glad to see you
none	none	 take care of the glasses 
1772-135621-0059	train-other-500	This caution was addressed to mister Pickwick who had put his hat in the tray Dear me said mister Pickwick I beg your pardon Don t mention it don t mention it said Bob Sawyer I m rather confined for room here but you
1772-135621-0060	train-other-500	must put up with all that when you come to see a young bachelor Walk in You ve seen this gentleman before I think mister Pickwick shook hands with mister Benjamin Allen and his friends followed his example
none	none	 They had scarcely taken their seats when there was another 
1772-135621-0061	train-other-500	double knock I hope that s Jack Hopkins said mister Bob Sawyer Hush Yes it is Come up Jack come up A heavy footstep was heard upon the stairs and Jack Hopkins presented himself
1772-135621-0062	train-other-500	He wore a black velvet waistcoat with thunder and lightning buttons
none	none	 and a blue striped shirt with a white false collar 
1772-135621-0063	train-other-500	You re late Jack said mister Benjamin Allen Been detained at Bartholomew s replied Hopkins Anything new No nothing particular Rather a good accident brought into the casualty ward
1772-135621-0064	train-other-500	What was that sir inquired mister Pickwick Only a man fallen out of a four pair of stairs window but it s a very fair case indeed
1772-135621-0065	train-other-500	Do you mean that the patient is in a fair way to recover inquired mister Pickwick No replied mister Hopkins carelessly No I should rather say he wouldn t There must be a splendid operation though
1772-135621-0066	train-other-500	to morrow magnificent sight if Slasher does it You consider mister Slasher a good operator said mister Pickwick Best alive replied Hopkins Took a boy s leg out of the socket last week
none	none	 boy ate five apples and a gingerbread cake exactly two minutes after it was all over 
1772-135621-0067	train-other-500	boy said he wouldn t lie there to be made game of and he d tell his mother if they didn t begin
none	none	 Dear me said mister Pickwick astonished Pooh That s nothing 
1772-135621-0068	train-other-500	that ain t said Jack Hopkins Is it Bob Nothing at all replied mister Bob Sawyer By the bye Bob said Hopkins with a scarcely perceptible glance at mister Pickwick s attentive face
1772-135621-0069	train-other-500	we had a curious accident last night A child was brought in who had swallowed a necklace Swallowed what Sir interrupted
none	none	 mister Pickwick A necklace replied Jack Hopkins 
1772-135621-0070	train-other-500	Not all at once you know that would be too much you couldn t swallow that if the child did eh mister Pickwick ha ha
none	none	 mister Hopkins appeared highly gratified with his own pleasantry and continued No 
1772-135621-0071	train-other-500	the way was this Child s parents were poor people who lived in a court Child s eldest sister bought a necklace common necklace made of large black wooden beads Child
none	none	 being fond of toys cribbed the necklace hid it played with it 
1772-135621-0072	train-other-500	cut the string and swallowed a bead Child thought it capital fun went back next day and swallowed another bead Bless my heart said mister Pickwick what a dreadful thing I beg your pardon Sir Go on
none	none	 Next day child swallowed two beads the day after that he treated himself to three and so on till in a week s time he had got through the necklace five and twenty beads in all The sister who was an industrious girl and seldom treated herself to a bit of finery 
1772-135621-0073	train-other-500	cried her eyes out at the loss of the necklace looked high and low for it but I needn t say didn t find it A few days afterwards the family were at dinner baked shoulder of mutton and potatoes under it
1772-135621-0074	train-other-500	the child who wasn t hungry was playing about the room when suddenly there was heard a devil of a noise like a small hailstorm Don t do that my boy said the father
none	none	 I ain t a doin nothing said the child Well don t do it again said the father There was a short silence and then the noise began again worse than ever If you don t mind what I say my boy said the father you ll find yourself in bed in something less than a pig s whisper He gave the child a shake to make him obedient and such a rattling ensued as nobody ever heard before Why damme it s IN the child said the father he s got the croup in the wrong place No I haven t father said the child beginning to cry 
1772-135621-0075	train-other-500	it s the necklace I swallowed it father The father caught the child up and ran with him to the hospital the beads in the boy s stomach rattling all the way with the jolting
none	none	 and the people looking up in the air and down in the cellars 
1772-135621-0076	train-other-500	to see where the unusual sound came from He s in the hospital now said Jack Hopkins and he makes such a devil of a noise when he walks about
1772-135621-0077	train-other-500	that they re obliged to muffle him in a watchman s coat for fear he should wake the patients That s the most extraordinary case I ever heard of said mister Pickwick with an emphatic blow
none	none	 on the table Oh that s nothing said Jack Hopkins Is it Bob 
1772-135621-0078	train-other-500	Certainly not replied Bob Sawyer Very singular things occur in our profession I can assure you Sir said Hopkins So I should be disposed to imagine
none	none	 replied mister Pickwick 
1772-135621-0079	train-other-500	Another knock at the door announced a large headed young man in a black wig who
none	none	 brought with him a scorbutic youth in a long stock The next comer was a gentleman in a shirt emblazoned with pink anchors who was closely followed by a pale youth 
1772-135621-0080	train-other-500	with a plated watchguard The arrival of a prim personage in clean linen and cloth boots rendered the party complete The little table with the green baize cover was wheeled out the first instalment of punch
1772-135621-0081	train-other-500	was brought in in a white jug and the succeeding three hours were devoted to
none	none	 VINGT ET UN 
1772-135621-0082	train-other-500	at sixpence a dozen which was only once interrupted by a slight dispute between the scorbutic youth and the gentleman with the pink anchors
1772-135621-0083	train-other-500	in the course of which the scorbutic youth intimated a burning desire to pull the nose of the gentleman with the emblems of hope in reply to which that individual
none	none	 expressed his decided unwillingness to accept of any sauce 
1772-135621-0084	train-other-500	on gratuitous terms either from the irascible young
none	none	 gentleman with the scorbutic countenance 
1772-135621-0085	train-other-500	or any other person who was ornamented with a head When the last natural had been declared and the profit and loss account of fish and sixpences adjusted to the satisfaction of all parties
1772-135621-0086	train-other-500	mister Bob Sawyer rang for supper and the visitors squeezed themselves into corners while it was getting ready it was not so easily got ready as some people may imagine
1772-135621-0087	train-other-500	First of all it was necessary to awaken the
none	none	 girl who had 
1772-135621-0088	train-other-500	fallen asleep with her face on the kitchen table this took a little time and even when she did answer the bell another quarter of an hour was consumed in fruitless endeavours to impart to her
1772-135621-0089	train-other-500	a faint and distant glimmering of reason The man to whom the order for the oysters had been sent had not been told to open them it is a very difficult thing to open an oyster with a limp knife
1772-135621-0090	train-other-500	and a two pronged fork and very little was done in this way Very little of the beef was done either and the ham which was also from the German sausage shop round the corner was in a similar predicament
1772-135621-0091	train-other-500	However there was plenty of porter in a tin can and the cheese went a great way for it was very strong So upon the whole perhaps the supper was quite as good as such
none	none	 matters usually are 
1772-135621-0092	train-other-500	After supper another jug of punch was put upon the table together with a paper of
none	none	 cigars and a couple of bottles of spirits 
1772-135621-0093	train-other-500	Then there was an awful pause and this awful pause was occasioned by a very common occurrence in this sort of place but a very embarrassing one notwithstanding The fact is
none	none	 the girl was washing the glasses The establishment boasted four we do not record the circumstance 
1772-135621-0094	train-other-500	as at all derogatory to missus Raddle for there never was a lodging house yet that was not short of glasses
none	none	 The landlady s glasses were little thin

none	none	 in itself sufficient to have possessed the company with the real state of affairs but the young woman of all work had prevented the possibility of any misconception arising in the mind of any gentleman upon the subject by forcibly dragging every man s glass away long before he had finished his beer and audibly stating despite the winks and interruptions of 
1772-135621-0096	train-other-500	mister Bob Sawyer that it was to be conveyed downstairs and washed forthwith It is a very ill wind that blows nobody any good
none	none	 The prim man in the cloth boots who had been unsuccessfully attempting to make a joke during the whole time the round game lasted 
1772-135621-0097	train-other-500	saw his opportunity and availed himself of it The instant the glasses disappeared he commenced a long story about a great public character whose name he had forgotten
1772-135621-0098	train-other-500	making a particularly happy reply to another eminent and illustrious individual whom he had never been able to identify He enlarged at some length and with great
none	none	 minuteness upon divers 
1772-135621-0099	train-other-500	collateral circumstances distantly connected with the anecdote in hand but for the life of him he couldn t recollect at that precise moment what the anecdote was
1772-135621-0100	train-other-500	although he had been in the habit of telling the story with great applause for the last ten years
none	none	 Dear me said the prim man in the cloth boots 
1772-135621-0101	train-other-500	it is a very extraordinary circumstance I am sorry you have forgotten it said mister Bob Sawyer glancing eagerly at the door as he thought he heard the noise of glasses jingling
1772-135621-0102	train-other-500	very sorry So am I responded the prim man because I know it would have afforded so much amusement
none	none	 Never mind I dare say I shall manage 
1772-135621-0103	train-other-500	to recollect it in the course of half an hour or so The prim man arrived at this point just as the glasses came back when mister Bob Sawyer who had been absorbed in attention during the whole time said he should
1772-135621-0104	train-other-500	very much like to hear the end of it for so far as it went it was without exception the very best story he had ever heard
none	none	 The sight of the tumblers restored Bob Sawyer to a degree of equanimity which he had not possessed since his interview with his landlady His face brightened up and he began to feel quite convivial 
1772-135621-0105	train-other-500	Now Betsy said mister Bob Sawyer with great suavity and dispersing at the same time
none	none	 the tumultuous little mob of glasses the girl had collected in the centre of the table now Betsy the warm water be brisk there s a good girl You can t have no warm water replied Betsy 
1772-135621-0106	train-other-500	No warm water exclaimed mister Bob Sawyer
none	none	 No said the girl with a shake of the head which expressed a more decided negative 
1772-135621-0107	train-other-500	than the most copious language could have conveyed Missis Raddle said you warn t to have none The surprise depicted on the countenances of his guests imparted new courage to the host
1772-135621-0108	train-other-500	Bring up the warm water
none	none	 instantly instantly said mister Bob Sawyer with 
1772-135621-0109	train-other-500	desperate sternness No I can t replied the girl Missis Raddle raked out the kitchen fire afore she went to bed and locked up the kittle
1772-135621-0110	train-other-500	Oh never mind never mind Pray don t disturb yourself about such a trifle said mister Pickwick observing the conflict of Bob Sawyer s passions as depicted in his countenance
1772-135621-0111	train-other-500	cold water will do very well Oh admirably said mister Benjamin Allen My landlady is subject to some slight attacks of mental derangement remarked Bob Sawyer with a
1772-135621-0112	train-other-500	ghastly smile I fear I must give her warning No don t said Ben Allen I fear I must said Bob with heroic firmness
1772-135621-0113	train-other-500	I ll pay her what I owe her and give her warning to morrow morning Poor fellow how devoutly he wished he could mister Bob Sawyer s heart sickening attempts to rally
1772-135621-0114	train-other-500	under this last blow communicated a dispiriting influence to the company the greater part of whom with the view of raising their spirits attached themselves with extra cordiality to the
1772-135621-0115	train-other-500	cold brandy and water the first perceptible effects of which were displayed in a renewal of hostilities between the scorbutic youth and the gentleman in the shirt The belligerents vented their
1772-135621-0116	train-other-500	feelings of mutual contempt for some time in a variety of frownings and snortings until at last the scorbutic youth felt it necessary to come to a more explicit understanding on the matter
1772-135621-0117	train-other-500	when the following clear understanding took place Sawyer said the scorbutic youth in a loud voice Well Noddy replied mister Bob Sawyer
1772-135621-0118	train-other-500	I should be very sorry Sawyer said mister Noddy to create any unpleasantness at any friend s table and much less at yours Sawyer very but
1772-135621-0119	train-other-500	I must take this opportunity of informing mister Gunter that he is no gentleman And I should be very sorry Sawyer to create any disturbance in the street in which you reside
1772-135621-0120	train-other-500	said mister Gunter but I m afraid I shall be under the necessity of alarming the neighbours by throwing the person who has just spoken out o window
none	none	 What do you mean by that sir inquired mister Noddy What I say Sir replied mister Gunter I should like to see you do it Sir said mister Noddy 
1772-135621-0121	train-other-500	You shall FEEL me do it in half a minute Sir replied mister Gunter I request that you ll favour me with your card Sir said mister Noddy I ll do nothing of the kind Sir replied mister Gunter Why not Sir
1772-135621-0122	train-other-500	inquired mister Noddy Because you ll stick it up over your chimney piece and delude your visitors
none	none	 into the false belief that a gentleman has been to see you Sir replied mister Gunter 
1772-135621-0123	train-other-500	Sir a friend of mine shall wait on you in the morning said mister Noddy Sir I m very much obliged to you for the caution
1772-135621-0124	train-other-500	and I ll leave particular directions with the servant to lock up the spoons replied mister Gunter At this point the remainder of the guests interposed and remonstrated with both parties on the impropriety of their conduct
1772-135621-0125	train-other-500	on which mister Noddy begged to state that his father was quite as respectable as mister Gunter s father to which mister Gunter replied that his father was to the full as respectable as mister Noddy s father
1772-135621-0126	train-other-500	and that his father s son was as good a man as mister Noddy any day in the week As this announcement seemed the prelude to a recommencement of the dispute
none	none	 there was another interference on the part of the company 
1772-135621-0127	train-other-500	and a vast quantity of talking and clamouring ensued in the course of which mister Noddy gradually allowed his feelings to overpower him and professed that he had ever entertained
1772-135621-0128	train-other-500	a devoted personal attachment towards mister Gunter To this mister Gunter replied that upon the whole he rather preferred mister Noddy to his own brother
1772-135621-0129	train-other-500	on hearing which admission mister Noddy magnanimously rose from his seat and proffered his hand to mister Gunter mister Gunter grasped it with affecting fervour and everybody said
1772-135621-0130	train-other-500	that the whole dispute had been conducted in a manner which was highly honourable to both parties concerned Now said Jack Hopkins just to set us going again Bob I don t mind singing a song
none	none	 And Hopkins incited thereto by 
1772-135621-0131	train-other-500	tumultuous applause plunged himself at once into The King God bless him
none	none	 which he sang as loud as he could to a novel air 
1772-135621-0132	train-other-500	compounded of the Bay of Biscay and A Frog he would The chorus was the essence of the song and as each gentleman sang it to the tune he knew best the effect was very striking
1772-135621-0133	train-other-500	indeed It was at the end of the chorus to the first verse that mister Pickwick held up his hand in a listening attitude and said as soon as silence was restored Hush
1772-135621-0134	train-other-500	I beg your pardon I thought I heard somebody calling from upstairs A profound silence immediately ensued and mister Bob Sawyer was observed to turn pale
none	none	 I think I hear it now said mister Pickwick Have the goodness to open the door The door was no sooner opened than all doubt on the subject was removed mister Sawyer mister Sawyer screamed a voice from the two pair landing 
1772-135621-0135	train-other-500	It s my landlady said Bob Sawyer looking
none	none	 round him with great dismay Yes missus Raddle What do you mean by this mister Sawyer replied the voice with great shrillness and rapidity of utterance Ain t it enough to be swindled out of one s rent and money lent out of pocket besides and abused and insulted by your friends that dares to call themselves men without having the house turned out of the window and noise enough made to bring the fire engines here at two o clock in the morning Turn them wretches away You ought to be ashamed of yourselves said the voice of mister Raddle which appeared to proceed from beneath some distant bed clothes Ashamed of themselves said missus Raddle 
1772-135621-0136	train-other-500	Why don t you go down and knock em every one downstairs You would if you was a man I should if I was a dozen men my dear replied mister Raddle pacifically but
1772-135621-0137	train-other-500	they have the advantage of me in numbers my dear Ugh you coward replied missus Raddle with supreme contempt
none	none	 DO you mean to turn them wretches out or not mister Sawyer They re going missus Raddle they re going 
1772-135621-0138	train-other-500	said the miserable Bob I am afraid you d better go said mister Bob Sawyer to his friends I thought you were making too much noise It s a very unfortunate thing
1772-135621-0139	train-other-500	said the prim man Just as we were getting so comfortable too The prim man was just beginning to have a dawning recollection of the story he had forgotten
none	none	 It s hardly to be borne said the prim man looking round Hardly to be borne is it 
1772-135621-0140	train-other-500	Not to be endured replied Jack Hopkins let s have the other verse Bob Come here goes No no Jack don t interposed Bob Sawyer it s a capital song but I am afraid we had better not have the other verse
1772-135621-0141	train-other-500	They are very violent people the people of the house
none	none	 Shall I step upstairs and pitch into the landlord inquired Hopkins or keep on ringing the bell or 
1772-135621-0142	train-other-500	go and groan on the staircase You may command me Bob I am very much indebted to you for your friendship and good nature Hopkins said the wretched mister Bob Sawyer but I think the best
1772-135621-0143	train-other-500	plan to avoid any further dispute is for us to break up at once
none	none	 Now mister Sawyer screamed the shrill voice of missus Raddle are them brutes going 
1772-135621-0144	train-other-500	They re only looking for their hats missus Raddle said Bob they are going directly
none	none	 Going said missus Raddle thrusting her nightcap over the banisters just as mister Pickwick followed by mister Tupman emerged from the sitting room Going what did they ever come for 
1772-135621-0145	train-other-500	My dear ma am remonstrated mister Pickwick
none	none	 looking up Get along with you old wretch replied missus Raddle hastily withdrawing the nightcap Old enough to be his grandfather you willin You re worse than any of em 
1772-135621-0146	train-other-500	mister Pickwick found it in vain to protest his innocence
none	none	 so hurried downstairs into the street 
1772-135621-0147	train-other-500	whither he was closely followed by mister Tupman mister Winkle and mister Snodgrass mister Ben Allen who was dismally depressed with spirits and agitation
none	none	 accompanied them as far as London Bridge and in the course of the walk confided to mister Winkle 
1772-135621-0148	train-other-500	as an especially eligible person to intrust the secret to that he was resolved to cut the throat of any gentleman except mister Bob Sawyer who should aspire to the affections of his sister Arabella
1772-135621-0149	train-other-500	Having expressed his determination to perform this painful duty of a brother with proper firmness he burst into tears knocked his hat over his eyes and making the best of his way back knocked double knocks
none	none	 at the door of the Borough Market office and took short naps on the steps 
1772-135621-0150	train-other-500	alternately until daybreak under the firm impression that he lived there and had forgotten the key The visitors having all departed
1772-135621-0151	train-other-500	in compliance with the rather pressing request of missus Raddle the luckless mister Bob Sawyer was left alone
none	none	 to meditate on the probable events of to morrow and the pleasures of the evening CHAPTER XXXIII mister WELLER THE ELDER DELIVERS SOME CRITICAL SENTIMENTS RESPECTING LITERARY COMPOSITION AND ASSISTED BY HIS SON SAMUEL PAYS A SMALL INSTALMENT OF RETALIATION TO THE ACCOUNT OF THE REVEREND GENTLEMAN WITH THE RED NOSE The morning of the thirteenth of February which the readers of this authentic narrative know as well as we do to have been the day immediately preceding that which was appointed for the trial of missus Bardell s action was a busy time for mister Samuel Weller who was perpetually engaged in travelling from the George and Vulture to mister Perker s chambers and back again from and between the hours of nine o clock in the morning and two in the afternoon both inclusive Not that there was anything whatever to be done for the consultation had taken place and the course of proceeding to be adopted had been finally determined on but mister Pickwick being in a most extreme state of excitement persevered in constantly sending small notes to his attorney merely containing the inquiry Dear Perker Is all going on well to which mister Perker invariably forwarded the reply Dear Pickwick As well as possible the fact being as we have already hinted that there was nothing whatever to go on either well or ill until the sitting of the court on the following morning But people who go voluntarily to law or are taken forcibly there for the first time may be allowed to labour under some temporary irritation and anxiety and Sam with a due allowance for the frailties of human nature obeyed all his master s behests with that imperturbable good humour and unruffable composure which formed one of his most striking and amiable characteristics Sam had solaced himself with a most agreeable little dinner and was waiting at the bar for the glass of warm mixture in which mister Pickwick had requested him to drown the fatigues of his morning s walks when a young boy of about three feet high or thereabouts in a hairy cap and fustian overalls whose garb bespoke a laudable ambition to attain in time the elevation of an hostler entered the passage of the George and Vulture and looked first up the stairs and then along the passage and then into the bar as if in search of somebody to whom he bore a commission whereupon the barmaid conceiving it not improbable that the said commission might be directed to the tea or table spoons of the establishment accosted the boy with Now young man what do you want Is there anybody here named Sam inquired the youth in a loud voice of treble quality What s the t other name said Sam Weller looking round How should I know briskly replied the young gentleman below the hairy cap You re a sharp boy you are said mister Weller only I wouldn t show that wery fine edge too much if I was you in case anybody took it off What do you mean by comin to a hot el and asking arter Sam vith as much politeness as a vild Indian Cos an old general l m n told me to replied the boy What old general l m n inquired Sam with deep disdain Him as drives a Ipswich coach and uses our parlour rejoined the boy He told me yesterday mornin to come to the George and Wultur this arternoon and ask for Sam It s my father my dear said mister Weller turning with an explanatory air to the young lady in the bar blessed if I think he hardly knows wot my other name is Well young brockiley sprout wot then Why then said the boy you was to come to him at six o clock to our ouse cos he wants to see you Blue Boar Leaden all Markit Shall I say you re comin You may wenture on that ere statement Sir replied Sam And thus empowered the young gentleman walked away awakening all the echoes in George Yard as he did so with several chaste and extremely correct imitations of a drover s whistle delivered in a tone of peculiar richness and volume mister Weller having obtained leave of absence from mister Pickwick who in his then state of excitement and worry was by no means displeased at being left alone set forth long before the appointed hour and having plenty of time at his disposal sauntered down as far as the Mansion House where he paused and contemplated with a face of great calmness and philosophy the numerous cads and drivers of short stages who assemble near that famous place of resort to the great terror and confusion of the old lady population of these realms Having loitered here for half an hour or so mister Weller turned and began wending his way towards Leadenhall Market through a variety of by streets and courts As he was sauntering away his spare time and stopped to look at almost every object that met his gaze it is by no means surprising that mister Weller should have paused before a small stationer s and print seller s window but without further explanation it does appear surprising that his eyes should have no sooner rested on certain pictures which were exposed for sale therein than he gave a sudden start smote his right leg with great vehemence and exclaimed with energy if it hadn t been for this I should ha forgot all about it till it was too late The particular picture on which Sam Weller s eyes were fixed as he said this was a highly coloured representation of a couple of human hearts skewered together with an arrow cooking before a cheerful fire while a male and female cannibal in modern attire the gentleman being clad in a blue coat and white trousers and the lady in a deep red pelisse with a parasol of the same were approaching the meal with hungry eyes up a serpentine gravel path leading thereunto A decidedly indelicate young gentleman in a pair of wings and nothing else was depicted as superintending the cooking a representation of the spire of the church in Langham Place London appeared in the distance and the whole formed a valentine of which as a written inscription in the window testified there was a large assortment within which the shopkeeper pledged himself to dispose of to his countrymen generally at the reduced rate of one and sixpence each I should ha forgot it I should certainly ha forgot it said Sam so saying he at once stepped into the stationer s shop and requested to be served with a sheet of the best gilt edged letter paper and a hard nibbed pen which could be warranted not to splutter These articles having been promptly supplied he walked on direct towards Leadenhall Market at a good round pace very different from his recent lingering one Looking round him he there beheld a signboard on which the painter s art had delineated something remotely resembling a cerulean elephant with an aquiline nose in lieu of trunk Rightly conjecturing that this was the Blue Boar himself he stepped into the house and inquired concerning his parent He won t be here this three quarters of an hour or more said the young lady who superintended the domestic arrangements of the Blue Boar Wery good my dear replied Sam Let me have nine penn oth o brandy and water luke and the inkstand will you miss The brandy and water luke and the inkstand having been carried into the little parlour and the young lady having carefully flattened down the coals to prevent their blazing and carried away the poker to preclude the possibility of the fire being stirred without the full privity and concurrence of the Blue Boar being first had and obtained Sam Weller sat himself down in a box near the stove and pulled out the sheet of gilt edged letter paper and the hard nibbed pen Then looking carefully at the pen to see that there were no hairs in it and dusting down the table so that there might be no crumbs of bread under the paper Sam tucked up the cuffs of his coat squared his elbows and composed himself to write To ladies and gentlemen who are not in the habit of devoting themselves practically to the science of penmanship writing a letter is no very easy task it being always considered necessary in such cases for the writer to recline his head on his left arm so as to place his eyes as nearly as possible on a level with the paper and while glancing sideways at the letters he is constructing to form with his tongue imaginary characters to correspond These motions although unquestionably of the greatest assistance to original composition retard in some degree the progress of the writer and Sam had unconsciously been a full hour and a half writing words in small text smearing out wrong letters with his little finger and putting in new ones which required going over very often to render them visible through the old blots when he was roused by the opening of the door and the entrance of his parent Vell Sammy said the father Vell my Prooshan Blue responded the son laying down his pen What s the last bulletin about mother in law missus Veller passed a very good night but is uncommon perwerse and unpleasant this mornin Signed upon oath Tony Veller Esquire That s the last vun as was issued Sammy replied mister Weller untying his shawl No better yet inquired Sam All the symptoms aggerawated replied mister Weller shaking his head But wot s that you re a doin of Pursuit of knowledge under difficulties Sammy I ve done now said Sam with slight embarrassment I ve been a writin So I see replied mister Weller Not to any young ooman I hope Sammy Why it s no use a sayin it ain t replied Sam it s a walentine A what exclaimed mister Weller apparently horror stricken by the word A walentine replied Sam Samivel Samivel said mister Weller in reproachful accents I didn t think you d ha done it Arter the warnin you ve had o your father s wicious propensities arter all I ve said to you upon this here wery subject arter actiwally seein and bein in the company o your own mother in law vich I should ha thought wos a moral lesson as no man could never ha forgotten to his dyin day I didn t think you d ha done it Sammy I didn t think you d ha done it These reflections were too much for the good old man He raised Sam s tumbler to his lips and drank off its contents Wot s the matter now said Sam Nev r mind Sammy replied mister Weller it ll be a wery agonisin trial to me at my time of life but I m pretty tough that s vun consolation as the wery old turkey remarked wen the farmer said he wos afeerd he should be obliged to kill him for the London market Wot ll be a trial inquired Sam To see you married Sammy to see you a dilluded wictim and thinkin in your innocence that it s all wery capital replied mister Weller It s a dreadful trial to a father s feelin s that ere Sammy Nonsense said Sam I ain t a goin to get married don t you fret yourself about that I know you re a judge of these things Order in your pipe and I ll read you the letter There We cannot distinctly say whether it was the prospect of the pipe or the consolatory reflection that a fatal disposition to get married ran in the family and couldn t be helped which calmed mister Weller s feelings and caused his grief to subside We should be rather disposed to say that the result was attained by combining the two sources of consolation for he repeated the second in a low tone very frequently ringing the bell meanwhile to order in the first He then divested himself of his upper coat and lighting the pipe and placing himself in front of the fire with his back towards it so that he could feel its full heat and recline against the mantel piece at the same time turned towards Sam and with a countenance greatly mollified by the softening influence of tobacco requested him to fire away Sam dipped his pen into the ink to be ready for any corrections and began with a very theatrical air Lovely Stop said mister Weller ringing the bell A double glass o the inwariable my dear Very well Sir replied the girl who with great quickness appeared vanished returned and disappeared They seem to know your ways here observed Sam Yes replied his father I ve been here before in my time Go on Sammy Lovely creetur repeated Sam Tain t in poetry is it interposed his father No no replied Sam Wery glad to hear it said mister Weller Poetry s unnat ral no man ever talked poetry cept a beadle on boxin day or Warren s blackin or Rowland s oil or some of them low fellows never you let yourself down to talk poetry my boy Begin agin Sammy mister Weller resumed his pipe with critical solemnity and Sam once more commenced and read as follows Lovely creetur I feel myself a damned That ain t proper said mister Weller taking his pipe from his mouth No it ain t damned observed Sam holding the letter up to the light it s shamed there s a blot there I feel myself ashamed Wery good said mister Weller Go on Feel myself ashamed and completely cir I forget what this here word is said Sam scratching his head with the pen in vain attempts to remember Why don t you look at it then inquired mister Weller So I am a lookin at it replied Sam but there s another blot Here s a c and a i and a d Circumwented p raps suggested mister Weller No it ain t that said Sam circumscribed that s it That ain t as good a word as circumwented Sammy said mister Weller gravely Think not said Sam Nothin like it replied his father But don t you think it means more inquired Sam Vell p raps it s a more tenderer word said mister Weller after a few moments reflection Go on Sammy Feel myself ashamed and completely circumscribed in a dressin of you for you are a nice gal and nothin but it That s a wery pretty sentiment said the elder mister Weller removing his pipe to make way for the remark Yes I think it is rayther good observed Sam highly flattered Wot I like in that ere style of writin said the elder mister Weller is that there ain t no callin names in it no Wenuses nor nothin o that kind Wot s the good o callin a young ooman a Wenus or a angel Sammy Ah what indeed replied Sam You might jist as well call her a griffin or a unicorn or a king s arms at once which is wery well known to be a collection o fabulous animals added mister Weller Just as well replied Sam Drive on Sammy said mister Weller Sam complied with the request and proceeded as follows his father continuing to smoke with a mixed expression of wisdom and complacency which was particularly edifying Afore I see you I thought all women was alike So they are observed the elder mister Weller parenthetically But now continued Sam now I find what a reg lar soft headed inkred lous turnip I must ha been for there ain t nobody like you though I like you better than nothin at all I thought it best to make that rayther strong said Sam looking up mister Weller nodded approvingly and Sam resumed So I take the privilidge of the day Mary my dear as the general l m n in difficulties did ven he valked out of a Sunday to tell you that the first and only time I see you your likeness was took on my hart in much quicker time and brighter colours than ever a likeness was took by the profeel macheen wich p raps you may have heerd on Mary my dear altho it DOES finish a portrait and put the frame and glass on complete with a hook at the end to hang it up by and all in two minutes and a quarter I am afeerd that werges on the poetical Sammy said mister Weller dubiously No it don t replied Sam reading on very quickly to avoid contesting the point Except of me Mary my dear as your walentine and think over what I ve said My dear Mary I will now conclude That s all said Sam That s rather a Sudden pull up ain t it Sammy inquired mister Weller Not a bit on it said Sam she ll vish there wos more and that s the great art o letter writin Well said mister Weller there s somethin in that and I wish your mother in law ud only conduct her conwersation on the same general teel principle Ain t you a goin to sign it That s the difficulty said Sam I don t know what to sign it Sign it Veller said the oldest surviving proprietor of that name Won t do said Sam Never sign a walentine with your own name Sign it Pickwick then said mister Weller it s a wery good name and a easy one to spell The wery thing said Sam I COULD end with a werse what do you think I don t like it Sam rejoined mister Weller I never know d a respectable coachman as wrote poetry cept one as made an affectin copy o werses the night afore he was hung for a highway robbery and he wos only a Cambervell man so even that s no rule But Sam was not to be dissuaded from the poetical idea that had occurred to him so he signed the letter Your love sick Pickwick And having folded it in a very intricate manner squeezed a downhill direction in one corner To Mary Housemaid at mister Nupkins s Mayor s Ipswich Suffolk and put it into his pocket wafered and ready for the general post This important business having been transacted mister Weller the elder proceeded to open that on which he had summoned his son The first matter relates to your governor Sammy said mister Weller He s a goin to be tried to morrow ain t he The trial s a comin on replied Sam Vell said mister Weller Now I s pose he ll want to call some witnesses to speak to his character or p rhaps to prove a alleybi I ve been a turnin the bis ness over in my mind and he may make his self easy Sammy I ve got some friends as ll do either for him but my adwice ud be this here never mind the character and stick to the alleybi Nothing like a alleybi Sammy nothing mister Weller looked very profound as he delivered this legal opinion and burying his nose in his tumbler winked over the top thereof at his astonished son Why what do you mean said Sam you don t think he s a goin to be tried at the Old Bailey do you That ain t no part of the present consideration Sammy replied mister Weller Verever he s a goin to be tried my boy a alleybi s the thing to get him off Ve got Tom Vildspark off that ere manslaughter with a alleybi ven all the big vigs to a man said as nothing couldn t save him And my pinion is Sammy that if your governor don t prove a alleybi he ll be what the Italians call reg larly flummoxed and that s all about it As the elder mister Weller entertained a firm and unalterable conviction that the Old Bailey was the supreme court of judicature in this country and that its rules and forms of proceeding regulated and controlled the practice of all other courts of justice whatsoever he totally disregarded the assurances and arguments of his son tending to show that the alibi was inadmissible and vehemently protested that mister Pickwick was being wictimised Finding that it was of no use to discuss the matter further Sam changed the subject and inquired what the second topic was on which his revered parent wished to consult him That s a pint o domestic policy Sammy said mister Weller This here Stiggins Red nosed man inquired Sam The wery same replied mister Weller This here red nosed man Sammy wisits your mother in law vith a kindness and constancy I never see equalled He s sitch a friend o the family Sammy that wen he s avay from us he can t be comfortable unless he has somethin to remember us by And I d give him somethin as ud turpentine and beeswax his memory for the next ten years or so if I wos you interposed Sam Stop a minute said mister Weller I wos a going to say he always brings now a flat bottle as holds about a pint and a half and fills it vith the pine apple rum afore he goes avay And empties it afore he comes back I s pose said Sam Clean replied mister Weller never leaves nothin in it but the cork and the smell trust him for that Sammy Now these here fellows my boy are a goin to night to get up the monthly meetin o the Brick Lane Branch o the United Grand Junction Ebenezer Temperance Association Your mother in law wos a goin Sammy but she s got the rheumatics and can t and I Sammy I ve got the two tickets as wos sent her mister Weller communicated this secret with great glee and winked so indefatigably after doing so that Sam began to think he must have got the TIC DOLOUREUX in his right eyelid Well said that young gentleman Well continued his progenitor looking round him very cautiously you and I ll go punctiwal to the time The deputy shepherd won t Sammy the deputy shepherd won t Here mister Weller was seized with a paroxysm of chuckles which gradually terminated in as near an approach to a choke as an elderly gentleman can with safety sustain Well I never see sitch an old ghost in all my born days exclaimed Sam rubbing the old gentleman s back hard enough to set him on fire with the friction What are you a laughin at corpilence Hush Sammy said mister Weller looking round him with increased caution and speaking in a whisper Two friends o mine as works the Oxford Road and is up to all kinds o games has got the deputy shepherd safe in tow Sammy and ven he does come to the Ebenezer Junction vich he s sure to do for they ll see him to the door and shove him in if necessary he ll be as far gone in rum and water as ever he wos at the Markis o Granby Dorkin and that s not sayin a little neither And with this mister Weller once more laughed immoderately and once more relapsed into a state of partial suffocation in consequence Nothing could have been more in accordance with Sam Weller s feelings than the projected exposure of the real propensities and qualities of the red nosed man and it being very near the appointed hour of meeting the father and son took their way at once to Brick Lane Sam not forgetting to drop his letter into a general post office as they walked along The monthly meetings of the Brick Lane Branch of the United Grand Junction Ebenezer Temperance Association were held in a large room pleasantly and airily situated at the top of a safe and commodious ladder The president was the straight walking mister Anthony Humm a converted fireman now a schoolmaster and occasionally an itinerant preacher and the secretary was mister Jonas Mudge chandler s shopkeeper an enthusiastic and disinterested vessel who sold tea to the members Previous to the commencement of business the ladies sat upon forms and drank tea till such time as they considered it expedient to leave off and a large wooden money box was conspicuously placed upon the green baize cloth of the business table behind which the secretary stood and acknowledged with a gracious smile every addition to the rich vein of copper which lay concealed within On this particular occasion the women drank tea to a most alarming extent greatly to the horror of mister Weller senior who utterly regardless of all Sam s admonitory nudgings stared about him in every direction with the most undisguised astonishment Sammy whispered mister Weller if some o these here people don t want tappin to morrow mornin I ain t your father and that s wot it is Why this here old lady next me is a drowndin herself in tea Be quiet can t you murmured Sam Sam whispered mister Weller a moment afterwards in a tone of deep agitation mark my vords my boy If that ere secretary fellow keeps on for only five minutes more he ll blow hisself up with toast and water Well let him if he likes replied Sam it ain t no bis ness o yourn If this here lasts much longer Sammy said mister Weller in the same low voice I shall feel it my duty as a human bein to rise and address the cheer There s a young ooman on the next form but two as has drunk nine breakfast cups and a half and she s a swellin wisibly before my wery eyes There is little doubt that mister Weller would have carried his benevolent intention into immediate execution if a great noise occasioned by putting up the cups and saucers had not very fortunately announced that the tea drinking was over The crockery having been removed the table with the green baize cover was carried out into the centre of the room and the business of the evening was commenced by a little emphatic man with a bald head and drab shorts who suddenly rushed up the ladder at the imminent peril of snapping the two little legs incased in the drab shorts and said Ladies and gentlemen I move our excellent brother mister Anthony Humm into the chair The ladies waved a choice selection of pocket handkerchiefs at this proposition and the impetuous little man literally moved mister Humm into the chair by taking him by the shoulders and thrusting him into a mahogany frame which had once represented that article of furniture The waving of handkerchiefs was renewed and mister Humm who was a sleek white faced man in a perpetual perspiration bowed meekly to the great admiration of the females and formally took his seat Silence was then proclaimed by the little man in the drab shorts and mister Humm rose and said That with the permission of his Brick Lane Branch brothers and sisters then and there present the secretary would read the report of the Brick Lane Branch committee a proposition which was again received with a demonstration of pocket handkerchiefs The secretary having sneezed in a very impressive manner and the cough which always seizes an assembly when anything particular is going to be done having been duly performed the following document was read REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE BRICK LANE BRANCH OF THE UNITED GRAND JUNCTION EBENEZER TEMPERANCE ASSOCIATION Your committee have pursued their grateful labours during the past month and have the unspeakable pleasure of reporting the following additional cases of converts to Temperance H Walker tailor wife and two children When in better circumstances owns to having been in the constant habit of drinking ale and beer says he is not certain whether he did not twice a week for twenty years taste dog s nose which your committee find upon inquiry to be compounded of warm porter moist sugar gin and nutmeg a groan and So it is from an elderly female Is now out of work and penniless thinks it must be the porter cheers or the loss of the use of his right hand is not certain which but thinks it very likely that if he had drunk nothing but water all his life his fellow workman would never have stuck a rusty needle in him and thereby occasioned his accident tremendous cheering Has nothing but cold water to drink and never feels thirsty great applause Betsy Martin widow one child and one eye Goes out charing and washing by the day never had more than one eye but knows her mother drank bottled stout and shouldn t wonder if that caused it immense cheering Thinks it not impossible that if she had always abstained from spirits she might have had two eyes by this time tremendous applause Used at every place she went to to have eighteen pence a day a pint of porter and a glass of spirits but since she became a member of the Brick Lane Branch has always demanded three and sixpence the announcement of this most interesting fact was received with deafening enthusiasm Henry Beller was for many years toast master at various corporation dinners during which time he drank a great deal of foreign wine may sometimes have carried a bottle or two home with him is not quite certain of that but is sure if he did that he drank the contents Feels very low and melancholy is very feverish and has a constant thirst upon him thinks it must be the wine he used to drink cheers Is out of employ now and never touches a drop of foreign wine by any chance tremendous plaudits Thomas Burton is purveyor of cat s meat to the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs and several members of the Common Council the announcement of this gentleman s name was received with breathless interest Has a wooden leg finds a wooden leg expensive going over the stones used to wear second hand wooden legs and drink a glass of hot gin and water regularly every night sometimes two deep sighs Found the second hand wooden legs split and rot very quickly is firmly persuaded that their constitution was undermined by the gin and water prolonged cheering Buys new wooden legs now and drinks nothing but water and weak tea The new legs last twice as long as the others used to do and he attributes this solely to his temperate habits triumphant cheers Anthony Humm now moved that the assembly do regale itself with a song With a view to their rational and moral enjoyment Brother Mordlin had adapted the beautiful words of Who hasn t heard of a Jolly Young Waterman to the tune of the Old Hundredth which he would request them to join him in singing great applause He might take that opportunity of expressing his firm persuasion that the late mister Dibdin seeing the errors of his former life had written that song to show the advantages of abstinence It was a temperance song whirlwinds of cheers The neatness of the young man s attire the dexterity of his feathering the enviable state of mind which enabled him in the beautiful words of the poet to Row along thinking of nothing at all all combined to prove that he must have been a water drinker cheers Oh what a state of virtuous jollity rapturous cheering And what was the young man s reward Let all young men present mark this The maidens all flocked to his boat so readily Loud cheers in which the ladies joined What a bright example The sisterhood the maidens flocking round the young waterman and urging him along the stream of duty and of temperance But was it the maidens of humble life only who soothed consoled and supported him No He was always first oars with the fine city ladies Immense cheering The soft sex to a man he begged pardon to a female rallied round the young waterman and turned with disgust from the drinker of spirits cheers The Brick Lane Branch brothers were watermen cheers and laughter That room was their boat that audience were the maidens and he mister Anthony Humm however unworthily was first oars unbounded applause Wot does he mean by the soft sex Sammy inquired mister Weller in a whisper The womin said Sam in the same tone He ain t far out there Sammy replied mister Weller they MUST be a soft sex a wery soft sex indeed if they let themselves be gammoned by such fellers as him Any further observations from the indignant old gentleman were cut short by the announcement of the song which mister Anthony Humm gave out two lines at a time for the information of such of his hearers as were unacquainted with the legend While it was being sung the little man with the drab shorts disappeared he returned immediately on its conclusion and whispered mister Anthony Humm with a face of the deepest importance My friends said mister Humm holding up his hand in a deprecatory manner to bespeak the silence of such of the stout old ladies as were yet a line or two behind my friends a delegate from the Dorking Branch of our society Brother Stiggins attends below Out came the pocket handkerchiefs again in greater force than ever for mister Stiggins was excessively popular among the female constituency of Brick Lane He may approach I think said mister Humm looking round him with a fat smile Brother Tadger let him come forth and greet us The little man in the drab shorts who answered to the name of Brother Tadger bustled down the ladder with great speed and was immediately afterwards heard tumbling up with the Reverend mister Stiggins He s a comin Sammy whispered mister Weller purple in the countenance with suppressed laughter Don t say nothin to me replied Sam for I can t bear it He s close to the door I hear him a knockin his head again the lath and plaster now As Sam Weller spoke the little door flew open and Brother Tadger appeared closely followed by the Reverend mister Stiggins who no sooner entered than there was a great clapping of hands and stamping of feet and flourishing of handkerchiefs to all of which manifestations of delight Brother Stiggins returned no other acknowledgment than staring with a wild eye and a fixed smile at the extreme top of the wick of the candle on the table swaying his body to and fro meanwhile in a very unsteady and uncertain manner Are you unwell Brother Stiggins whispered mister Anthony Humm I am all right Sir replied mister Stiggins in a tone in which ferocity was blended with an extreme thickness of utterance I am all right Sir Oh very well rejoined mister Anthony Humm retreating a few paces I believe no man here has ventured to say that I am not all right Sir said mister Stiggins Oh certainly not said mister Humm I should advise him not to Sir I should advise him not said mister Stiggins By this time the audience were perfectly silent and waited with some anxiety for the resumption of business Will you address the meeting brother said mister Humm with a smile of invitation No sir rejoined mister Stiggins No sir I will not sir The meeting looked at each other with raised eyelids and a murmur of astonishment ran through the room It s my opinion sir said mister Stiggins unbuttoning his coat and speaking very loudly it s my opinion sir that this meeting is drunk sir Brother Tadger sir said mister Stiggins suddenly increasing in ferocity and turning sharp round on the little man in the drab shorts YOU are drunk sir With this mister Stiggins entertaining a praiseworthy desire to promote the sobriety of the meeting and to exclude therefrom all improper characters hit Brother Tadger on the summit of the nose with such unerring aim that the drab shorts disappeared like a flash of lightning Brother Tadger had been knocked head first down the ladder Upon this the women set up a loud and dismal screaming and rushing in small parties before their favourite brothers flung their arms around them to preserve them from danger An instance of affection which had nearly proved fatal to Humm who being extremely popular was all but suffocated by the crowd of female devotees that hung about his neck and heaped caresses upon him The greater part of the lights were quickly put out and nothing but noise and confusion resounded on all sides Now Sammy said mister Weller taking off his greatcoat with much deliberation just you step out and fetch in a watchman And wot are you a goin to do the while inquired Sam Never you mind me Sammy replied the old gentleman I shall ockipy myself in havin a small settlement with that ere Stiggins Before Sam could interfere to prevent it his heroic parent had penetrated into a remote corner of the room and attacked the Reverend mister Stiggins with manual dexterity Come off said Sam Come on cried mister Weller and without further invitation he gave the Reverend mister Stiggins a preliminary tap on the head and began dancing round him in a buoyant and cork like manner which in a gentleman at his time of life was a perfect marvel to behold Finding all remonstrances unavailing Sam pulled his hat firmly on threw his father s coat over his arm and taking the old man round the waist forcibly dragged him down the ladder and into the street never releasing his hold or permitting him to stop until they reached the corner As they gained it they could hear the shouts of the populace who were witnessing the removal of the Reverend mister Stiggins to strong lodgings for the night and could hear the noise occasioned by the dispersion in various directions of the members of the Brick Lane Branch of the United Grand Junction Ebenezer Temperance Association CHAPTER XXXIV IS WHOLLY DEVOTED TO A FULL AND FAITHFUL REPORT OF THE MEMORABLE TRIAL OF BARDELL AGAINST PICKWICK I wonder what the foreman of the jury whoever he ll be has got for breakfast said mister Snodgrass by way of keeping up a conversation on the eventful morning of the fourteenth of February Ah said Perker I hope he s got a good one Why so inquired mister Pickwick Highly important very important my dear Sir replied Perker A good contented well breakfasted juryman is a capital thing to get hold of Discontented or hungry jurymen my dear sir always find for the plaintiff Bless my heart said mister Pickwick looking very blank what do they do that for Why I don t know replied the little man coolly saves time I suppose If it s near dinner time the foreman takes out his watch when the jury has retired and says Dear me gentlemen ten minutes to five I declare I dine at five gentlemen So do I says everybody else except two men who ought to have dined at three and seem more than half disposed to stand out in consequence The foreman smiles and puts up his watch Well gentlemen what do we say plaintiff or defendant gentlemen I rather think so far as I am concerned gentlemen I say I rather think but don t let that influence you I RATHER think the plaintiff s the man Upon this two or three other men are sure to say that they think so too as of course they do and then they get on very unanimously and comfortably Ten minutes past nine said the little man looking at his watch Time we were off my dear sir breach of promise trial court is generally full in such cases You had better ring for a coach my dear sir or we shall be rather late mister Pickwick immediately rang the bell and a coach having been procured the four Pickwickians and mister Perker ensconced themselves therein and drove to Guildhall Sam Weller mister Lowten and the blue bag following in a cab Lowten said Perker when they reached the outer hall of the court put mister Pickwick s friends in the students box mister Pickwick himself had better sit by me This way my dear sir this way Taking mister Pickwick by the coat sleeve the little man led him to the low seat just beneath the desks of the King s Counsel which is constructed for the convenience of attorneys who from that spot can whisper into the ear of the leading counsel in the case any instructions that may be necessary during the progress of the trial The occupants of this seat are invisible to the great body of spectators inasmuch as they sit on a much lower level than either the barristers or the audience whose seats are raised above the floor Of course they have their backs to both and their faces towards the judge That s the witness box I suppose said mister Pickwick pointing to a kind of pulpit with a brass rail on his left hand That s the witness box my dear sir replied Perker disinterring a quantity of papers from the blue bag which Lowten had just deposited at his feet And that said mister Pickwick pointing to a couple of enclosed seats on his right that s where the jurymen sit is it not The identical place my dear Sir replied Perker tapping the lid of his snuff box mister Pickwick stood up in a state of great agitation and took a glance at the court There were already a pretty large sprinkling of spectators in the gallery and a numerous muster of gentlemen in wigs in the barristers seats who presented as a body all that pleasing and extensive variety of nose and whisker for which the Bar of England is so justly celebrated Such of the gentlemen as had a brief to carry carried it in as conspicuous a manner as possible and occasionally scratched their noses therewith to impress the fact more strongly on the observation of the spectators Other gentlemen who had no briefs to show carried under their arms goodly octavos with a red label behind and that under done pie crust coloured cover which is technically known as law calf Others who had neither briefs nor books thrust their hands into their pockets and looked as wise as they conveniently could others again moved here and there with great restlessness and earnestness of manner content to awaken thereby the admiration and astonishment of the uninitiated strangers The whole to the great wonderment of mister Pickwick were divided into little groups who were chatting and discussing the news of the day in the most unfeeling manner possible just as if no trial at all were coming on A bow from mister Phunky as he entered and took his seat behind the row appropriated to the King s Counsel attracted mister Pickwick s attention and he had scarcely returned it when mister Serjeant Snubbin appeared followed by mister Mallard who half hid the Serjeant behind a large crimson bag which he placed on his table and after shaking hands with Perker withdrew Then there entered two or three more Serjeants and among them one with a fat body and a red face who nodded in a friendly manner to mister Serjeant Snubbin and said it was a fine morning Who s that red faced man who said it was a fine morning and nodded to our counsel whispered mister Pickwick mister Serjeant Buzfuz replied Perker He s opposed to us he leads on the other side That gentleman behind him is mister Skimpin his junior mister Pickwick was on the point of inquiring with great abhorrence of the man s cold blooded villainy how mister Serjeant Buzfuz who was counsel for the opposite party dared to presume to tell mister Serjeant Snubbin who was counsel for him that it was a fine morning when he was interrupted by a general rising of the barristers and a loud cry of Silence from the officers of the court Looking round he found that this was caused by the entrance of the judge mister Justice Stareleigh who sat in the absence of the Chief Justice occasioned by indisposition was a most particularly short man and so fat that he seemed all face and waistcoat He rolled in upon two little turned legs and having bobbed gravely to the Bar who bobbed gravely to him put his little legs underneath his table and his little three cornered hat upon it and when mister Justice Stareleigh had done this all you could see of him was two queer little eyes one broad pink face and somewhere about half of a big and very comical looking wig The judge had no sooner taken his seat than the officer on the floor of the court called out Silence in a commanding tone upon which another officer in the gallery cried Silence in an angry manner whereupon three or four more ushers shouted Silence in a voice of indignant remonstrance This being done a gentleman in black who sat below the judge proceeded to call over the names of the jury and after a great deal of bawling it was discovered that only ten special jurymen were present Upon this mister Serjeant Buzfuz prayed a TALES the gentleman in black then proceeded to press into the special jury two of the common jurymen and a greengrocer and a chemist were caught directly Answer to your names gentlemen that you may be sworn said the gentleman in black Richard Upwitch Here said the greengrocer Thomas Groffin Here said the chemist Take the book gentlemen You shall well and truly try I beg this court s pardon said the chemist who was a tall thin yellow visaged man but I hope this court will excuse my attendance On what grounds Sir said mister Justice Stareleigh I have no assistant my Lord said the chemist I can t help that Sir replied mister Justice Stareleigh You should hire one I can t afford it my Lord rejoined the chemist Then you ought to be able to afford it Sir said the judge reddening for mister Justice Stareleigh s temper bordered on the irritable and brooked not contradiction I know I OUGHT to do if I got on as well as I deserved but I don t my Lord answered the chemist Swear the gentleman said the judge peremptorily The officer had got no further than the You shall well and truly try when he was again interrupted by the chemist I am to be sworn my Lord am I said the chemist Certainly sir replied the testy little judge Very well my Lord replied the chemist in a resigned manner Then there ll be murder before this trial s over that s all Swear me if you please Sir and sworn the chemist was before the judge could find words to utter I merely wanted to observe my Lord said the chemist taking his seat with great deliberation that I ve left nobody but an errand boy in my shop He is a very nice boy my Lord but he is not acquainted with drugs and I know that the prevailing impression on his mind is that Epsom salts means oxalic acid and syrup of senna laudanum That s all my Lord With this the tall chemist composed himself into a comfortable attitude and assuming a pleasant expression of countenance appeared to have prepared himself for the worst mister Pickwick was regarding the chemist with feelings of the deepest horror when a slight sensation was perceptible in the body of the court and immediately afterwards missus Bardell supported by missus Cluppins was led in and placed in a drooping state at the other end of the seat on which mister Pickwick sat An extra sized umbrella was then handed in by mister Dodson and a pair of pattens by mister Fogg each of whom had prepared a most sympathising and melancholy face for the occasion missus Sanders then appeared leading in Master Bardell At sight of her child missus Bardell started suddenly recollecting herself she kissed him in a frantic manner then relapsing into a state of hysterical imbecility the good lady requested to be informed where she was In reply to this missus Cluppins and missus Sanders turned their heads away and wept while Messrs Dodson and Fogg entreated the plaintiff to compose herself Serjeant Buzfuz rubbed his eyes very hard with a large white handkerchief and gave an appealing look towards the jury while the judge was visibly affected and several of the beholders tried to cough down their emotion Very good notion that indeed whispered Perker to mister Pickwick Capital fellows those Dodson and Fogg excellent ideas of effect my dear Sir excellent As Perker spoke missus Bardell began to recover by slow degrees while missus Cluppins after a careful survey of Master Bardell s buttons and the button holes to which they severally belonged placed him on the floor of the court in front of his mother a commanding position in which he could not fail to awaken the full commiseration and sympathy of both judge and jury This was not done without considerable opposition and many tears on the part of the young gentleman himself who had certain inward misgivings that the placing him within the full glare of the judge s eye was only a formal prelude to his being immediately ordered away for instant execution or for transportation beyond the seas during the whole term of his natural life at the very least Bardell and Pickwick cried the gentleman in black calling on the case which stood first on the list I am for the plaintiff my Lord said mister Serjeant Buzfuz Who is with you Brother Buzfuz said the judge mister Skimpin bowed to intimate that he was I appear for the defendant my Lord said mister Serjeant Snubbin Anybody with you Brother Snubbin inquired the court mister Phunky my Lord replied Serjeant Snubbin Serjeant Buzfuz and mister Skimpin for the plaintiff said the judge writing down the names in his note book and reading as he wrote for the defendant Serjeant Snubbin and mister Monkey Beg your Lordship s pardon Phunky Oh very good said the judge I never had the pleasure of hearing the gentleman s name before Here mister Phunky bowed and smiled and the judge bowed and smiled too and then mister Phunky blushing into the very whites of his eyes tried to look as if he didn t know that everybody was gazing at him a thing which no man ever succeeded in doing yet or in all reasonable probability ever will Go on said the judge The ushers again called silence and mister Skimpin proceeded to open the case and the case appeared to have very little inside it when he had opened it for he kept such particulars as he knew completely to himself and sat down after a lapse of three minutes leaving the jury in precisely the same advanced stage of wisdom as they were in before Serjeant Buzfuz then rose with all the majesty and dignity which the grave nature of the proceedings demanded and having whispered to Dodson and conferred briefly with Fogg pulled his gown over his shoulders settled his wig and addressed the jury Serjeant Buzfuz began by saying that never in the whole course of his professional experience never from the very first moment of his applying himself to the study and practice of the law had he approached a case with feelings of such deep emotion or with such a heavy sense of the responsibility imposed upon him a responsibility he would say which he could never have supported were he not buoyed up and sustained by a conviction so strong that it amounted to positive certainty that the cause of truth and justice or in other words the cause of his much injured and most oppressed client must prevail with the high minded and intelligent dozen of men whom he now saw in that box before him Counsel usually begin in this way because it puts the jury on the very best terms with themselves and makes them think what sharp fellows they must be A visible effect was produced immediately several jurymen beginning to take voluminous notes with the utmost eagerness You have heard from my learned friend gentlemen continued Serjeant Buzfuz well knowing that from the learned friend alluded to the gentlemen of the jury had heard just nothing at all you have heard from my learned friend gentlemen that this is an action for a breach of promise of marriage in which the damages are laid at fifteen hundred But you have not heard from my learned friend inasmuch as it did not come within my learned friend s province to tell you what are the facts and circumstances of the case Those facts and circumstances gentlemen you shall hear detailed by me and proved by the unimpeachable female whom I will place in that box before you Here mister Serjeant Buzfuz with a tremendous emphasis on the word box smote his table with a mighty sound and glanced at Dodson and Fogg who nodded admiration of the Serjeant and indignant defiance of the defendant The plaintiff gentlemen continued Serjeant Buzfuz in a soft and melancholy voice the plaintiff is a widow yes gentlemen a widow The late mister Bardell after enjoying for many years the esteem and confidence of his sovereign as one of the guardians of his royal revenues glided almost imperceptibly from the world to seek elsewhere for that repose and peace which a custom house can never afford At this pathetic description of the decease of mister Bardell who had been knocked on the head with a quart pot in a public house cellar the learned serjeant s voice faltered and he proceeded with emotion Some time before his death he had stamped his likeness upon a little boy With this little boy the only pledge of her departed exciseman missus Bardell shrank from the world and courted the retirement and tranquillity of Goswell Street and here she placed in her front parlour window a written placard bearing this inscription Apartments furnished for a single gentleman Inquire within Here Serjeant Buzfuz paused while several gentlemen of the jury took a note of the document There is no date to that is there inquired a juror There is no date gentlemen replied Serjeant Buzfuz but I am instructed to say that it was put in the plaintiff s parlour window just this time three years I entreat the attention of the jury to the wording of this document Apartments furnished for a single gentleman missus Bardell s opinions of the opposite sex gentlemen were derived from a long contemplation of the inestimable qualities of her lost husband She had no fear she had no distrust she had no suspicion all was confidence and reliance mister Bardell said the widow mister Bardell was a man of honour mister Bardell was a man of his word mister Bardell was no deceiver mister Bardell was once a single gentleman himself to single gentlemen I look for protection for assistance for comfort and for consolation in single gentlemen I shall perpetually see something to remind me of what mister Bardell was when he first won my young and untried affections to a single gentleman then shall my lodgings be let Actuated by this beautiful and touching impulse among the best impulses of our imperfect nature gentlemen the lonely and desolate widow dried her tears furnished her first floor caught her innocent boy to her maternal bosom and put the bill up in her parlour window Did it remain there long No The serpent was on the watch the train was laid the mine was preparing the sapper and miner was at work Before the bill had been in the parlour window three days three days gentlemen a being erect upon two legs and bearing all the outward semblance of a man and not of a monster knocked at the door of missus Bardell s house He inquired within he took the lodgings and on the very next day he entered into possession of them This man was Pickwick Pickwick the defendant Serjeant Buzfuz who had proceeded with such volubility that his face was perfectly crimson here paused for breath The silence awoke mister Justice Stareleigh who immediately wrote down something with a pen without any ink in it and looked unusually profound to impress the jury with the belief that he always thought most deeply with his eyes shut Serjeant Buzfuz proceeded Of this man Pickwick I will say little the subject presents but few attractions and I gentlemen am not the man nor are you gentlemen the men to delight in the contemplation of revolting heartlessness and of systematic villainy Here mister Pickwick who had been writhing in silence for some time gave a violent start as if some vague idea of assaulting Serjeant Buzfuz in the august presence of justice and law suggested itself to his mind An admonitory gesture from Perker restrained him and he listened to the learned gentleman s continuation with a look of indignation which contrasted forcibly with the admiring faces of missus Cluppins and missus Sanders I say systematic villainy gentlemen said Serjeant Buzfuz looking through mister Pickwick and talking AT him and when I say systematic villainy let me tell the defendant Pickwick if he be in court as I am informed he is that it would have been more decent in him more becoming in better judgment and in better taste if he had stopped away Let me tell him gentlemen that any gestures of dissent or disapprobation in which he may indulge in this court will not go down with you that you will know how to value and how to appreciate them and let me tell him further as my Lord will tell you gentlemen that a counsel in the discharge of his duty to his client is neither to be intimidated nor bullied nor put down and that any attempt to do either the one or the other or the first or the last will recoil on the head of the attempter be he plaintiff or be he defendant be his name Pickwick or Noakes or Stoakes or Stiles or Brown or Thompson This little divergence from the subject in hand had of course the intended effect of turning all eyes to mister Pickwick Serjeant Buzfuz having partially recovered from the state of moral elevation into which he had lashed himself resumed I shall show you gentlemen that for two years Pickwick continued to reside constantly and without interruption or intermission at missus Bardell s house I shall show you that missus Bardell during the whole of that time waited on him attended to his comforts cooked his meals looked out his linen for the washerwoman when it went abroad darned aired and prepared it for wear when it came home and in short enjoyed his fullest trust and confidence I shall show you that on many occasions he gave halfpence and on some occasions even sixpences to her little boy and I shall prove to you by a witness whose testimony it will be impossible for my learned friend to weaken or controvert that on one occasion he patted the boy on the head and after inquiring whether he had won any ALLEY TORS or COMMONEYS lately both of which I understand to be a particular species of marbles much prized by the youth of this town made use of this remarkable expression How should you like to have another father I shall prove to you gentlemen that about a year ago Pickwick suddenly began to absent himself from home during long intervals as if with the intention of gradually breaking off from my client but I shall show you also that his resolution was not at that time sufficiently strong or that his better feelings conquered if better feelings he has or that the charms and accomplishments of my client prevailed against his unmanly intentions by proving to you that on one occasion when he returned from the country he distinctly and in terms offered her marriage previously however taking special care that there would be no witness to their solemn contract and I am in a situation to prove to you on the testimony of three of his own friends most unwilling witnesses gentlemen most unwilling witnesses that on that morning he was discovered by them holding the plaintiff in his arms and soothing her agitation by his caresses and endearments A visible impression was produced upon the auditors by this part of the learned Serjeant s address Drawing forth two very small scraps of paper he proceeded And now gentlemen but one word more Two letters have passed between these parties letters which are admitted to be in the handwriting of the defendant and which speak volumes indeed The letters too bespeak the character of the man They are not open fervent eloquent epistles breathing nothing but the language of affectionate attachment They are covert sly underhanded communications but fortunately far more conclusive than if couched in the most glowing language and the most poetic imagery letters that must be viewed with a cautious and suspicious eye letters that were evidently intended at the time by Pickwick to mislead and delude any third parties into whose hands they might fall Let me read the first Garraways twelve o clock Dear missus B Chops and tomato sauce Yours PICKWICK Gentlemen what does this mean Chops and tomato sauce Yours Pickwick Chops Gracious heavens and tomato sauce Gentlemen is the happiness of a sensitive and confiding female to be trifled away by such shallow artifices as these The next has no date whatever which is in itself suspicious Dear missus B I shall not be at home till to morrow Slow coach And then follows this very remarkable expression Don t trouble yourself about the warming pan The warming pan Why gentlemen who DOES trouble himself about a warming pan When was the peace of mind of man or woman broken or disturbed by a warming pan which is in itself a harmless a useful and I will add gentlemen a comforting article of domestic furniture Why is missus Bardell so earnestly entreated not to agitate herself about this warming pan unless as is no doubt the case it is a mere cover for hidden fire a mere substitute for some endearing word or promise agreeably to a preconcerted system of correspondence artfully contrived by Pickwick with a view to his contemplated desertion and which I am not in a condition to explain And what does this allusion to the slow coach mean For aught I know it may be a reference to Pickwick himself who has most unquestionably been a criminally slow coach during the whole of this transaction but whose speed will now be very unexpectedly accelerated and whose wheels gentlemen as he will find to his cost will very soon be greased by you mister Serjeant Buzfuz paused in this place to see whether the jury smiled at his joke but as nobody took it but the greengrocer whose sensitiveness on the subject was very probably occasioned by his having subjected a chaise cart to the process in question on that identical morning the learned Serjeant considered it advisable to undergo a slight relapse into the dismals before he concluded But enough of this gentlemen said mister Serjeant Buzfuz it is difficult to smile with an aching heart it is ill jesting when our deepest sympathies are awakened My client s hopes and prospects are ruined and it is no figure of speech to say that her occupation is gone indeed The bill is down but there is no tenant Eligible single gentlemen pass and repass but there is no invitation for to inquire within or without All is gloom and silence in the house even the voice of the child is hushed his infant sports are disregarded when his mother weeps his alley tors and his commoneys are alike neglected he forgets the long familiar cry of knuckle down and at tip cheese or odd and even his hand is out But Pickwick gentlemen Pickwick the ruthless destroyer of this domestic oasis in the desert of Goswell Street Pickwick who has choked up the well and thrown ashes on the sward Pickwick who comes before you to day with his heartless tomato sauce and warming pans Pickwick still rears his head with unblushing effrontery and gazes without a sigh on the ruin he has made Damages gentlemen heavy damages is the only punishment with which you can visit him the only recompense you can award to my client And for those damages she now appeals to an enlightened a high minded a right feeling a conscientious a dispassionate a sympathising a contemplative jury of her civilised countrymen With this beautiful peroration mister Serjeant Buzfuz sat down and mister Justice Stareleigh woke up Call Elizabeth Cluppins said Serjeant Buzfuz rising a minute afterwards with renewed vigour The nearest usher called for Elizabeth Tuppins another one at a little distance off demanded Elizabeth Jupkins and a third rushed in a breathless state into King Street and screamed for Elizabeth Muffins till he was hoarse Meanwhile missus Cluppins with the combined assistance of missus Bardell missus Sanders mister Dodson and mister Fogg was hoisted into the witness box and when she was safely perched on the top step missus Bardell stood on the bottom one with the pocket handkerchief and pattens in one hand and a glass bottle that might hold about a quarter of a pint of smelling salts in the other ready for any emergency missus Sanders whose eyes were intently fixed on the judge s face planted herself close by with the large umbrella keeping her right thumb pressed on the spring with an earnest countenance as if she were fully prepared to put it up at a moment s notice missus Cluppins said Serjeant Buzfuz pray compose yourself ma am Of course directly missus Cluppins was desired to compose herself she sobbed with increased vehemence and gave divers alarming manifestations of an approaching fainting fit or as she afterwards said of her feelings being too many for her Do you recollect missus Cluppins said Serjeant Buzfuz after a few unimportant questions do you recollect being in missus Bardell s back one pair of stairs on one particular morning in July last when she was dusting Pickwick s apartment Yes my Lord and jury I do replied missus Cluppins mister Pickwick s sitting room was the first floor front I believe Yes it were Sir replied missus Cluppins What were you doing in the back room ma am inquired the little judge My Lord and jury said missus Cluppins with interesting agitation I will not deceive you You had better not ma am said the little judge I was there resumed missus Cluppins unbeknown to missus Bardell I had been out with a little basket gentlemen to buy three pound of red kidney pertaties which was three pound tuppence ha penny when I see missus Bardell s street door on the jar On the what exclaimed the little judge Partly open my Lord said Serjeant Snubbin She said on the jar said the little judge with a cunning look It s all the same my Lord said Serjeant Snubbin The little judge looked doubtful and said he d make a note of it missus Cluppins then resumed I walked in gentlemen just to say good mornin and went in a permiscuous manner upstairs and into the back room Gentlemen there was the sound of voices in the front room and And you listened I believe missus Cluppins said Serjeant Buzfuz Beggin your pardon Sir replied missus Cluppins in a majestic manner I would scorn the haction The voices was very loud Sir and forced themselves upon my ear Well missus Cluppins you were not listening but you heard the voices Was one of those voices Pickwick s Yes it were Sir And missus Cluppins after distinctly stating that mister Pickwick addressed himself to missus Bardell repeated by slow degrees and by dint of many questions the conversation with which our readers are already acquainted The jury looked suspicious and mister Serjeant Buzfuz smiled as he sat down They looked positively awful when Serjeant Snubbin intimated that he should not cross examine the witness for mister Pickwick wished it to be distinctly stated that it was due to her to say that her account was in substance correct missus Cluppins having once broken the ice thought it a favourable opportunity for entering into a short dissertation on her own domestic affairs so she straightway proceeded to inform the court that she was the mother of eight children at that present speaking and that she entertained confident expectations of presenting mister Cluppins with a ninth somewhere about that day six months At this interesting point the little judge interposed most irascibly and the effect of the interposition was that both the worthy lady and missus Sanders were politely taken out of court under the escort of mister Jackson without further parley Nathaniel Winkle said mister Skimpin Here replied a feeble voice mister Winkle entered the witness box and having been duly sworn bowed to the judge with considerable deference Don t look at me Sir said the judge sharply in acknowledgment of the salute look at the jury mister Winkle obeyed the mandate and looked at the place where he thought it most probable the jury might be for seeing anything in his then state of intellectual complication was wholly out of the question mister Winkle was then examined by mister Skimpin who being a promising young man of two or three and forty was of course anxious to confuse a witness who was notoriously predisposed in favour of the other side as much as he could Now Sir said mister Skimpin have the goodness to let his Lordship know what your name is will you and mister Skimpin inclined his head on one side to listen with great sharpness to the answer and glanced at the jury meanwhile as if to imply that he rather expected mister Winkle s natural taste for perjury would induce him to give some name which did not belong to him Winkle replied the witness What s your Christian name Sir angrily inquired the little judge Nathaniel Sir Daniel any other name Nathaniel sir my Lord I mean Nathaniel Daniel or Daniel Nathaniel No my Lord only Nathaniel not Daniel at all What did you tell me it was Daniel for then sir inquired the judge I didn t my Lord replied mister Winkle You did Sir replied the judge with a severe frown How could I have got Daniel on my notes unless you told me so Sir This argument was of course unanswerable mister Winkle has rather a short memory my Lord interposed mister Skimpin with another glance at the jury We shall find means to refresh it before we have quite done with him I dare say You had better be careful Sir said the little judge with a sinister look at the witness Poor mister Winkle bowed and endeavoured to feign an easiness of manner which in his then state of confusion gave him rather the air of a disconcerted pickpocket Now mister Winkle said mister Skimpin attend to me if you please Sir and let me recommend you for your own sake to bear in mind his Lordship s injunctions to be careful I believe you are a particular friend of mister Pickwick the defendant are you not I have known mister Pickwick now as well as I recollect at this moment nearly Pray mister Winkle do not evade the question Are you or are you not a particular friend of the defendant s I was just about to say that Will you or will you not answer my question Sir If you don t answer the question you ll be committed Sir interposed the little judge looking over his note book Come Sir said mister Skimpin yes or no if you please Yes I am replied mister Winkle Yes you are And why couldn t you say that at once Sir Perhaps you know the plaintiff too Eh mister Winkle I don t know her I ve seen her Oh you don t know her but you ve seen her Now have the goodness to tell the gentlemen of the jury what you mean by that mister Winkle I mean that I am not intimate with her but I have seen her when I went to call on mister Pickwick in Goswell Street How often have you seen her Sir How often Yes mister Winkle how often I ll repeat the question for you a dozen times if you require it Sir And the learned gentleman with a firm and steady frown placed his hands on his hips and smiled suspiciously to the jury On this question there arose the edifying brow beating customary on such points First of all mister Winkle said it was quite impossible for him to say how many times he had seen missus Bardell Then he was asked if he had seen her twenty times to which he replied Certainly more than that Then he was asked whether he hadn t seen her a hundred times whether he couldn t swear that he had seen her more than fifty times whether he didn t know that he had seen her at least seventy five times and so forth the satisfactory conclusion which was arrived at at last being that he had better take care of himself and mind what he was about The witness having been by these means reduced to the requisite ebb of nervous perplexity the examination was continued as follows Pray mister Winkle do you remember calling on the defendant Pickwick at these apartments in the plaintiff s house in Goswell Street on one particular morning in the month of July last Yes I do Were you accompanied on that occasion by a friend of the name of Tupman and another by the name of Snodgrass Yes I was Are they here Yes they are replied mister Winkle looking very earnestly towards the spot where his friends were stationed Pray attend to me mister Winkle and never mind your friends said mister Skimpin with another expressive look at the jury They must tell their stories without any previous consultation with you if none has yet taken place another look at the jury Now Sir tell the gentlemen of the jury what you saw on entering the defendant s room on this particular morning Come out with it Sir we must have it sooner or later The defendant mister Pickwick was holding the plaintiff in his arms with his hands clasping her waist replied mister Winkle with natural hesitation and the plaintiff appeared to have fainted away Did you hear the defendant say anything I heard him call missus Bardell a good creature and I heard him ask her to compose herself for what a situation it was if anybody should come or words to that effect Now mister Winkle I have only one more question to ask you and I beg you to bear in mind his Lordship s caution Will you undertake to swear that Pickwick the defendant did not say on the occasion in question My dear missus Bardell you re a good creature compose yourself to this situation for to this situation you must come or words to that effect I I didn t understand him so certainly said mister Winkle astounded on this ingenious dove tailing of the few words he had heard I was on the staircase and couldn t hear distinctly the impression on my mind is The gentlemen of the jury want none of the impressions on your mind mister Winkle which I fear would be of little service to honest straightforward men interposed mister Skimpin You were on the staircase and didn t distinctly hear but you will not swear that Pickwick did not make use of the expressions I have quoted Do I understand that No I will not replied mister Winkle and down sat mister Skimpin with a triumphant countenance mister Pickwick s case had not gone off in so particularly happy a manner up to this point that it could very well afford to have any additional suspicion cast upon it But as it could afford to be placed in a rather better light if possible mister Phunky rose for the purpose of getting something important out of mister Winkle in cross examination Whether he did get anything important out of him will immediately appear I believe mister Winkle said mister Phunky that mister Pickwick is not a young man Oh no replied mister Winkle old enough to be my father You have told my learned friend that you have known mister Pickwick a long time Had you ever any reason to suppose or believe that he was about to be married Oh no certainly not replied mister Winkle with so much eagerness that mister Phunky ought to have got him out of the box with all possible dispatch Lawyers hold that there are two kinds of particularly bad witnesses a reluctant witness and a too willing witness it was mister Winkle s fate to figure in both characters I will even go further than this mister Winkle continued mister Phunky in a most smooth and complacent manner Did you ever see anything in mister Pickwick s manner and conduct towards the opposite sex to induce you to believe that he ever contemplated matrimony of late years in any case Oh no certainly not replied mister Winkle Has his behaviour when females have been in the case always been that of a man who having attained a pretty advanced period of life content with his own occupations and amusements treats them only as a father might his daughters Not the least doubt of it replied mister Winkle in the fulness of his heart That is yes oh yes certainly You have never known anything in his behaviour towards missus Bardell or any other female in the least degree suspicious said mister Phunky preparing to sit down for Serjeant Snubbin was winking at him N n no replied mister Winkle except on one trifling occasion which I have no doubt might be easily explained Now if the unfortunate mister Phunky had sat down when Serjeant Snubbin had winked at him or if Serjeant Buzfuz had stopped this irregular cross examination at the outset which he knew better than to do observing mister Winkle s anxiety and well knowing it would in all probability lead to something serviceable to him this unfortunate admission would not have been elicited The moment the words fell from mister Winkle s lips mister Phunky sat down and Serjeant Snubbin rather hastily told him he might leave the box which mister Winkle prepared to do with great readiness when Serjeant Buzfuz stopped him Stay mister Winkle stay said Serjeant Buzfuz will your Lordship have the goodness to ask him what this one instance of suspicious behaviour towards females on the part of this gentleman who is old enough to be his father was You hear what the learned counsel says Sir observed the judge turning to the miserable and agonised mister Winkle Describe the occasion to which you refer My Lord said mister Winkle trembling with anxiety I I d rather not Perhaps so said the little judge but you must Amid the profound silence of the whole court mister Winkle faltered out that the trifling circumstance of suspicion was mister Pickwick s being found in a lady s sleeping apartment at midnight which had terminated he believed in the breaking off of the projected marriage of the lady in question and had led he knew to the whole party being forcibly carried before George Nupkins esquire magistrate and justice of the peace for the borough of Ipswich You may leave the box Sir said Serjeant Snubbin mister Winkle did leave the box and rushed with delirious haste to the George and Vulture where he was discovered some hours after by the waiter groaning in a hollow and dismal manner with his head buried beneath the sofa cushions Tracy Tupman and Augustus Snodgrass were severally called into the box both corroborated the testimony of their unhappy friend and each was driven to the verge of desperation by excessive badgering Susannah Sanders was then called and examined by Serjeant Buzfuz and cross examined by Serjeant Snubbin Had always said and believed that Pickwick would marry missus Bardell knew that missus Bardell s being engaged to Pickwick was the current topic of conversation in the neighbourhood after the fainting in July had been told it herself by missus Mudberry which kept a mangle and missus Bunkin which clear starched but did not see either missus Mudberry or missus Bunkin in court Had heard Pickwick ask the little boy how he should like to have another father Did not know that missus Bardell was at that time keeping company with the baker but did know that the baker was then a single man and is now married Couldn t swear that missus Bardell was not very fond of the baker but should think that the baker was not very fond of missus Bardell or he wouldn t have married somebody else Thought missus Bardell fainted away on the morning in July because Pickwick asked her to name the day knew that she witness fainted away stone dead when mister Sanders asked her to name the day and believed that everybody as called herself a lady would do the same under similar circumstances Heard Pickwick ask the boy the question about the marbles but upon her oath did not know the difference between an alley tor and a commoney By the COURT During the period of her keeping company with mister Sanders had received love letters like other ladies In the course of their correspondence mister Sanders had often called her a duck but never chops nor yet tomato sauce He was particularly fond of ducks Perhaps if he had been as fond of chops and tomato sauce he might have called her that as a term of affection Serjeant Buzfuz now rose with more importance than he had yet exhibited if that were possible and vociferated Call Samuel Weller It was quite unnecessary to call Samuel Weller for Samuel Weller stepped briskly into the box the instant his name was pronounced and placing his hat on the floor and his arms on the rail took a bird s eye view of the Bar and a comprehensive survey of the Bench with a remarkably cheerful and lively aspect What s your name sir inquired the judge Sam Weller my Lord replied that gentleman Do you spell it with a V or a W inquired the judge That depends upon the taste and fancy of the speller my Lord replied Sam I never had occasion to spell it more than once or twice in my life but I spells it with a V Here a voice in the gallery exclaimed aloud Quite right too Samivel quite right Put it down a we my Lord put it down a we Who is that who dares address the court said the little judge looking up Usher Yes my Lord Bring that person here instantly Yes my Lord But as the usher didn t find the person he didn t bring him and after a great commotion all the people who had got up to look for the culprit sat down again The little judge turned to the witness as soon as his indignation would allow him to speak and said Do you know who that was sir I rayther suspect it was my father my lord replied Sam Do you see him here now said the judge No I don t my Lord replied Sam staring right up into the lantern at the roof of the court If you could have pointed him out I would have committed him instantly said the judge Sam bowed his acknowledgments and turned with unimpaired cheerfulness of countenance towards Serjeant Buzfuz Now mister Weller said Serjeant Buzfuz Now sir replied Sam I believe you are in the service of mister Pickwick the defendant in this case Speak up if you please mister Weller I mean to speak up Sir replied Sam I am in the service o that ere general l man and a wery good service it is Little to do and plenty to get I suppose said Serjeant Buzfuz with jocularity Oh quite enough to get Sir as the soldier said ven they ordered him three hundred and fifty lashes replied Sam You must not tell us what the soldier or any other man said Sir interposed the judge it s not evidence Wery good my Lord replied Sam Do you recollect anything particular happening on the morning when you were first engaged by the defendant eh mister Weller said Serjeant Buzfuz Yes I do sir replied Sam Have the goodness to tell the jury what it was I had a reg lar new fit out o clothes that mornin general l men of the jury said Sam and that was a wery partickler and uncommon circumstance vith me in those days Hereupon there was a general laugh and the little judge looking with an angry countenance over his desk said You had better be careful Sir So mister Pickwick said at the time my Lord replied Sam and I was wery careful o that ere suit o clothes wery careful indeed my Lord The judge looked sternly at Sam for full two minutes but Sam s features were so perfectly calm and serene that the judge said nothing and motioned Serjeant Buzfuz to proceed Do you mean to tell me mister Weller said Serjeant Buzfuz folding his arms emphatically and turning half round to the jury as if in mute assurance that he would bother the witness yet do you mean to tell me mister Weller that you saw nothing of this fainting on the part of the plaintiff in the arms of the defendant which you have heard described by the witnesses Certainly not replied Sam I was in the passage till they called me up and then the old lady was not there Now attend mister Weller said Serjeant Buzfuz dipping a large pen into the inkstand before him for the purpose of frightening Sam with a show of taking down his answer You were in the passage and yet saw nothing of what was going forward Have you a pair of eyes mister Weller Yes I have a pair of eyes replied Sam and that s just it If they wos a pair o patent double million magnifyin gas microscopes of hextra power p raps I might be able to see through a flight o stairs and a deal door but bein only eyes you see my wision s limited At this answer which was delivered without the slightest appearance of irritation and with the most complete simplicity and equanimity of manner the spectators tittered the little judge smiled and Serjeant Buzfuz looked particularly foolish After a short consultation with Dodson Fogg the learned Serjeant again turned towards Sam and said with a painful effort to conceal his vexation Now mister Weller I ll ask you a question on another point if you please If you please Sir rejoined Sam with the utmost good humour Do you remember going up to missus Bardell s house one night in November last Oh yes wery well Oh you do remember that mister Weller said Serjeant Buzfuz recovering his spirits I thought we should get at something at last I rayther thought that too sir replied Sam and at this the spectators tittered again Well I suppose you went up to have a little talk about this trial eh mister Weller said Serjeant Buzfuz looking knowingly at the jury I went up to pay the rent but we did get a talkin about the trial replied Sam Oh you did get a talking about the trial said Serjeant Buzfuz brightening up with the anticipation of some important discovery Now what passed about the trial will you have the goodness to tell us mister Weller Vith all the pleasure in life sir replied Sam Arter a few unimportant obserwations from the two wirtuous females as has been examined here to day the ladies gets into a very great state o admiration at the honourable conduct of mister Dodson and Fogg them two general l men as is settin near you now This of course drew general attention to Dodson Fogg who looked as virtuous as possible The attorneys for the plaintiff said mister Serjeant Buzfuz Well They spoke in high praise of the honourable conduct of Messrs Dodson and Fogg the attorneys for the plaintiff did they Yes said Sam they said what a wery general rous thing it was o them to have taken up the case on spec and to charge nothing at all for costs unless they got em out of mister Pickwick At this very unexpected reply the spectators tittered again and Dodson Fogg turning very red leaned over to Serjeant Buzfuz and in a hurried manner whispered something in his ear You are quite right said Serjeant Buzfuz aloud with affected composure It s perfectly useless my Lord attempting to get at any evidence through the impenetrable stupidity of this witness I will not trouble the court by asking him any more questions Stand down sir Would any other general l man like to ask me anythin inquired Sam taking up his hat and looking round most deliberately Not I mister Weller thank you said Serjeant Snubbin laughing You may go down sir said Serjeant Buzfuz waving his hand impatiently Sam went down accordingly after doing Messrs Dodson Fogg s case as much harm as he conveniently could and saying just as little respecting mister Pickwick as might be which was precisely the object he had had in view all along I have no objection to admit my Lord said Serjeant Snubbin if it will save the examination of another witness that mister Pickwick has retired from business and is a gentleman of considerable independent property Very well said Serjeant Buzfuz putting in the two letters to be read then that s my case my Lord Serjeant Snubbin then addressed the jury on behalf of the defendant and a very long and a very emphatic address he delivered in which he bestowed the highest possible eulogiums on the conduct and character of mister Pickwick but inasmuch as our readers are far better able to form a correct estimate of that gentleman s merits and deserts than Serjeant Snubbin could possibly be we do not feel called upon to enter at any length into the learned gentleman s observations He attempted to show that the letters which had been exhibited merely related to mister Pickwick s dinner or to the preparations for receiving him in his apartments on his return from some country excursion It is sufficient to add in general terms that he did the best he could for mister Pickwick and the best as everybody knows on the infallible authority of the old adage could do no more mister Justice Stareleigh summed up in the old established and most approved form He read as much of his notes to the jury as he could decipher on so short a notice and made running comments on the evidence as he went along If missus Bardell were right it was perfectly clear that mister Pickwick was wrong and if they thought the evidence of missus Cluppins worthy of credence they would believe it and if they didn t why they wouldn t If they were satisfied that a breach of promise of marriage had been committed they would find for the plaintiff with such damages as they thought proper and if on the other hand it appeared to them that no promise of marriage had ever been given they would find for the defendant with no damages at all The jury then retired to their private room to talk the matter over and the judge retired to HIS private room to refresh himself with a mutton chop and a glass of sherry An anxious quarter of a hour elapsed the jury came back the judge was fetched in mister Pickwick put on his spectacles and gazed at the foreman with an agitated countenance and a quickly beating heart Gentlemen said the individual in black are you all agreed upon your verdict We are replied the foreman Do you find for the plaintiff gentlemen or for the defendant For the plaintiff With what damages gentlemen Seven hundred and fifty pounds mister Pickwick took off his spectacles carefully wiped the glasses folded them into their case and put them in his pocket then having drawn on his gloves with great nicety and stared at the foreman all the while he mechanically followed mister Perker and the blue bag out of court They stopped in a side room while Perker paid the court fees and here mister Pickwick was joined by his friends Here too he encountered Messrs Dodson Fogg rubbing their hands with every token of outward satisfaction Well gentlemen said mister Pickwick Well Sir said Dodson for self and partner You imagine you ll get your costs don t you gentlemen said mister Pickwick Fogg said they thought it rather probable Dodson smiled and said they d try You may try and try and try again Messrs Dodson and Fogg said mister Pickwick vehemently but not one farthing of costs or damages do you ever get from me if I spend the rest of my existence in a debtor s prison Ha ha laughed Dodson You ll think better of that before next term mister Pickwick He he he We ll soon see about that mister Pickwick grinned Fogg Speechless with indignation mister Pickwick allowed himself to be led by his solicitor and friends to the door and there assisted into a hackney coach which had been fetched for the purpose by the ever watchful Sam Weller Sam had put up the steps and was preparing to jump upon the box when he felt himself gently touched on the shoulder and looking round his father stood before him The old gentleman s countenance wore a mournful expression as he shook his head gravely and said in warning accents I know d what ud come o this here mode o doin bisness Oh Sammy Sammy vy worn t there a alleybi CHAPTER XXXV IN WHICH mister PICKWICK THINKS HE HAD BETTER GO TO BATH AND GOES ACCORDINGLY But surely my dear sir said little Perker as he stood in mister Pickwick s apartment on the morning after the trial surely you don t really mean really and seriously now and irritation apart that you won t pay these costs and damages 
1750-135624-0000	train-other-500	Not one halfpenny said mister Pickwick firmly not one halfpenny Hooroar for the principle as the money lender said ven he vouldn t renew the bill observed mister Weller who was clearing away the breakfast things Sam said mister Pickwick
1750-135624-0001	train-other-500	have the goodness to step downstairs Cert nly sir replied mister Weller and acting on mister Pickwick s gentle hint Sam retired No Perker said mister Pickwick with great seriousness of manner
1750-135624-0002	train-other-500	my friends here have endeavoured to dissuade me from this determination but without avail I shall employ myself as usual until the opposite party have the power of issuing a legal process of execution against me and if they are vile enough to avail themselves of it and to arrest my person
1750-135624-0003	train-other-500	I shall yield myself up with perfect cheerfulness and content of heart When can they do this They can issue execution my dear Sir for the amount of the damages and taxed costs next term replied Perker just two months hence my dear sir
1750-135624-0004	train-other-500	Very good said mister Pickwick Until that time my dear fellow let me hear no more of the matter And now continued mister Pickwick looking round on his friends with a good humoured smile and a sparkle in the eye which no spectacles could dim or conceal
1750-135624-0005	train-other-500	the only question is Where shall we go next mister Tupman and mister Snodgrass were too much affected by their friend s heroism to offer any reply
none	none	 mister Winkle had not yet sufficiently recovered the recollection of his evidence at the trial to make any observation on any subject 
1750-135624-0006	train-other-500	so mister Pickwick paused in vain Well said that gentleman if you leave me to suggest our destination I say Bath I think none of us have ever been there
none	none	 Nobody had and as the proposition was warmly seconded by Perker 
1750-135624-0007	train-other-500	who considered it extremely probable that if mister Pickwick saw a little change and gaiety he would be inclined to think better of his determination and worse of a debtor s prison
none	none	 it was carried unanimously and Sam was at once despatched to the White Horse Cellar to take five places by the half past seven o clock coach next morning 
1750-135624-0008	train-other-500	There were just two places to be had inside and just three to be had out so Sam Weller booked for them all and having exchanged a few compliments with the booking office clerk on the subject of a pewter half crown which was tendered him as a portion of his change
1750-135624-0009	train-other-500	walked back to the George and Vulture where he was pretty busily employed until bed time in reducing clothes and linen into the smallest possible compass and exerting his mechanical genius in constructing a variety of ingenious devices for keeping the lids on boxes which had neither locks nor hinges
none	none	 The next was a very unpropitious morning for a journey muggy damp and drizzly 
1750-135624-0010	train-other-500	The horses in the stages that were going out and had come through the city were smoking so that the outside passengers were invisible The newspaper sellers looked moist and smelled mouldy
none	none	 the wet ran off the hats of the orange vendors as they thrust their heads into the coach windows and diluted the insides in a refreshing manner 
1750-135624-0011	train-other-500	The Jews with the fifty bladed penknives shut them up in despair the men with the pocket books made pocket books of them Watch guards and toasting forks were alike at a discount and pencil cases and sponges were a drug in the market
1750-135624-0012	train-other-500	Leaving Sam Weller to rescue the luggage from the seven or eight porters who flung themselves savagely upon it the moment the coach stopped and finding that they were about twenty minutes too early mister Pickwick and his friends went for shelter into the travellers room
1750-135624-0013	train-other-500	the last resource of human dejection The travellers room at the White Horse Cellar is of course uncomfortable
none	none	 it would be no travellers room if it were not It is the right hand parlour into which an aspiring kitchen fireplace appears to have walked accompanied by a rebellious poker tongs and shovel It is divided into boxes for the solitary confinement of travellers and is furnished with a clock 
1750-135624-0014	train-other-500	a looking glass and a live waiter
none	none	 which latter article is kept in a small kennel for washing glasses in a corner of the apartment 
1750-135624-0015	train-other-500	One of these boxes was occupied on this particular occasion by a stern eyed man of about five and forty who had a bald and glossy forehead with a good deal of black hair at the sides and back of his head and large black whiskers
1750-135624-0016	train-other-500	He was buttoned up to the chin in a brown coat and had a large sealskin travelling cap and a greatcoat and cloak lying on the seat beside him
none	none	 He looked up from his breakfast as mister Pickwick entered with a fierce and peremptory air 
1750-135624-0017	train-other-500	which was very dignified and having scrutinised that gentleman and his companions to his entire satisfaction hummed a tune
none	none	 in a manner which seemed to say that he rather suspected somebody wanted to take advantage of him 
1750-135624-0018	train-other-500	but it wouldn t do Waiter said the gentleman with the whiskers Sir replied a man with a dirty complexion and a towel of the same emerging from the kennel before mentioned Some more toast Yes sir
none	none	 Buttered toast mind said the gentleman fiercely Directly sir replied the waiter The gentleman with the whiskers hummed a tune in the same manner as before 
1750-135624-0019	train-other-500	and pending the arrival of the toast advanced to the front of the fire and taking his coat tails under his arms looked at his boots and ruminated I wonder whereabouts in Bath this coach puts up said mister Pickwick mildly addressing mister Winkle Hum eh what s that
1750-135624-0020	train-other-500	said the strange man I made an observation to my friend sir replied mister Pickwick always ready to enter into conversation I wondered at what house the Bath coach put up Perhaps you can inform me Are you going to Bath said the strange man
none	none	 I am sir replied mister Pickwick And those other gentlemen They are going also said mister Pickwick Not inside I ll be damned if you re going inside said the strange man Not all of us said mister Pickwick 
1750-135624-0021	train-other-500	No not all of you said the strange man emphatically I ve taken two places If they try to squeeze six people into an infernal box that only holds four I ll take a post chaise and bring an action I ve paid my fare It won t do
none	none	 I told the clerk when I took my places that it wouldn t do 
1750-135624-0022	train-other-500	I know these things have been done I know they are done every day
none	none	 but I never was done and I never will be 
1750-135624-0023	train-other-500	Those who know me best best know it crush me Here the fierce gentleman rang the bell with great violence and told the waiter he d better bring the toast in five seconds or he d know the reason why My good sir said mister Pickwick
1750-135624-0024	train-other-500	you will allow me to observe that this is a very unnecessary display of excitement I have only taken places inside for two I am glad to hear it said the fierce man I withdraw my expressions
none	none	 I tender an apology 
1750-135624-0025	train-other-500	There s my card Give me your acquaintance With great pleasure Sir replied mister Pickwick We are to be fellow travellers and I hope we shall find each other s society mutually agreeable I hope we shall said the fierce gentleman
1750-135624-0026	train-other-500	I know we shall I like your looks they please me Gentlemen your hands and names Know me Of course an interchange of friendly salutations followed this gracious speech and the fierce gentleman immediately proceeded to inform the friends in the same short abrupt
1750-135624-0027	train-other-500	jerking sentences that his name was Dowler that he was going to Bath on pleasure that he was formerly in the army that he had now set up in business as a gentleman that he lived upon the profits
1750-135624-0028	train-other-500	and that the individual for whom the second place was taken was a personage no less illustrious than missus Dowler his lady wife She s a fine woman said mister Dowler I am proud of her I have reason I hope I shall have the pleasure of judging said mister Pickwick with a smile
1750-135624-0029	train-other-500	You shall replied Dowler She shall know you She shall esteem you I courted her under singular circumstances I won her through a rash vow Thus I saw her I loved her I proposed she refused me You love another
1750-135624-0030	train-other-500	Spare my blushes I know him You do Very good if he remains here I ll skin him Lord bless me exclaimed mister Pickwick involuntarily Did you skin the gentleman Sir inquired mister Winkle with a very pale face I wrote him a note
1750-135624-0031	train-other-500	I said it was a painful thing And so it was Certainly interposed mister Winkle I said I had pledged my word as a gentleman to skin him My character was at stake I had no alternative As an officer in His Majesty s service I was bound to skin him
1750-135624-0032	train-other-500	I regretted the necessity but it must be done He was open to conviction He saw that the rules of the service were imperative He fled I married her Here s the coach That s her head
none	none	 As mister Dowler concluded he pointed to a stage which had just driven up from the open window of which a rather pretty face in a bright blue bonnet was looking among the crowd on the pavement most probably for the rash man himself 
1750-135624-0033	train-other-500	mister Dowler paid his bill and hurried out with his travelling cap coat and cloak and mister Pickwick and his friends followed to secure their places
none	none	 mister Tupman and mister Snodgrass had seated themselves at the back part of the coach mister Winkle had got inside and mister Pickwick was preparing to follow him 
1750-135624-0034	train-other-500	when Sam Weller came up to his master and whispering in his ear begged to speak to him with an air of the deepest mystery Well Sam said mister Pickwick what s the matter now Here s rayther a rum go sir replied Sam What inquired mister Pickwick
1750-135624-0035	train-other-500	This here Sir rejoined Sam
none	none	 I m wery much afeerd sir that the properiator o this here coach is a playin some imperence vith us 
1750-135624-0036	train-other-500	How is that Sam said mister Pickwick aren t the names down on the way bill The names is not only down on the vay bill Sir replied Sam but they ve painted vun on em up
none	none	 on the door o the coach As Sam spoke he pointed to that part of the coach door on which the proprietor s name usually appears 
1750-135624-0037	train-other-500	and there sure enough in gilt letters of a goodly size was the magic name of PICKWICK Dear me exclaimed mister Pickwick quite staggered by the coincidence what a very extraordinary thing
1750-135624-0038	train-other-500	Yes but that ain t all said Sam again directing his master s attention to the coach door
none	none	 not content vith writin up Pick wick they puts Moses afore it vich I call addin insult to injury as the parrot said ven they not only took him from his native land but made him talk the English langwidge arterwards 
1750-135624-0039	train-other-500	It s odd enough certainly Sam said mister Pickwick but if we stand talking here we shall lose our places
none	none	 Wot ain t nothin to be done in consequence sir exclaimed Sam perfectly aghast at the coolness with which mister Pickwick prepared to ensconce himself inside 
1750-135624-0040	train-other-500	Done said mister Pickwick What should be done
none	none	 Ain t nobody to be whopped for takin this here liberty sir said mister Weller who had expected that at least he would have been commissioned to challenge the guard and the coachman to a pugilistic encounter on the spot 
1750-135624-0041	train-other-500	Certainly not replied mister Pickwick eagerly not on any account Jump up to your seat directly I am wery much afeered muttered Sam to himself as he turned away that somethin queer s come over the governor or he d never ha stood this so quiet
1750-135624-0042	train-other-500	I hope that ere trial hasn t broke his spirit but it looks bad wery bad
none	none	 mister Weller shook his head gravely and it is worthy of remark as an illustration of the manner in which he took this circumstance to heart that he did not speak another word until the coach reached the Kensington turnpike Which was so long a time for him to remain taciturn that the fact may be considered wholly unprecedented Nothing worthy of special mention occurred during the journey mister Dowler related a variety of anecdotes all illustrative of his own personal prowess and desperation and appealed to missus Dowler in corroboration thereof when missus Dowler invariably brought in in the form of an appendix some remarkable fact or circumstance which mister Dowler had forgotten or had perhaps through modesty omitted for the addenda in every instance went to show that mister Dowler was even a more wonderful fellow than he made himself out to be mister Pickwick and mister Winkle listened with great admiration and at intervals conversed with missus Dowler who was a very agreeable and fascinating person 
1750-135624-0043	train-other-500	So what between mister Dowler s stories and missus Dowler s charms
none	none	 and mister Pickwick s good humour and mister Winkle s good listening 
1750-135624-0044	train-other-500	the insides contrived to be very companionable all the way The outsides did as outsides always do
none	none	 They were very cheerful and talkative at the beginning of every stage and very dismal and sleepy in the middle and very bright and wakeful again towards the end 
1750-135624-0045	train-other-500	There was one young gentleman in an India rubber cloak who smoked cigars all day and there was another young gentleman in a parody upon a greatcoat who lighted a good many and feeling obviously unsettled after the second whiff threw them away when he thought nobody was looking at him
none	none	 There was a third young man on the box who wished to be learned in cattle 
1750-135624-0046	train-other-500	and an old one behind who was familiar with farming There was a constant succession of Christian names in smock frocks and white coats who were invited to have a lift by the guard and who knew every horse and hostler on the road and off it and there was a dinner
1750-135624-0047	train-other-500	which would have been cheap at half a crown a mouth if any moderate number of mouths could have eaten it in the time And at seven o clock P m mister Pickwick and his friends and mister Dowler and his wife respectively retired to their private sitting rooms at the White Hart Hotel
1750-135624-0048	train-other-500	opposite the Great Pump Room Bath where the waiters from their costume might be mistaken for Westminster boys only they destroy the illusion by behaving themselves much better Breakfast had scarcely been cleared away on the succeeding morning when a waiter brought in mister Dowler s card
none	none	 with a request to be allowed permission to introduce a friend mister Dowler at once followed up the delivery of the card by bringing himself and the friend also 
1750-135624-0049	train-other-500	The friend was a charming young man of not much more than fifty dressed in a very bright blue coat with resplendent buttons black trousers and the thinnest possible pair of highly polished boots A gold eye glass was suspended from his neck by a short broad black ribbon
1750-135624-0050	train-other-500	a gold snuff box was lightly clasped in his left hand gold rings innumerable glittered on his fingers and a large diamond pin set in gold glistened in his shirt frill He had a gold watch and a gold curb chain with large gold seals
none	none	 and he carried a pliant ebony cane with a gold top His linen was of the very whitest finest and stiffest his wig of the glossiest blackest and curliest His snuff was princes mixture his scent BOUQUET DU ROI 
1750-135624-0051	train-other-500	His features were contracted into a perpetual smile and his teeth were in such perfect order that it was difficult at a small distance to tell the real from the false mister Pickwick said mister Dowler my friend Angelo Cyrus Bantam Esquire M C
1750-135624-0052	train-other-500	Bantam mister Pickwick Know each other
none	none	 Welcome to Ba ath Sir 
1750-135624-0053	train-other-500	This is indeed an acquisition
none	none	 Most welcome to Ba ath sir 
1750-135624-0054	train-other-500	It is long very long mister Pickwick since you drank the waters It appears an age mister Pickwick Re markable Such were the expressions with which Angelo Cyrus Bantam Esquire M C took mister Pickwick s hand
none	none	 retaining it in his meantime and shrugging up his shoulders with a constant succession of bows 
1750-135624-0055	train-other-500	as if he really could not make up his mind to the trial of letting it go again It is a very long time since I drank the waters certainly replied mister Pickwick for to the best of my knowledge I was never here before
none	none	 Never in Ba ath mister Pickwick exclaimed the Grand Master letting the hand fall in astonishment Never in Ba ath He he mister Pickwick you are a wag Not bad not bad Good good He he he Re markable 
1750-135624-0056	train-other-500	To my shame I must say that I am perfectly serious rejoined mister Pickwick I really never was here before Oh I see exclaimed the Grand Master looking extremely pleased yes yes good good better and better You are the gentleman of whom we have heard
none	none	 Yes we know you mister Pickwick we know you The 
1750-135624-0057	train-other-500	reports of the trial in those confounded papers thought mister Pickwick They have heard all about me You are the gentleman residing on Clapham Green resumed Bantam who lost the use of his limbs from imprudently taking cold after port wine
1750-135624-0058	train-other-500	who could not be moved in consequence of acute suffering and who had the water from the king s bath bottled at one hundred and three degrees and sent by wagon to his bedroom in town where he bathed sneezed and the same day recovered Very remarkable
1750-135624-0059	train-other-500	mister Pickwick acknowledged the compliment which the supposition implied but had the self denial to repudiate it notwithstanding and taking advantage of a moment s silence on the part of the M C begged to introduce his friends mister Tupman mister Winkle and mister Snodgrass
1750-135624-0060	train-other-500	An introduction which overwhelmed the M C with delight and honour Bantam said mister Dowler mister Pickwick and his friends are strangers They must put their names down Where s the book The register of the distinguished visitors in Ba ath will be at the Pump Room this morning at two o clock replied the M C
none	none	 Will you guide our friends to that splendid building and enable me to procure their autographs 
1750-135624-0061	train-other-500	I will rejoined Dowler This is a long call
none	none	 It s time to go I shall be here again in an hour Come This is a ball night said the M C again taking mister Pickwick s hand as he rose to go The ball nights in Ba ath 
1750-135624-0062	train-other-500	are moments snatched from paradise rendered bewitching by music beauty elegance fashion etiquette and and above all by the absence of tradespeople who are quite inconsistent with paradise
1750-135624-0063	train-other-500	and who have an amalgamation of themselves at the Guildhall every fortnight which is to say the least remarkable Good bye good bye and protesting all the way downstairs that he was most satisfied and most delighted and most overpowered and most flattered
1750-135624-0064	train-other-500	Angelo Cyrus Bantam Esquire M C stepped into a very elegant chariot that waited at the door and rattled off At the appointed hour mister Pickwick and his friends escorted by Dowler repaired to the Assembly Rooms and wrote their names down in the book
1750-135624-0065	train-other-500	an instance of condescension at which Angelo Bantam was even more overpowered than before Tickets of admission to that evening s assembly were to have been prepared for the whole party but as they were not ready mister Pickwick undertook despite all the protestations to the contrary of Angelo Bantam
1750-135624-0066	train-other-500	to send Sam for them at four o clock in the afternoon to the M C s house in Queen Square Having taken a short walk through the city and arrived at the unanimous conclusion that Park Street was very much like the perpendicular streets a man sees in a dream which he cannot get up for the life of him
1750-135624-0067	train-other-500	they returned to the White Hart and despatched Sam on the errand to which his master had pledged him Sam Weller put on his hat in a very easy and graceful manner and thrusting his hands in his waistcoat pockets walked with great deliberation to Queen Square
none	none	 whistling as he went along several of the most popular airs of the day 
1750-135624-0068	train-other-500	as arranged with entirely new movements for that noble instrument the organ either mouth or barrel Arriving at the number in Queen Square to which he had been directed he left off whistling and gave a cheerful knock
1750-135624-0069	train-other-500	which was instantaneously answered by a powdered headed footman in gorgeous livery and of symmetrical stature Is this here mister Bantam s old feller
1750-135624-0070	train-other-500	inquired Sam Weller nothing abashed by the blaze of splendour which burst upon his sight in the person of the powdered headed footman with the gorgeous livery Why young man was the haughty inquiry of the powdered headed footman
1750-135624-0071	train-other-500	Cos if it is jist you step in to him with that ere card and say mister Veller s a waitin will you said Sam And saying it he very coolly walked into the hall and sat down The powdered headed footman slammed the door very hard and scowled very grandly
none	none	 but both the slam and the scowl were lost upon Sam who was regarding a mahogany umbrella stand with every outward token of critical approval Apparently his master s reception of the card had impressed the powdered headed footman in Sam s favour for when he came back from delivering it he smiled in a friendly manner and said that the answer would be ready directly Wery good said Sam Tell the old general l m n not to put himself in a perspiration No hurry six foot 
1750-135624-0072	train-other-500	I ve had my dinner You dine early sir said the powdered headed footman I find I gets on better at supper when I does replied Sam Have you been long in Bath sir inquired the powdered headed footman I have not had the pleasure of hearing of you before
none	none	 I haven t created any wery surprisin sensation here as yet rejoined Sam 
1750-135624-0073	train-other-500	for me and the other fash nables only come last night Nice place Sir said the powdered headed footman Seems so observed Sam Pleasant society sir remarked the powdered headed footman Very agreeable servants sir
none	none	 I should think they wos replied Sam Affable unaffected say nothin to nobody sorts o fellers 
1750-135624-0074	train-other-500	Oh very much so indeed sir said the powdered headed footman taking Sam s remarks as a high compliment Very much so indeed Do you do anything in this way Sir inquired the tall footman producing a small snuff box with a fox s head on the top of it
none	none	 Not without sneezing replied Sam Why it IS difficult sir I confess said the tall footman It may be done by degrees Sir Coffee is the best practice I carried coffee Sir for a long time It looks very like rappee sir Here a sharp peal at the bell reduced the powdered headed footman to the ignominious necessity of putting the fox s head in his pocket 
1750-135624-0075	train-other-500	and hastening with a humble countenance to mister Bantam s study By the bye who ever knew a man who never read or wrote either who hadn t got some small back parlour which he WOULD call a study There is the answer sir
none	none	 said the powdered headed footman I m afraid you ll find it inconveniently large Don t mention it said Sam taking a letter with a small enclosure It s just possible as exhausted natur may manage to surwive it 
1750-135624-0076	train-other-500	I hope we shall meet again Sir said the powdered headed footman rubbing his hands and following Sam out to the door step You are wery obligin sir replied Sam Now don t allow yourself to be fatigued beyond your powers
none	none	 there s a amiable bein 
1750-135624-0077	train-other-500	Consider what you owe to society and don t let yourself be injured by too much work For the sake o your feller creeturs keep yourself as quiet as you can only think what a loss you would be With these pathetic words Sam Weller departed
none	none	 A very singular young man that said the powdered headed footman looking after mister Weller with a countenance which clearly showed he could make nothing of him Sam said nothing at all He winked shook his head smiled winked again 
1750-135624-0078	train-other-500	and with an expression of countenance which seemed to denote that he was greatly amused with something or other walked merrily away
none	none	 At precisely twenty minutes before eight o clock that night Angelo Cyrus Bantam esquire 
1750-135624-0079	train-other-500	the Master of the Ceremonies emerged from his chariot at the door of the Assembly Rooms in the same wig the same teeth the same eye glass the same watch and seals the same rings the same shirt pin and the same cane
1750-135624-0080	train-other-500	The only observable alterations in his appearance were that he wore a brighter blue coat with a white silk lining black tights black silk stockings and pumps and a white waistcoat and was if possible just a thought more scented
none	none	 Thus attired the Master of the Ceremonies in strict discharge of the important duties of his all important office planted himself in the room to receive the company Bath being full the company and the sixpences for tea poured in in shoals In the ballroom the long card room the octagonal card room the staircases and the passages the hum of many voices and the sound of many feet were perfectly bewildering 
1750-135624-0081	train-other-500	Dresses rustled feathers waved lights shone and jewels sparkled There was the music not of the quadrille band for it had not yet commenced
none	none	 but the music of soft tiny footsteps with now and then a clear merry laugh 
1750-135624-0082	train-other-500	low and gentle but very pleasant to hear in a female voice whether in Bath or elsewhere
none	none	 Brilliant eyes lighted up with pleasurable expectation gleamed from every side and look where you would some exquisite form glided gracefully through the throng and was no sooner lost 
1750-135624-0083	train-other-500	than it was replaced by another as dainty and bewitching In the tea room and hovering round the card tables were a vast number of queer old ladies and decrepit old gentlemen discussing all the small talk and scandal of the day with a relish and gusto which sufficiently bespoke
none	none	 the intensity of the pleasure they derived from the occupation Mingled with these groups were three or four match making mammas appearing to be wholly absorbed by the conversation in which they were taking part 
1750-135624-0084	train-other-500	but failing not from time to time to cast an anxious sidelong glance upon their daughters who remembering the maternal injunction to make the best use of their youth had already commenced incipient flirtations in the mislaying scarves
1750-135624-0085	train-other-500	putting on gloves setting down cups and so forth
none	none	 slight matters apparently but which may be turned to surprisingly good account by expert practitioners Lounging near the doors and in remote corners were various knots of silly young men 
1750-135624-0086	train-other-500	displaying various varieties of puppyism and stupidity amusing all sensible people near them with their folly and conceit and happily thinking themselves the objects of general admiration a wise and merciful dispensation which no good man will quarrel with
1750-135624-0087	train-other-500	And lastly seated on some of the back benches where they had already taken up their positions for the evening were divers unmarried ladies past their grand climacteric who
1750-135624-0088	train-other-500	not dancing because there were no partners for them and not playing cards lest they should be set down as irretrievably single were in the favourable situation of being able to abuse everybody without reflecting on themselves In short they could abuse everybody because everybody was there
none	none	 It was a scene of gaiety glitter and show of richly dressed people handsome mirrors chalked floors 
1750-135624-0089	train-other-500	girandoles and wax candles and in all parts of the scene gliding from spot to spot in silent softness
none	none	 bowing obsequiously to this party nodding familiarly to that and smiling complacently on all was the sprucely attired person of Angelo Cyrus Bantam Esquire the Master of the Ceremonies 
1750-135624-0090	train-other-500	Stop in the tea room Take your sixpenn orth Then lay on hot water and call it tea Drink it said mister Dowler in a loud voice directing mister Pickwick who advanced at the head of the little party with missus Dowler on his arm
1750-135624-0091	train-other-500	Into the tea room mister Pickwick turned and catching sight of him mister Bantam corkscrewed his way through the crowd and welcomed him with ecstasy My dear Sir I am highly honoured
none	none	 Ba ath is favoured missus Dowler you embellish the rooms I congratulate you on your feathers Re markable 
1750-135624-0092	train-other-500	Anybody here inquired Dowler suspiciously Anybody
none	none	 The ELITE of Ba ath mister Pickwick do you see the old lady in the gauze turban 
1750-135624-0093	train-other-500	The fat old lady inquired mister Pickwick innocently
none	none	 Hush my dear sir nobody s fat or old in Ba ath That s the Dowager Lady Snuphanuph 
1750-135624-0094	train-other-500	Is it indeed said mister Pickwick
none	none	 No less a person I assure you said the Master of the Ceremonies 
1750-135624-0095	train-other-500	Hush Draw a little nearer mister Pickwick You see the splendidly dressed young man coming this way
none	none	 The one with the long hair and the particularly small forehead inquired mister Pickwick The same The richest young man in Ba ath at this moment Young Lord Mutanhed 
1750-135624-0096	train-other-500	You don t say so said mister Pickwick Yes You ll hear his voice in a moment mister Pickwick
none	none	 He ll speak to me The other gentleman with him in the red under waistcoat and dark moustache is the Honourable mister Crushton 
1750-135624-0097	train-other-500	his bosom friend How do you do my Lord
none	none	 Veway hot Bantam said his 
1750-135624-0098	train-other-500	Lordship It IS very warm my Lord replied the M C Confounded assented the Honourable mister Crushton
none	none	 Have you seen his Lordship s mail cart Bantam inquired the Honourable mister Crushton after a short pause during which young Lord Mutanhed had been endeavouring to stare mister Pickwick out of countenance 
1750-135624-0099	train-other-500	and mister Crushton had been reflecting what subject his Lordship could talk about best
none	none	 Dear me no replied the M C 
1750-135624-0100	train-other-500	A mail cart What an excellent idea Re markable Gwacious heavens said his Lordship
none	none	 I thought evewebody had seen the new mail cart it s the neatest pwettiest gwacefullest thing that ever wan upon wheels Painted wed with a cweam piebald With a real box for the letters and all complete said the Honourable mister Crushton And a little seat in fwont with an iwon wail for the dwiver 
1750-135624-0101	train-other-500	added his Lordship I dwove it over to Bwistol the other morning in a cwimson coat with two servants widing a quarter of a mile behind
none	none	 and confound me if the people didn t wush out of their cottages and awest my pwogwess 
1750-135624-0102	train-other-500	to know if I wasn t the post Glorwious glorwious At this anecdote his Lordship laughed very heartily as did the listeners of course
none	none	 Then drawing his arm through that of the obsequious mister Crushton Lord Mutanhed walked away Delightful young man his Lordship said the Master of the Ceremonies 
1750-135624-0103	train-other-500	So I should think rejoined mister Pickwick drily
none	none	 The dancing having commenced the necessary introductions having been made and all preliminaries arranged 
1750-135624-0104	train-other-500	Angelo Bantam rejoined mister Pickwick and led him into the card room Just at the very moment of their entrance the Dowager Lady Snuphanuph and two other ladies of an ancient and whist like appearance were hovering over an unoccupied card table
1750-135624-0105	train-other-500	and they no sooner set eyes upon mister Pickwick under the convoy of Angelo Bantam than they exchanged glances with each other seeing that he was precisely the very person they wanted to make up the rubber
none	none	 My dear Bantam said the Dowager Lady Snuphanuph coaxingly find us some nice creature to make up this table there s a good soul 
1750-135624-0106	train-other-500	mister Pickwick happened to be looking another way at the moment so her Ladyship nodded her head towards him and frowned expressively My friend mister Pickwick my Lady will be most happy I am sure remarkably so said the M C taking the hint
1750-135624-0107	train-other-500	mister Pickwick Lady Snuphanuph missus Colonel Wugsby Miss Bolo mister Pickwick bowed to each of the ladies and finding escape impossible cut mister Pickwick and Miss Bolo against Lady Snuphanuph and missus Colonel Wugsby
1750-135624-0108	train-other-500	As the trump card was turned up at the commencement of the second deal two young ladies hurried into the room and took their stations on either side of missus Colonel Wugsby s chair where they waited patiently until the hand was over
1750-135624-0109	train-other-500	Now Jane said missus Colonel Wugsby turning to one of the girls what is it I came to ask ma whether I might dance with the youngest mister Crawley whispered the prettier and younger of the two
1750-135624-0110	train-other-500	Good God Jane how can you think of such things replied the mamma indignantly Haven t you repeatedly heard that his father has eight hundred a year which dies with him I am ashamed of you Not on any account
1750-135624-0111	train-other-500	Ma whispered the other who was much older than her sister and very insipid and artificial
none	none	 Lord Mutanhed has been introduced to me I said I thought I wasn t engaged ma 
1750-135624-0112	train-other-500	You re a sweet pet my love replied missus Colonel Wugsby tapping her daughter s cheek with her fan and are always to be trusted He s immensely rich my dear Bless you With these words missus Colonel Wugsby kissed her eldest daughter most affectionately
1750-135624-0113	train-other-500	and frowning in a warning manner upon the other sorted her cards Poor mister Pickwick he had never played with three thorough paced female card players before They were so desperately sharp that they quite frightened him
1750-135624-0114	train-other-500	If he played a wrong card Miss Bolo looked a small armoury of daggers if he stopped to consider which was the right one Lady Snuphanuph would throw herself back in her chair and smile with a mingled glance of impatience and pity
1750-135624-0115	train-other-500	to missus Colonel Wugsby at which missus Colonel Wugsby would shrug up her shoulders and cough as much as to say she wondered whether he ever would begin
none	none	 Then at the end of every hand Miss Bolo would inquire with a dismal countenance and reproachful sigh

EXTRAORDINARY CALAMITY THAT BEFELL mister WINKLE As mister Pickwick contemplated a stay of at least two months in Bath he deemed it advisable to take private lodgings for himself and friends for that period and as a favourable opportunity offered for their securing on moderate terms the upper portion of a house in the Royal Crescent which was larger than they required mister and missus Dowler offered to relieve them of a bedroom and sitting room This proposition was at once accepted and in three days time they were all located in their new abode when mister Pickwick began to drink the waters with the utmost assiduity mister Pickwick took them systematically He drank a quarter of a pint before breakfast and then walked up a hill and another quarter of a pint after breakfast and then walked down a hill and after every fresh quarter of a pint mister Pickwick declared in the most solemn and emphatic terms that he felt a great deal better whereat his friends were very much delighted though they had not been previously aware that there was anything the matter with him The Great Pump Room is a spacious saloon ornamented with Corinthian pillars and a music gallery and a Tompion clock and a statue of Nash and a golden inscription to which all the water drinkers should attend for it appeals to them in the cause of a deserving charity There is a large bar with a marble vase out of which the pumper gets the water and there are a number of yellow looking tumblers out of which the company get it and it is a most edifying and satisfactory sight to behold the perseverance and gravity with which they swallow it There are baths near at hand in which a part of the company wash themselves and a band plays afterwards to congratulate the remainder on their having done so There is another pump room into which infirm ladies and gentlemen are wheeled in such an astonishing variety of chairs and chaises that any adventurous individual who goes in with the regular number of toes is in imminent danger of coming out without them and there is a third into which the quiet people go for it is less noisy than either There is an immensity of promenading on crutches and off with sticks and without and a great deal of conversation and liveliness and pleasantry Every morning the regular water drinkers mister Pickwick among the number met each other in the pump room took their quarter of a pint and walked constitutionally At the afternoon s promenade Lord Mutanhed and the Honourable mister Crushton the Dowager Lady Snuphanuph missus Colonel Wugsby and all the great people and all the morning water drinkers met in grand assemblage After this they walked out or drove out or were pushed out in bath chairs and met one another again After this the gentlemen went to the reading rooms and met divisions of the mass After this they went home If it were theatre night perhaps they met at the theatre if it were assembly night they met at the rooms and if it were neither they met the next day A very pleasant routine with perhaps a slight tinge of sameness mister Pickwick was sitting up by himself after a day spent in this manner making entries in his journal his friends having retired to bed when he was roused by a gentle tap at the room door Beg your pardon Sir said missus Craddock the landlady peeping in but did you want anything more sir Nothing more ma am replied mister Pickwick My young girl is gone to bed Sir said missus Craddock and mister Dowler is good enough to say that he ll sit up for missus Dowler as the party isn t expected to be over till late so I was thinking that if you wanted nothing more mister Pickwick I would go to bed By all means ma am replied mister Pickwick Wish you good night Sir said missus Craddock Good night ma am rejoined mister Pickwick missus Craddock closed the door and mister Pickwick resumed his writing In half an hour s time the entries were concluded mister Pickwick carefully rubbed the last page on the blotting paper shut up the book wiped his pen on the bottom of the inside of his coat tail and opened the drawer of the inkstand to put it carefully away There were a couple of sheets of writing paper pretty closely written over in the inkstand drawer and they were folded so that the title which was in a good round hand was fully disclosed to him Seeing from this that it was no private document and as it seemed to relate to Bath and was very short mister Pick wick unfolded it lighted his bedroom candle that it might burn up well by the time he finished and drawing his chair nearer the fire read as follows THE TRUE LEGEND OF PRINCE BLADUD Less than two hundred years ago on one of the public baths in this city there appeared an inscription in honour of its mighty founder the renowned Prince Bladud That inscription is now erased For many hundred years before that time there had been handed down from age to age an old legend that the illustrious prince being afflicted with leprosy on his return from reaping a rich harvest of knowledge in Athens shunned the court of his royal father and consorted moodily with husbandman and pigs Among the herd so said the legend was a pig of grave and solemn countenance with whom the prince had a fellow feeling for he too was wise a pig of thoughtful and reserved demeanour an animal superior to his fellows whose grunt was terrible and whose bite was sharp The young prince sighed deeply as he looked upon the countenance of the majestic swine he thought of his royal father and his eyes were bedewed with tears This sagacious pig was fond of bathing in rich moist mud Not in summer as common pigs do now to cool themselves and did even in those distant ages which is a proof that the light of civilisation had already begun to dawn though feebly but in the cold sharp days of winter His coat was ever so sleek and his complexion so clear that the prince resolved to essay the purifying qualities of the same water that his friend resorted to He made the trial Beneath that black mud bubbled the hot springs of Bath He washed and was cured Hastening to his father s court he paid his best respects and returning quickly hither founded this city and its famous baths He sought the pig with all the ardour of their early friendship but alas the waters had been his death He had imprudently taken a bath at too high a temperature and the natural philosopher was no more He was succeeded by Pliny who also fell a victim to his thirst for knowledge This was the legend Listen to the true one A great many centuries since there flourished in great state the famous and renowned Lud Hudibras king of Britain He was a mighty monarch The earth shook when he walked he was so very stout His people basked in the light of his countenance it was so red and glowing He was indeed every inch a king And there were a good many inches of him too for although he was not very tall he was a remarkable size round and the inches that he wanted in height he made up in circumference If any degenerate monarch of modern times could be in any way compared with him I should say the venerable King Cole would be that illustrious potentate This good king had a queen who eighteen years before had had a son who was called Bladud He was sent to a preparatory seminary in his father s dominions until he was ten years old and was then despatched in charge of a trusty messenger to a finishing school at Athens and as there was no extra charge for remaining during the holidays and no notice required previous to the removal of a pupil there he remained for eight long years at the expiration of which time the king his father sent the lord chamberlain over to settle the bill and to bring him home which the lord chamberlain doing was received with shouts and pensioned immediately When King Lud saw the prince his son and found he had grown up such a fine young man he perceived what a grand thing it would be to have him married without delay so that his children might be the means of perpetuating the glorious race of Lud down to the very latest ages of the world With this view he sent a special embassy composed of great noblemen who had nothing particular to do and wanted lucrative employment to a neighbouring king and demanded his fair daughter in marriage for his son stating at the same time that he was anxious to be on the most affectionate terms with his brother and friend but that if they couldn t agree in arranging this marriage he should be under the unpleasant necessity of invading his kingdom and putting his eyes out To this the other king who was the weaker of the two replied that he was very much obliged to his friend and brother for all his goodness and magnanimity and that his daughter was quite ready to be married whenever Prince Bladud liked to come and fetch her This answer no sooner reached Britain than the whole nation was transported with joy Nothing was heard on all sides but the sounds of feasting and revelry except the chinking of money as it was paid in by the people to the collector of the royal treasures to defray the expenses of the happy ceremony It was upon this occasion that King Lud seated on the top of his throne in full council rose in the exuberance of his feelings and commanded the lord chief justice to order in the richest wines and the court minstrels an act of graciousness which has been through the ignorance of traditionary historians attributed to King Cole in those celebrated lines in which his Majesty is represented as Calling for his pipe and calling for his pot And calling for his fiddlers three Which is an obvious injustice to the memory of King Lud and a dishonest exaltation of the virtues of King Cole But in the midst of all this festivity and rejoicing there was one individual present who tasted not when the sparkling wines were poured forth and who danced not when the minstrels played This was no other than Prince Bladud himself in honour of whose happiness a whole people were at that very moment straining alike their throats and purse strings The truth was that the prince forgetting the undoubted right of the minister for foreign affairs to fall in love on his behalf had contrary to every precedent of policy and diplomacy already fallen in love on his own account and privately contracted himself unto the fair daughter of a noble Athenian Here we have a striking example of one of the manifold advantages of civilisation and refinement If the prince had lived in later days he might at once have married the object of his father s choice and then set himself seriously to work to relieve himself of the burden which rested heavily upon him He might have endeavoured to break her heart by a systematic course of insult and neglect or if the spirit of her sex and a proud consciousness of her many wrongs had upheld her under this ill treatment he might have sought to take her life and so get rid of her effectually But neither mode of relief suggested itself to Prince Bladud so he solicited a private audience and told his father it is an old prerogative of kings to govern everything but their passions King Lud flew into a frightful rage tossed his crown up to the ceiling and caught it again for in those days kings kept their crowns on their heads and not in the Tower stamped the ground rapped his forehead wondered why his own flesh and blood rebelled against him and finally calling in his guards ordered the prince away to instant Confinement in a lofty turret a course of treatment which the kings of old very generally pursued towards their sons when their matrimonial inclinations did not happen to point to the same quarter as their own When Prince Bladud had been shut up in the lofty turret for the greater part of a year with no better prospect before his bodily eyes than a stone wall or before his mental vision than prolonged imprisonment he naturally began to ruminate on a plan of escape which after months of preparation he managed to accomplish considerately leaving his dinner knife in the heart of his jailer lest the poor fellow who had a family should be considered privy to his flight and punished accordingly by the infuriated king The monarch was frantic at the loss of his son He knew not on whom to vent his grief and wrath until fortunately bethinking himself of the lord chamberlain who had brought him home he struck off his pension and his head together Meanwhile the young prince effectually disguised wandered on foot through his father s dominions cheered and supported in all his hardships by sweet thoughts of the Athenian maid who was the innocent cause of his weary trials One day he stopped to rest in a country village and seeing that there were gay dances going forward on the green and gay faces passing to and fro ventured to inquire of a reveller who stood near him the reason for this rejoicing Know you not O stranger was the reply of the recent proclamation of our gracious king Proclamation No What proclamation rejoined the prince for he had travelled along the by and little frequented ways and knew nothing of what had passed upon the public roads such as they were Why replied the peasant the foreign lady that our prince wished to wed is married to a foreign noble of her own country and the king proclaims the fact and a great public festival besides for now of course Prince Bladud will come back and marry the lady his father chose who they say is as beautiful as the noonday sun Your health sir God save the king The prince remained to hear no more He fled from the spot and plunged into the thickest recesses of a neighbouring wood On on he wandered night and day beneath the blazing sun and the cold pale moon through the dry heat of noon and the damp cold of night in the gray light of morn and the red glare of eve So heedless was he of time or object that being bound for Athens he wandered as far out of his way as Bath There was no city where Bath stands then There was no vestige of human habitation or sign of man s resort to bear the name but there was the same noble country the same broad expanse of hill and dale the same beautiful channel stealing on far away the same lofty mountains which like the troubles of life viewed at a distance and partially obscured by the bright mist of its morning lose their ruggedness and asperity and seem all ease and softness Moved by the gentle beauty of the scene the prince sank upon the green turf and bathed his swollen feet in his tears Oh said the unhappy Bladud clasping his hands and mournfully raising his eyes towards the sky would that my wanderings might end here Would that these grateful tears with which I now mourn hope misplaced and love despised might flow in peace for ever The wish was heard It was in the time of the heathen deities who used occasionally to take people at their words with a promptness in some cases extremely awkward The ground opened beneath the prince s feet he sank into the chasm and instantaneously it closed upon his head for ever save where his hot tears welled up through the earth and where they have continued to gush forth ever since It is observable that to this day large numbers of elderly ladies and gentlemen who have been disappointed in procuring partners and almost as many young ones who are anxious to obtain them repair annually to Bath to drink the waters from which they derive much strength and comfort This is most complimentary to the virtue of Prince Bladud s tears and strongly corroborative of the veracity of this legend mister Pickwick yawned several times when he had arrived at the end of this little manuscript carefully refolded and replaced it in the inkstand drawer and then with a countenance expressive of the utmost weariness lighted his chamber candle and went upstairs to bed He stopped at mister Dowler s door according to custom and knocked to say good night Ah said Dowler going to bed I wish I was Dismal night Windy isn t it Very said mister Pickwick Good night Good night mister Pickwick went to his bedchamber and mister Dowler resumed his seat before the fire in fulfilment of his rash promise to sit up till his wife came home There are few things more worrying than sitting up for somebody especially if that somebody be at a party You cannot help thinking how quickly the time passes with them which drags so heavily with you and the more you think of this the more your hopes of their speedy arrival decline Clocks tick so loud too when you are sitting up alone and you seem as if you had an under garment of cobwebs on First something tickles your right knee and then the same sensation irritates your left You have no sooner changed your position than it comes again in the arms when you have fidgeted your limbs into all sorts of queer shapes you have a sudden relapse in the nose which you rub as if to rub it off as there is no doubt you would if you could Eyes too are mere personal inconveniences and the wick of one candle gets an inch and a half long while you are snuffing the other These and various other little nervous annoyances render sitting up for a length of time after everybody else has gone to bed anything but a cheerful amusement This was just mister Dowler s opinion as he sat before the fire and felt honestly indignant with all the inhuman people at the party who were keeping him up He was not put into better humour either by the reflection that he had taken it into his head early in the evening to think he had got an ache there and so stopped at home At length after several droppings asleep and fallings forward towards the bars and catchings backward soon enough to prevent being branded in the face mister Dowler made up his mind that he would throw himself on the bed in the back room and think not sleep of course I m a heavy sleeper said mister Dowler as he flung himself on the bed I must keep awake I suppose I shall hear a knock here Yes I thought so I can hear the watchman There he goes Fainter now though A little fainter He s turning the corner Ah When mister Dowler arrived at this point he turned the corner at which he had been long hesitating and fell fast asleep Just as the clock struck three there was blown into the crescent a sedan chair with missus Dowler inside borne by one short fat chairman and one long thin one who had had much ado to keep their bodies perpendicular to say nothing of the chair But on that high ground and in the crescent which the wind swept round and round as if it were going to tear the paving stones up its fury was tremendous They were very glad to set the chair down and give a good round loud double knock at the street door They waited some time but nobody came Servants is in the arms o Porpus I think said the short chairman warming his hands at the attendant link boy s torch I wish he d give em a squeeze and wake em observed the long one Knock again will you if you please cried missus Dowler from the chair Knock two or three times if you please The short man was quite willing to get the job over as soon as possible so he stood on the step and gave four or five most startling double knocks of eight or ten knocks a piece while the long man went into the road and looked up at the windows for a light Nobody came It was all as silent and dark as ever Dear me said missus Dowler You must knock again if you please There ain t a bell is there ma am said the short chairman Yes there is interposed the link boy I ve been a ringing at it ever so long It s only a handle said missus Dowler the wire s broken I wish the servants heads wos growled the long man I must trouble you to knock again if you please said missus Dowler with the utmost politeness The short man did knock again several times without producing the smallest effect The tall man growing very impatient then relieved him and kept on perpetually knocking double knocks of two loud knocks each like an insane postman At length mister Winkle began to dream that he was at a club and that the members being very refractory the chairman was obliged to hammer the table a good deal to preserve order then he had a confused notion of an auction room where there were no bidders and the auctioneer was buying everything in and ultimately he began to think it just within the bounds of possibility that somebody might be knocking at the street door To make quite certain however he remained quiet in bed for ten minutes or so and listened and when he had counted two or three and thirty knocks he felt quite satisfied and gave himself a great deal of credit for being so wakeful Rap rap rap rap rap rap ra ra ra ra ra rap went the knocker mister Winkle jumped out of bed wondering very much what could possibly be the matter and hastily putting on his stockings and slippers folded his dressing gown round him lighted a flat candle from the rush light that was burning in the fireplace and hurried downstairs Here s somebody comin at last ma am said the short chairman I wish I wos behind him vith a bradawl muttered the long one Who s there cried mister Winkle undoing the chain Don t stop to ask questions cast iron head replied the long man with great disgust taking it for granted that the inquirer was a footman but open the door Come look sharp timber eyelids added the other encouragingly mister Winkle being half asleep obeyed the command mechanically opened the door a little and peeped out The first thing he saw was the red glare of the link boy s torch Startled by the sudden fear that the house might be on fire he hastily threw the door wide open and holding the candle above his head stared eagerly before him not quite certain whether what he saw was a sedan chair or a fire engine At this instant there came a violent gust of wind the light was blown out mister Winkle felt himself irresistibly impelled on to the steps and the door blew to with a loud crash Well young man now you HAVE done it said the short chairman mister Winkle catching sight of a lady s face at the window of the sedan turned hastily round plied the knocker with all his might and main and called frantically upon the chairman to take the chair away again Take it away take it away cried mister Winkle Here s somebody coming out of another house put me into the chair Hide me Do something with me All this time he was shivering with cold and every time he raised his hand to the knocker the wind took the dressing gown in a most unpleasant manner The people are coming down the crescent now There are ladies with em cover me up with something Stand before me roared mister Winkle But the chairmen were too much exhausted with laughing to afford him the slightest assistance and the ladies were every moment approaching nearer and nearer mister Winkle gave a last hopeless knock the ladies were only a few doors off He threw away the extinguished candle which all this time he had held above his head and fairly bolted into the sedan chair where missus Dowler was Now missus Craddock had heard the knocking and the voices at last and only waiting to put something smarter on her head than her nightcap ran down into the front drawing room to make sure that it was the right party Throwing up the window sash as mister Winkle was rushing into the chair she no sooner caught sight of what was going forward below than she raised a vehement and dismal shriek and implored mister Dowler to get up directly for his wife was running away with another gentleman Upon this mister Dowler bounced off the bed as abruptly as an India rubber ball and rushing into the front room arrived at one window just as mister Pickwick threw up the other when the first object that met the gaze of both was mister Winkle bolting into the sedan chair Watchman shouted Dowler furiously stop him hold him keep him tight shut him in till I come down I ll cut his throat give me a knife from ear to ear missus Craddock I will And breaking from the shrieking landlady and from mister Pickwick the indignant husband seized a small supper knife and tore into the street But mister Winkle didn t wait for him He no sooner heard the horrible threat of the valorous Dowler than he bounced out of the sedan quite as quickly as he had bounced in and throwing off his slippers into the road took to his heels and tore round the crescent hotly pursued by Dowler and the watchman He kept ahead the door was open as he came round the second time he rushed in slammed it in Dowler s face mounted to his bedroom locked the door piled a wash hand stand chest of drawers and a table against it and packed up a few necessaries ready for flight with the first ray of morning Dowler came up to the outside of the door avowed through the keyhole his steadfast determination of cutting mister Winkle s throat next day and after a great confusion of voices in the drawing room amidst which that of mister Pickwick was distinctly heard endeavouring to make peace the inmates dispersed to their several bed chambers and all was quiet once more It is not unlikely that the inquiry may be made where mister Weller was all this time We will state where he was in the next chapter CHAPTER XXXVII HONOURABLY ACCOUNTS FOR mister WELLER S ABSENCE BY DESCRIBING A SOIREE TO WHICH HE WAS INVITED AND WENT ALSO RELATES HOW HE WAS ENTRUSTED BY mister PICKWICK WITH A PRIVATE MISSION OF DELICACY AND IMPORTANCE mister Weller said missus Craddock upon the morning of this very eventful day here s a letter for you Wery odd that said Sam I m afeerd there must be somethin the matter for I don t recollect any general l m n in my circle of acquaintance as is capable o writin one Perhaps something uncommon has taken place observed missus Craddock It must be somethin wery uncommon indeed as could perduce a letter out o any friend o mine replied Sam shaking his head dubiously nothin less than a nat ral conwulsion as the young general l m n observed ven he wos took with fits It can t be from the gov ner said Sam looking at the direction He always prints I know cos he learnt writin from the large bills in the booking offices It s a wery strange thing now where this here letter can ha come from As Sam said this he did what a great many people do when they are uncertain about the writer of a note looked at the seal and then at the front and then at the back and then at the sides and then at the superscription and as a last resource thought perhaps he might as well look at the inside and try to find out from that It s wrote on gilt edged paper said Sam as he unfolded it and sealed in bronze vax vith the top of a door key Now for it And with a very grave face mister Weller slowly read as follows A select company of the Bath footmen presents their compliments to mister Weller and requests the pleasure of his company this evening to a friendly swarry consisting of a boiled leg of mutton with the usual trimmings The swarry to be on table at half past nine o clock punctually This was inclosed in another note which ran thus mister John Smauker the gentleman who had the pleasure of meeting mister Weller at the house of their mutual acquaintance mister Bantam a few days since begs to inclose mister Weller the herewith invitation If mister Weller will call on mister John Smauker at nine o clock mister John Smauker will have the pleasure of introducing mister Weller Signed JOHN SMAUKER The envelope was directed to blank Weller esquire at mister Pickwick s and in a parenthesis in the left hand corner were the words airy bell as an instruction to the bearer Vell said Sam this is comin it rayther powerful this is I never heerd a biled leg o mutton called a swarry afore I wonder wot they d call a roast one However without waiting to debate the point Sam at once betook himself into the presence of mister Pickwick and requested leave of absence for that evening which was readily granted With this permission and the street door key Sam Weller issued forth a little before the appointed time and strolled leisurely towards Queen Square which he no sooner gained than he had the satisfaction of beholding mister John Smauker leaning his powdered head against a lamp post at a short distance off smoking a cigar through an amber tube How do you do mister Weller said mister John Smauker raising his hat gracefully with one hand while he gently waved the other in a condescending manner How do you do Sir Why reasonably conwalessent replied Sam How do YOU find yourself my dear feller Only so so said mister John Smauker Ah you ve been a workin too hard observed Sam I was fearful you would it won t do you know you must not give way to that ere uncompromisin spirit o yourn It s not so much that mister Weller replied mister John Smauker as bad wine I m afraid I ve been dissipating Oh that s it is it said Sam that s a wery bad complaint that And yet the temptation you see mister Weller observed mister John Smauker Ah to be sure said Sam Plunged into the very vortex of society you know mister Weller said mister John Smauker with a sigh Dreadful indeed rejoined Sam But it s always the way said mister John Smauker if your destiny leads you into public life and public station you must expect to be subjected to temptations which other people is free from mister Weller Precisely what my uncle said ven he vent into the public line remarked Sam and wery right the old general l m n wos for he drank hisself to death in somethin less than a quarter mister John Smauker looked deeply indignant at any parallel being drawn between himself and the deceased gentleman in question but as Sam s face was in the most immovable state of calmness he thought better of it and looked affable again Perhaps we had better be walking said mister Smauker consulting a copper timepiece which dwelt at the bottom of a deep watch pocket and was raised to the surface by means of a black string with a copper key at the other end P raps we had replied Sam or they ll overdo the swarry and that ll spile it Have you drank the waters mister Weller inquired his companion as they walked towards High Street Once replied Sam What did you think of em Sir I thought they was particklery unpleasant replied Sam Ah said mister John Smauker you disliked the killibeate taste perhaps I don t know much about that ere said Sam I thought they d a wery strong flavour o warm flat irons That IS the killibeate mister Weller observed mister John Smauker contemptuously Well if it is it s a wery inexpressive word that s all said Sam It may be but I ain t much in the chimical line myself so I can t say And here to the great horror of mister John Smauker Sam Weller began to whistle I beg your pardon mister Weller said mister John Smauker agonised at the exceeding ungenteel sound will you take my arm Thank ee you re wery good but I won t deprive you of it replied Sam I ve rayther a way o putting my hands in my pockets if it s all the same to you As Sam said this he suited the action to the word and whistled far louder than before This way said his new friend apparently much relieved as they turned down a by street we shall soon be there Shall we said Sam quite unmoved by the announcement of his close vicinity to the select footmen of Bath Yes said mister John Smauker Don t be alarmed mister Weller Oh no said Sam You ll see some very handsome uniforms mister Weller continued mister John Smauker and perhaps you ll find some of the gentlemen rather high at first you know but they ll soon come round That s wery kind on em replied Sam And you know resumed mister John Smauker with an air of sublime protection you know as you re a stranger perhaps they ll be rather hard upon you at first They won t be wery cruel though will they inquired Sam No no replied mister John Smauker pulling forth the fox s head and taking a gentlemanly pinch There are some funny dogs among us and they will have their joke you know but you mustn t mind em you mustn t mind em I ll try and bear up agin such a reg lar knock down o talent replied Sam That s right said mister John Smauker putting forth his fox s head and elevating his own I ll stand by you By this time they had reached a small greengrocer s shop which mister John Smauker entered followed by Sam who the moment he got behind him relapsed into a series of the very broadest and most unmitigated grins and manifested other demonstrations of being in a highly enviable state of inward merriment Crossing the greengrocer s shop and putting their hats on the stairs in the little passage behind it they walked into a small parlour and here the full splendour of the scene burst upon mister Weller s view A couple of tables were put together in the middle of the parlour covered with three or four cloths of different ages and dates of washing arranged to look as much like one as the circumstances of the case would allow Upon these were laid knives and forks for six or eight people Some of the knife handles were green others red and a few yellow and as all the forks were black the combination of colours was exceedingly striking Plates for a corresponding number of guests were warming behind the fender and the guests themselves were warming before it the chief and most important of whom appeared to be a stoutish gentleman in a bright crimson coat with long tails vividly red breeches and a cocked hat who was standing with his back to the fire and had apparently just entered for besides retaining his cocked hat on his head he carried in his hand a high stick such as gentlemen of his profession usually elevate in a sloping position over the roofs of carriages Smauker my lad your fin said the gentleman with the cocked hat mister Smauker dovetailed the top joint of his right hand little finger into that of the gentleman with the cocked hat and said he was charmed to see him looking so well Well they tell me I am looking pretty blooming said the man with the cocked hat and it s a wonder too I ve been following our old woman about two hours a day for the last fortnight and if a constant contemplation of the manner in which she hooks and eyes that infernal lavender coloured old gown of hers behind isn t enough to throw anybody into a low state of despondency for life stop my quarter s salary At this the assembled selections laughed very heartily and one gentleman in a yellow waistcoat with a coach trimming border whispered a neighbour in green foil smalls that Tuckle was in spirits to night By the bye said mister Tuckle Smauker my boy you The remainder of the sentence was forwarded into mister John Smauker s ear by whisper Oh dear me I quite forgot said mister John Smauker Gentlemen my friend mister Weller Sorry to keep the fire off you Weller said mister Tuckle with a familiar nod Hope you re not cold Weller Not by no means Blazes replied Sam It ud be a wery chilly subject as felt cold wen you stood opposite You d save coals if they put you behind the fender in the waitin room at a public office you would As this retort appeared to convey rather a personal allusion to mister Tuckle s crimson livery that gentleman looked majestic for a few seconds but gradually edging away from the fire broke into a forced smile and said it wasn t bad Wery much obliged for your good opinion sir replied Sam We shall get on by degrees I des say We ll try a better one by and bye At this point the conversation was interrupted by the arrival of a gentleman in orange coloured plush accompanied by another selection in purple cloth with a great extent of stocking The new comers having been welcomed by the old ones mister Tuckle put the question that supper be ordered in which was carried unanimously The greengrocer and his wife then arranged upon the table a boiled leg of mutton hot with caper sauce turnips and potatoes mister Tuckle took the chair and was supported at the other end of the board by the gentleman in orange plush The greengrocer put on a pair of wash leather gloves to hand the plates with and stationed himself behind mister Tuckle s chair Harris said mister Tuckle in a commanding tone Sir said the greengrocer Have you got your gloves on Yes Sir Then take the kiver off Yes Sir The greengrocer did as he was told with a show of great humility and obsequiously handed mister Tuckle the carving knife in doing which he accidentally gaped What do you mean by that Sir said mister Tuckle with great asperity I beg your pardon Sir replied the crestfallen greengrocer I didn t mean to do it Sir I was up very late last night Sir I tell you what my opinion of you is Harris said mister Tuckle with a most impressive air you re a wulgar beast I hope gentlemen said Harris that you won t be severe with me gentlemen I am very much obliged to you indeed gentlemen for your patronage and also for your recommendations gentlemen whenever additional assistance in waiting is required I hope gentlemen I give satisfaction No you don t Sir said mister Tuckle Very far from it Sir We consider you an inattentive reskel said the gentleman in the orange plush And a low thief added the gentleman in the green foil smalls And an unreclaimable blaygaird added the gentleman in purple The poor greengrocer bowed very humbly while these little epithets were bestowed upon him in the true spirit of the very smallest tyranny and when everybody had said something to show his superiority mister Tuckle proceeded to carve the leg of mutton and to help the company This important business of the evening had hardly commenced when the door was thrown briskly open and another gentleman in a light blue suit and leaden buttons made his appearance Against the rules said mister Tuckle Too late too late No no positively I couldn t help it said the gentleman in blue I appeal to the company An affair of gallantry now an appointment at the theayter Oh that indeed said the gentleman in the orange plush Yes raly now honour bright said the man in blue I made a promese to fetch our youngest daughter at half past ten and she is such an uncauminly fine gal that I raly hadn t the art to disappint her No offence to the present company Sir but a petticut sir a petticut Sir is irrevokeable I begin to suspect there s something in that quarter said Tuckle as the new comer took his seat next Sam I ve remarked once or twice that she leans very heavy on your shoulder when she gets in and out of the carriage Oh raly raly Tuckle you shouldn t said the man in blue It s not fair I may have said to one or two friends that she wos a very divine creechure and had refused one or two offers without any hobvus cause but no no no indeed Tuckle before strangers too it s not right you shouldn t Delicacy my dear friend delicacy And the man in blue pulling up his neckerchief and adjusting his coat cuffs nodded and frowned as if there were more behind which he could say if he liked but was bound in honour to suppress The man in blue being a light haired stiff necked free and easy sort of footman with a swaggering air and pert face had attracted mister Weller s special attention at first but when he began to come out in this way Sam felt more than ever disposed to cultivate his acquaintance so he launched himself into the conversation at once with characteristic independence Your health Sir said Sam I like your conversation much I think it s wery pretty At this the man in blue smiled as if it were a compliment he was well used to but looked approvingly on Sam at the same time and said he hoped he should be better acquainted with him for without any flattery at all he seemed to have the makings of a very nice fellow about him and to be just the man after his own heart You re wery good sir said Sam What a lucky feller you are How do you mean inquired the gentleman in blue That ere young lady replied Sam She knows wot s wot she does Ah I see mister Weller closed one eye and shook his head from side to side in a manner which was highly gratifying to the personal vanity of the gentleman in blue I m afraid your a cunning fellow mister Weller said that individual No no said Sam I leave all that ere to you It s a great deal more in your way than mine as the general l m n on the right side o the garden vall said to the man on the wrong un ven the mad bull vos a comin up the lane Well well mister Weller said the gentleman in blue I think she has remarked my air and manner mister Weller I should think she couldn t wery well be off o that said Sam Have you any little thing of that kind in hand sir inquired the favoured gentleman in blue drawing a toothpick from his waistcoat pocket Not exactly said Sam There s no daughters at my place else o course I should ha made up to vun on em As it is I don t think I can do with anythin under a female markis I might keep up with a young ooman o large property as hadn t a title if she made wery fierce love to me Not else Of course not mister Weller said the gentleman in blue one can t be troubled you know and WE know mister Weller we who are men of the world that a good uniform must work its way with the women sooner or later In fact that s the only thing between you and me that makes the service worth entering into Just so said Sam That s it o course When this confidential dialogue had gone thus far glasses were placed round and every gentleman ordered what he liked best before the public house shut up The gentleman in blue and the man in orange who were the chief exquisites of the party ordered cold shrub and water but with the others gin and water sweet appeared to be the favourite beverage Sam called the greengrocer a desp rate willin and ordered a large bowl of punch two circumstances which seemed to raise him very much in the opinion of the selections Gentlemen said the man in blue with an air of the most consummate dandyism I ll give you the ladies come Hear hear said Sam The young mississes Here there was a loud cry of Order and mister John Smauker as the gentleman who had introduced mister Weller into that company begged to inform him that the word he had just made use of was unparliamentary Which word was that ere Sir inquired Sam Mississes Sir replied mister John Smauker with an alarming frown We don t recognise such distinctions here Oh wery good said Sam then I ll amend the obserwation and call em the dear creeturs if Blazes vill allow me Some doubt appeared to exist in the mind of the gentleman in the green foil smalls whether the chairman could be legally appealed to as Blazes but as the company seemed more disposed to stand upon their own rights than his the question was not raised The man with the cocked hat breathed short and looked long at Sam but apparently thought it as well to say nothing in case he should get the worst of it After a short silence a gentleman in an embroidered coat reaching down to his heels and a waistcoat of the same which kept one half of his legs warm stirred his gin and water with great energy and putting himself upon his feet all at once by a violent effort said he was desirous of offering a few remarks to the company whereupon the person in the cocked hat had no doubt that the company would be very happy to hear any remarks that the man in the long coat might wish to offer I feel a great delicacy gentlemen in coming for ard said the man in the long coat having the misforchune to be a coachman and being only admitted as a honorary member of these agreeable swarrys but I do feel myself bound gentlemen drove into a corner if I may use the expression to make known an afflicting circumstance which has come to my knowledge which has happened I may say within the soap of my everyday contemplation Gentlemen our friend mister Whiffers everybody looked at the individual in orange our friend mister Whiffers has resigned Universal astonishment fell upon the hearers Each gentleman looked in his neighbour s face and then transferred his glance to the upstanding coachman You may well be sapparised gentlemen said the coachman I will not wenchure to state the reasons of this irrepairabel loss to the service but I will beg mister Whiffers to state them himself for the improvement and imitation of his admiring friends The suggestion being loudly approved of mister Whiffers explained He said he certainly could have wished to have continued to hold the appointment he had just resigned The uniform was extremely rich and expensive the females of the family was most agreeable and the duties of the situation was not he was bound to say too heavy the principal service that was required of him being that he should look out of the hall window as much as possible in company with another gentleman who had also resigned He could have wished to have spared that company the painful and disgusting detail on which he was about to enter but as the explanation had been demanded of him he had no alternative but to state boldly and distinctly that he had been required to eat cold meat It is impossible to conceive the disgust which this avowal awakened in the bosoms of the hearers Loud cries of Shame mingled with groans and hisses prevailed for a quarter of an hour mister Whiffers then added that he feared a portion of this outrage might be traced to his own forbearing and accommodating disposition He had a distinct recollection of having once consented to eat salt butter and he had moreover on an occasion of sudden sickness in the house so far forgotten himself as to carry a coal scuttle up to the second floor He trusted he had not lowered himself in the good opinion of his friends by this frank confession of his faults and he hoped the promptness with which he had resented the last unmanly outrage on his feelings to which he had referred would reinstate him in their good opinion if he had mister Whiffers s address was responded to with a shout of admiration and the health of the interesting martyr was drunk in a most enthusiastic manner for this the martyr returned thanks and proposed their visitor mister Weller a gentleman whom he had not the pleasure of an intimate acquaintance with but who was the friend of mister John Smauker which was a sufficient letter of recommendation to any society of gentlemen whatever or wherever On this account he should have been disposed to have given mister Weller s health with all the honours if his friends had been drinking wine but as they were taking spirits by way of a change and as it might be inconvenient to empty a tumbler at every toast he should propose that the honours be understood At the conclusion of this speech everybody took a sip in honour of Sam and Sam having ladled out and drunk two full glasses of punch in honour of himself returned thanks in a neat speech Wery much obliged to you old fellers said Sam ladling away at the punch in the most unembarrassed manner possible for this here compliment which comin from sich a quarter is wery overvelmin I ve heered a good deal on you as a body but I will say that I never thought you was sich uncommon nice men as I find you air I only hope you ll take care o yourselves and not compromise nothin o your dignity which is a wery charmin thing to see when one s out a walkin and has always made me wery happy to look at ever since I was a boy about half as high as the brass headed stick o my wery respectable friend Blazes there As to the wictim of oppression in the suit o brimstone all I can say of him is that I hope he ll get jist as good a berth as he deserves in vitch case it s wery little cold swarry as ever he ll be troubled with agin Here Sam sat down with a pleasant smile and his speech having been vociferously applauded the company broke up Wy you don t mean to say you re a goin old feller said Sam Weller to his friend mister John Smauker I must indeed said mister Smauker I promised Bantam Oh wery well said Sam that s another thing P raps he d resign if you disappinted him You ain t a goin Blazes Yes I am said the man with the cocked hat Wot and leave three quarters of a bowl of punch behind you said Sam nonsense set down agin mister Tuckle was not proof against this invitation He laid aside the cocked hat and stick which he had just taken up and said he would have one glass for good fellowship s sake As the gentleman in blue went home the same way as mister Tuckle he was prevailed upon to stop too When the punch was about half gone Sam ordered in some oysters from the green grocer s shop and the effect of both was so extremely exhilarating that mister Tuckle dressed out with the cocked hat and stick danced the frog hornpipe among the shells on the table while the gentleman in blue played an accompaniment upon an ingenious musical instrument formed of a hair comb upon a curl paper At last when the punch was all gone and the night nearly so they sallied forth to see each other home mister Tuckle no sooner got into the open air than he was seized with a sudden desire to lie on the curbstone Sam thought it would be a pity to contradict him and so let him have his own way As the cocked hat would have been spoiled if left there Sam very considerately flattened it down on the head of the gentleman in blue and putting the big stick in his hand propped him up against his own street door rang the bell and walked quietly home At a much earlier hour next morning than his usual time of rising mister Pickwick walked downstairs completely dressed and rang the bell Sam said mister Pickwick when mister Weller appeared in reply to the summons shut the door mister Weller did so There was an unfortunate occurrence here last night Sam said mister Pickwick which gave mister Winkle some cause to apprehend violence from mister Dowler So I ve heerd from the old lady downstairs Sir replied Sam And I m sorry to say Sam continued mister Pickwick with a most perplexed countenance that in dread of this violence mister Winkle has gone away Gone avay said Sam Left the house early this morning without the slightest previous communication with me replied mister Pickwick And is gone I know not where He should ha stopped and fought it out Sir replied Sam contemptuously It wouldn t take much to settle that ere Dowler Sir Well Sam said mister Pickwick I may have my doubts of his great bravery and determination also But however that may be mister Winkle is gone He must be found Sam Found and brought back to me And s pose he won t come back Sir said Sam He must be made Sam said mister Pickwick Who s to do it Sir inquired Sam with a smile You replied mister Pickwick Wery good Sir With these words mister Weller left the room and immediately afterwards was heard to shut the street door In two hours time he returned with so much coolness as if he had been despatched on the most ordinary message possible and brought the information that an individual in every respect answering mister Winkle s description had gone over to Bristol that morning by the branch coach from the Royal Hotel Sam said mister Pickwick grasping his hand you re a capital fellow an invaluable fellow You must follow him Sam Cert nly Sir replied mister Weller The instant you discover him write to me immediately Sam said mister Pickwick If he attempts to run away from you knock him down or lock him up You have my full authority Sam I ll be wery careful sir rejoined Sam You ll tell him said mister Pickwick that I am highly excited highly displeased and naturally indignant at the very extraordinary course he has thought proper to pursue I will Sir replied Sam You ll tell him said mister Pickwick that if he does not come back to this very house with you he will come back with me for I will come and fetch him I ll mention that ere Sir rejoined Sam You think you can find him Sam said mister Pickwick looking earnestly in his face Oh I ll find him if he s anyvere rejoined Sam with great confidence Very well said mister Pickwick Then the sooner you go the better With these instructions mister Pickwick placed a sum of money in the hands of his faithful servitor and ordered him to start for Bristol immediately in pursuit of the fugitive Sam put a few necessaries in a carpet bag and was ready for starting He stopped when he had got to the end of the passage and walking quietly back thrust his head in at the parlour door Sir whispered Sam Well Sam said mister Pickwick I fully understands my instructions do I Sir inquired Sam I hope so said mister Pickwick It s reg larly understood about the knockin down is it Sir inquired Sam Perfectly replied Pickwick Thoroughly Do what you think necessary You have my orders Sam gave a nod of intelligence and withdrawing his head from the door set forth on his pilgrimage with a light heart CHAPTER XXXVIII HOW mister WINKLE WHEN HE STEPPED OUT OF THE FRYING PAN WALKED GENTLY AND COMFORTABLY INTO THE FIRE The ill starred gentleman who had been the unfortunate cause of the unusual noise and disturbance which alarmed the inhabitants of the Royal Crescent in manner and form already described after passing a night of great confusion and anxiety left the roof beneath which his friends still slumbered bound he knew not whither The excellent and considerate feelings which prompted mister Winkle to take this step can never be too highly appreciated or too warmly extolled If reasoned mister Winkle with himself if this Dowler attempts as I have no doubt he will to carry into execution his threat of personal violence against myself it will be incumbent on me to call him out He has a wife that wife is attached to and dependent on him Heavens If I should kill him in the blindness of my wrath what would be my feelings ever afterwards This painful consideration operated so powerfully on the feelings of the humane young man as to cause his knees to knock together and his countenance to exhibit alarming manifestations of inward emotion Impelled by such reflections he grasped his carpet bag and creeping stealthily downstairs shut the detestable street door with as little noise as possible and walked off Bending his steps towards the Royal Hotel he found a coach on the point of starting for Bristol and thinking Bristol as good a place for his purpose as any other he could go to he mounted the box and reached his place of destination in such time as the pair of horses who went the whole stage and back again twice a day or more could be reasonably supposed to arrive there He took up his quarters at the Bush and designing to postpone any communication by letter with mister Pickwick until it was probable that mister Dowler s wrath might have in some degree evaporated walked forth to view the city which struck him as being a shade more dirty than any place he had ever seen Having inspected the docks and shipping and viewed the cathedral he inquired his way to Clifton and being directed thither took the route which was pointed out to him But as the pavements of Bristol are not the widest or cleanest upon earth so its streets are not altogether the straightest or least intricate and mister Winkle being greatly puzzled by their manifold windings and twistings looked about him for a decent shop in which he could apply afresh for counsel and instruction His eye fell upon a newly painted tenement which had been recently converted into something between a shop and a private house and which a red lamp projecting over the fanlight of the street door would have sufficiently announced as the residence of a medical practitioner even if the word Surgery had not been inscribed in golden characters on a wainscot ground above the window of what in times bygone had been the front parlour Thinking this an eligible place wherein to make his inquiries mister Winkle stepped into the little shop where the gilt labelled drawers and bottles were and finding nobody there knocked with a half crown on the counter to attract the attention of anybody who might happen to be in the back parlour which he judged to be the innermost and peculiar sanctum of the establishment from the repetition of the word surgery on the door painted in white letters this time by way of taking off the monotony At the first knock a sound as of persons fencing with fire irons which had until now been very audible suddenly ceased at the second a studious looking young gentleman in green spectacles with a very large book in his hand glided quietly into the shop and stepping behind the counter requested to know the visitor s pleasure I am sorry to trouble you Sir said mister Winkle but will you have the goodness to direct me to Ha ha ha roared the studious young gentleman throwing the large book up into the air and catching it with great dexterity at the very moment when it threatened to smash to atoms all the bottles on the counter Here s a start There was without doubt for mister Winkle was so very much astonished at the extraordinary behaviour of the medical gentleman that he involuntarily retreated towards the door and looked very much disturbed at his strange reception What don t you know me said the medical gentleman mister Winkle murmured in reply that he had not that pleasure Why then said the medical gentleman there are hopes for me yet I may attend half the old women in Bristol if I ve decent luck Get out you mouldy old villain get out With this adjuration which was addressed to the large book the medical gentleman kicked the volume with remarkable agility to the farther end of the shop and pulling off his green spectacles grinned the identical grin of Robert Sawyer Esquire formerly of Guy s Hospital in the Borough with a private residence in Lant Street You don t mean to say you weren t down upon me said mister Bob Sawyer shaking mister Winkle s hand with friendly warmth Upon my word I was not replied mister Winkle returning his pressure I wonder you didn t see the name said Bob Sawyer calling his friend s attention to the outer door on which in the same white paint were traced the words Sawyer late Nockemorf It never caught my eye returned mister Winkle Lord if I had known who you were I should have rushed out and caught you in my arms said Bob Sawyer but upon my life I thought you were the King s taxes No said mister Winkle I did indeed responded Bob Sawyer and I was just going to say that I wasn t at home but if you d leave a message I d be sure to give it to myself for he don t know me no more does the Lighting and Paving I think the Church rates guesses who I am and I know the Water works does because I drew a tooth of his when I first came down here But come in come in Chattering in this way mister Bob Sawyer pushed mister Winkle into the back room where amusing himself by boring little circular caverns in the chimney piece with a red hot poker sat no less a person than mister Benjamin Allen Well said mister Winkle This is indeed a pleasure I did not expect What a very nice place you have here Pretty well pretty well replied Bob Sawyer I PASSED soon after that precious party and my friends came down with the needful for this business so I put on a black suit of clothes and a pair of spectacles and came here to look as solemn as I could And a very snug little business you have no doubt said mister Winkle knowingly Very replied Bob Sawyer So snug that at the end of a few years you might put all the profits in a wine glass and cover em over with a gooseberry leaf You cannot surely mean that said mister Winkle The stock itself Dummies my dear boy said Bob Sawyer half the drawers have nothing in em and the other half don t open Nonsense said mister Winkle Fact honour returned Bob Sawyer stepping out into the shop and demonstrating the veracity of the assertion by divers hard pulls at the little gilt knobs on the counterfeit drawers Hardly anything real in the shop but the leeches and THEY are second hand I shouldn t have thought it exclaimed mister Winkle much surprised I hope not replied Bob Sawyer else where s the use of appearances eh But what will you take Do as we do That s right Ben my fine fellow put your hand into the cupboard and bring out the patent digester mister Benjamin Allen smiled his readiness and produced from the closet at his elbow a black bottle half full of brandy You don t take water of course said Bob Sawyer Thank you replied mister Winkle It s rather early I should like to qualify it if you have no objection None in the least if you can reconcile it to your conscience replied Bob Sawyer tossing off as he spoke a glass of the liquor with great relish Ben the pipkin mister Benjamin Allen drew forth from the same hiding place a small brass pipkin which Bob Sawyer observed he prided himself upon particularly because it looked so business like The water in the professional pipkin having been made to boil in course of time by various little shovelfuls of coal which mister Bob Sawyer took out of a practicable window seat labelled Soda Water mister Winkle adulterated his brandy and the conversation was becoming general when it was interrupted by the entrance into the shop of a boy in a sober gray livery and a gold laced hat with a small covered basket under his arm whom mister Bob Sawyer immediately hailed with Tom you vagabond come here The boy presented himself accordingly You ve been stopping to over all the posts in Bristol you idle young scamp said mister Bob Sawyer No sir I haven t replied the boy You had better not said mister Bob Sawyer with a threatening aspect Who do you suppose will ever employ a professional man when they see his boy playing at marbles in the gutter or flying the garter in the horse road Have you no feeling for your profession you groveller Did you leave all the medicine Yes Sir The powders for the child at the large house with the new family and the pills to be taken four times a day at the ill tempered old gentleman s with the gouty leg Yes sir Then shut the door and mind the shop Come said mister Winkle as the boy retired things are not quite so bad as you would have me believe either There is SOME medicine to be sent out mister Bob Sawyer peeped into the shop to see that no stranger was within hearing and leaning forward to mister Winkle said in a low tone He leaves it all at the wrong houses mister Winkle looked perplexed and Bob Sawyer and his friend laughed Don t you see said Bob He goes up to a house rings the area bell pokes a packet of medicine without a direction into the servant s hand and walks off Servant takes it into the dining parlour master opens it and reads the label Draught to be taken at bedtime pills as before lotion as usual the powder From Sawyer s late Nockemorf s Physicians prescriptions carefully prepared and all the rest of it Shows it to his wife she reads the label it goes down to the servants THEY read the label Next day boy calls Very sorry his mistake immense business great many parcels to deliver mister Sawyer s compliments late Nockemorf The name gets known and that s the thing my boy in the medical way Bless your heart old fellow it s better than all the advertising in the world We have got one four ounce bottle that s been to half the houses in Bristol and hasn t done yet Dear me I see observed mister Winkle what an excellent plan Oh Ben and I have hit upon a dozen such replied Bob Sawyer with great glee The lamplighter has eighteenpence a week to pull the night bell for ten minutes every time he comes round and my boy always rushes into the church just before the psalms when the people have got nothing to do but look about em and calls me out with horror and dismay depicted on his countenance Bless my soul everybody says somebody taken suddenly ill Sawyer late Nockemorf sent for What a business that young man has At the termination of this disclosure of some of the mysteries of medicine mister Bob Sawyer and his friend Ben Allen threw themselves back in their respective chairs and laughed boisterously When they had enjoyed the joke to their heart s content the discourse changed to topics in which mister Winkle was more immediately interested We think we have hinted elsewhere that mister Benjamin Allen had a way of becoming sentimental after brandy The case is not a peculiar one as we ourself can testify having on a few occasions had to deal with patients who have been afflicted in a similar manner At this precise period of his existence mister Benjamin Allen had perhaps a greater predisposition to maudlinism than he had ever known before the cause of which malady was briefly this He had been staying nearly three weeks with mister Bob Sawyer mister Bob Sawyer was not remarkable for temperance nor was mister Benjamin Allen for the ownership of a very strong head the consequence was that during the whole space of time just mentioned mister Benjamin Allen had been wavering between intoxication partial and intoxication complete My dear friend said mister Ben Allen taking advantage of mister Bob Sawyer s temporary absence behind the counter whither he had retired to dispense some of the second hand leeches previously referred to my dear friend I am very miserable mister Winkle professed his heartfelt regret to hear it and begged to know whether he could do anything to alleviate the sorrows of the suffering student Nothing my dear boy nothing said Ben You recollect Arabella Winkle My sister Arabella a little girl Winkle with black eyes when we were down at Wardle s I don t know whether you happened to notice her a nice little girl Winkle Perhaps my features may recall her countenance to your recollection mister Winkle required nothing to recall the charming Arabella to his mind and it was rather fortunate he did not for the features of her brother Benjamin would unquestionably have proved but an indifferent refresher to his memory He answered with as much calmness as he could assume that he perfectly remembered the young lady referred to and sincerely trusted she was in good health Our friend Bob is a delightful fellow Winkle was the only reply of mister Ben Allen Very said mister Winkle not much relishing this close connection of the two names I designed em for each other they were made for each other sent into the world for each other born for each other Winkle said mister Ben Allen setting down his glass with emphasis There s a special destiny in the matter my dear sir there s only five years difference between em and both their birthdays are in August mister Winkle was too anxious to hear what was to follow to express much wonderment at this extraordinary coincidence marvellous as it was so mister Ben Allen after a tear or two went on to say that notwithstanding all his esteem and respect and veneration for his friend Arabella had unaccountably and undutifully evinced the most determined antipathy to his person And I think said mister Ben Allen in conclusion I think there s a prior attachment Have you any idea who the object of it might be asked mister Winkle with great trepidation mister Ben Allen seized the poker flourished it in a warlike manner above his head inflicted a savage blow on an imaginary skull and wound up by saying in a very expressive manner that he only wished he could guess that was all I d show him what I thought of him said mister Ben Allen And round went the poker again more fiercely than before All this was of course very soothing to the feelings of mister Winkle who remained silent for a few minutes but at length mustered up resolution to inquire whether Miss Allen was in Kent No no said mister Ben Allen laying aside the poker and looking very cunning I didn t think Wardle s exactly the place for a headstrong girl so as I am her natural protector and guardian our parents being dead I have brought her down into this part of the country to spend a few months at an old aunt s in a nice dull close place I think that will cure her my boy If it doesn t I ll take her abroad for a little while and see what that ll do Oh the aunt s is in Bristol is it faltered mister Winkle No no not in Bristol replied mister Ben Allen jerking his thumb over his right shoulder over that way down there But hush here s Bob Not a word my dear friend not a word Short as this conversation was it roused in mister Winkle the highest degree of excitement and anxiety The suspected prior attachment rankled in his heart Could he be the object of it Could it be for him that the fair Arabella had looked scornfully on the sprightly Bob Sawyer or had he a successful rival He determined to see her cost what it might but here an insurmountable objection presented itself for whether the explanatory over that way and down there of mister Ben Allen meant three miles off or thirty or three hundred he could in no wise guess But he had no opportunity of pondering over his love just then for Bob Sawyer s return was the immediate precursor of the arrival of a meat pie from the baker s of which that gentleman insisted on his staying to partake The cloth was laid by an occasional charwoman who officiated in the capacity of mister Bob Sawyer s housekeeper and a third knife and fork having been borrowed from the mother of the boy in the gray livery for mister Sawyer s domestic arrangements were as yet conducted on a limited scale they sat down to dinner the beer being served up as mister Sawyer remarked in its native pewter After dinner mister Bob Sawyer ordered in the largest mortar in the shop and proceeded to brew a reeking jorum of rum punch therein stirring up and amalgamating the materials with a pestle in a very creditable and apothecary like manner mister Sawyer being a bachelor had only one tumbler in the house which was assigned to mister Winkle as a compliment to the visitor mister Ben Allen being accommodated with a funnel with a cork in the narrow end and Bob Sawyer contented himself with one of those wide lipped crystal vessels inscribed with a variety of cabalistic characters in which chemists are wont to measure out their liquid drugs in compounding prescriptions These preliminaries adjusted the punch was tasted and pronounced excellent and it having been arranged that Bob Sawyer and Ben Allen should be considered at liberty to fill twice to mister Winkle s once they started fair with great satisfaction and good fellowship There was no singing because mister Bob Sawyer said it wouldn t look professional but to make amends for this deprivation there was so much talking and laughing that it might have been heard and very likely was at the end of the street Which conversation materially lightened the hours and improved the mind of mister Bob Sawyer s boy who instead of devoting the evening to his ordinary occupation of writing his name on the counter and rubbing it out again peeped through the glass door and thus listened and looked on at the same time The mirth of mister Bob Sawyer was rapidly ripening into the furious mister Ben Allen was fast relapsing into the sentimental and the punch had well nigh disappeared altogether when the boy hastily running in announced that a young woman had just come over to say that Sawyer late Nockemorf was wanted directly a couple of streets off This broke up the party mister Bob Sawyer understanding the message after some twenty repetitions tied a wet cloth round his head to sober himself and having partially succeeded put on his green spectacles and issued forth Resisting all entreaties to stay till he came back and finding it quite impossible to engage mister Ben Allen in any intelligible conversation on the subject nearest his heart or indeed on any other mister Winkle took his departure and returned to the Bush The anxiety of his mind and the numerous meditations which Arabella had awakened prevented his share of the mortar of punch producing that effect upon him which it would have had under other circumstances So after taking a glass of soda water and brandy at the bar he turned into the coffee room dispirited rather than elevated by the occurrences of the evening Sitting in front of the fire with his back towards him was a tallish gentleman in a greatcoat the only other occupant of the room It was rather a cool evening for the season of the year and the gentleman drew his chair aside to afford the new comer a sight of the fire What were mister Winkle s feelings when in doing so he disclosed to view the face and figure of the vindictive and sanguinary Dowler mister Winkle s first impulse was to give a violent pull at the nearest bell handle but that unfortunately happened to be immediately behind mister Dowler s head He had made one step towards it before he checked himself As he did so mister Dowler very hastily drew back mister Winkle Sir Be calm Don t strike me I won t bear it A blow Never said mister Dowler looking meeker than mister Winkle had expected in a gentleman of his ferocity A blow Sir stammered mister Winkle A blow Sir replied Dowler Compose your feelings Sit down Hear me Sir said mister Winkle trembling from head to foot before I consent to sit down beside or opposite you without the presence of a waiter I must be secured by some further understanding You used a threat against me last night Sir a dreadful threat Sir Here mister Winkle turned very pale indeed and stopped short I did said Dowler with a countenance almost as white as mister Winkle s Circumstances were suspicious They have been explained I respect your bravery Your feeling is upright Conscious innocence There s my hand Grasp it Really Sir said mister Winkle hesitating whether to give his hand or not and almost fearing that it was demanded in order that he might be taken at an advantage really Sir I I know what you mean interposed Dowler You feel aggrieved Very natural So should I I was wrong I beg your pardon Be friendly Forgive me With this Dowler fairly forced his hand upon mister Winkle and shaking it with the utmost vehemence declared he was a fellow of extreme spirit and he had a higher opinion of him than ever Now said Dowler sit down Relate it all How did you find me When did you follow Be frank Tell me It s quite accidental replied mister Winkle greatly perplexed by the curious and unexpected nature of the interview Quite Glad of it said Dowler I woke this morning I had forgotten my threat I laughed at the accident I felt friendly I said so To whom inquired mister Winkle To missus Dowler You made a vow said she I did said I It was a rash one said she It was said I I ll apologise Where is he Who inquired mister Winkle You replied Dowler I went downstairs You were not to be found Pickwick looked gloomy Shook his head Hoped no violence would be committed I saw it all You felt yourself insulted You had gone for a friend perhaps Possibly for pistols High spirit said I I admire him mister Winkle coughed and beginning to see how the land lay assumed a look of importance I left a note for you resumed Dowler I said I was sorry So I was Pressing business called me here You were not satisfied You followed You required a verbal explanation You were right It s all over now My business is finished I go back to morrow Join me As Dowler progressed in his explanation mister Winkle s countenance grew more and more dignified The mysterious nature of the commencement of their conversation was explained mister Dowler had as great an objection to duelling as himself in short this blustering and awful personage was one of the most egregious cowards in existence and interpreting mister Winkle s absence through the medium of his own fears had taken the same step as himself and prudently retired until all excitement of feeling should have subsided As the real state of the case dawned upon mister Winkle s mind he looked very terrible and said he was perfectly satisfied but at the same time said so with an air that left mister Dowler no alternative but to infer that if he had not been something most horrible and destructive must inevitably have occurred mister Dowler appeared to be impressed with a becoming sense of mister Winkle s magnanimity and condescension and the two belligerents parted for the night with many protestations of eternal friendship About half past twelve o clock when mister Winkle had been revelling some twenty minutes in the full luxury of his first sleep he was suddenly awakened by a loud knocking at his chamber door which being repeated with increased vehemence caused him to start up in bed and inquire who was there and what the matter was Please Sir here s a young man which says he must see you directly responded the voice of the chambermaid A young man exclaimed mister Winkle No mistake about that ere Sir replied another voice through the keyhole and if that wery same interestin young creetur ain t let in vithout delay it s wery possible as his legs vill enter afore his countenance The young man gave a gentle kick at one of the lower panels of the door after he had given utterance to this hint as if to add force and point to the remark Is that you Sam inquired mister Winkle springing out of bed Quite unpossible to identify any general l m n vith any degree o mental satisfaction vithout lookin at him Sir replied the voice dogmatically mister Winkle not much doubting who the young man was unlocked the door which he had no sooner done than mister Samuel Weller entered with great precipitation and carefully relocking it on the inside deliberately put the key in his waistcoat pocket and after surveying mister Winkle from head to foot said You re a wery humorous young general l m n you air Sir What do you mean by this conduct Sam inquired mister Winkle indignantly Get out sir this instant What do you mean Sir What do I mean retorted Sam come Sir this is rayther too rich as the young lady said when she remonstrated with the pastry cook arter he d sold her a pork pie as had got nothin but fat inside What do I mean Well that ain t a bad un that ain t Unlock that door and leave this room immediately Sir said mister Winkle I shall leave this here room sir just precisely at the wery same moment as you leaves it responded Sam speaking in a forcible manner and seating himself with perfect gravity If I find it necessary to carry you away pick a back o course I shall leave it the least bit o time possible afore you but allow me to express a hope as you won t reduce me to extremities in saying wich I merely quote wot the nobleman said to the fractious pennywinkle ven he vouldn t come out of his shell by means of a pin and he conseqvently began to be afeered that he should be obliged to crack him in the parlour door At the end of this address which was unusually lengthy for him mister Weller planted his hands on his knees and looked full in mister Winkle s face with an expression of countenance which showed that he had not the remotest intention of being trifled with You re a amiably disposed young man Sir I don t think resumed mister Weller in a tone of moral reproof to go inwolving our precious governor in all sorts o fanteegs wen he s made up his mind to go through everythink for principle You re far worse nor Dodson Sir and as for Fogg I consider him a born angel to you mister Weller having accompanied this last sentiment with an emphatic slap on each knee folded his arms with a look of great disgust and threw himself back in his chair as if awaiting the criminal s defence My good fellow said mister Winkle extending his hand his teeth chattering all the time he spoke for he had been standing during the whole of mister Weller s lecture in his night gear my good fellow I respect your attachment to my excellent friend and I am very sorry indeed to have added to his causes for disquiet There Sam there Well said Sam rather sulkily but giving the proffered hand a respectful shake at the same time well so you ought to be and I am very glad to find you air for if I can help it I won t have him put upon by nobody and that s all about it Certainly not Sam said mister Winkle There Now go to bed Sam and we ll talk further about this in the morning I m wery sorry said Sam but I can t go to bed Not go to bed repeated mister Winkle No said Sam shaking his head Can t be done You don t mean to say you re going back to night Sam urged mister Winkle greatly surprised Not unless you particklerly wish it replied Sam but I mustn t leave this here room The governor s orders wos peremptory Nonsense Sam said mister Winkle I must stop here two or three days and more than that Sam you must stop here too to assist me in gaining an interview with a young lady Miss Allen Sam you remember her whom I must and will see before I leave Bristol But in reply to each of these positions Sam shook his head with great firmness and energetically replied It can t be done After a great deal of argument and representation on the part of mister Winkle however and a full disclosure of what had passed in the interview with Dowler Sam began to waver and at length a compromise was effected of which the following were the main and principal conditions That Sam should retire and leave mister Winkle in the undisturbed possession of his apartment on the condition that he had permission to lock the door on the outside and carry off the key provided always that in the event of an alarm of fire or other dangerous contingency the door should be instantly unlocked That a letter should be written to mister Pickwick early next morning and forwarded per Dowler requesting his consent to Sam and mister Winkle s remaining at Bristol for the purpose and with the object already assigned and begging an answer by the next coach if favourable the aforesaid parties to remain accordingly and if not to return to Bath immediately on the receipt thereof And lastly that mister Winkle should be understood as distinctly pledging himself not to resort to the window fireplace or other surreptitious mode of escape in the meanwhile These stipulations having been concluded Sam locked the door and departed He had nearly got downstairs when he stopped and drew the key from his pocket I quite forgot about the knockin down said Sam half turning back The governor distinctly said it was to be done Amazin stupid o me that ere Never mind said Sam brightening up it s easily done to morrow anyvays Apparently much consoled by this reflection mister Weller once more deposited the key in his pocket and descending the remainder of the stairs without any fresh visitations of conscience was soon in common with the other inmates of the house buried in profound repose CHAPTER XXXIX mister SAMUEL WELLER BEING INTRUSTED WITH A MISSION OF LOVE PROCEEDS TO EXECUTE IT WITH WHAT SUCCESS WILL HEREINAFTER APPEAR During the whole of next day Sam kept mister Winkle steadily in sight fully determined not to take his eyes off him for one instant until he should receive express instructions from the fountain head However disagreeable Sam s very close watch and great vigilance were to mister Winkle he thought it better to bear with them than by any act of violent opposition to hazard being carried away by force which mister Weller more than once strongly hinted was the line of conduct that a strict sense of duty prompted him to pursue There is little reason to doubt that Sam would very speedily have quieted his scruples by bearing mister Winkle back to Bath bound hand and foot had not mister Pickwick s prompt attention to the note which Dowler had undertaken to deliver forestalled any such proceeding In short at eight o clock in the evening mister Pickwick himself walked into the coffee room of the Bush Tavern and told Sam with a smile to his very great relief that he had done quite right and it was unnecessary for him to mount guard any longer I thought it better to come myself said mister Pickwick addressing mister Winkle as Sam disencumbered him of his great coat and travelling shawl to ascertain before I gave my consent to Sam s employment in this matter that you are quite in earnest and serious with respect to this young lady Serious from my heart from my soul returned mister Winkle with great energy Remember said mister Pickwick with beaming eyes we met her at our excellent and hospitable friend s Winkle It would be an ill return to tamper lightly and without due consideration with this young lady s affections I ll not allow that sir I ll not allow it I have no such intention indeed exclaimed mister Winkle warmly I have considered the matter well for a long time and I feel that my happiness is bound up in her That s wot we call tying it up in a small parcel sir interposed mister Weller with an agreeable smile mister Winkle looked somewhat stern at this interruption and mister Pickwick angrily requested his attendant not to jest with one of the best feelings of our nature to which Sam replied That he wouldn t if he was aware on it but there were so many on em that he hardly know d which was the best ones wen he heerd em mentioned mister Winkle then recounted what had passed between himself and mister Ben Allen relative to Arabella stated that his object was to gain an interview with the young lady and make a formal disclosure of his passion and declared his conviction founded on certain dark hints and mutterings of the aforesaid Ben that wherever she was at present immured it was somewhere near the Downs And this was his whole stock of knowledge or suspicion on the subject With this very slight clue to guide him it was determined that mister Weller should start next morning on an expedition of discovery it was also arranged that mister Pickwick and mister Winkle who were less confident of their powers should parade the town meanwhile and accidentally drop in upon mister Bob Sawyer in the course of the day in the hope of seeing or hearing something of the young lady s whereabouts Accordingly next morning Sam Weller issued forth upon his quest in no way daunted by the very discouraging prospect before him and away he walked up one street and down another we were going to say up one hill and down another only it s all uphill at Clifton without meeting with anything or anybody that tended to throw the faintest light on the matter in hand Many were the colloquies into which Sam entered with grooms who were airing horses on roads and nursemaids who were airing children in lanes but nothing could Sam elicit from either the first mentioned or the last which bore the slightest reference to the object of his artfully prosecuted inquiries There were a great many young ladies in a great many houses the greater part whereof were shrewdly suspected by the male and female domestics to be deeply attached to somebody or perfectly ready to become so if opportunity afforded But as none among these young ladies was Miss Arabella Allen the information left Sam at exactly the old point of wisdom at which he had stood before Sam struggled across the Downs against a good high wind wondering whether it was always necessary to hold your hat on with both hands in that part of the country and came to a shady by place about which were sprinkled several little villas of quiet and secluded appearance Outside a stable door at the bottom of a long back lane without a thoroughfare a groom in undress was idling about apparently persuading himself that he was doing something with a spade and a wheel barrow We may remark in this place that we have scarcely ever seen a groom near a stable in his lazy moments who has not been to a greater or less extent the victim of this singular delusion Sam thought he might as well talk to this groom as to any one else especially as he was very tired with walking and there was a good large stone just opposite the wheel barrow so he strolled down the lane and seating himself on the stone opened a conversation with the ease and freedom for which he was remarkable Mornin old friend said Sam Arternoon you mean replied the groom casting a surly look at Sam You re wery right old friend said Sam I DO mean arternoon How are you Why I don t find myself much the better for seeing of you replied the ill tempered groom That s wery odd that is said Sam for you look so uncommon cheerful and seem altogether so lively that it does vun s heart good to see you The surly groom looked surlier still at this but not sufficiently so to produce any effect upon Sam who immediately inquired with a countenance of great anxiety whether his master s name was not Walker No it ain t said the groom Nor Brown I s pose said Sam No it ain t Nor Vilson No nor that ither said the groom Vell replied Sam then I m mistaken and he hasn t got the honour o my acquaintance which I thought he had Don t wait here out o compliment to me said Sam as the groom wheeled in the barrow and prepared to shut the gate Ease afore ceremony old boy I ll excuse you I d knock your head off for half a crown said the surly groom bolting one half of the gate Couldn t afford to have it done on those terms rejoined Sam It ud be worth a life s board wages at least to you and ud be cheap at that Make my compliments indoors Tell em not to vait dinner for me and say they needn t mind puttin any by for it ll be cold afore I come in In reply to this the groom waxing very wroth muttered a desire to damage somebody s person but disappeared without carrying it into execution slamming the door angrily after him and wholly unheeding Sam s affectionate request that he would leave him a lock of his hair before he went Sam continued to sit on the large stone meditating upon what was best to be done and revolving in his mind a plan for knocking at all the doors within five miles of Bristol taking them at a hundred and fifty or two hundred a day and endeavouring to find Miss Arabella by that expedient when accident all of a sudden threw in his way what he might have sat there for a twelvemonth and yet not found without it Into the lane where he sat there opened three or four garden gates belonging to as many houses which though detached from each other were only separated by their gardens As these were large and long and well planted with trees the houses were not only at some distance off but the greater part of them were nearly concealed from view Sam was sitting with his eyes fixed upon the dust heap outside the next gate to that by which the groom had disappeared profoundly turning over in his mind the difficulties of his present undertaking when the gate opened and a female servant came out into the lane to shake some bedside carpets Sam was so very busy with his own thoughts that it is probable he would have taken no more notice of the young woman than just raising his head and remarking that she had a very neat and pretty figure if his feelings of gallantry had not been most strongly roused by observing that she had no one to help her and that the carpets seemed too heavy for her single strength mister Weller was a gentleman of great gallantry in his own way and he no sooner remarked this circumstance than he hastily rose from the large stone and advanced towards her My dear said Sam sliding up with an air of great respect you ll spile that wery pretty figure out o all perportion if you shake them carpets by yourself Let me help you The young lady who had been coyly affecting not to know that a gentleman was so near turned round as Sam spoke no doubt indeed she said so afterwards to decline this offer from a perfect stranger when instead of speaking she started back and uttered a half suppressed scream Sam was scarcely less staggered for in the countenance of the well shaped female servant he beheld the very features of his valentine the pretty housemaid from mister Nupkins s Wy Mary my dear said Sam Lauk mister Weller said Mary how you do frighten one Sam made no verbal answer to this complaint nor can we precisely say what reply he did make We merely know that after a short pause Mary said Lor do adun mister Weller and that his hat had fallen off a few moments before from both of which tokens we should be disposed to infer that one kiss or more had passed between the parties Why how did you come here said Mary when the conversation to which this interruption had been offered was resumed O course I came to look arter you my darlin replied mister Weller for once permitting his passion to get the better of his veracity And how did you know I was here inquired Mary Who could have told you that I took another service at Ipswich and that they afterwards moved all the way here Who COULD have told you that mister Weller Ah to be sure said Sam with a cunning look that s the pint Who could ha told me It wasn t mister Muzzle was it inquired Mary Oh no replied Sam with a solemn shake of the head it warn t him It must have been the cook said Mary O course it must said Sam Well I never heard the like of that exclaimed Mary No more did I said Sam But Mary my dear here Sam s manner grew extremely affectionate Mary my dear I ve got another affair in hand as is wery pressin There s one o my governor s friends mister Winkle you remember him Him in the green coat said Mary Oh yes I remember him Well said Sam he s in a horrid state o love reg larly comfoozled and done over vith it Lor interposed Mary Yes said Sam but that s nothin if we could find out the young ooman and here Sam with many digressions upon the personal beauty of Mary and the unspeakable tortures he had experienced since he last saw her gave a faithful account of mister Winkle s present predicament Well said Mary I never did O course not said Sam and nobody never did nor never vill neither and here am I a walkin about like the wandering Jew a sportin character you have perhaps heerd on Mary my dear as vos alvays doin a match agin time and never vent to sleep looking arter this here Miss Arabella Allen Miss who said Mary in great astonishment Miss Arabella Allen said Sam Goodness gracious said Mary pointing to the garden door which the sulky groom had locked after him Why it s that very house she s been living there these six weeks Their upper house maid which is lady s maid too told me all about it over the wash house palin s before the family was out of bed one mornin Wot the wery next door to you said Sam The very next replied Mary mister Weller was so deeply overcome on receiving this intelligence that he found it absolutely necessary to cling to his fair informant for support and divers little love passages had passed between them before he was sufficiently collected to return to the subject Vell said Sam at length if this don t beat cock fightin nothin never vill as the lord mayor said ven the chief secretary o state proposed his missis s health arter dinner That wery next house Wy I ve got a message to her as I ve been a trying all day to deliver Ah said Mary but you can t deliver it now because she only walks in the garden in the evening and then only for a very little time she never goes out without the old lady Sam ruminated for a few moments and finally hit upon the following plan of operations that he should return just at dusk the time at which Arabella invariably took her walk and being admitted by Mary into the garden of the house to which she belonged would contrive to scramble up the wall beneath the overhanging boughs of a large pear tree which would effectually screen him from observation would there deliver his message and arrange if possible an interview on behalf of mister Winkle for the ensuing evening at the same hour Having made this arrangement with great despatch he assisted Mary in the long deferred occupation of shaking the carpets It is not half as innocent a thing as it looks that shaking little pieces of carpet at least there may be no great harm in the shaking but the folding is a very insidious process So long as the shaking lasts and the two parties are kept the carpet s length apart it is as innocent an amusement as can well be devised but when the folding begins and the distance between them gets gradually lessened from one half its former length to a quarter and then to an eighth and then to a sixteenth and then to a thirty second if the carpet be long enough it becomes dangerous We do not know to a nicety how many pieces of carpet were folded in this instance but we can venture to state that as many pieces as there were so many times did Sam kiss the pretty housemaid mister Weller regaled himself with moderation at the nearest tavern until it was nearly dusk and then returned to the lane without the thoroughfare Having been admitted into the garden by Mary and having received from that lady sundry admonitions concerning the safety of his limbs and neck Sam mounted into the pear tree to wait until Arabella should come into sight He waited so long without this anxiously expected event occurring that he began to think it was not going to take place at all when he heard light footsteps upon the gravel and immediately afterwards beheld Arabella walking pensively down the garden As soon as she came nearly below the tree Sam began by way of gently indicating his presence to make sundry diabolical noises similar to those which would probably be natural to a person of middle age who had been afflicted with a combination of inflammatory sore throat croup and whooping cough from his earliest infancy Upon this the young lady cast a hurried glance towards the spot whence the dreadful sounds proceeded and her previous alarm being not at all diminished when she saw a man among the branches she would most certainly have decamped and alarmed the house had not fear fortunately deprived her of the power of moving and caused her to sink down on a garden seat which happened by good luck to be near at hand She s a goin off soliloquised Sam in great perplexity Wot a thing it is as these here young creeturs will go a faintin avay just ven they oughtn t to Here young ooman Miss Sawbones missus Vinkle don t Whether it was the magic of mister Winkle s name or the coolness of the open air or some recollection of mister Weller s voice that revived Arabella matters not She raised her head and languidly inquired Who s that and what do you want Hush said Sam swinging himself on to the wall and crouching there in as small a compass as he could reduce himself to only me miss only me mister Pickwick s servant said Arabella earnestly The wery same miss replied Sam Here s mister Vinkle reg larly sewed up vith desperation miss Ah said Arabella drawing nearer the wall Ah indeed said Sam Ve thought ve should ha been obliged to strait veskit him last night he s been a ravin all day and he says if he can t see you afore to morrow night s over he vishes he may be somethin unpleasanted if he don t drownd hisself Oh no no mister Weller said Arabella clasping her hands That s wot he says miss replied Sam coolly He s a man of his word and it s my opinion he ll do it miss He s heerd all about you from the sawbones in barnacles From my brother said Arabella having some faint recognition of Sam s description I don t rightly know which is your brother miss replied Sam Is it the dirtiest vun o the two Yes yes mister Weller returned Arabella go on Make haste pray Well miss said Sam he s heerd all about it from him and it s the gov nor s opinion that if you don t see him wery quick the sawbones as we ve been a speakin on ull get as much extra lead in his head as ll rayther damage the dewelopment o the orgins if they ever put it in spirits artervards Oh what can I do to prevent these dreadful quarrels exclaimed Arabella It s the suspicion of a priory tachment as is the cause of it all replied Sam You d better see him miss But how where cried Arabella I dare not leave the house alone My brother is so unkind so unreasonable I know how strange my talking thus to you may appear mister Weller but I am very very unhappy and here poor Arabella wept so bitterly that Sam grew chivalrous It may seem wery strange talkin to me about these here affairs miss said Sam with great vehemence but all I can say is that I m not only ready but villin to do anythin as ll make matters agreeable and if chuckin either o them sawboneses out o winder ull do it I m the man As Sam Weller said this he tucked up his wristbands at the imminent hazard of falling off the wall in so doing to intimate his readiness to set to work immediately Flattering as these professions of good feeling were Arabella resolutely declined most unaccountably as Sam thought to avail herself of them For some time she strenuously refused to grant mister Winkle the interview Sam had so pathetically requested but at length when the conversation threatened to be interrupted by the unwelcome arrival of a third party she hurriedly gave him to understand with many professions of gratitude that it was barely possible she might be in the garden an hour later next evening Sam understood this perfectly well and Arabella bestowing upon him one of her sweetest smiles tripped gracefully away leaving mister Weller in a state of very great admiration of her charms both personal and mental Having descended in safety from the wall and not forgotten to devote a few moments to his own particular business in the same department mister Weller then made the best of his way back to the Bush where his prolonged absence had occasioned much speculation and some alarm We must be careful said mister Pickwick after listening attentively to Sam s tale not for our sakes but for that of the young lady We must be very cautious WE said mister Winkle with marked emphasis mister Pickwick s momentary look of indignation at the tone of this remark subsided into his characteristic expression of benevolence as he replied WE Sir I shall accompany you You said mister Winkle I replied mister Pickwick mildly In affording you this interview the young lady has taken a natural perhaps but still a very imprudent step If I am present at the meeting a mutual friend who is old enough to be the father of both parties the voice of calumny can never be raised against her hereafter mister Pickwick s eyes lightened with honest exultation at his own foresight as he spoke thus mister Winkle was touched by this little trait of his delicate respect for the young PROTEGEE of his friend and took his hand with a feeling of regard akin to veneration You SHALL go said mister Winkle I will said mister Pickwick Sam have my greatcoat and shawl ready and order a conveyance to be at the door to morrow evening rather earlier than is absolutely necessary in order that we may be in good time mister Weller touched his hat as an earnest of his obedience and withdrew to make all needful preparations for the expedition The coach was punctual to the time appointed and mister Weller after duly installing mister Pickwick and mister Winkle inside took his seat on the box by the driver They alighted as had been agreed on about a quarter of a mile from the place of rendezvous and desiring the coachman to await their return proceeded the remaining distance on foot It was at this stage of the undertaking that mister Pickwick with many smiles and various other indications of great self satisfaction produced from one of his coat pockets a dark lantern with which he had specially provided himself for the occasion and the great mechanical beauty of which he proceeded to explain to mister Winkle as they walked along to the no small surprise of the few stragglers they met I should have been the better for something of this kind in my last garden expedition at night eh Sam said mister Pickwick looking good humouredly round at his follower who was trudging behind Wery nice things if they re managed properly Sir replied mister Weller but wen you don t want to be seen I think they re more useful arter the candle s gone out than wen it s alight mister Pickwick appeared struck by Sam s remarks for he put the lantern into his pocket again and they walked on in silence Down here Sir said Sam Let me lead the way This is the lane Sir Down the lane they went and dark enough it was mister Pickwick brought out the lantern once or twice as they groped their way along and threw a very brilliant little tunnel of light before them about a foot in diameter It was very pretty to look at but seemed to have the effect of rendering surrounding objects rather darker than before At length they arrived at the large stone Here Sam recommended his master and mister Winkle to seat themselves while he reconnoitred and ascertained whether Mary was yet in waiting After an absence of five or ten minutes Sam returned to say that the gate was opened and all quiet Following him with stealthy tread mister Pickwick and mister Winkle soon found themselves in the garden Here everybody said Hush a good many times and that being done no one seemed to have any very distinct apprehension of what was to be done next Is Miss Allen in the garden yet Mary inquired mister Winkle much agitated I don t know sir replied the pretty housemaid The best thing to be done sir will be for mister Weller to give you a hoist up into the tree and perhaps mister Pickwick will have the goodness to see that nobody comes up the lane while I watch at the other end of the garden Goodness gracious what s that That ere blessed lantern ull be the death on us all exclaimed Sam peevishly Take care wot you re a doin on sir you re a sendin a blaze o light right into the back parlour winder Dear me said mister Pickwick turning hastily aside I didn t mean to do that Now it s in the next house sir remonstrated Sam Bless my heart exclaimed mister Pickwick turning round again Now it s in the stable and they ll think the place is afire said Sam Shut it up sir can t you It s the most extraordinary lantern I ever met with in all my life exclaimed mister Pickwick greatly bewildered by the effects he had so unintentionally produced I never saw such a powerful reflector It ll be vun too powerful for us if you keep blazin avay in that manner sir replied Sam as mister Pickwick after various unsuccessful efforts managed to close the slide There s the young lady s footsteps Now mister Winkle sir up vith you Stop stop said mister Pickwick I must speak to her first Help me up Sam Gently Sir said Sam planting his head against the wall and making a platform of his back Step atop o that ere flower pot Sir Now then up vith you I m afraid I shall hurt you Sam said mister Pickwick Never mind me Sir replied Sam Lend him a hand mister Winkle sir Steady sir steady That s the time o day As Sam spoke mister Pickwick by exertions almost supernatural in a gentleman of his years and weight contrived to get upon Sam s back and Sam gently raising himself up and mister Pickwick holding on fast by the top of the wall while mister Winkle clasped him tight by the legs they contrived by these means to bring his spectacles just above the level of the coping My dear said mister Pickwick looking over the wall and catching sight of Arabella on the other side don t be frightened my dear it s only me Oh pray go away mister Pickwick said Arabella Tell them all to go away I am so dreadfully frightened Dear dear mister Pickwick don t stop there You ll fall down and kill yourself I know you will Now pray don t alarm yourself my dear said mister Pickwick soothingly There is not the least cause for fear I assure you Stand firm Sam said mister Pickwick looking down All right sir replied mister Weller Don t be longer than you can conweniently help sir You re rayther heavy Only another moment Sam replied mister Pickwick I merely wished you to know my dear that I should not have allowed my young friend to see you in this clandestine way if the situation in which you are placed had left him any alternative and lest the impropriety of this step should cause you any uneasiness my love it may be a satisfaction to you to know that I am present That s all my dear Indeed mister Pickwick I am very much obliged to you for your kindness and consideration replied Arabella drying her tears with her handkerchief She would probably have said much more had not mister Pickwick s head disappeared with great swiftness in consequence of a false step on Sam s shoulder which brought him suddenly to the ground He was up again in an instant however and bidding mister Winkle make haste and get the interview over ran out into the lane to keep watch with all the courage and ardour of youth mister Winkle himself inspired by the occasion was on the wall in a moment merely pausing to request Sam to be careful of his master I ll take care on him sir replied Sam Leave him to me Where is he What s he doing Sam inquired mister Winkle Bless his old gaiters rejoined Sam looking out at the garden door He s a keepin guard in the lane vith that ere dark lantern like a amiable Guy Fawkes I never see such a fine creetur in my days Blessed if I don t think his heart must ha been born five and twenty year arter his body at least mister Winkle stayed not to hear the encomium upon his friend He had dropped from the wall thrown himself at Arabella s feet and by this time was pleading the sincerity of his passion with an eloquence worthy even of mister Pickwick himself While these things were going on in the open air an elderly gentleman of scientific attainments was seated in his library two or three houses off writing a philosophical treatise and ever and anon moistening his clay and his labours with a glass of claret from a venerable looking bottle which stood by his side In the agonies of composition the elderly gentleman looked sometimes at the carpet sometimes at the ceiling and sometimes at the wall and when neither carpet ceiling nor wall afforded the requisite degree of inspiration he looked out of the window In one of these pauses of invention the scientific gentleman was gazing abstractedly on the thick darkness outside when he was very much surprised by observing a most brilliant light glide through the air at a short distance above the ground and almost instantaneously vanish After a short time the phenomenon was repeated not once or twice but several times at last the scientific gentleman laying down his pen began to consider to what natural causes these appearances were to be assigned They were not meteors they were too low They were not glow worms they were too high They were not will o the wisps they were not fireflies they were not fireworks What could they be Some extraordinary and wonderful phenomenon of nature which no philosopher had ever seen before something which it had been reserved for him alone to discover and which he should immortalise his name by chronicling for the benefit of posterity Full of this idea the scientific gentleman seized his pen again and committed to paper sundry notes of these unparalleled appearances with the date day hour minute and precise second at which they were visible all of which were to form the data of a voluminous treatise of great research and deep learning which should astonish all the atmospherical wiseacres that ever drew breath in any part of the civilised globe He threw himself back in his easy chair wrapped in contemplations of his future greatness The mysterious light appeared more brilliantly than before dancing to all appearance up and down the lane crossing from side to side and moving in an orbit as eccentric as comets themselves The scientific gentleman was a bachelor He had no wife to call in and astonish so he rang the bell for his servant Pruffle said the scientific gentleman there is something very extraordinary in the air to night Did you see that said the scientific gentleman pointing out of the window as the light again became visible Yes I did Sir What do you think of it Pruffle Think of it Sir Yes You have been bred up in this country What should you say was the cause for those lights now The scientific gentleman smilingly anticipated Pruffle s reply that he could assign no cause for them at all Pruffle meditated I should say it was thieves Sir said Pruffle at length You re a fool and may go downstairs said the scientific gentleman Thank you Sir said Pruffle And down he went But the scientific gentleman could not rest under the idea of the ingenious treatise he had projected being lost to the world which must inevitably be the case if the speculation of the ingenious mister Pruffle were not stifled in its birth He put on his hat and walked quickly down the garden determined to investigate the matter to the very bottom Now shortly before the scientific gentleman walked out into the garden mister Pickwick had run down the lane as fast as he could to convey a false alarm that somebody was coming that way occasionally drawing back the slide of the dark lantern to keep himself from the ditch The alarm was no sooner given than mister Winkle scrambled back over the wall and Arabella ran into the house the garden gate was shut and the three adventurers were making the best of their way down the lane when they were startled by the scientific gentleman unlocking his garden gate Hold hard whispered Sam who was of course the first of the party Show a light for just vun second Sir mister Pickwick did as he was desired and Sam seeing a man s head peeping out very cautiously within half a yard of his own gave it a gentle tap with his clenched fist which knocked it with a hollow sound against the gate Having performed this feat with great suddenness and dexterity mister Weller caught mister Pickwick up on his back and followed mister Winkle down the lane at a pace which considering the burden he carried was perfectly astonishing Have you got your vind back agin Sir inquired Sam when they had reached the end Quite Quite now replied mister Pickwick Then come along Sir said Sam setting his master on his feet again Come betveen us sir Not half a mile to run Think you re vinnin a cup sir Now for it Thus encouraged mister Pickwick made the very best use of his legs It may be confidently stated that a pair of black gaiters never got over the ground in better style than did those of mister Pickwick on this memorable occasion The coach was waiting the horses were fresh the roads were good and the driver was willing The whole party arrived in safety at the Bush before mister Pickwick had recovered his breath in with you at once sir said Sam as he helped his master out Don t stop a second in the street arter that ere exercise Beg your pardon sir continued Sam touching his hat as mister Winkle descended hope there warn t a priory tachment sir mister Winkle grasped his humble friend by the hand and whispered in his ear It s all right Sam quite right Upon which mister Weller struck three distinct blows upon his nose in token of intelligence smiled winked and proceeded to put the steps up with a countenance expressive of lively satisfaction As to the scientific gentleman he demonstrated in a masterly treatise that these wonderful lights were the effect of electricity and clearly proved the same by detailing how a flash of fire danced before his eyes when he put his head out of the gate and how he received a shock which stunned him for a quarter of an hour afterwards which demonstration delighted all the scientific associations beyond measure and caused him to be considered a light of science ever afterwards CHAPTER XL INTRODUCES mister PICKWICK TO A NEW AND NOT UNINTERESTING SCENE IN THE GREAT DRAMA OF LIFE The remainder of the period which mister Pickwick had assigned as the duration of the stay at Bath passed over without the occurrence of anything material Trinity term commenced On the expiration of its first week mister Pickwick and his friends returned to London and the former gentleman attended of course by Sam straightway repaired to his old quarters at the George and Vulture On the third morning after their arrival just as all the clocks in the city were striking nine individually and somewhere about nine hundred and ninety nine collectively Sam was taking the air in George Yard when a queer sort of fresh painted vehicle drove up out of which there jumped with great agility throwing the reins to a stout man who sat beside him a queer sort of gentleman who seemed made for the vehicle and the vehicle for him The vehicle was not exactly a gig neither was it a stanhope It was not what is currently denominated a dog cart neither was it a taxed cart nor a chaise cart nor a guillotined cabriolet and yet it had something of the character of each and every of these machines It was painted a bright yellow with the shafts and wheels picked out in black and the driver sat in the orthodox sporting style on cushions piled about two feet above the rail The horse was a bay a well looking animal enough but with something of a flash and dog fighting air about him nevertheless which accorded both with the vehicle and his master The master himself was a man of about forty with black hair and carefully combed whiskers He was dressed in a particularly gorgeous manner with plenty of articles of jewellery about him all about three sizes larger than those which are usually worn by gentlemen and a rough greatcoat to crown the whole Into one pocket of this greatcoat he thrust his left hand the moment he dismounted while from the other he drew forth with his right a very bright and glaring silk handkerchief with which he whisked a speck or two of dust from his boots and then crumpling it in his hand swaggered up the court It had not escaped Sam s attention that when this person dismounted a shabby looking man in a brown greatcoat shorn of divers buttons who had been previously slinking about on the opposite side of the way crossed over and remained stationary close by Having something more than a suspicion of the object of the gentleman s visit Sam preceded him to the George and Vulture and turning sharp round planted himself in the Centre of the doorway Now my fine fellow said the man in the rough coat in an imperious tone attempting at the same time to push his way past Now Sir wot s the matter replied Sam returning the push with compound interest Come none of this my man this won t do with me said the owner of the rough coat raising his voice and turning white Here Smouch Well wot s amiss here growled the man in the brown coat who had been gradually sneaking up the court during this short dialogue Only some insolence of this young man s said the principal giving Sam another push Come none o this gammon growled Smouch giving him another and a harder one This last push had the effect which it was intended by the experienced mister Smouch to produce for while Sam anxious to return the compliment was grinding that gentleman s body against the door post the principal crept past and made his way to the bar whither Sam after bandying a few epithetical remarks with mister Smouch followed at once Good morning my dear said the principal addressing the young lady at the bar with Botany Bay ease and New South Wales gentility which is mister Pickwick s room my dear Show him up said the barmaid to a waiter without deigning another look at the exquisite in reply to his inquiry The waiter led the way upstairs as he was desired and the man in the rough coat followed with Sam behind him who in his progress up the staircase indulged in sundry gestures indicative of supreme contempt and defiance to the unspeakable gratification of the servants and other lookers on mister Smouch who was troubled with a hoarse cough remained below and expectorated in the passage mister Pickwick was fast asleep in bed when his early visitor followed by Sam entered the room The noise they made in so doing awoke him Shaving water Sam said mister Pickwick from within the curtains Shave you directly mister Pickwick said the visitor drawing one of them back from the bed s head I ve got an execution against you at the suit of Bardell Here s the warrant Common Pleas Here s my card I suppose you ll come over to my house Giving mister Pickwick a friendly tap on the shoulder the sheriff s officer for such he was threw his card on the counterpane and pulled a gold toothpick from his waistcoat pocket Namby s the name said the sheriff s deputy as mister Pickwick took his spectacles from under the pillow and put them on to read the card Namby Bell Alley Coleman Street At this point Sam Weller who had had his eyes fixed hitherto on mister Namby s shining beaver interfered Are you a Quaker said Sam I ll let you know I am before I ve done with you replied the indignant officer I ll teach you manners my fine fellow one of these fine mornings Thank ee said Sam I ll do the same to you Take your hat off With this mister Weller in the most dexterous manner knocked mister Namby s hat to the other side of the room with such violence that he had very nearly caused him to swallow the gold toothpick into the bargain Observe this mister Pickwick said the disconcerted officer gasping for breath I ve been assaulted in the execution of my dooty by your servant in your chamber I m in bodily fear I call you to witness this Don t witness nothin Sir interposed Sam Shut your eyes up tight Sir I d pitch him out o winder only he couldn t fall far enough cause o the leads outside Sam said mister Pickwick in an angry voice as his attendant made various demonstrations of hostilities if you say another word or offer the slightest interference with this person I discharge you that instant But Sir said Sam Hold your tongue interposed mister Pickwick Take that hat up again But this Sam flatly and positively refused to do and after he had been severely reprimanded by his master the officer being in a hurry condescended to pick it up himself venting a great variety of threats against Sam meanwhile which that gentleman received with perfect composure merely observing that if mister Namby would have the goodness to put his hat on again he would knock it into the latter end of next week mister Namby perhaps thinking that such a process might be productive of inconvenience to himself declined to offer the temptation and soon after called up Smouch Having informed him that the capture was made and that he was to wait for the prisoner until he should have finished dressing Namby then swaggered out and drove away Smouch requesting mister Pickwick in a surly manner to be as alive as he could for it was a busy time drew up a chair by the door and sat there until he had finished dressing Sam was then despatched for a hackney coach and in it the triumvirate proceeded to Coleman Street It was fortunate the distance was short for mister Smouch besides possessing no very enchanting conversational powers was rendered a decidedly unpleasant companion in a limited space by the physical weakness to which we have elsewhere adverted The coach having turned into a very narrow and dark street stopped before a house with iron bars to all the windows the door posts of which were graced by the name and title of Namby Officer to the Sheriffs of London the inner gate having been opened by a gentleman who might have passed for a neglected twin brother of mister Smouch and who was endowed with a large key for the purpose mister Pickwick was shown into the coffee room This coffee room was a front parlour the principal features of which were fresh sand and stale tobacco smoke mister Pickwick bowed to the three persons who were seated in it when he entered and having despatched Sam for Perker withdrew into an obscure corner and looked thence with some curiosity upon his new companions One of these was a mere boy of nineteen or twenty who though it was yet barely ten o clock was drinking gin and water and smoking a cigar amusements to which judging from his inflamed countenance he had devoted himself pretty constantly for the last year or two of his life Opposite him engaged in stirring the fire with the toe of his right boot was a coarse vulgar young man of about thirty with a sallow face and harsh voice evidently possessed of that knowledge of the world and captivating freedom of manner which is to be acquired in public house parlours and at low billiard tables The third tenant of the apartment was a middle aged man in a very old suit of black who looked pale and haggard and paced up and down the room incessantly stopping now and then to look with great anxiety out of the window as if he expected somebody and then resuming his walk You d better have the loan of my razor this morning mister Ayresleigh said the man who was stirring the fire tipping the wink to his friend the boy Thank you no I shan t want it I expect I shall be out in the course of an hour or so replied the other in a hurried manner Then walking again up to the window and once more returning disappointed he sighed deeply and left the room upon which the other two burst into a loud laugh Well I never saw such a game as that said the gentleman who had offered the razor whose name appeared to be Price Never mister Price confirmed the assertion with an oath and then laughed again when of course the boy who thought his companion one of the most dashing fellows alive laughed also You d hardly think would you now said Price turning towards mister Pickwick that that chap s been here a week yesterday and never once shaved himself yet because he feels so certain he s going out in half an hour s time thinks he may as well put it off till he gets home Poor man said mister Pickwick Are his chances of getting out of his difficulties really so great Chances be d d replied Price he hasn t half the ghost of one I wouldn t give THAT for his chance of walking about the streets this time ten years With this mister Price snapped his fingers contemptuously and rang the bell Give me a sheet of paper Crookey said mister Price to the attendant who in dress and general appearance looked something between a bankrupt glazier and a drover in a state of insolvency and a glass of brandy and water Crookey d ye hear I m going to write to my father and I must have a stimulant or I shan t be able to pitch it strong enough into the old boy At this facetious speech the young boy it is almost needless to say was fairly convulsed That s right said mister Price Never say die All fun ain t it Prime said the young gentleman You ve got some spirit about you you have said Price You ve seen something of life I rather think I have replied the boy He had looked at it through the dirty panes of glass in a bar door mister Pickwick feeling not a little disgusted with this dialogue as well as with the air and manner of the two beings by whom it had been carried on was about to inquire whether he could not be accommodated with a private sitting room when two or three strangers of genteel appearance entered at sight of whom the boy threw his cigar into the fire and whispering to mister Price that they had come to make it all right for him joined them at a table in the farther end of the room It would appear however that matters were not going to be made all right quite so speedily as the young gentleman anticipated for a very long conversation ensued of which mister Pickwick could not avoid hearing certain angry fragments regarding dissolute conduct and repeated forgiveness At last there were very distinct allusions made by the oldest gentleman of the party to one Whitecross Street at which the young gentleman notwithstanding his primeness and his spirit and his knowledge of life into the bargain reclined his head upon the table and howled dismally Very much satisfied with this sudden bringing down of the youth s valour and this effectual lowering of his tone mister Pickwick rang the bell and was shown at his own request into a private room furnished with a carpet table chairs sideboard and sofa and ornamented with a looking glass and various old prints Here he had the advantage of hearing missus Namby s performance on a square piano overhead while the breakfast was getting ready when it came mister Perker came too Aha my dear sir said the little man nailed at last eh Come come I m not sorry for it either because now you ll see the absurdity of this conduct I ve noted down the amount of the taxed costs and damages for which the ca sa was issued and we had better settle at once and lose no time Namby is come home by this time I dare say What say you my dear sir Shall I draw a cheque or will you The little man rubbed his hands with affected cheerfulness as he said this but glancing at mister Pickwick s countenance could not forbear at the same time casting a desponding look towards Sam Weller Perker said mister Pickwick let me hear no more of this I beg I see no advantage in staying here so I Shall go to prison to night You can t go to Whitecross Street my dear Sir said Perker Impossible There are sixty beds in a ward and the bolt s on sixteen hours out of the four and twenty I would rather go to some other place of confinement if I can said mister Pickwick If not I must make the best I can of that You can go to the Fleet my dear Sir if you re determined to go somewhere said Perker That ll do said mister Pickwick I ll go there directly I have finished my breakfast Stop stop my dear Sir not the least occasion for being in such a violent hurry to get into a place that most other men are as eager to get out of said the good natured little attorney We must have a habeas corpus There ll be no judge at chambers till four o clock this afternoon You must wait till then Very good said mister Pickwick with unmoved patience Then we will have a chop here at two See about it Sam and tell them to be punctual mister Pickwick remaining firm despite all the remonstrances and arguments of Perker the chops appeared and disappeared in due course he was then put into another hackney coach and carried off to Chancery Lane after waiting half an hour or so for mister Namby who had a select dinner party and could on no account be disturbed before There were two judges in attendance at Serjeant s Inn one King s Bench and one Common Pleas and a great deal of business appeared to be transacting before them if the number of lawyer s clerks who were hurrying in and out with bundles of papers afforded any test When they reached the low archway which forms the entrance to the inn Perker was detained a few moments parlaying with the coachman about the fare and the change and mister Pickwick stepping to one side to be out of the way of the stream of people that were pouring in and out looked about him with some curiosity The people that attracted his attention most were three or four men of shabby genteel appearance who touched their hats to many of the attorneys who passed and seemed to have some business there the nature of which mister Pickwick could not divine They were curious looking fellows One was a slim and rather lame man in rusty black and a white neckerchief another was a stout burly person dressed in the same apparel with a great reddish black cloth round his neck a third was a little weazen drunken looking body with a pimply face They were loitering about with their hands behind them and now and then with an anxious countenance whispered something in the ear of some of the gentlemen with papers as they hurried by mister Pickwick remembered to have very often observed them lounging under the archway when he had been walking past and his curiosity was quite excited to know to what branch of the profession these dingy looking loungers could possibly belong He was about to propound the question to Namby who kept close beside him sucking a large gold ring on his little finger when Perker bustled up and observing that there was no time to lose led the way into the inn As mister Pickwick followed the lame man stepped up to him and civilly touching his hat held out a written card which mister Pickwick not wishing to hurt the man s feelings by refusing courteously accepted and deposited in his waistcoat pocket Now said Perker turning round before he entered one of the offices to see that his companions were close behind him In here my dear sir Hallo what do you want This last question was addressed to the lame man who unobserved by mister Pickwick made one of the party In reply to it the lame man touched his hat again with all imaginable politeness and motioned towards mister Pickwick No no said Perker with a smile We don t want you my dear friend we don t want you I beg your pardon sir said the lame man The gentleman took my card I hope you will employ me sir The gentleman nodded to me I ll be judged by the gentleman himself You nodded to me sir Pooh pooh nonsense You didn t nod to anybody Pickwick A mistake a mistake said Perker The gentleman handed me his card replied mister Pickwick producing it from his waistcoat pocket I accepted it as the gentleman seemed to wish it in fact I had some curiosity to look at it when I should be at leisure I The little attorney burst into a loud laugh and returning the card to the lame man informing him it was all a mistake whispered to mister Pickwick as the man turned away in dudgeon that he was only a bail A what exclaimed mister Pickwick A bail replied Perker A bail Yes my dear sir half a dozen of em here Bail you to any amount and only charge half a crown Curious trade isn t it said Perker regaling himself with a pinch of snuff What Am I to understand that these men earn a livelihood by waiting about here to perjure themselves before the judges of the land at the rate of half a crown a crime exclaimed mister Pickwick quite aghast at the disclosure Why I don t exactly know about perjury my dear sir replied the little gentleman Harsh word my dear sir very harsh word indeed It s a legal fiction my dear sir nothing more Saying which the attorney shrugged his shoulders smiled took a second pinch of snuff and led the way into the office of the judge s clerk This was a room of specially dirty appearance with a very low ceiling and old panelled walls and so badly lighted that although it was broad day outside great tallow candles were burning on the desks At one end was a door leading to the judge s private apartment round which were congregated a crowd of attorneys and managing clerks who were called in in the order in which their respective appointments stood upon the file Every time this door was opened to let a party out the next party made a violent rush to get in and as in addition to the numerous dialogues which passed between the gentlemen who were waiting to see the judge a variety of personal squabbles ensued between the greater part of those who had seen him there was as much noise as could well be raised in an apartment of such confined dimensions Nor were the conversations of these gentlemen the only sounds that broke upon the ear Standing on a box behind a wooden bar at another end of the room was a clerk in spectacles who was taking the affidavits large batches of which were from time to time carried into the private room by another clerk for the judge s signature There were a large number of attorneys clerks to be sworn and it being a moral impossibility to swear them all at once the struggles of these gentlemen to reach the clerk in spectacles were like those of a crowd to get in at the pit door of a theatre when Gracious Majesty honours it with its presence Another functionary from time to time exercised his lungs in calling over the names of those who had been sworn for the purpose of restoring to them their affidavits after they had been signed by the judge which gave rise to a few more scuffles and all these things going on at the same time occasioned as much bustle as the most active and excitable person could desire to behold There were yet another class of persons those who were waiting to attend summonses their employers had taken out which it was optional to the attorney on the opposite side to attend or not and whose business it was from time to time to cry out the opposite attorney s name to make certain that he was not in attendance without their knowledge For example Leaning against the wall close beside the seat mister Pickwick had taken was an office lad of fourteen with a tenor voice near him a common law clerk with a bass one A clerk hurried in with a bundle of papers and stared about him Sniggle and Blink cried the tenor Porkin and Snob growled the bass Stumpy and Deacon said the new comer Nobody answered the next man who came in was bailed by the whole three and he in his turn shouted for another firm and then somebody else roared in a loud voice for another and so forth All this time the man in the spectacles was hard at work swearing the clerks the oath being invariably administered without any effort at punctuation and usually in the following terms Take the book in your right hand this is your name and hand writing you swear that the contents of this your affidavit are true so help you God a shilling you must get change I haven t got it Well Sam said mister Pickwick I suppose they are getting the HABEAS CORPUS ready Yes said Sam and I vish they d bring out the have his carcase It s wery unpleasant keepin us vaitin here I d ha got half a dozen have his carcases ready pack d up and all by this time What sort of cumbrous and unmanageable machine Sam Weller imagined a habeas corpus to be does not appear for Perker at that moment walked up and took mister Pickwick away The usual forms having been gone through the body of Samuel Pickwick was soon afterwards confided to the custody of the tipstaff to be by him taken to the warden of the Fleet Prison and there detained until the amount of the damages and costs in the action of Bardell against Pickwick was fully paid and satisfied And that said mister Pickwick laughing will be a very long time Sam call another hackney coach Perker my dear friend good bye I shall go with you and see you safe there said Perker Indeed replied mister Pickwick I would rather go without any other attendant than Sam As soon as I get settled I will write and let you know and I shall expect you immediately Until then good bye As mister Pickwick said this he got into the coach which had by this time arrived followed by the tipstaff Sam having stationed himself on the box it rolled away A most extraordinary man that said Perker as he stopped to pull on his gloves What a bankrupt he d make Sir observed mister Lowten who was standing near How he would bother the commissioners He d set em at defiance if they talked of committing him Sir The attorney did not appear very much delighted with his clerk s professional estimate of mister Pickwick s character for he walked away without deigning any reply The hackney coach jolted along Fleet Street as hackney coaches usually do The horses went better the driver said when they had anything before them they must have gone at a most extraordinary pace when there was nothing and so the vehicle kept behind a cart when the cart stopped it stopped and when the cart went on again it did the same mister Pickwick sat opposite the tipstaff and the tipstaff sat with his hat between his knees whistling a tune and looking out of the coach window Time performs wonders By the powerful old gentleman s aid even a hackney coach gets over half a mile of ground They stopped at length and mister Pickwick alighted at the gate of the Fleet The tipstaff just looking over his shoulder to see that his charge was following close at his heels preceded mister Pickwick into the prison turning to the left after they had entered they passed through an open door into a lobby from which a heavy gate opposite to that by which they had entered and which was guarded by a stout turnkey with the key in his hand led at once into the interior of the prison Here they stopped while the tipstaff delivered his papers and here mister Pickwick was apprised that he would remain until he had undergone the ceremony known to the initiated as sitting for your portrait Sitting for my portrait said mister Pickwick Having your likeness taken sir replied the stout turnkey We re capital hands at likenesses here Take em in no time and always exact Walk in sir and make yourself at home mister Pickwick complied with the invitation and sat himself down when mister Weller who stationed himself at the back of the chair whispered that the sitting was merely another term for undergoing an inspection by the different turnkeys in order that they might know prisoners from visitors Well Sam said mister Pickwick then I wish the artists would come This is rather a public place They von t be long Sir I des say replied Sam There s a Dutch clock sir So I see observed mister Pickwick And a bird cage sir says Sam Veels vithin veels a prison in a prison Ain t it Sir As mister Weller made this philosophical remark mister Pickwick was aware that his sitting had commenced The stout turnkey having been relieved from the lock sat down and looked at him carelessly from time to time while a long thin man who had relieved him thrust his hands beneath his coat tails and planting himself opposite took a good long view of him A third rather surly looking gentleman who had apparently been disturbed at his tea for he was disposing of the last remnant of a crust and butter when he came in stationed himself close to mister Pickwick and resting his hands on his hips inspected him narrowly while two others mixed with the group and studied his features with most intent and thoughtful faces mister Pickwick winced a good deal under the operation and appeared to sit very uneasily in his chair but he made no remark to anybody while it was being performed not even to Sam who reclined upon the back of the chair reflecting partly on the situation of his master and partly on the great satisfaction it would have afforded him to make a fierce assault upon all the turnkeys there assembled one after the other if it were lawful and peaceable so to do At length the likeness was completed and mister Pickwick was informed that he might now proceed into the prison Where am I to sleep to night inquired mister Pickwick Why I don t rightly know about to night replied the stout turnkey You ll be chummed on somebody to morrow and then you ll be all snug and comfortable The first night s generally rather unsettled but you ll be set all squares to morrow After some discussion it was discovered that one of the turnkeys had a bed to let which mister Pickwick could have for that night He gladly agreed to hire it If you ll come with me I ll show it you at once said the man It ain t a large un but it s an out and outer to sleep in This way sir They passed through the inner gate and descended a short flight of steps The key was turned after them and mister Pickwick found himself for the first time in his life within the walls of a debtors prison CHAPTER XLI WHAT BEFELL mister PICKWICK WHEN HE GOT INTO THE FLEET WHAT PRISONERS HE SAW THERE AND HOW HE PASSED THE NIGHT mister Tom Roker the gentleman who had accompanied mister Pickwick into the prison turned sharp round to the right when he got to the bottom of the little flight of steps and led the way through an iron gate which stood open and up another short flight of steps into a long narrow gallery dirty and low paved with stone and very dimly lighted by a window at each remote end This said the gentleman thrusting his hands into his pockets and looking carelessly over his shoulder to mister Pickwick this here is the hall flight Oh replied mister Pickwick looking down a dark and filthy staircase which appeared to lead to a range of damp and gloomy stone vaults beneath the ground and those I suppose are the little cellars where the prisoners keep their small quantities of coals Unpleasant places to have to go down to but very convenient I dare say Yes I shouldn t wonder if they was convenient replied the gentleman seeing that a few people live there pretty snug That s the Fair that is My friend said mister Pickwick you don t really mean to say that human beings live down in those wretched dungeons Don t I replied mister Roker with indignant astonishment why shouldn t I Live live down there exclaimed mister Pickwick Live down there Yes and die down there too very often replied mister Roker and what of that Who s got to say anything agin it Live down there Yes and a wery good place it is to live in ain t it As Roker turned somewhat fiercely upon mister Pickwick in saying this and moreover muttered in an excited fashion certain unpleasant invocations concerning his own eyes limbs and circulating fluids the latter gentleman deemed it advisable to pursue the discourse no further mister Roker then proceeded to mount another staircase as dirty as that which led to the place which has just been the subject of discussion in which ascent he was closely followed by mister Pickwick and Sam There said mister Roker pausing for breath when they reached another gallery of the same dimensions as the one below this is the coffee room flight the one above s the third and the one above that s the top and the room where you re a going to sleep to night is the warden s room and it s this way come on Having said all this in a breath mister Roker mounted another flight of stairs with mister Pickwick and Sam Weller following at his heels These staircases received light from sundry windows placed at some little distance above the floor and looking into a gravelled area bounded by a high brick wall with iron CHEVAUX DE FRISE at the top This area it appeared from mister Roker s statement was the racket ground and it further appeared on the testimony of the same gentleman that there was a smaller area in that portion of the prison which was nearest Farringdon Street denominated and called the Painted Ground from the fact of its walls having once displayed the semblance of various men of war in full sail and other artistical effects achieved in bygone times by some imprisoned draughtsman in his leisure hours Having communicated this piece of information apparently more for the purpose of discharging his bosom of an important fact than with any specific view of enlightening mister Pickwick the guide having at length reached another gallery led the way into a small passage at the extreme end opened a door and disclosed an apartment of an appearance by no means inviting containing eight or nine iron bedsteads There said mister Roker holding the door open and looking triumphantly round at mister Pickwick there s a room mister Pickwick s face however betokened such a very trifling portion of satisfaction at the appearance of his lodging that mister Roker looked for a reciprocity of feeling into the countenance of Samuel Weller who until now had observed a dignified silence There s a room young man observed mister Roker I see it replied Sam with a placid nod of the head You wouldn t think to find such a room as this in the Farringdon Hotel would you said mister Roker with a complacent smile To this mister Weller replied with an easy and unstudied closing of one eye which might be considered to mean either that he would have thought it or that he would not have thought it or that he had never thought anything at all about it as the observer s imagination suggested Having executed this feat and reopened his eye mister Weller proceeded to inquire which was the individual bedstead that mister Roker had so flatteringly described as an out and outer to sleep in That s it replied mister Roker pointing to a very rusty one in a corner It would make any one go to sleep that bedstead would whether they wanted to or not I should think said Sam eyeing the piece of furniture in question with a look of excessive disgust I should think poppies was nothing to it Nothing at all said mister Roker And I s pose said Sam with a sidelong glance at his master as if to see whether there were any symptoms of his determination being shaken by what passed I s pose the other general l men as sleeps here ARE general l men Nothing but it said mister Roker One of em takes his twelve pints of ale a day and never leaves off smoking even at his meals He must be a first rater said Sam Aone replied mister Roker Nothing daunted even by this intelligence mister Pickwick smilingly announced his determination to test the powers of the narcotic bedstead for that night and mister Roker after informing him that he could retire to rest at whatever hour he thought proper without any further notice or formality walked off leaving him standing with Sam in the gallery It was getting dark that is to say a few gas jets were kindled in this place which was never light by way of compliment to the evening which had set in outside As it was rather warm some of the tenants of the numerous little rooms which opened into the gallery on either hand had set their doors ajar mister Pickwick peeped into them as he passed along with great curiosity and interest Here four or five great hulking fellows just visible through a cloud of tobacco smoke were engaged in noisy and riotous conversation over half emptied pots of beer or playing at all fours with a very greasy pack of cards In the adjoining room some solitary tenant might be seen poring by the light of a feeble tallow candle over a bundle of soiled and tattered papers yellow with dust and dropping to pieces from age writing for the hundredth time some lengthened statement of his grievances for the perusal of some great man whose eyes it would never reach or whose heart it would never touch In a third a man with his wife and a whole crowd of children might be seen making up a scanty bed on the ground or upon a few chairs for the younger ones to pass the night in And in a fourth and a fifth and a sixth and a seventh the noise and the beer and the tobacco smoke and the cards all came over again in greater force than before In the galleries themselves and more especially on the stair cases there lingered a great number of people who came there some because their rooms were empty and lonesome others because their rooms were full and hot the greater part because they were restless and uncomfortable and not possessed of the secret of exactly knowing what to do with themselves There were many classes of people here from the labouring man in his fustian jacket to the broken down spendthrift in his shawl dressing gown most appropriately out at elbows but there was the same air about them all a kind of listless jail bird careless swagger a vagabondish who s afraid sort of bearing which is wholly indescribable in words but which any man can understand in one moment if he wish by setting foot in the nearest debtors prison and looking at the very first group of people he sees there with the same interest as mister Pickwick did It strikes me Sam said mister Pickwick leaning over the iron rail at the stair head it strikes me Sam that imprisonment for debt is scarcely any punishment at all Think not sir inquired mister Weller You see how these fellows drink and smoke and roar replied mister Pickwick It s quite impossible that they can mind it much Ah that s just the wery thing Sir rejoined Sam they don t mind it it s a reg lar holiday to them all porter and skittles It s the t other vuns as gets done over vith this sort o thing them down hearted fellers as can t svig avay at the beer nor play at skittles neither them as vould pay if they could and gets low by being boxed up I ll tell you wot it is sir them as is always a idlin in public houses it don t damage at all and them as is alvays a workin wen they can it damages too much It s unekal as my father used to say wen his grog worn t made half and half it s unekal and that s the fault on it I think you re right Sam said mister Pickwick after a few moments reflection quite right P raps now and then there s some honest people as likes it observed mister Weller in a ruminative tone but I never heerd o one as I can call to mind cept the little dirty faced man in the brown coat and that was force of habit And who was he inquired mister Pickwick Wy that s just the wery point as nobody never know d replied Sam But what did he do Wy he did wot many men as has been much better know d has done in their time Sir replied Sam he run a match agin the constable and vun it In other words I suppose said mister Pickwick he got into debt Just that Sir replied Sam and in course o time he come here in consekens It warn t much execution for nine pound nothin multiplied by five for costs but hows ever here he stopped for seventeen year If he got any wrinkles in his face they were stopped up vith the dirt for both the dirty face and the brown coat wos just the same at the end o that time as they wos at the beginnin He wos a wery peaceful inoffendin little creetur and wos alvays a bustlin about for somebody or playin rackets and never vinnin till at last the turnkeys they got quite fond on him and he wos in the lodge ev ry night a chattering vith em and tellin stories and all that ere Vun night he wos in there as usual along vith a wery old friend of his as wos on the lock ven he says all of a sudden I ain t seen the market outside Bill he says Fleet Market wos there at that time I ain t seen the market outside Bill he says for seventeen year I know you ain t says the turnkey smoking his pipe I should like to see it for a minit Bill he says Wery probable says the turnkey smoking his pipe wery fierce and making believe he warn t up to wot the little man wanted Bill says the little man more abrupt than afore I ve got the fancy in my head Let me see the public streets once more afore I die and if I ain t struck with apoplexy I ll be back in five minits by the clock And wot ud become o me if you WOS struck with apoplexy said the turnkey Wy says the little creetur whoever found me ud bring me home for I ve got my card in my pocket Bill he says No twenty Coffee room Flight and that wos true sure enough for wen he wanted to make the acquaintance of any new comer he used to pull out a little limp card vith them words on it and nothin else in consideration of vich he vos alvays called Number Tventy The turnkey takes a fixed look at him and at last he says in a solemn manner Tventy he says I ll trust you you Won t get your old friend into trouble No my boy I hope I ve somethin better behind here says the little man and as he said it he hit his little vesket wery hard and then a tear started out o each eye which wos wery extraordinary for it wos supposed as water never touched his face He shook the turnkey by the hand out he vent And never came back again said mister Pickwick Wrong for vunce sir replied mister Weller for back he come two minits afore the time a bilin with rage sayin how he d been nearly run over by a hackney coach that he warn t used to it and he was blowed if he wouldn t write to the lord mayor They got him pacified at last and for five years arter that he never even so much as peeped out o the lodge gate At the expiration of that time he died I suppose said mister Pickwick No he didn t Sir replied Sam He got a curiosity to go and taste the beer at a new public house over the way and it wos such a wery nice parlour that he took it into his head to go there every night which he did for a long time always comin back reg lar about a quarter of an hour afore the gate shut which was all wery snug and comfortable At last he began to get so precious jolly that he used to forget how the time vent or care nothin at all about it and he went on gettin later and later till vun night his old friend wos just a shuttin the gate had turned the key in fact wen he come up Hold hard Bill he says Wot ain t you come home yet Tventy says the turnkey I thought you wos in long ago No I wasn t says the little man with a smile Well then I ll tell you wot it is my friend says the turnkey openin the gate wery slow and sulky it s my pinion as you ve got into bad company o late which I m wery sorry to see Now I don t wish to do nothing harsh he says but if you can t confine yourself to steady circles and find your vay back at reg lar hours as sure as you re a standin there I ll shut you out altogether The little man was seized vith a wiolent fit o tremblin and never vent outside the prison walls artervards As Sam concluded mister Pickwick slowly retraced his steps downstairs After a few thoughtful turns in the Painted Ground which as it was now dark was nearly deserted he intimated to mister Weller that he thought it high time for him to withdraw for the night requesting him to seek a bed in some adjacent public house and return early in the morning to make arrangements for the removal of his master s wardrobe from the George and Vulture This request mister Samuel Weller prepared to obey with as good a grace as he could assume but with a very considerable show of reluctance nevertheless He even went so far as to essay sundry ineffectual hints regarding the expediency of stretching himself on the gravel for that night but finding mister Pickwick obstinately deaf to any such suggestions finally withdrew There is no disguising the fact that mister Pickwick felt very low spirited and uncomfortable not for lack of society for the prison was very full and a bottle of wine would at once have purchased the utmost good fellowship of a few choice spirits without any more formal ceremony of introduction but he was alone in the coarse vulgar crowd and felt the depression of spirits and sinking of heart naturally consequent on the reflection that he was cooped and caged up without a prospect of liberation As to the idea of releasing himself by ministering to the sharpness of Dodson Fogg it never for an instant entered his thoughts In this frame of mind he turned again into the coffee room gallery and walked slowly to and fro The place was intolerably dirty and the smell of tobacco smoke perfectly suffocating There was a perpetual slamming and banging of doors as the people went in and out and the noise of their voices and footsteps echoed and re echoed through the passages constantly A young woman with a child in her arms who seemed scarcely able to crawl from emaciation and misery was walking up and down the passage in conversation with her husband who had no other place to see her in As they passed mister Pickwick he could hear the female sob bitterly and once she burst into such a passion of grief that she was compelled to lean against the wall for support while the man took the child in his arms and tried to soothe her mister Pickwick s heart was really too full to bear it and he went upstairs to bed Now although the warder s room was a very uncomfortable one being in every point of decoration and convenience several hundred degrees inferior to the common infirmary of a county jail it had at present the merit of being wholly deserted save by mister Pickwick himself So he sat down at the foot of his little iron bedstead and began to wonder how much a year the warder made out of the dirty room Having satisfied himself by mathematical calculation that the apartment was about equal in annual value to the freehold of a small street in the suburbs of London he took to wondering what possible temptation could have induced a dingy looking fly that was crawling over his pantaloons to come into a close prison when he had the choice of so many airy situations a course of meditation which led him to the irresistible conclusion that the insect was insane After settling this point he began to be conscious that he was getting sleepy whereupon he took his nightcap out of the pocket in which he had had the precaution to stow it in the morning and leisurely undressing himself got into bed and fell asleep Bravo Heel over toe cut and shuffle pay away at it Zephyr I m smothered if the opera house isn t your proper hemisphere Keep it up Hooray These expressions delivered in a most boisterous tone and accompanied with loud peals of laughter roused mister Pickwick from one of those sound slumbers which lasting in reality some half hour seem to the sleeper to have been protracted for three weeks or a month The voice had no sooner ceased than the room was shaken with such violence that the windows rattled in their frames and the bedsteads trembled again mister Pickwick started up and remained for some minutes fixed in mute astonishment at the scene before him On the floor of the room a man in a broad skirted green coat with corduroy knee smalls and gray cotton stockings was performing the most popular steps of a hornpipe with a slang and burlesque caricature of grace and lightness which combined with the very appropriate character of his costume was inexpressibly absurd Another man evidently very drunk who had probably been tumbled into bed by his companions was sitting up between the sheets warbling as much as he could recollect of a comic song with the most intensely sentimental feeling and expression while a third seated on one of the bedsteads was applauding both performers with the air of a profound connoisseur and encouraging them by such ebullitions of feeling as had already roused mister Pickwick from his sleep This last man was an admirable specimen of a class of gentry which never can be seen in full perfection but in such places they may be met with in an imperfect state occasionally about stable yards and Public houses but they never attain their full bloom except in these hot beds which would almost seem to be considerately provided by the legislature for the sole purpose of rearing them He was a tall fellow with an olive complexion long dark hair and very thick bushy whiskers meeting under his chin He wore no neckerchief as he had been playing rackets all day and his Open shirt collar displayed their full luxuriance On his head he wore one of the common eighteenpenny French skull caps with a gaudy tassel dangling therefrom very happily in keeping with a common fustian coat His legs which being long were afflicted with weakness graced a pair of Oxford mixture trousers made to show the full symmetry of those limbs Being somewhat negligently braced however and moreover but imperfectly buttoned they fell in a series of not the most graceful folds over a pair of shoes sufficiently down at heel to display a pair of very soiled white stockings There was a rakish vagabond smartness and a kind of boastful rascality about the whole man that was worth a mine of gold This figure was the first to perceive that mister Pickwick was looking on upon which he winked to the Zephyr and entreated him with mock gravity not to wake the gentleman Why bless the gentleman s honest heart and soul said the Zephyr turning round and affecting the extremity of surprise the gentleman is awake Hem Shakespeare How do you do Sir How is Mary and Sarah sir and the dear old lady at home Sir Will you have the kindness to put my compliments into the first little parcel you re sending that way sir and say that I would have sent em before only I was afraid they might be broken in the wagon sir Don t overwhelm the gentlemen with ordinary civilities when you see he s anxious to have something to drink said the gentleman with the whiskers with a jocose air Why don t you ask the gentleman what he ll take Dear me I quite forgot replied the other What will you take sir Will you take port wine sir or sherry wine sir I can recommend the ale sir or perhaps you d like to taste the porter sir Allow me to have the felicity of hanging up your nightcap Sir With this the speaker snatched that article of dress from mister Pickwick s head and fixed it in a twinkling on that of the drunken man who firmly impressed with the belief that he was delighting a numerous assembly continued to hammer away at the comic song in the most melancholy strains imaginable Taking a man s nightcap from his brow by violent means and adjusting it on the head of an unknown gentleman of dirty exterior however ingenious a witticism in itself is unquestionably one of those which come under the denomination of practical jokes Viewing the matter precisely in this light mister Pickwick without the slightest intimation of his purpose sprang vigorously out of bed struck the Zephyr so smart a blow in the chest as to deprive him of a considerable portion of the commodity which sometimes bears his name and then recapturing his nightcap boldly placed himself in an attitude of defence Now said mister Pickwick gasping no less from excitement than from the expenditure of so much energy come on both of you both of you With this liberal invitation the worthy gentleman communicated a revolving motion to his clenched fists by way of appalling his antagonists with a display of science It might have been mister Pickwick s very unexpected gallantry or it might have been the complicated manner in which he had got himself out of bed and fallen all in a mass upon the hornpipe man that touched his adversaries Touched they were for instead of then and there making an attempt to commit man slaughter as mister Pickwick implicitly believed they would have done they paused stared at each other a short time and finally laughed outright Well you re a trump and I like you all the better for it said the Zephyr Now jump into bed again or you ll catch the rheumatics No malice I hope said the man extending a hand the size of the yellow clump of fingers which sometimes swings over a glover s door Certainly not said mister Pickwick with great alacrity for now that the excitement was over he began to feel rather cool about the legs Allow me the H onour said the gentleman with the whiskers presenting his dexter hand and aspirating the h With much pleasure sir said mister Pickwick and having executed a very long and solemn shake he got into bed again My name is Smangle sir said the man with the whiskers Oh said mister Pickwick Mine is Mivins said the man in the stockings I am delighted to hear it sir said mister Pickwick Hem coughed mister Smangle Did you speak sir said mister Pickwick No I did not sir said mister Smangle All this was very genteel and pleasant and to make matters still more comfortable mister Smangle assured mister Pickwick a great many more times that he entertained a very high respect for the feelings of a gentleman which sentiment indeed did him infinite credit as he could be in no wise supposed to understand them Are you going through the court sir inquired mister Smangle Through the what said mister Pickwick Through the court Portugal Street the Court for Relief of You know Oh no replied mister Pickwick No I am not Going out perhaps suggested mister Mivins I fear not replied mister Pickwick I refuse to pay some damages and am here in consequence Ah said mister Smangle paper has been my ruin A stationer I presume Sir said mister Pickwick innocently Stationer No no confound and curse me Not so low as that No trade When I say paper I mean bills Oh you use the word in that sense I see said mister Pickwick Damme A gentleman must expect reverses said Smangle What of that Here am I in the Fleet Prison Well good What then I m none the worse for that am I Not a bit replied mister Mivins And he was quite right for so far from mister Smangle being any the worse for it he was something the better inasmuch as to qualify himself for the place he had attained gratuitous possession of certain articles of jewellery which long before that had found their way to the pawnbroker s Well but come said mister Smangle this is dry work Let s rinse our mouths with a drop of burnt sherry the last comer shall stand it Mivins shall fetch it and I ll help to drink it That s a fair and gentlemanlike division of labour anyhow Curse me Unwilling to hazard another quarrel mister Pickwick gladly assented to the proposition and consigned the money to mister Mivins who as it was nearly eleven o clock lost no time in repairing to the coffee room on his errand I say whispered Smangle the moment his friend had left the room what did you give him Half a sovereign said mister Pickwick He s a devilish pleasant gentlemanly dog said mister Smangle infernal pleasant I don t know anybody more so but Here mister Smangle stopped short and shook his head dubiously You don t think there is any probability of his appropriating the money to his own use said mister Pickwick Oh no Mind I don t say that I expressly say that he s a devilish gentlemanly fellow said mister Smangle But I think perhaps if somebody went down just to see that he didn t dip his beak into the jug by accident or make some confounded mistake in losing the money as he came upstairs it would be as well Here you sir just run downstairs and look after that gentleman will you This request was addressed to a little timid looking nervous man whose appearance bespoke great poverty and who had been crouching on his bedstead all this while apparently stupefied by the novelty of his situation You know where the coffee room is said Smangle just run down and tell that gentleman you ve come to help him up with the jug Or stop I ll tell you what I ll tell you how we ll do him said Smangle with a cunning look How said mister Pickwick Send down word that he s to spend the change in cigars Capital thought Run and tell him that d ye hear They shan t be wasted continued Smangle turning to mister Pickwick I LL smoke em This manoeuvring was so exceedingly ingenious and withal performed with such immovable composure and coolness that mister Pickwick would have had no wish to disturb it even if he had had the power In a short time mister Mivins returned bearing the sherry which mister Smangle dispensed in two little cracked mugs considerately remarking with reference to himself that a gentleman must not be particular under such circumstances and that for his part he was not too proud to drink out of the jug In which to show his sincerity he forthwith pledged the company in a draught which half emptied it An excellent understanding having been by these means promoted mister Smangle proceeded to entertain his hearers with a relation of divers romantic adventures in which he had been from time to time engaged involving various interesting anecdotes of a thoroughbred horse and a magnificent Jewess both of surpassing beauty and much coveted by the nobility and gentry of these kingdoms Long before these elegant extracts from the biography of a gentleman were concluded mister Mivins had betaken himself to bed and had set in snoring for the night leaving the timid stranger and mister Pickwick to the full benefit of mister Smangle s experiences Nor were the two last named gentlemen as much edified as they might have been by the moving passages narrated mister Pickwick had been in a state of slumber for some time when he had a faint perception of the drunken man bursting out afresh with the comic song and receiving from mister Smangle a gentle intimation through the medium of the water jug that his audience was not musically disposed mister Pickwick then once again dropped off to sleep with a confused consciousness that mister Smangle was still engaged in relating a long story the chief point of which appeared to be that on some occasion particularly stated and set forth he had done a bill and a gentleman at the same time CHAPTER XLII ILLUSTRATIVE LIKE THE PRECEDING ONE OF THE OLD PROVERB THAT ADVERSITY BRINGS A MAN ACQUAINTED WITH STRANGE BEDFELLOWS LIKEWISE CONTAINING mister PICKWICK S EXTRAORDINARY AND STARTLING ANNOUNCEMENT TO mister SAMUEL WELLER When mister Pickwick opened his eyes next morning the first object upon which they rested was Samuel Weller seated upon a small black portmanteau intently regarding apparently in a condition of profound abstraction the stately figure of the dashing mister Smangle while mister Smangle himself who was already partially dressed was seated on his bedstead occupied in the desperately hopeless attempt of staring mister Weller out of countenance We say desperately hopeless because Sam with a comprehensive gaze which took in mister Smangle s cap feet head face legs and whiskers all at the same time continued to look steadily on with every demonstration of lively satisfaction but with no more regard to mister Smangle s personal sentiments on the subject than he would have displayed had he been inspecting a wooden statue or a straw embowelled Guy Fawkes Well will you know me again said mister Smangle with a frown I d svear to you anyveres Sir replied Sam cheerfully Don t be impertinent to a gentleman Sir said mister Smangle Not on no account replied Sam If you ll tell me wen he wakes I ll be upon the wery best extra super behaviour This observation having a remote tendency to imply that mister Smangle was no gentleman kindled his ire Mivins said mister Smangle with a passionate air What s the office replied that gentleman from his couch Who the devil is this fellow Gad said mister Mivins looking lazily out from under the bed clothes I ought to ask YOU that Hasn t he any business here No replied mister Smangle Then knock him downstairs and tell him not to presume to get up till I come and kick him rejoined mister Mivins with this prompt advice that excellent gentleman again betook himself to slumber The conversation exhibiting these unequivocal symptoms of verging on the personal mister Pickwick deemed it a fit point at which to interpose Sam said mister Pickwick Sir rejoined that gentleman Has anything new occurred since last night Nothin partickler sir replied Sam glancing at mister Smangle s whiskers the late prewailance of a close and confined atmosphere has been rayther favourable to the growth of veeds of an alarmin and sangvinary natur but vith that ere exception things is quiet enough I shall get up said mister Pickwick give me some clean things Whatever hostile intentions mister Smangle might have entertained his thoughts were speedily diverted by the unpacking of the portmanteau the contents of which appeared to impress him at once with a most favourable opinion not only of mister Pickwick but of Sam also who he took an early opportunity of declaring in a tone of voice loud enough for that eccentric personage to overhear was a regular thoroughbred original and consequently the very man after his own heart As to mister Pickwick the affection he conceived for him knew no limits Now is there anything I can do for you my dear Sir said Smangle Nothing that I am aware of I am obliged to you replied mister Pickwick No linen that you want sent to the washerwoman s I know a delightful washerwoman outside that comes for my things twice a week and by Jove how devilish lucky this is the day she calls Shall I put any of those little things up with mine Don t say anything about the trouble Confound and curse it if one gentleman under a cloud is not to put himself a little out of the way to assist another gentleman in the same condition what s human nature Thus spake mister Smangle edging himself meanwhile as near as possible to the portmanteau and beaming forth looks of the most fervent and disinterested friendship There s nothing you want to give out for the man to brush my dear creature is there resumed Smangle Nothin whatever my fine feller rejoined Sam taking the reply into his own mouth P raps if vun of us wos to brush without troubling the man it ud be more agreeable for all parties as the schoolmaster said when the young gentleman objected to being flogged by the butler And there s nothing I can send in my little box to the washer woman s is there said Smangle turning from Sam to mister Pickwick with an air of some discomfiture Nothin whatever Sir retorted Sam I m afeered the little box must be chock full o your own as it is This speech was accompanied with such a very expressive look at that particular portion of mister Smangle s attire by the appearance of which the skill of laundresses in getting up gentlemen s linen is generally tested that he was fain to turn upon his heel and for the present at any rate to give up all design on mister Pickwick s purse and wardrobe He accordingly retired in dudgeon to the racket ground where he made a light and whole some breakfast on a couple of the cigars which had been purchased on the previous night mister Mivins who was no smoker and whose account for small articles of chandlery had also reached down to the bottom of the slate and been carried over to the other side remained in bed and in his own words took it out in sleep After breakfasting in a small closet attached to the coffee room which bore the imposing title of the Snuggery the temporary inmate of which in consideration of a small additional charge had the unspeakable advantage of overhearing all the conversation in the coffee room aforesaid and after despatching mister Weller on some necessary errands mister Pickwick repaired to the lodge to consult mister Roker concerning his future accommodation Accommodation eh said that gentleman consulting a large book Plenty of that mister Pickwick Your chummage ticket will be on twenty seven in the third Oh said mister Pickwick My what did you say Your chummage ticket replied mister Roker you re up to that Not quite replied mister Pickwick with a smile Why said mister Roker it s as plain as Salisbury You ll have a chummage ticket upon twenty seven in the third and them as is in the room will be your chums Are there many of them inquired mister Pickwick dubiously Three replied mister Roker mister Pickwick coughed One of em s a parson said mister Roker filling up a little piece of paper as he spoke another s a butcher Eh exclaimed mister Pickwick A butcher repeated mister Roker giving the nib of his pen a tap on the desk to cure it of a disinclination to mark What a thorough paced goer he used to be sure ly You remember Tom Martin Neddy said Roker appealing to another man in the lodge who was paring the mud off his shoes with a five and twenty bladed pocket knife I should think so replied the party addressed with a strong emphasis on the personal pronoun Bless my dear eyes said mister Roker shaking his head slowly from side to side and gazing abstractedly out of the grated windows before him as if he were fondly recalling some peaceful scene of his early youth it seems but yesterday that he whopped the coal heaver down Fox under the Hill by the wharf there I think I can see him now a coming up the Strand between the two street keepers a little sobered by the bruising with a patch o winegar and brown paper over his right eyelid and that ere lovely bulldog as pinned the little boy arterwards a following at his heels What a rum thing time is ain t it Neddy The gentleman to whom these observations were addressed who appeared of a taciturn and thoughtful cast merely echoed the inquiry mister Roker shaking off the poetical and gloomy train of thought into which he had been betrayed descended to the common business of life and resumed his pen Do you know what the third gentlemen is inquired mister Pickwick not very much gratified by this description of his future associates What is that Simpson Neddy said mister Roker turning to his companion What Simpson said Neddy Why him in twenty seven in the third that this gentleman s going to be chummed on Oh him replied Neddy he s nothing exactly He WAS a horse chaunter he s a leg now Ah so I thought rejoined mister Roker closing the book and placing the small piece of paper in mister Pickwick s hands That s the ticket sir Very much perplexed by this summary disposition of this person mister Pickwick walked back into the prison revolving in his mind what he had better do Convinced however that before he took any other steps it would be advisable to see and hold personal converse with the three gentlemen with whom it was proposed to quarter him he made the best of his way to the third flight After groping about in the gallery for some time attempting in the dim light to decipher the numbers on the different doors he at length appealed to a pot boy who happened to be pursuing his morning occupation of gleaning for pewter Which is twenty seven my good fellow said mister Pickwick Five doors farther on replied the pot boy There s the likeness of a man being hung and smoking the while chalked outside the door Guided by this direction mister Pickwick proceeded slowly along the gallery until he encountered the portrait of a gentleman above described upon whose countenance he tapped with the knuckle of his forefinger gently at first and then audibly After repeating this process several times without effect he ventured to open the door and peep in There was only one man in the room and he was leaning out of window as far as he could without overbalancing himself endeavouring with great perseverance to spit upon the crown of the hat of a personal friend on the parade below As neither speaking coughing sneezing knocking nor any other ordinary mode of attracting attention made this person aware of the presence of a visitor mister Pickwick after some delay stepped up to the window and pulled him gently by the coat tail The individual brought in his head and shoulders with great swiftness and surveying mister Pickwick from head to foot demanded in a surly tone what the something beginning with a capital H he wanted I believe said mister Pickwick consulting his ticket I believe this is twenty seven in the third Well replied the gentleman I have come here in consequence of receiving this bit of paper rejoined mister Pickwick Hand it over said the gentleman mister Pickwick complied I think Roker might have chummed you somewhere else said mister Simpson for it was the leg after a very discontented sort of a pause mister Pickwick thought so also but under all the circumstances he considered it a matter of sound policy to be silent mister Simpson mused for a few moments after this and then thrusting his head out of the window gave a shrill whistle and pronounced some word aloud several times What the word was mister Pickwick could not distinguish but he rather inferred that it must be some nickname which distinguished mister Martin from the fact of a great number of gentlemen on the ground below immediately proceeding to cry Butcher in imitation of the tone in which that useful class of society are wont diurnally to make their presence known at area railings Subsequent occurrences confirmed the accuracy of mister Pickwick s impression for in a few seconds a gentleman prematurely broad for his years clothed in a professional blue jean frock and top boots with circular toes entered the room nearly out of breath closely followed by another gentleman in very shabby black and a sealskin cap The latter gentleman who fastened his coat all the way up to his chin by means of a pin and a button alternately had a very coarse red face and looked like a drunken chaplain which indeed he was These two gentlemen having by turns perused mister Pickwick s billet the one expressed his opinion that it was a rig and the other his conviction that it was a go Having recorded their feelings in these very intelligible terms they looked at mister Pickwick and each other in awkward silence It s an aggravating thing just as we got the beds so snug said the chaplain looking at three dirty mattresses each rolled up in a blanket which occupied one corner of the room during the day and formed a kind of slab on which were placed an old cracked basin ewer and soap dish of common yellow earthenware with a blue flower very aggravating mister Martin expressed the same opinion in rather stronger terms mister Simpson after having let a variety of expletive adjectives loose upon society without any substantive to accompany them tucked up his sleeves and began to wash the greens for dinner While this was going on mister Pickwick had been eyeing the room which was filthily dirty and smelt intolerably close There was no vestige of either carpet curtain or blind There was not even a closet in it Unquestionably there were but few things to put away if there had been one but however few in number or small in individual amount still remnants of loaves and pieces of cheese and damp towels and scrags of meat and articles of wearing apparel and mutilated crockery and bellows without nozzles and toasting forks without prongs do present somewhat of an uncomfortable appearance when they are scattered about the floor of a small apartment which is the common sitting and sleeping room of three idle men I suppose this can be managed somehow said the butcher after a pretty long silence What will you take to go out I beg your pardon replied mister Pickwick What did you say I hardly understand you What will you take to be paid out said the butcher The regular chummage is two and six Will you take three bob And a bender suggested the clerical gentleman Well I don t mind that it s only twopence a piece more said mister Martin What do you say now We ll pay you out for three and sixpence a week Come And stand a gallon of beer down chimed in mister Simpson There And drink it on the spot said the chaplain Now I really am so wholly ignorant of the rules of this place returned mister Pickwick that I do not yet comprehend you Can I live anywhere else I thought I could not At this inquiry mister Martin looked with a countenance of excessive surprise at his two friends and then each gentleman pointed with his right thumb over his left shoulder This action imperfectly described in words by the very feeble term of over the left when performed by any number of ladies or gentlemen who are accustomed to act in unison has a very graceful and airy effect its expression is one of light and playful sarcasm CAN you repeated mister Martin with a smile of pity Well if I knew as little of life as that I d eat my hat and swallow the buckle whole said the clerical gentleman So would I added the sporting one solemnly After this introductory preface the three chums informed mister Pickwick in a breath that money was in the Fleet just what money was out of it that it would instantly procure him almost anything he desired and that supposing he had it and had no objection to spend it if he only signified his wish to have a room to himself he might take possession of one furnished and fitted to boot in half an hour s time With this the parties separated very much to their common satisfaction mister Pickwick once more retracing his steps to the lodge and the three companions adjourning to the coffee room there to spend the five shillings which the clerical gentleman had with admirable prudence and foresight borrowed of him for the purpose I knowed it said mister Roker with a chuckle when mister Pickwick stated the object with which he had returned Didn t I say so Neddy The philosophical owner of the universal penknife growled an affirmative I knowed you d want a room for yourself bless you said mister Roker Let me see You ll want some furniture You ll hire that of me I suppose That s the reg lar thing With great pleasure replied mister Pickwick There s a capital room up in the coffee room flight that belongs to a Chancery prisoner said mister Roker It ll stand you in a pound a week I suppose you don t mind that Not at all said mister Pickwick Just step there with me said Roker taking up his hat with great alacrity the matter s settled in five minutes Lord why didn t you say at first that you was willing to come down handsome The matter was soon arranged as the turnkey had foretold The Chancery prisoner had been there long enough to have lost his friends fortune home and happiness and to have acquired the right of having a room to himself As he laboured however under the inconvenience of often wanting a morsel of bread he eagerly listened to mister Pickwick s proposal to rent the apartment and readily covenanted and agreed to yield him up the sole and undisturbed possession thereof in consideration of the weekly payment of twenty shillings from which fund he furthermore contracted to pay out any person or persons that might be chummed upon it As they struck the bargain mister Pickwick surveyed him with a painful interest He was a tall gaunt cadaverous man in an old greatcoat and slippers with sunken cheeks and a restless eager eye His lips were bloodless and his bones sharp and thin God help him the iron teeth of confinement and privation had been slowly filing him down for twenty years And where will you live meanwhile Sir said mister Pickwick as he laid the amount of the first week s rent in advance on the tottering table The man gathered up the money with a trembling hand and replied that he didn t know yet he must go and see where he could move his bed to I am afraid sir said mister Pickwick laying his hand gently and compassionately on his arm I am afraid you will have to live in some noisy crowded place Now pray consider this room your own when you want quiet or when any of your friends come to see you Friends interposed the man in a voice which rattled in his throat if I lay dead at the bottom of the deepest mine in the world tight screwed down and soldered in my coffin rotting in the dark and filthy ditch that drags its slime along beneath the foundations of this prison I could not be more forgotten or unheeded than I am here I am a dead man dead to society without the pity they bestow on those whose souls have passed to judgment Friends to see me My God I have sunk from the prime of life into old age in this place and there is not one to raise his hand above my bed when I lie dead upon it and say It is a blessing he is gone The excitement which had cast an unwonted light over the man s face while he spoke subsided as he concluded and pressing his withered hands together in a hasty and disordered manner he shuffled from the room Rides rather rusty said mister Roker with a smile Ah they re like the elephants They feel it now and then and it makes em wild Having made this deeply sympathising remark mister Roker entered upon his arrangements with such expedition that in a short time the room was furnished with a carpet six chairs a table a sofa bedstead a tea kettle and various small articles on hire at the very reasonable rate of seven and twenty shillings and sixpence per week 
1265_135636_000092_000003	train-clean-360	Now is there anything more 
none	none	we can do for you inquired mister Roker looking round with great satisfaction and gaily chinking the first week s hire in his closed fist Why yes said mister Pickwick who had been musing deeply for some time Are there any people here who run on errands and so forth Outside do you mean inquired mister Roker Yes I mean who are able to go outside Not prisoners Yes there is said Roker There s an unfortunate devil who has got a friend on the poor side that s glad to do anything of that sort He s been running odd jobs and that for the last two months Shall I send him If you please rejoined mister Pickwick Stay no The poor side you say I should like to see it I ll go to him myself The poor side of a debtor s prison is as its name imports that in which the most miserable and abject class of debtors are confined A prisoner having declared upon the poor side pays neither rent nor chummage His fees upon entering and leaving the jail are reduced in amount and he becomes entitled to a share of some small quantities of food to provide which a few charitable persons have from time to time left trifling legacies in their wills Most of our readers will remember that until within a very few years past there was a kind of iron cage in the wall of the Fleet Prison within which was posted some man of hungry looks who from time to time rattled a money box and exclaimed in a mournful voice Pray remember the poor debtors pray remember the poor debtors The receipts of this box when there were any were divided among the poor prisoners and the men on the poor side relieved each other in this degrading office Although this custom has been abolished and the cage is now boarded up the miserable and destitute condition of these unhappy persons remains the same We no longer suffer them to appeal at the prison gates to the charity and compassion of the passersby but we still leave unblotted the leaves of our statute book for the reverence and admiration of succeeding ages the just and wholesome law which declares that the sturdy felon shall be fed and clothed and that the penniless debtor shall be left to die of starvation and nakedness This is no fiction Not a week passes over our head but in every one of our prisons for debt some of these men must inevitably expire in the slow agonies of want if they were not relieved by their fellow prisoners Turning these things in his mind as he mounted the narrow staircase at the foot of which Roker had left him mister Pickwick gradually worked himself to the boiling over point and so excited was he with his reflections on this subject that he had burst into the room to which he had been directed before he had any distinct recollection either of the place in which he was or of the object of his visit The general aspect of the room recalled him to himself at once but he had no sooner cast his eye on the figure of a man who was brooding over the dusty fire than letting his hat fall on the floor he stood perfectly fixed and immovable with astonishment Yes in tattered garments and without a coat his common calico shirt yellow and in rags his hair hanging over his face his features changed with suffering and pinched with famine there sat mister Alfred Jingle his head resting on his hands his eyes fixed upon the fire and his whole appearance denoting misery and dejection Near him leaning listlessly against the wall stood a strong built countryman flicking with a worn out hunting whip the top boot that adorned his right foot his left being thrust into an old slipper Horses dogs and drink had brought him there pell mell There was a rusty spur on the solitary boot which he occasionally jerked into the empty air at the same time giving the boot a smart blow and muttering some of the sounds by which a sportsman encourages his horse He was riding in imagination some desperate steeplechase at that moment Poor wretch He never rode a match on the swiftest animal in his costly stud with half the speed at which he had torn along the course that ended in the Fleet On the opposite side of the room an old man was seated on a small wooden box with his eyes riveted on the floor and his face settled into an expression of the deepest and most hopeless despair A young girl his little grand daughter was hanging about him endeavouring with a thousand childish devices to engage his attention but the old man neither saw nor heard her The voice that had been music to him and the eyes that had been light fell coldly on his senses His limbs were shaking with disease and the palsy had fastened on his mind There were two or three other men in the room congregated in a little knot and noiselessly talking among themselves There was a lean and haggard woman too a prisoner s wife who was watering with great solicitude the wretched stump of a dried up withered plant which it was plain to see could never send forth a green leaf again too true an emblem perhaps of the office she had come there to discharge Such were the objects which presented themselves to mister Pickwick s view as he looked round him in amazement The noise of some one stumbling hastily into the room roused him Turning his eyes towards the door they encountered the new comer and in him through his rags and dirt he recognised the familiar features of mister Job Trotter mister Pickwick exclaimed Job aloud Eh said Jingle starting from his seat mister So it is queer place strange things serves me right very mister Jingle thrust his hands into the place where his trousers pockets used to be and dropping his chin upon his breast sank back into his chair mister Pickwick was affected the two men looked so very miserable The sharp involuntary glance Jingle had cast at a small piece of raw loin of mutton which Job had brought in with him said more of their reduced state than two hours explanation could have done mister Pickwick looked mildly at Jingle and said I should like to speak to you in private Will you step out for an instant Certainly said Jingle rising hastily Can t step far no danger of overwalking yourself here spike park grounds pretty romantic but not extensive open for public inspection family always in town housekeeper desperately careful very You have forgotten your coat said mister Pickwick as they walked out to the staircase and closed the door after them Eh said Jingle Spout dear relation uncle Tom couldn t help it must eat you know Wants of nature and all that What do you mean Gone my dear sir last coat can t help it Lived on a pair of boots whole fortnight Silk umbrella ivory handle week fact honour ask Job knows it Lived for three weeks upon a pair of boots and a silk umbrella with an ivory handle exclaimed mister Pickwick who had only heard of such things in shipwrecks or read of them in Constable s Miscellany True said Jingle nodding his head Pawnbroker s shop duplicates here small sums mere nothing all rascals Oh said mister Pickwick much relieved by this explanation I understand you You have pawned your wardrobe Everything Job s too all shirts gone never mind saves washing Nothing soon lie in bed starve die inquest little bone house poor prisoner common necessaries hush it up gentlemen of the jury warden s tradesmen keep it snug natural death coroner s order workhouse funeral serve him right all over drop the curtain Jingle delivered this singular summary of his prospects in life with his accustomed volubility and with various twitches of the countenance to counterfeit smiles mister Pickwick easily perceived that his recklessness was assumed and looking him full but not unkindly in the face saw that his eyes were moist with tears Good fellow said Jingle pressing his hand and turning his head away Ungrateful dog boyish to cry can t help it bad fever weak ill hungry Deserved it all but suffered much very Wholly unable to keep up appearances any longer and perhaps rendered worse by the effort he had made the dejected stroller sat down on the stairs and covering his face with his hands sobbed like a child Come come said mister Pickwick with considerable emotion we will see what can be done when I know all about the matter Here Job where is that fellow Here sir replied Job presenting himself on the staircase We have described him by the bye as having deeply sunken eyes in the best of times In his present state of want and distress he looked as if those features had gone out of town altogether Here sir cried Job Come here sir said mister Pickwick trying to look stern with four large tears running down his waistcoat Take that sir Take what In the ordinary acceptation of such language it should have been a blow As the world runs it ought to have been a sound hearty cuff for mister Pickwick had been duped deceived and wronged by the destitute outcast who was now wholly in his power Must we tell the truth It was something from mister Pickwick s waistcoat pocket which chinked as it was given into Job s hand and the giving of which somehow or other imparted a sparkle to the eye and a swelling to the heart of our excellent old friend as he hurried away Sam had returned when mister Pickwick reached his own room and was inspecting the arrangements that had been made for his comfort with a kind of grim satisfaction which was very pleasant to look upon Having a decided objection to his master s being there at all mister Weller appeared to consider it a high moral duty not to appear too much pleased with anything that was done said suggested or proposed Well Sam said mister Pickwick Well sir replied mister Weller Pretty comfortable now eh Sam Pretty vell sir responded Sam looking round him in a disparaging manner Have you seen mister Tupman and our other friends Yes I HAVE seen em sir and they re a comin to morrow and wos wery much surprised to hear they warn t to come to day replied Sam You have brought the things I wanted mister Weller in reply pointed to various packages which he had arranged as neatly as he could in a corner of the room Very well Sam said mister Pickwick after a little hesitation listen to what I am going to say Sam Cert nly Sir rejoined mister Weller fire away Sir I have felt from the first Sam said mister Pickwick with much solemnity that this is not the place to bring a young man to Nor an old un neither Sir observed mister Weller You re quite right Sam said mister Pickwick but old men may come here through their own heedlessness and unsuspicion and young men may be brought here by the selfishness of those they serve It is better for those young men in every point of view that they should not remain here Do you understand me Sam Vy no Sir I do NOT replied mister Weller doggedly Try Sam said mister Pickwick Vell sir rejoined Sam after a short pause I think I see your drift and if I do see your drift it s my pinion that you re a comin it a great deal too strong as the mail coachman said to the snowstorm ven it overtook him I see you comprehend me Sam said mister Pickwick Independently of my wish that you should not be idling about a place like this for years to come I feel that for a debtor in the Fleet to be attended by his manservant is a monstrous absurdity Sam said mister Pickwick for a time you must leave me Oh for a time eh sir rejoined mister Weller rather sarcastically Yes for the time that I remain here said mister Pickwick Your wages I shall continue to pay Any one of my three friends will be happy to take you were it only out of respect to me And if I ever do leave this place Sam added mister Pickwick with assumed cheerfulness if I do I pledge you my word that you shall return to me instantly Now I ll tell you wot it is Sir said mister Weller in a grave and solemn voice This here sort o thing won t do at all so don t let s hear no more about it I am serious and resolved Sam said mister Pickwick You air air you sir inquired mister Weller firmly Wery good Sir then so am I Thus speaking mister Weller fixed his hat on his head with great precision and abruptly left the room Sam cried mister Pickwick calling after him Sam Here But the long gallery ceased to re echo the sound of footsteps Sam Weller was gone CHAPTER XLIII SHOWING HOW mister SAMUEL WELLER GOT INTO DIFFICULTIES In a lofty room ill lighted and worse ventilated situated in Portugal Street Lincoln s Inn Fields there sit nearly the whole year round one two three or four gentlemen in wigs as the case may be with little writing desks before them constructed after the fashion of those used by the judges of the land barring the French polish There is a box of barristers on their right hand there is an enclosure of insolvent debtors on their left and there is an inclined plane of most especially dirty faces in their front These gentlemen are the Commissioners of the Insolvent Court and the place in which they sit is the Insolvent Court itself It is and has been time out of mind the remarkable fate of this court to be somehow or other held and understood by the general consent of all the destitute shabby genteel people in London as their common resort and place of daily refuge It is always full The steams of beer and spirits perpetually ascend to the ceiling and being condensed by the heat roll down the walls like rain there are more old suits of clothes in it at one time than will be offered for sale in all Houndsditch in a twelvemonth more unwashed skins and grizzly beards than all the pumps and shaving shops between Tyburn and Whitechapel could render decent between sunrise and sunset It must not be supposed that any of these people have the least shadow of business in or the remotest connection with the place they so indefatigably attend If they had it would be no matter of surprise and the singularity of the thing would cease Some of them sleep during the greater part of the sitting others carry small portable dinners wrapped in pocket handkerchiefs or sticking out of their worn out pockets and munch and listen with equal relish but no one among them was ever known to have the slightest personal interest in any case that was ever brought forward Whatever they do there they sit from the first moment to the last When it is heavy rainy weather they all come in wet through and at such times the vapours of the court are like those of a fungus pit A casual visitor might suppose this place to be a temple dedicated to the Genius of Seediness There is not a messenger or process server attached to it who wears a coat that was made for him not a tolerably fresh or wholesome looking man in the whole establishment except a little white headed apple faced tipstaff and even he like an ill conditioned cherry preserved in brandy seems to have artificially dried and withered up into a state of preservation to which he can lay no natural claim The very barristers wigs are ill powdered and their curls lack crispness But the attorneys who sit at a large bare table below the commissioners are after all the greatest curiosities The professional establishment of the more opulent of these gentlemen consists of a blue bag and a boy generally a youth of the Jewish persuasion They have no fixed offices their legal business being transacted in the parlours of public houses or the yards of prisons whither they repair in crowds and canvass for customers after the manner of omnibus cads They are of a greasy and mildewed appearance and if they can be said to have any vices at all perhaps drinking and cheating are the most conspicuous among them Their residences are usually on the outskirts of the Rules chiefly lying within a circle of one mile from the obelisk in saint George s Fields Their looks are not prepossessing and their manners are peculiar mister Solomon Pell one of this learned body was a fat flabby pale man in a surtout which looked green one minute and brown the next with a velvet collar of the same chameleon tints His forehead was narrow his face wide his head large and his nose all on one side as if Nature indignant with the propensities she observed in him in his birth had given it an angry tweak which it had never recovered Being short necked and asthmatic however he respired principally through this feature so perhaps what it wanted in ornament it made up in usefulness I m sure to bring him through it said mister Pell Are you though replied the person to whom the assurance was pledged Certain sure replied Pell but if he d gone to any irregular practitioner mind you I wouldn t have answered for the consequences Ah said the other with open mouth No that I wouldn t said mister Pell and he pursed up his lips frowned and shook his head mysteriously Now the place where this discourse occurred was the public house just opposite to the Insolvent Court and the person with whom it was held was no other than the elder mister Weller who had come there to comfort and console a friend whose petition to be discharged under the act was to be that day heard and whose attorney he was at that moment consulting And vere is George inquired the old gentleman mister Pell jerked his head in the direction of a back parlour whither mister Weller at once repairing was immediately greeted in the warmest and most flattering manner by some half dozen of his professional brethren in token of their gratification at his arrival The insolvent gentleman who had contracted a speculative but imprudent passion for horsing long stages which had led to his present embarrassments looked extremely well and was soothing the excitement of his feelings with shrimps and porter The salutation between mister Weller and his friends was strictly confined to the freemasonry of the craft consisting of a jerking round of the right wrist and a tossing of the little finger into the air at the same time We once knew two famous coachmen they are dead now poor fellows who were twins and between whom an unaffected and devoted attachment existed They passed each other on the Dover road every day for twenty four years never exchanging any other greeting than this and yet when one died the other pined away and soon afterwards followed him Vell George said mister Weller senior taking off his upper coat and seating himself with his accustomed gravity How is it All right behind and full inside All right old feller replied the embarrassed gentleman Is the gray mare made over to anybody inquired mister Weller anxiously George nodded in the affirmative Vell that s all right said mister Weller Coach taken care on also Con signed in a safe quarter replied George wringing the heads off half a dozen shrimps and swallowing them without any more ado Wery good wery good said mister Weller Alvays see to the drag ven you go downhill Is the vay bill all clear and straight for erd The schedule sir said Pell guessing at mister Weller s meaning the schedule is as plain and satisfactory as pen and ink can make it mister Weller nodded in a manner which bespoke his inward approval of these arrangements and then turning to mister Pell said pointing to his friend George Ven do you take his cloths off Why replied mister Pell he stands third on the opposed list and I should think it would be his turn in about half an hour I told my clerk to come over and tell us when there was a chance mister Weller surveyed the attorney from head to foot with great admiration and said emphatically And what ll you take sir Why really replied mister Pell you re very Upon my word and honour I m not in the habit of It s so very early in the morning that actually I am almost Well you may bring me threepenn orth of rum my dear The officiating damsel who had anticipated the order before it was given set the glass of spirits before Pell and retired Gentlemen said mister Pell looking round upon the company success to your friend I don t like to boast gentlemen it s not my way but I can t help saying that if your friend hadn t been fortunate enough to fall into hands that But I won t say what I was going to say Gentlemen my service to you Having emptied the glass in a twinkling mister Pell smacked his lips and looked complacently round on the assembled coachmen who evidently regarded him as a species of divinity Let me see said the legal authority What was I a saying gentlemen I think you was remarkin as you wouldn t have no objection to another o the same Sir said mister Weller with grave facetiousness Ha ha laughed mister Pell Not bad not bad A professional man too At this time of the morning it would be rather too good a Well I don t know my dear you may do that again if you please Hem This last sound was a solemn and dignified cough in which mister Pell observing an indecent tendency to mirth in some of his auditors considered it due to himself to indulge The late Lord Chancellor gentlemen was very fond of me said mister Pell And wery creditable in him too interposed mister Weller Hear hear assented mister Pell s client Why shouldn t he be Ah Why indeed said a very red faced man who had said nothing yet and who looked extremely unlikely to say anything more Why shouldn t he A murmur of assent ran through the company I remember gentlemen said mister Pell dining with him on one occasion there was only us two but everything as splendid as if twenty people had been expected the great seal on a dumb waiter at his right hand and a man in a bag wig and suit of armour guarding the mace with a drawn sword and silk stockings which is perpetually done gentlemen night and day when he said Pell he said no false delicacy Pell You re a man of talent you can get anybody through the Insolvent Court Pell and your country should be proud of you Those were his very words My Lord I said you flatter me Pell he said if I do I m damned Did he say that inquired mister Weller He did replied Pell Vell then said mister Weller I say Parliament ought to ha took it up and if he d been a poor man they would ha done it But my dear friend argued mister Pell it was in confidence In what said mister Weller In confidence Oh wery good replied mister Weller after a little reflection If he damned hisself in confidence o course that was another thing Of course it was said mister Pell The distinction s obvious you will perceive Alters the case entirely said mister Weller Go on Sir No I will not go on Sir said mister Pell in a low and serious tone You have reminded me Sir that this conversation was private private and confidential gentlemen Gentlemen I am a professional man It may be that I am a good deal looked up to in my profession it may be that I am not Most people know I say nothing Observations have already been made in this room injurious to the reputation of my noble friend You will excuse me gentlemen I was imprudent I feel that I have no right to mention this matter without his concurrence Thank you Sir thank you Thus delivering himself mister Pell thrust his hands into his pockets and frowning grimly around rattled three halfpence with terrible determination This virtuous resolution had scarcely been formed when the boy and the blue bag who were inseparable companions rushed violently into the room and said at least the boy did for the blue bag took no part in the announcement that the case was coming on directly The intelligence was no sooner received than the whole party hurried across the street and began to fight their way into court a preparatory ceremony which has been calculated to occupy in ordinary cases from twenty five minutes to thirty mister Weller being stout cast himself at once into the crowd with the desperate hope of ultimately turning up in some place which would suit him His success was not quite equal to his expectations for having neglected to take his hat off it was knocked over his eyes by some unseen person upon whose toes he had alighted with considerable force Apparently this individual regretted his impetuosity immediately afterwards for muttering an indistinct exclamation of surprise he dragged the old man out into the hall and after a violent struggle released his head and face Samivel exclaimed mister Weller when he was thus enabled to behold his rescuer Sam nodded You re a dutiful and affectionate little boy you are ain t you said mister Weller to come a bonnetin your father in his old age How should I know who you wos responded the son Do you s pose I wos to tell you by the weight o your foot Vell that s wery true Sammy replied mister Weller mollified at once but wot are you a doin on here Your gov nor can t do no good here Sammy They won t pass that werdick they won t pass it Sammy And mister Weller shook his head with legal solemnity Wot a perwerse old file it is exclaimed Sam always a goin on about werdicks and alleybis and that Who said anything about the werdick mister Weller made no reply but once more shook his head most learnedly Leave off rattlin that ere nob o yourn if you don t want it to come off the springs altogether said Sam impatiently and behave reasonable I vent all the vay down to the Markis o Granby arter you last night Did you see the Marchioness o Granby Sammy inquired mister Weller with a sigh Yes I did replied Sam How wos the dear creetur a lookin Wery queer said Sam I think she s a injurin herself gradivally vith too much o that ere pine apple rum and other strong medicines of the same natur You don t mean that Sammy said the senior earnestly I do indeed replied the junior mister Weller seized his son s hand clasped it and let it fall There was an expression on his countenance in doing so not of dismay or apprehension but partaking more of the sweet and gentle character of hope A gleam of resignation and even of cheerfulness passed over his face too as he slowly said I ain t quite certain Sammy I wouldn t like to say I wos altogether positive in case of any subsekent disappointment but I rayther think my boy I rayther think that the shepherd s got the liver complaint Does he look bad inquired Sam He s uncommon pale replied his father cept about the nose which is redder than ever His appetite is wery so so but he imbibes wonderful Some thoughts of the rum appeared to obtrude themselves on mister Weller s mind as he said this for he looked gloomy and thoughtful but he very shortly recovered as was testified by a perfect alphabet of winks in which he was only wont to indulge when particularly pleased Vell now said Sam about my affair Just open them ears o yourn and don t say nothin till I ve done With this preface Sam related as succinctly as he could the last memorable conversation he had had with mister Pickwick Stop there by himself poor creetur exclaimed the elder mister Weller without nobody to take his part It can t be done Samivel it can t be done O course it can t asserted Sam I know d that afore I came Why they ll eat him up alive Sammy exclaimed mister Weller Sam nodded his concurrence in the opinion He goes in rayther raw Sammy said mister Weller metaphorically and he ll come out done so ex ceedin brown that his most formiliar friends won t know him Roast pigeon s nothin to it Sammy Again Sam Weller nodded It oughtn t to be Samivel said mister Weller gravely It mustn t be said Sam Cert nly not said mister Weller Vell now said Sam you ve been a prophecyin away wery fine like a red faced Nixon as the sixpenny books gives picters on Who wos he Sammy inquired mister Weller Never mind who he was retorted Sam he warn t a coachman that s enough for you I know d a ostler o that name said mister Weller musing It warn t him said Sam This here general l m n was a prophet Wot s a prophet inquired mister Weller looking sternly on his son Wy a man as tells what s a goin to happen replied Sam I wish I d know d him Sammy said mister Weller P raps he might ha throw d a small light on that ere liver complaint as we wos a speakin on just now Hows ever if he s dead and ain t left the bisness to nobody there s an end on it Go on Sammy said mister Weller with a sigh Well said Sam you ve been a prophecyin avay about wot ll happen to the gov ner if he s left alone Don t you see any way o takin care on him No I don t Sammy said mister Weller with a reflective visage No vay at all inquired Sam No vay said mister Weller unless and a gleam of intelligence lighted up his countenance as he sank his voice to a whisper and applied his mouth to the ear of his offspring unless it is getting him out in a turn up bedstead unbeknown to the turnkeys Sammy or dressin him up like a old ooman vith a green wail Sam Weller received both of these suggestions with unexpected contempt and again propounded his question No said the old gentleman if he von t let you stop there I see no vay at all It s no thoroughfare Sammy no thoroughfare Well then I ll tell you wot it is said Sam I ll trouble you for the loan of five and twenty pound Wot good ll that do inquired mister Weller Never mind replied Sam P raps you may ask for it five minits arterwards p raps I may say I von t pay and cut up rough You von t think o arrestin your own son for the money and sendin him off to the Fleet will you you unnat ral wagabone At this reply of Sam s the father and son exchanged a complete code of telegraph nods and gestures after which the elder mister Weller sat himself down on a stone step and laughed till he was purple Wot a old image it is exclaimed Sam indignant at this loss of time What are you a settin down there for con wertin your face into a street door knocker wen there s so much to be done Where s the money In the boot Sammy in the boot replied mister Weller composing his features Hold my hat Sammy Having divested himself of this encumbrance mister Weller gave his body a sudden wrench to one side and by a dexterous twist contrived to get his right hand into a most capacious pocket from whence after a great deal of panting and exertion he extricated a pocket book of the large octavo size fastened by a huge leathern strap From this ledger he drew forth a couple of whiplashes three or four buckles a little sample bag of corn and finally a small roll of very dirty bank notes from which he selected the required amount which he handed over to Sam And now Sammy said the old gentleman when the whip lashes and the buckles and the samples had been all put back and the book once more deposited at the bottom of the same pocket now Sammy I know a general l m n here as ll do the rest o the bisness for us in no time a limb o the law Sammy as has got brains like the frogs dispersed all over his body and reachin to the wery tips of his fingers a friend of the Lord Chancellorship s Sammy who d only have to tell him what he wanted and he d lock you up for life if that wos all I say said Sam none o that None o wot inquired mister Weller Wy none o them unconstitootional ways o doin it retorted Sam The have his carcass next to the perpetual motion is vun of the blessedest things as wos ever made I ve read that ere in the newspapers wery of en Well wot s that got to do vith it inquired mister Weller Just this here said Sam that I ll patronise the inwention and go in that vay No visperin s to the Chancellorship I don t like the notion It mayn t be altogether safe vith reference to gettin out agin Deferring to his son s feeling upon this point mister Weller at once sought the erudite Solomon Pell and acquainted him with his desire to issue a writ instantly for the SUM of twenty five pounds and costs of process to be executed without delay upon the body of one Samuel Weller the charges thereby incurred to be paid in advance to Solomon Pell The attorney was in high glee for the embarrassed coach horser was ordered to be discharged forthwith He highly approved of Sam s attachment to his master declared that it strongly reminded him of his own feelings of devotion to his friend the Chancellor and at once led the elder mister Weller down to the Temple to swear the affidavit of debt which the boy with the assistance of the blue bag had drawn up on the spot Meanwhile Sam having been formally introduced to the whitewashed gentleman and his friends as the offspring of mister Weller of the Belle Savage was treated with marked distinction and invited to regale himself with them in honour of the occasion an invitation which he was by no means backward in accepting The mirth of gentlemen of this class is of a grave and quiet character usually but the present instance was one of peculiar festivity and they relaxed in proportion After some rather tumultuous toasting of the Chief Commissioner and mister Solomon Pell who had that day displayed such transcendent abilities a mottled faced gentleman in a blue shawl proposed that somebody should sing a song The obvious suggestion was that the mottled faced gentleman being anxious for a song should sing it himself but this the mottled faced gentleman sturdily and somewhat offensively declined to do Upon which as is not unusual in such cases a rather angry colloquy ensued Gentlemen said the coach horser rather than disturb the harmony of this delightful occasion perhaps mister Samuel Weller will oblige the company Raly gentlemen said Sam I m not wery much in the habit o singin without the instrument but anythin for a quiet life as the man said wen he took the sitivation at the lighthouse With this prelude mister Samuel Weller burst at once into the following wild and beautiful legend which under the impression that it is not generally known we take the liberty of quoting We would beg to call particular attention to the monosyllable at the end of the second and fourth lines which not only enables the singer to take breath at those points but greatly assists the metre ROMANCE I Bold Turpin vunce on Hounslow Heath His bold mare Bess bestrode er Ven there he see d the Bishop s coach A coming along the road er So he gallops close to the orse s legs And he claps his head vithin And the Bishop says Sure as eggs is eggs This here s the bold Turpin CHORUS And the Bishop says Sure as eggs is eggs This here s the bold Turpin II Says Turpin You shall eat your words With a sarse of leaden bul let So he puts a pistol to his mouth And he fires it down his gul let The coachman he not likin the job Set off at full gal lop But Dick put a couple of balls in his nob And perwailed on him to stop CHORUS sarcastically But Dick put a couple of balls in his nob And perwailed on him to stop I maintain that that ere song s personal to the cloth said the mottled faced gentleman interrupting it at this point I demand the name o that coachman Nobody know d replied Sam He hadn t got his card in his pocket I object to the introduction o politics said the mottled faced gentleman I submit that in the present company that ere song s political and wot s much the same that it ain t true I say that that coachman did not run away but that he died game game as pheasants and I won t hear nothin said to the contrairey As the mottled faced gentleman spoke with great energy and determination and as the opinions of the company seemed divided on the subject it threatened to give rise to fresh altercation when mister Weller and mister Pell most opportunely arrived All right Sammy said mister Weller The officer will be here at four o clock said mister Pell I suppose you won t run away meanwhile eh Ha ha P raps my cruel pa ull relent afore then replied Sam with a broad grin Not I said the elder mister Weller Do said Sam Not on no account replied the inexorable creditor I ll give bills for the amount at sixpence a month said Sam I won t take em said mister Weller Ha ha ha very good very good said mister Solomon Pell who was making out his little bill of costs a very amusing incident indeed Benjamin copy that And mister Pell smiled again as he called mister Weller s attention to the amount Thank you thank you said the professional gentleman taking up another of the greasy notes as mister Weller took it from the pocket book Three ten and one ten is five Much obliged to you mister Weller Your son is a most deserving young man very much so indeed Sir It s a very pleasant trait in a young man s character very much so added mister Pell smiling smoothly round as he buttoned up the money Wot a game it is said the elder mister Weller with a chuckle A reg lar prodigy son Prodigal prodigal son Sir suggested mister Pell mildly Never mind Sir said mister Weller with dignity I know wot s o clock Sir Wen I don t I ll ask you Sir By the time the officer arrived Sam had made himself so extremely popular that the congregated gentlemen determined to see him to prison in a body So off they set the plaintiff and defendant walking arm in arm the officer in front and eight stout coachmen bringing up the rear At Serjeant s Inn Coffee house the whole party halted to refresh and the legal arrangements being completed the procession moved on again Some little commotion was occasioned in Fleet Street by the pleasantry of the eight gentlemen in the flank who persevered in walking four abreast it was also found necessary to leave the mottled faced gentleman behind to fight a ticket porter it being arranged that his friends should call for him as they came back Nothing but these little incidents occurred on the way When they reached the gate of the Fleet the cavalcade taking the time from the plaintiff gave three tremendous cheers for the defendant and after having shaken hands all round left him Sam having been formally delivered into the warder s custody to the intense astonishment of Roker and to the evident emotion of even the phlegmatic Neddy passed at once into the prison walked straight to his master s room and knocked at the door Come in said mister Pickwick Sam appeared pulled off his hat and smiled Ah Sam my good lad said mister Pickwick evidently delighted to see his humble friend again I had no intention of hurting your feelings yesterday my faithful fellow by what I said Put down your hat Sam and let me explain my meaning a little more at length Won t presently do sir inquired Sam Certainly said mister Pickwick but why not now I d rayther not now sir rejoined Sam Why inquired mister Pickwick Cause said Sam hesitating Because of what inquired mister Pickwick alarmed at his follower s manner Speak out Sam Cause rejoined Sam cause I ve got a little bisness as I want to do What business inquired mister Pickwick surprised at Sam s confused manner Nothin partickler Sir replied Sam Oh if it s nothing particular said mister Pickwick with a smile you can speak with me first I think I d better see arter it at once said Sam still hesitating mister Pickwick looked amazed but said nothing The fact is said Sam stopping short Well said mister Pickwick Speak out Sam Why the fact is said Sam with a desperate effort perhaps I d better see arter my bed afore I do anythin else YOUR BED exclaimed mister Pickwick in astonishment Yes my bed Sir replied Sam I m a prisoner I was arrested this here wery arternoon for debt You arrested for debt exclaimed mister Pickwick sinking into a chair Yes for debt Sir replied Sam And the man as puts me in ull never let me out till you go yourself Bless my heart and soul ejaculated mister Pickwick What do you mean Wot I say Sir rejoined Sam If it s forty years to come I shall be a prisoner and I m very glad on it and if it had been Newgate it would ha been just the same Now the murder s out and damme there s an end on it With these words which he repeated with great emphasis and violence Sam Weller dashed his hat upon the ground in a most unusual state of excitement and then folding his arms looked firmly and fixedly in his master s face CHAPTER LXIV TREATS OF DIVERS LITTLE MATTERS WHICH OCCURRED IN THE FLEET AND OF mister WINKLE S MYSTERIOUS BEHAVIOUR AND SHOWS HOW THE POOR CHANCERY PRISONER OBTAINED HIS RELEASE AT LAST mister Pickwick felt a great deal too much touched by the warmth of Sam s attachment to be able to exhibit any manifestation of anger or displeasure at the precipitate course he had adopted in voluntarily consigning himself to a debtor s prison for an indefinite period The only point on which he persevered in demanding an explanation was the name of Sam s detaining creditor but this mister Weller as perseveringly withheld It ain t o no use sir said Sam again and again he s a malicious bad disposed vorldly minded spiteful windictive creetur with a hard heart as there ain t no soft nin as the wirtuous clergyman remarked of the old general l m n with the dropsy ven he said that upon the whole he thought he d rayther leave his property to his vife than build a chapel vith it But consider Sam mister Pickwick remonstrated the sum is so small that it can very easily be paid and having made up My mind that you shall stop with me you should recollect how much more useful you would be if you could go outside the walls Wery much obliged to you sir replied mister Weller gravely but I d rayther not Rather not do what Sam Wy I d rayther not let myself down to ask a favour o this here unremorseful enemy But it is no favour asking him to take his money Sam reasoned mister Pickwick Beg your pardon sir rejoined Sam but it ud be a wery great favour to pay it and he don t deserve none that s where it is sir Here mister Pickwick rubbing his nose with an air of some vexation mister Weller thought it prudent to change the theme of the discourse I takes my determination on principle Sir remarked Sam and you takes yours on the same ground wich puts me in mind o the man as killed his self on principle wich o course you ve heerd on Sir mister Weller paused when he arrived at this point and cast a comical look at his master out of the corners of his eyes There is no of course in the case Sam said mister Pickwick gradually breaking into a smile in spite of the uneasiness which Sam s obstinacy had given him The fame of the gentleman in question never reached my ears No sir exclaimed mister Weller You astonish me Sir he wos a clerk in a gov ment office sir Was he said mister Pickwick Yes he wos Sir rejoined mister Weller and a wery pleasant general l m n too one o the precise and tidy sort as puts their feet in little India rubber fire buckets wen it s wet weather and never has no other bosom friends but hare skins he saved up his money on principle wore a clean shirt ev ry day on principle never spoke to none of his relations on principle fear they shou d want to borrow money of him and wos altogether in

Wot s the matter says the doctor Wery ill says the patient Wot have you been a eatin on says the doctor Roast weal says the patient Wot s the last thing you dewoured says the doctor Crumpets says the patient That s it says the doctor I ll send you a box of pills directly and don t you never take no more of em he says No more o wot says the patient pills No crumpets says the doctor Wy says the patient starting up in bed I ve eat four crumpets ev ry night for fifteen year on principle Well then you d better leave em off on principle says the doctor Crumpets is NOT wholesome Sir says the

crumpets a night he says vill do your business in six months The patient looks him full in the face and turns it over in his mind for a long time and at last he says Are you sure o that ere Sir I ll

mornin he gets up has a fire lit orders in three shillins wurth o crumpets toasts em all eats em all and blows his brains out What did he do that for inquired mister Pickwick abruptly for he was considerably startled by this tragical termination of the narrative Wot did he do it for Sir reiterated Sam Wy in support of his great principle that crumpets wos wholesome and to show that he wouldn t be put out of his way for nobody With such like shiftings and changings of the discourse did mister Weller meet his master s questioning on the night of his taking up his residence in the Fleet Finding all gentle remonstrance useless mister Pickwick at length yielded a reluctant consent to his taking lodgings by the week of a bald headed cobbler who rented a small slip room in one of the upper galleries To this humble apartment mister Weller moved a mattress and bedding which he hired of mister Roker and by the time he lay down upon it at night was as much at home as if he had been bred in the prison and his whole family had vegetated therein for three generations Do you always smoke arter you goes to bed old cock inquired mister Weller of his landlord when they had both retired for the night Yes I does young bantam replied the cobbler Will you allow me to in quire wy you make up your bed under that ere deal table said Sam Cause I was always used to a four poster afore I came here and I find the legs of the table answer just as well replied the cobbler You re a character sir said Sam I haven t got anything of the kind belonging to me rejoined the cobbler shaking his head and if you want to meet with a good one I m afraid you ll find some difficulty in suiting yourself at this register office The above short dialogue took place as mister Weller lay extended on his mattress at one end of the room and the cobbler on his at the other the apartment being illumined by the light of a rush candle and the cobbler s pipe which was glowing below the table like a red hot coal The conversation brief as it was predisposed mister Weller strongly in his landlord s favour and raising himself on his elbow he took a more lengthened survey of his appearance than he had yet had either time or inclination to make He was a sallow man all cobblers are and had a strong bristly beard all cobblers have His face was a queer good tempered crooked featured piece of workmanship ornamented with a couple of eyes that must have worn a very joyous expression at one time for they sparkled yet The man was sixty by years and Heaven knows how old by imprisonment so that his having any look approaching to mirth or contentment was singular enough He was a little man and being half doubled up as he lay in bed looked about as long as he ought to have been without his legs He had a great red pipe in his mouth and was smoking and staring at the rush light in a state of enviable placidity Have you been here long inquired Sam breaking the silence which had lasted for some time Twelve year replied the cobbler biting the end of his pipe as he spoke Contempt inquired Sam The cobbler nodded Well then said Sam with some sternness wot do you persevere in bein obstinit for vastin your precious life away in this here magnified pound Wy don t you give in and tell the Chancellorship that you re wery sorry for makin his court contemptible and you won t do so no more The cobbler put his pipe in the corner of his mouth while he smiled and then brought it back to its old place again but said nothing Wy don t you said Sam urging his question strenuously Ah said the cobbler you don t quite understand these matters What do you suppose ruined me now Wy said Sam trimming the rush light I s pose the beginnin wos that you got into debt eh Never owed a farden said the cobbler try again Well perhaps said Sam you bought houses wich is delicate English for goin mad or took to buildin wich is a medical term for bein incurable The cobbler shook his head and said Try again You didn t go to law I hope said Sam suspiciously Never in my life replied the cobbler The fact is I was ruined by having money left me Come come said Sam that von t do I wish some rich enemy ud try to vork my destruction in that ere vay I d let him Oh I dare say you don t believe it said the cobbler quietly smoking his pipe I wouldn t if I was you but it s true for all that How wos it inquired Sam half induced to believe the fact already by the look the cobbler gave him Just this replied the cobbler an old gentleman that I worked for down in the country and a humble relation of whose I married she s dead God bless her and thank Him for it was seized with a fit and went off Where inquired Sam who was growing sleepy after the numerous events of the day How should I know where he went said the cobbler speaking through his nose in an intense enjoyment of his pipe He went off dead Oh that indeed said Sam Well Well said the cobbler he left five thousand pound behind him And wery general teel in him so to do said Sam One of which continued the cobbler he left to me cause I married his relation you see Wery good murmured Sam And being surrounded by a great number of nieces and nevys as was always quarrelling and fighting among themselves for the property he makes me his executor and leaves the rest to me in trust to divide it among em as the will prowided Wot do you mean by leavin it on trust inquired Sam waking up a little If it ain t ready money were s the use on it It s a law term that s all said the cobbler I don t think that said Sam shaking his head There s wery little trust at that shop Hows ever go on Well said the cobbler when I was going to take out a probate of the will the nieces and nevys who was desperately disappointed at not getting all the money enters a caveat against it What s that inquired Sam A legal instrument which is as much as to say it s no go replied the cobbler I see said Sam a sort of brother in law o the have his carcass Well But continued the cobbler finding that they couldn t agree among themselves and consequently couldn t get up a case against the will they withdrew the caveat and I paid all the legacies I d hardly done it when one nevy brings an action to set the will aside The case comes on some months afterwards afore a deaf old gentleman in a back room somewhere down by Paul s Churchyard and arter four counsels had taken a day a piece to bother him regularly he takes a week or two to consider and read the evidence in six volumes and then gives his judgment that how the testator was not quite right in his head and I must pay all the money back again and all the costs I appealed the case come on before three or four very sleepy gentlemen who had heard it all before in the other court where they re lawyers without work the only difference being that there they re called doctors and in the other place delegates if you understand that and they very dutifully confirmed the decision of the old gentleman below After that we went into Chancery where we are still and where I shall always be My lawyers have had all my thousand pound long ago and what between the estate as they call it and the costs I m here for ten thousand and shall stop here till I die mending shoes Some gentlemen have talked of bringing it before Parliament and I dare say would have done it only they hadn t time to come to me and I hadn t power to go to them and they got tired of my long letters and dropped the business And this is God s truth without one word of suppression or exaggeration as fifty people both in this place and out of it very well know The cobbler paused to ascertain what effect his story had produced on Sam but finding that he had dropped asleep knocked the ashes out of his pipe sighed put it down drew the bed clothes over his head and went to sleep too mister Pickwick was sitting at breakfast alone next morning Sam being busily engaged in the cobbler s room polishing his master s shoes and brushing the black gaiters when there came a knock at the door which before mister Pickwick could cry Come in was followed by the appearance of a head of hair and a cotton velvet cap both of which articles of dress he had no difficulty in recognising as the personal property of mister Smangle How are you said that worthy accompanying the inquiry with a score or two of nods I say do you expect anybody this morning Three men devilish gentlemanly fellows have been asking after you downstairs and knocking at every door on the hall flight for which they ve been most infernally blown up by the collegians that had the trouble of opening em Dear me How very foolish of them said mister Pickwick rising Yes I have no doubt they are some friends whom I rather expected to see yesterday Friends of yours exclaimed Smangle seizing mister Pickwick by the hand Say no more Curse me they re friends of mine from this minute and friends of Mivins s too Infernal pleasant gentlemanly dog Mivins isn t he said Smangle with great feeling I know so little of the gentleman said mister Pickwick hesitating that I I know you do interrupted Smangle clasping mister Pickwick by the shoulder You shall know him better You ll be delighted with him That man Sir said Smangle with a solemn countenance has comic powers that would do honour to Drury Lane Theatre Has he indeed said mister Pickwick Ah by Jove he has replied Smangle Hear him come the four cats in the wheel barrow four distinct cats sir I pledge you my honour Now you know that s infernal clever Damme you can t help liking a man when you see these traits about him He s only one fault that little failing I mentioned to you you know As mister Smangle shook his head in a confidential and sympathising manner at this juncture mister Pickwick felt that he was expected to say something so he said Ah and looked restlessly at the door Ah echoed mister Smangle with a long drawn sigh He s delightful company that man is sir I don t know better company anywhere but he has that one drawback If the ghost of his grandfather Sir was to rise before him this minute he d ask him for the loan of his acceptance on an eightpenny stamp Dear me exclaimed mister Pickwick Yes added mister Smangle and if he d the power of raising him again he would in two months and three days from this time to renew the bill Those are very remarkable traits said mister Pickwick but I m afraid that while we are talking here my friends may be in a state of great perplexity at not finding me I ll show em the way said Smangle making for the door Good day I won t disturb you while they re here you know By the bye As Smangle pronounced the last three words he stopped suddenly reclosed the door which he had opened and walking softly back to mister Pickwick stepped close up to him on tiptoe and said in a very soft whisper You couldn t make it convenient to lend me half a crown till the latter end of next week could you mister Pickwick could scarcely forbear smiling but managing to preserve his gravity he drew forth the coin and placed it in mister Smangle s palm upon which that gentleman with many nods and winks implying profound mystery disappeared in quest of the three strangers with whom he presently returned and having coughed thrice and nodded as many times as an assurance to mister Pickwick that he would not forget to pay he shook hands all round in an engaging manner and at length took himself off My dear friends said mister Pickwick shaking hands alternately with mister Tupman mister Winkle and mister Snodgrass who were the three visitors in question I am delighted to see you The triumvirate were much affected mister Tupman shook his head deploringly mister Snodgrass drew forth his handkerchief with undisguised emotion and mister Winkle retired to the window and sniffed aloud Mornin general l m n said Sam entering at the moment with the shoes and gaiters Avay vith melincholly as the little boy said ven his schoolmissus died Velcome to the college general l m n This foolish fellow said mister Pickwick tapping Sam on the head as he knelt down to button up his master s gaiters this foolish fellow has got himself arrested in order to be near me What exclaimed the three friends Yes general l m n said Sam I m a stand steady sir if you please I m a prisoner general l m n Con fined as the lady said A prisoner exclaimed mister Winkle with unaccountable vehemence Hollo sir responded Sam looking up Wot s the matter Sir I had hoped Sam that Nothing nothing said mister Winkle precipitately There was something so very abrupt and unsettled in mister Winkle s manner that mister Pickwick involuntarily looked at his two friends for an explanation We don t know said mister Tupman answering this mute appeal aloud He has been much excited for two days past and his whole demeanour very unlike what it usually is We feared there must be something the matter but he resolutely denies it No no said mister Winkle colouring beneath mister Pickwick s gaze there is really nothing I assure you there is nothing my dear sir It will be necessary for me to leave town for a short time on private business and I had hoped to have prevailed upon you to allow Sam to accompany me mister Pickwick looked more astonished than before I think faltered mister Winkle that Sam would have had no objection to do so but of course his being a prisoner here renders it impossible So I must go alone As mister Winkle said these words mister Pickwick felt with some astonishment that Sam s fingers were trembling at the gaiters as if he were rather surprised or startled Sam looked up at mister Winkle too when he had finished speaking and though the glance they exchanged was instantaneous they seemed to understand each other Do you know anything of this Sam said mister Pickwick sharply No I don t sir replied mister Weller beginning to button with extraordinary assiduity Are you sure Sam said mister Pickwick Wy sir responded mister Weller I m sure so far that I ve never heerd anythin on the subject afore this moment If I makes any guess about it added Sam looking at mister Winkle I haven t got any right to say what It is fear it should be a wrong un I have no right to make any further inquiry into the private affairs of a friend however intimate a friend said mister Pickwick after a short silence at present let me merely say that I do not understand this at all There We have had quite enough of the subject Thus expressing himself mister Pickwick led the conversation to different topics and mister Winkle gradually appeared more at ease though still very far from being completely so They had all so much to converse about that the morning very quickly passed away and when at three o clock mister Weller produced upon the little dining table a roast leg of mutton and an enormous meat pie with sundry dishes of vegetables and pots of porter which stood upon the chairs or the sofa bedstead or where they could everybody felt disposed to do justice to the meal notwithstanding that the meat had been purchased and dressed and the pie made and baked at the prison cookery hard by To these succeeded a bottle or two of very good wine for which a messenger was despatched by mister Pickwick to the Horn Coffee house in Doctors Commons The bottle or two indeed might be more properly described as a bottle or six for by the time it was drunk and tea over the bell began to ring for strangers to withdraw But if mister Winkle s behaviour had been unaccountable in the morning it became perfectly unearthly and solemn when under the influence of his feelings and his share of the bottle or six he prepared to take leave of his friend He lingered behind until mister Tupman and mister Snodgrass had disappeared and then fervently clenched mister Pickwick s hand with an expression of face in which deep and mighty resolve was fearfully blended with the very concentrated essence of gloom Good night my dear Sir said mister Winkle between his set teeth Bless you my dear fellow replied the warm hearted mister Pickwick as he returned the pressure of his young friend s hand Now then cried mister Tupman from the gallery Yes yes directly replied mister Winkle Good night Good night said mister Pickwick There was another good night and another and half a dozen more after that and still mister Winkle had fast hold of his friend s hand and was looking into his face with the same strange expression Is anything the matter said mister Pickwick at last when his arm was quite sore with shaking Nothing said mister Winkle Well then good night said mister Pickwick attempting to disengage his hand My friend my benefactor my honoured companion murmured mister Winkle catching at his wrist Do not judge me harshly do not when you hear that driven to extremity by hopeless obstacles I Now then said mister Tupman reappearing at the door Are you coming or are we to be locked in Yes yes I am ready replied mister Winkle And with a violent effort he tore himself away As mister Pickwick was gazing down the passage after them in silent astonishment Sam Weller appeared at the stair head and whispered for one moment in mister Winkle s ear Oh certainly depend upon me said that gentleman aloud Thank ee sir You won t forget sir said Sam Of course not replied mister Winkle Wish you luck Sir said Sam touching his hat I should very much liked to ha joined you Sir but the gov nor o course is paramount It is very much to your credit that you remain here said mister Winkle With these words they disappeared down the stairs Very extraordinary said mister Pickwick going back into his room and seating himself at the table in a musing attitude What can that young man be going to do He had sat ruminating about the matter for some time when the voice of Roker the turnkey demanded whether he might come in By all means said mister Pickwick I ve brought you a softer pillow Sir said mister Roker instead of the temporary one you had last night Thank you said mister Pickwick Will you take a glass of wine You re wery good Sir replied mister Roker accepting the proffered glass Yours sir Thank you said mister Pickwick I m sorry to say that your landlord s wery bad to night Sir said Roker setting down the glass and inspecting the lining of his hat preparatory to putting it on again What The Chancery prisoner exclaimed mister Pickwick He won t be a Chancery prisoner wery long Sir replied Roker turning his hat round so as to get the maker s name right side upwards as he looked into it You make my blood run cold said mister Pickwick What do you mean He s been consumptive for a long time past said mister Roker and he s taken wery bad in the breath to night The doctor said six months ago that nothing but change of air could save him Great Heaven exclaimed mister Pickwick has this man been slowly murdered by the law for six months I don t know about that replied Roker weighing the hat by the brim in both hands I suppose he d have been took the same wherever he was He went into the infirmary this morning the doctor says his strength is to be kept up as much as possible and the warden s sent him wine and broth and that from his own house It s not the warden s fault you know sir Of course not replied mister Pickwick hastily I m afraid however said Roker shaking his head that it s all up with him I offered Neddy two six penn orths to one upon it just now but he wouldn t take it and quite right Thank ee Sir Good night sir Stay said mister Pickwick earnestly Where is this infirmary Just over where you slept sir replied Roker I ll show you if you like to come mister Pickwick snatched up his hat without speaking and followed at once The turnkey led the way in silence and gently raising the latch of the room door motioned mister Pickwick to enter It was a large bare desolate room with a number of stump bedsteads made of iron on one of which lay stretched the shadow of a man wan pale and ghastly His breathing was hard and thick and he moaned painfully as it came and went At the bedside sat a short old man in a cobbler s apron who by the aid of a pair of horn spectacles was reading from the Bible aloud It was the fortunate legatee The sick man laid his hand upon his attendant s arm and motioned him to stop He closed the book and laid it on the bed Open the window said the sick man He did so The noise of carriages and carts the rattle of wheels the cries of men and boys all the busy sounds of a mighty multitude instinct with life and occupation blended into one deep murmur floated into the room Above the hoarse loud hum arose from time to time a boisterous laugh or a scrap of some jingling song shouted forth by one of the giddy crowd would strike upon the ear for an instant and then be lost amidst the roar of voices and the tramp of footsteps the breaking of the billows of the restless sea of life that rolled heavily on without These are melancholy sounds to a quiet listener at any time but how melancholy to the watcher by the bed of death There is no air here said the man faintly The place pollutes it It was fresh round about when I walked there years ago but it grows hot and heavy in passing these walls I cannot breathe it We have breathed it together for a long time said the old man Come come There was a short silence during which the two spectators approached the bed The sick man drew a hand of his old fellow prisoner towards him and pressing it affectionately between both his own retained it in his grasp I hope he gasped after a while so faintly that they bent their ears close over the bed to catch the half formed sounds his pale lips gave vent to I hope my merciful Judge will bear in mind my heavy punishment on earth Twenty years my friend twenty years in this hideous grave My heart broke when my child died and I could not even kiss him in his little coffin My loneliness since then in all this noise and riot has been very dreadful May God forgive me He has seen my solitary lingering death He folded his hands and murmuring something more they could not hear fell into a sleep only a sleep at first for they saw him smile They whispered together for a little time and the turnkey stooping over the pillow drew hastily back He has got his discharge by G said the man He had But he had grown so like death in life that they knew not when he died CHAPTER XLIV DESCRIPTIVE OF AN AFFECTING INTERVIEW BETWEEN mister SAMUEL WELLER AND A FAMILY PARTY mister PICKWICK MAKES A TOUR OF THE DIMINUTIVE WORLD HE INHABITS AND RESOLVES TO MIX WITH IT IN FUTURE AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE A few mornings after his incarceration mister Samuel Weller having arranged his master s room with all possible care and seen him comfortably seated over his books and papers withdrew to employ himself for an hour or two to come as he best could It was a fine morning and it occurred to Sam that a pint of porter in the open air would lighten his next quarter of an hour or so as well as any little amusement in which he could indulge Having arrived at this conclusion he betook himself to the tap Having purchased the beer and obtained moreover the day but one before yesterday s paper he repaired to the skittle ground and seating himself on a bench proceeded to enjoy himself in a very sedate and methodical manner First of all he took a refreshing draught of the beer and then he looked up at a window and bestowed a platonic wink on a young lady who was peeling potatoes thereat Then he opened the paper and folded it so as to get the police reports outwards and this being a vexatious and difficult thing to do when there is any wind stirring he took another draught of the beer when he had accomplished it Then he read two lines of the paper and stopped short to look at a couple of men who were finishing a game at rackets which being concluded he cried out wery good in an approving manner and looked round upon the spectators to ascertain whether their sentiments coincided with his own This involved the necessity of looking up at the windows also and as the young lady was still there it was an act of common politeness to wink again and to drink to her good health in dumb show in another draught of the beer which Sam did and having frowned hideously upon a small boy who had noted this latter proceeding with open eyes he threw one leg over the other and holding the newspaper in both hands began to read in real earnest He had hardly composed himself into the needful state of abstraction when he thought he heard his own name proclaimed in some distant passage Nor was he mistaken for it quickly passed from mouth to mouth and in a few seconds the air teemed with shouts of Weller Here roared Sam in a stentorian voice Wot s the matter Who wants him Has an express come to say that his country house is afire Somebody wants you in the hall said a man who was standing by Just mind that ere paper and the pot old feller will you said Sam I m a comin Blessed if they was a callin me to the bar they couldn t make more noise about it Accompanying these words with a gentle rap on the head of the young gentleman before noticed who unconscious of his close vicinity to the person in request was screaming Weller with all his might Sam hastened across the ground and ran up the steps into the hall Here the first object that met his eyes was his beloved father sitting on a bottom stair with his hat in his hand shouting out Weller in his very loudest tone at half minute intervals Wot are you a roarin at said Sam impetuously when the old gentleman had discharged himself of another shout making yourself so precious hot that you looks like a aggrawated glass blower Wot s the matter Aha replied the old gentleman I began to be afeerd that you d gone for a walk round the Regency Park Sammy Come said Sam none o them taunts agin the wictim o avarice and come off that ere step Wot arc you a settin down there for I don t live there I ve got such a game for you Sammy said the elder mister Weller rising Stop a minit said Sam you re all vite behind That s right Sammy rub it off said mister Weller as his son dusted him It might look personal here if a man walked about with vitevash on his clothes eh Sammy As mister Weller exhibited in this place unequivocal symptoms of an approaching fit of chuckling Sam interposed to stop it Keep quiet do said Sam there never vos such a old picter card born Wot are you bustin vith now Sammy said mister Weller wiping his forehead I m afeerd that vun o these days I shall laugh myself into a appleplexy my boy Vell then wot do you do it for said Sam Now then wot have you got to say Who do you think s come here with me Samivel said mister Weller drawing back a pace or two pursing up his mouth and extending his eyebrows Pell said Sam mister Weller shook his head and his red cheeks expanded with the laughter that was endeavouring to find a vent Mottled faced man p raps asked Sam Again mister Weller shook his head Who then asked Sam Your mother in law said mister Weller and it was lucky he did say it or his cheeks must inevitably have cracked from their most unnatural distension Your mother in law Sammy said mister Weller and the red nosed man my boy and the red nosed man Ho ho ho With this mister Weller launched into convulsions of laughter while Sam regarded him with a broad grin gradually over spreading his whole countenance They ve come to have a little serious talk with you Samivel said mister Weller wiping his eyes Don t let out nothin about the unnat ral creditor Sammy Wot don t they know who it is inquired Sam Not a bit on it replied his father Vere are they said Sam reciprocating all the old gentleman s grins In the snuggery rejoined mister Weller Catch the red nosed man a goin anyvere but vere the liquors is not he Samivel not he Ve d a wery pleasant ride along the road from the Markis this mornin Sammy said mister Weller when he felt himself equal to the task of speaking in an articulate manner I drove the old piebald in that ere little shay cart as belonged to your mother in law s first wenter into vich a harm cheer wos lifted for the shepherd and I m blessed said mister Weller with a look of deep scorn I m blessed if they didn t bring a portable flight o steps out into the road a front o our door for him to get up by You don t mean that said Sam I do mean that Sammy replied his father and I vish you could ha seen how tight he held on by the sides wen he did get up as if he wos afeerd o being precipitayted down full six foot and dashed into a million hatoms He tumbled in at last however and avay ve vent and I rayther think I say I rayther think Samivel that he found his self a little jolted ven ve turned the corners Wot I s pose you happened to drive up agin a post or two said Sam I m afeerd replied mister Weller in a rapture of winks I m afeerd I took vun or two on em Sammy he wos a flyin out o the arm cheer all the way Here the old gentleman shook his head from side to side and was seized with a hoarse internal rumbling accompanied with a violent swelling of the countenance and a sudden increase in the breadth of all his features symptoms which alarmed his son not a little Don t be frightened Sammy don t be frightened said the old gentleman when by dint of much struggling and various convulsive stamps upon the ground he had recovered his voice It s only a kind o quiet laugh as I m a tryin to come Sammy Well if that s wot it is said Sam you d better not try to come it agin You ll find it rayther a dangerous inwention Don t you like it Sammy inquired the old gentleman Not at all replied Sam Well said mister Weller with the tears still running down his cheeks it ud ha been a wery great accommodation to me if I could ha done it and ud ha saved a good many vords atween your mother in law and me sometimes but I m afeerd you re right Sammy it s too much in the appleplexy line a deal too much Samivel This conversation brought them to the door of the snuggery into which Sam pausing for an instant to look over his shoulder and cast a sly leer at his respected progenitor who was still giggling behind at once led the way Mother in law said Sam politely saluting the lady wery much obliged to you for this here wisit Shepherd how air you Oh Samuel said missus Weller This is dreadful Not a bit on it mum replied Sam Is it shepherd mister Stiggins raised his hands and turned up his eyes until the whites or rather the yellows were alone visible but made no reply in words Is this here general l m n troubled with any painful complaint said Sam looking to his mother in law for explanation The good man is grieved to see you here Samuel replied missus Weller Oh that s it is it said Sam I was afeerd from his manner that he might ha forgotten to take pepper vith that ere last cowcumber he eat Set down Sir ve make no extra charge for settin down as the king remarked wen he blowed up his ministers Young man said mister Stiggins ostentatiously I fear you are not softened by imprisonment Beg your pardon Sir replied Sam wot wos you graciously pleased to hobserve I apprehend young man that your nature is no softer for this chastening said mister Stiggins in a loud voice Sir replied Sam you re wery kind to say so I hope my natur is NOT a soft vun Sir Wery much obliged to you for your good opinion Sir At this point of the conversation a sound indecorously approaching to a laugh was heard to proceed from the chair in which the elder mister Weller was seated upon which missus Weller on a hasty consideration of all the circumstances of the case considered it her bounden duty to become gradually hysterical Weller said missus W the old gentleman was seated in a corner Weller Come forth Wery much obleeged to you my dear replied mister Weller but I m quite comfortable vere I am Upon this missus Weller burst into tears Wot s gone wrong mum said Sam Oh Samuel replied missus Weller your father makes me wretched Will nothing do him good Do you hear this here said Sam Lady vants to know vether nothin ull do you good Wery much indebted to missus Weller for her po lite inquiries Sammy replied the old gentleman I think a pipe vould benefit me a good deal Could I be accommodated Sammy Here missus Weller let fall some more tears and mister Stiggins groaned Hollo Here s this unfortunate general l m n took ill agin said Sam looking round Vere do you feel it now sir In the same place young man rejoined mister Stiggins in the same place Vere may that be Sir inquired Sam with great outward simplicity In the buzzim young man replied mister Stiggins placing his umbrella on his waistcoat At this affecting reply missus Weller being wholly unable to suppress her feelings sobbed aloud and stated her conviction that the red nosed man was a saint whereupon mister Weller senior ventured to suggest in an undertone that he must be the representative of the united parishes of saint Simon Without and saint Walker Within I m afeered mum said Sam that this here general l m n with the twist in his countenance feels rather thirsty with the melancholy spectacle afore him Is it the case mum The worthy lady looked at mister Stiggins for a reply that gentleman with many rollings of the eye clenched his throat with his right hand and mimicked the act of swallowing to intimate that he was athirst I am afraid Samuel that his feelings have made him so indeed said missus Weller mournfully Wot s your usual tap sir replied Sam Oh my dear young friend replied mister Stiggins all taps is vanities Too true too true indeed said missus Weller murmuring a groan and shaking her head assentingly Well said Sam I des say they may be sir but wich is your partickler wanity Wich wanity do you like the flavour on best sir Oh my dear young friend replied mister Stiggins I despise them all If said mister Stiggins if there is any one of them less odious than another it is the liquor called rum Warm my dear young friend with three lumps of sugar to the tumbler Wery sorry to say sir said Sam that they don t allow that particular wanity to be sold in this here establishment Oh the hardness of heart of these inveterate men ejaculated mister Stiggins Oh the accursed cruelty of these inhuman persecutors With these words mister Stiggins again cast up his eyes and rapped his breast with his umbrella and it is but justice to the reverend gentleman to say that his indignation appeared very real and unfeigned indeed After missus Weller and the red nosed gentleman had commented on this inhuman usage in a very forcible manner and had vented a variety of pious and holy execrations against its authors the latter recommended a bottle of port wine warmed with a little water spice and sugar as being grateful to the stomach and savouring less of vanity than many other compounds It was accordingly ordered to be prepared and pending its preparation the red nosed man and missus Weller looked at the elder W and groaned Well Sammy said the gentleman I hope you ll find your spirits rose by this here lively wisit Wery cheerful and improvin conwersation ain t it Sammy You re a reprobate replied Sam and I desire you won t address no more o them ungraceful remarks to me So far from being edified by this very proper reply the elder mister Weller at once relapsed into a broad grin and this inexorable conduct causing the lady and mister Stiggins to close their eyes and rock themselves to and fro on their chairs in a troubled manner he furthermore indulged in several acts of pantomime indicative of a desire to pummel and wring the nose of the aforesaid Stiggins the performance of which appeared to afford him great mental relief The old gentleman very narrowly escaped detection in one instance for mister Stiggins happening to give a start on the arrival of the negus brought his head in smart contact with the clenched fist with which mister Weller had been describing imaginary fireworks in the air within two inches of his ear for some minutes Wot are you a reachin out your hand for the tumbler in that ere sawage way for said Sam with great promptitude Don t you see you ve hit the general l m n I didn t go to do it Sammy said mister Weller in some degree abashed by the very unexpected occurrence of the incident Try an in ard application sir said Sam as the red nosed gentleman rubbed his head with a rueful visage Wot do you think o that for a go o wanity warm Sir mister Stiggins made no verbal answer but his manner was expressive He tasted the contents of the glass which Sam had placed in his hand put his umbrella on the floor and tasted it again passing his hand placidly across his stomach twice or thrice he then drank the whole at a breath and smacking his lips held out the tumbler for more Nor was missus Weller behind hand in doing justice to the composition The good lady began by protesting that she couldn t touch a drop then took a small drop then a large drop then a great many drops and her feelings being of the nature of those substances which are powerfully affected by the application of strong waters she dropped a tear with every drop of negus and so got on melting the feelings down until at length she had arrived at a very pathetic and decent pitch of misery The elder mister Weller observed these signs and tokens with many manifestations of disgust and when after a second jug of the same mister Stiggins began to sigh in a dismal manner he plainly evinced his disapprobation of the whole proceedings by sundry incoherent ramblings of speech among which frequent angry repetitions of the word gammon were alone distinguishable to the ear I ll tell you wot it is Samivel my boy whispered the old gentleman into his son s ear after a long and steadfast contemplation of his lady and mister Stiggins I think there must be somethin wrong in your mother in law s inside as vell as in that o the red nosed man Wot do you mean said Sam I mean this here Sammy replied the old gentleman that wot they drink don t seem no nourishment to em it all turns to warm water and comes a pourin out o their eyes Pend upon it Sammy it s a constitootional infirmity mister Weller delivered this scientific opinion with many confirmatory frowns and nods which missus Weller remarking and concluding that they bore some disparaging reference either to herself or to mister Stiggins or to both was on the point of becoming infinitely worse when mister Stiggins getting on his legs as well as he could proceeded to deliver an edifying discourse for the benefit of the company but more especially of mister Samuel whom he adjured in moving terms to be upon his guard in that sink of iniquity into which he was cast to abstain from all hypocrisy and pride of heart and to take in all things exact pattern and copy by him Stiggins in which case he might calculate on arriving sooner or later at the comfortable conclusion that like him he was a most estimable and blameless character and that all his acquaintances and friends were hopelessly abandoned and profligate wretches Which consideration he said could not but afford him the liveliest satisfaction He furthermore conjured him to avoid above all things the vice of intoxication which he likened unto the filthy habits of swine and to those poisonous and baleful drugs which being chewed in the mouth are said to filch away the memory At this point of his discourse the reverend and red nosed gentleman became singularly incoherent and staggering to and fro in the excitement of his eloquence was fain to catch at the back of a chair to preserve his perpendicular mister Stiggins did not desire his hearers to be upon their guard against those false prophets and wretched mockers of religion who without sense to expound its first doctrines or hearts to feel its first principles are more dangerous members of society than the common criminal imposing as they necessarily do upon the weakest and worst informed casting scorn and contempt on what should be held most sacred and bringing into partial disrepute large bodies of virtuous and well conducted persons of many excellent sects and persuasions But as he leaned over the back of the chair for a considerable time and closing one eye winked a good deal with the other it is presumed that he thought all this but kept it to himself During the delivery of the oration missus Weller sobbed and wept at the end of the paragraphs while Sam sitting cross legged on a chair and resting his arms on the top rail regarded the speaker with great suavity and blandness of demeanour occasionally bestowing a look of recognition on the old gentleman who was delighted at the beginning and went to sleep about half way Brayvo wery pretty said Sam when the red nosed man having finished pulled his worn gloves on thereby thrusting his fingers through the broken tops till the knuckles were disclosed to view Wery pretty I hope it may do you good Samuel said missus Weller solemnly I think it vill mum replied Sam I wish I could hope that it would do your father good said missus Weller Thank ee my dear said mister Weller senior How do you find yourself arter it my love Scoffer exclaimed missus Weller Benighted man said the Reverend mister Stiggins If I don t get no better light than that ere moonshine o yourn my worthy creetur said the elder mister Weller it s wery likely as I shall continey to be a night coach till I m took off the road altogether Now missus We if the piebald stands at livery much longer he ll stand at nothin as we go back and p raps that ere harm cheer ull be tipped over into some hedge or another with the shepherd in it At this supposition the Reverend mister Stiggins in evident consternation gathered up his hat and umbrella and proposed an immediate departure to which missus Weller assented Sam walked with them to the lodge gate and took a dutiful leave A do Samivel said the old gentleman Wot s a do inquired Sammy Well good bye then said the old gentleman Oh that s wot you re aimin at is it said Sam Good bye Sammy whispered mister Weller looking cautiously round my duty to your gov nor and tell him if he thinks better o this here bis ness to com moonicate vith me Me and a cab net maker has dewised a plan for gettin him out A pianner Samivel a pianner said mister Weller striking his son on the chest with the back of his hand and falling back a step or two Wot do you mean said Sam A pianner forty Samivel rejoined mister Weller in a still more mysterious manner as he can have on hire vun as von t play Sammy And wot ud be the good o that said Sam Let him send to my friend the cabinet maker to fetch it back Sammy replied mister Weller Are you avake now No rejoined Sam There ain t no vurks in it whispered his father It ull hold him easy vith his hat and shoes on and breathe through the legs vich his holler Have a passage ready taken for Merriker The Merrikin gov ment will never give him up ven vunce they find as he s got money to spend Sammy Let the gov nor stop there till missus Bardell s dead or mister Dodson and Fogg s hung wich last ewent I think is the most likely to happen first Sammy and then let him come back and write a book about the Merrikins as ll pay all his expenses and more if he blows em up enough mister Weller delivered this hurried abstract of his plot with great vehemence of whisper and then as if fearful of weakening the effect of the tremendous communication by any further dialogue he gave the coachman s salute and vanished Sam had scarcely recovered his usual composure of countenance which had been greatly disturbed by the secret communication of his respected relative when mister Pickwick accosted him Sam said that gentleman Sir replied mister Weller I am going for a walk round the prison and I wish you to attend me I see a prisoner we know coming this way Sam said mister Pickwick smiling Wich Sir inquired mister Weller the general l m n vith the head o hair or the interestin captive in the stockin s Neither rejoined mister Pickwick He is an older friend of yours Sam O mine Sir exclaimed mister Weller You recollect the gentleman very well I dare say Sam replied mister Pickwick or else you are more unmindful of your old acquaintances than I think you are Hush not a word Sam not a syllable Here he is As mister Pickwick spoke Jingle walked up He looked less miserable than before being clad in a half worn suit of clothes which with mister Pickwick s assistance had been released from the pawnbroker s He wore clean linen too and had had his hair cut He was very pale and thin however and as he crept slowly up leaning on a stick it was easy to see that he had suffered severely from illness and want and was still very weak He took off his hat as mister Pickwick saluted him and seemed much humbled and abashed at the sight of Sam Weller Following close at his heels came mister Job Trotter in the catalogue of whose vices want of faith and attachment to his companion could at all events find no place He was still ragged and squalid but his face was not quite so hollow as on his first meeting with mister Pickwick a few days before As he took off his hat to our benevolent old friend he murmured some broken expressions of gratitude and muttered something about having been saved from starving Well well said mister Pickwick impatiently interrupting him you can follow with Sam I want to speak to you mister Jingle Can you walk without his arm Certainly sir all ready not too fast legs shaky head queer round and round earthquaky sort of feeling very Here give me your arm said mister Pickwick No no replied Jingle won t indeed rather not Nonsense said mister Pickwick lean upon me I desire Sir Seeing that he was confused and agitated and uncertain what to do mister Pickwick cut the matter short by drawing the invalided stroller s arm through his and leading him away without saying another word about it During the whole of this time the countenance of mister Samuel Weller had exhibited an expression of the most overwhelming and absorbing astonishment that the imagination can portray After looking from Job to Jingle and from Jingle to Job in profound silence he softly ejaculated the words Well I AM damn d which he repeated at least a score of times after which exertion he appeared wholly bereft of speech and again cast his eyes first upon the one and then upon the other in mute perplexity and bewilderment Now Sam said mister Pickwick looking back I m a comin sir replied mister Weller mechanically following his master and still he lifted not his eyes from mister Job Trotter who walked at his side in silence Job kept his eyes fixed on the ground for some time Sam with his glued to Job s countenance ran up against the people who were walking about and fell over little children and stumbled against steps and railings without appearing at all sensible of it until Job looking stealthily up said How do you do mister Weller It IS him exclaimed Sam and having established Job s identity beyond all doubt he smote his leg and vented his feelings in a long shrill whistle Things has altered with me sir said Job I should think they had exclaimed mister Weller surveying his companion s rags with undisguised wonder This is rayther a change for the worse mister Trotter as the general l m n said wen he got two doubtful shillin s and sixpenn orth o pocket pieces for a good half crown It is indeed replied Job shaking his head There is no deception now mister Weller Tears said Job with a look of momentary slyness tears are not the only proofs of distress nor the best ones No they ain t replied Sam expressively They may be put on mister Weller said Job I know they may said Sam some people indeed has em always ready laid on and can pull out the plug wenever they likes Yes replied Job but these sort of things are not so easily counterfeited mister Weller and it is a more painful process to get them up As he spoke he pointed to his sallow sunken cheeks and drawing up his coat sleeve disclosed an arm which looked as if the bone could be broken at a touch so sharp and brittle did it appear beneath its thin covering of flesh Wot have you been a doin to yourself said Sam recoiling Nothing replied Job Nothin echoed Sam I have been doin nothing for many weeks past said Job and eating and drinking almost as little Sam took one comprehensive glance at mister Trotter s thin face and wretched apparel and then seizing him by the arm commenced dragging him away with great violence Where are you going mister Weller said Job vainly struggling in the powerful grasp of his old enemy Come on said Sam come on He deigned no further explanation till they reached the tap and then called for a pot of porter which was speedily produced Now said Sam drink that up ev ry drop on it and then turn the pot upside down to let me see as you ve took the medicine But my dear mister Weller remonstrated Job Down vith it said Sam peremptorily Thus admonished mister Trotter raised the pot to his lips and by gentle and almost imperceptible degrees tilted it into the air He paused once and only once to draw a long breath but without raising his face from the vessel which in a few moments thereafter he held out at arm s length bottom upward Nothing fell upon the ground but a few particles of froth which slowly detached themselves from the rim and trickled lazily down Well done said Sam How do you find yourself arter it Better Sir I think I am better responded Job O course you air said Sam argumentatively It s like puttin gas in a balloon I can see with the naked eye that you gets stouter under the operation Wot do you say to another o the same dimensions I would rather not I am much obliged to you Sir replied Job much rather not Vell then wot do you say to some wittles inquired Sam Thanks to your worthy governor Sir said mister Trotter we have half a leg of mutton baked at a quarter before three with the potatoes under it to save boiling Wot Has HE been a purwidin for you asked Sam emphatically He has Sir replied Job More than that mister Weller my master being very ill he got us a room we were in a kennel before and paid for it Sir and come to look at us at night when nobody should know mister Weller said Job with real tears in his eyes for once I could serve that gentleman till I fell down dead at his feet I say said Sam I ll trouble you my friend None o that Job Trotter looked amazed None o that I say young feller repeated Sam firmly No man serves him but me And now we re upon it I ll let you into another secret besides that said Sam as he paid for the beer I never heerd mind you or read of in story books nor see in picters any angel in tights and gaiters not even in spectacles as I remember though that may ha been done for anythin I know to the contrairey but mark my vords Job Trotter he s a reg lar thoroughbred angel for all that and let me see the man as wenturs to tell me he knows a better vun With this defiance mister Weller buttoned up his change in a side pocket and with many confirmatory nods and gestures by the way proceeded in search of the subject of discourse They found mister Pickwick in company with Jingle talking very earnestly and not bestowing a look on the groups who were congregated on the racket ground they were very motley groups too and worth the looking at if it were only in idle curiosity Well said mister Pickwick as Sam and his companion drew nigh you will see how your health becomes and think about it meanwhile Make the statement out for me when you feel yourself equal to the task and I will discuss the subject with you when I have considered it Now go to your room You are tired and not strong enough to be out long mister Alfred Jingle without one spark of his old animation with nothing even of the dismal gaiety which he had assumed when mister Pickwick first stumbled on him in his misery bowed low without speaking and motioning to Job not to follow him just yet crept slowly away Curious scene this is it not Sam said mister Pickwick looking good humouredly round Wery much so Sir replied Sam Wonders ull never cease added Sam speaking to himself I m wery much mistaken if that ere Jingle worn t a doin somethin in the water cart way The area formed by the wall in that part of the Fleet in which mister Pickwick stood was just wide enough to make a good racket court one side being formed of course by the wall itself and the other by that portion of the prison which looked or rather would have looked but for the wall towards saint Paul s Cathedral Sauntering or sitting about in every possible attitude of listless idleness were a great number of debtors the major part of whom were waiting in prison until their day of going up before the Insolvent Court should arrive while others had been remanded for various terms which they were idling away as they best could Some were shabby some were smart many dirty a few clean but there they all lounged and loitered and slunk about with as little spirit or purpose as the beasts in a menagerie Lolling from the windows which commanded a view of this promenade were a number of persons some in noisy conversation with their acquaintance below others playing at ball with some adventurous throwers outside others looking on at the racket players or watching the boys as they cried the game Dirty slipshod women passed and repassed on their way to the cooking house in one corner of the yard children screamed and fought and played together in another the tumbling of the skittles and the shouts of the players mingled perpetually with these and a hundred other sounds and all was noise and tumult save in a little miserable shed a few yards off where lay all quiet and ghastly the body of the Chancery prisoner who had died the night before awaiting the mockery of an inquest The body It is the lawyer s term for the restless whirling mass of cares and anxieties affections hopes and griefs that make up the living man The law had his body and there it lay clothed in grave clothes an awful witness to its tender mercy Would you like to see a whistling shop Sir inquired Job Trotter What do you mean was mister Pickwick s counter inquiry A vistlin shop Sir interposed mister Weller What is that Sam A bird fancier s inquired mister Pickwick Bless your heart no Sir replied Job a whistling shop Sir is where they sell spirits mister Job Trotter briefly explained here that all persons being prohibited under heavy penalties from conveying spirits into debtors prisons and such commodities being highly prized by the ladies and gentlemen confined therein it had occurred to some speculative turnkey to connive for certain lucrative considerations at two or three prisoners retailing the favourite article of gin for their own profit and advantage This plan you see Sir has been gradually introduced into all the prisons for debt said mister Trotter And it has this wery great advantage said Sam that the turnkeys takes wery good care to seize hold o ev rybody but them as pays em that attempts the willainy and wen it gets in the papers they re applauded for their wigilance so it cuts two ways frightens other people from the trade and elewates their own characters Exactly so mister Weller observed Job Well but are these rooms never searched to ascertain whether any spirits are concealed in them said mister Pickwick Cert nly they are Sir replied Sam but the turnkeys knows beforehand and gives the word to the wistlers and you may wistle for it wen you go to look By this time Job had tapped at a door which was opened by a gentleman with an uncombed head who bolted it after them when they had walked in and grinned upon which Job grinned and Sam also whereupon mister Pickwick thinking it might be expected of him kept on smiling to the end of the interview The gentleman with the uncombed head appeared quite satisfied with this mute announcement of their business and producing a flat stone bottle which might hold about a couple of quarts from beneath his bedstead filled out three glasses of gin which Job Trotter and Sam disposed of in a most workmanlike manner Any more said the whistling gentleman No more replied Job Trotter mister Pickwick paid the door was unbolted and out they came the uncombed gentleman bestowing a friendly nod upon mister Roker who happened to be passing at the moment From this spot mister Pickwick wandered along all the galleries up and down all the staircases and once again round the whole area of the yard The great body of the prison population appeared to be Mivins and Smangle and the parson and the butcher and the leg over and over and over again There were the same squalor the same turmoil and noise the same general characteristics in every corner in the best and the worst alike The whole place seemed restless and troubled and the people were crowding and flitting to and fro like the shadows in an uneasy dream I have seen enough said mister Pickwick as he threw himself into a chair in his little apartment My head aches with these scenes and my heart too Henceforth I will be a prisoner in my own room And mister Pickwick steadfastly adhered to this determination For three long months he remained shut up all day only stealing out at night to breathe the air when the greater part of his fellow prisoners were in bed or carousing in their rooms His health was beginning to suffer from the closeness of the confinement but neither the often repeated entreaties of Perker and his friends nor the still more frequently repeated warnings and admonitions of mister Samuel Weller could induce him to alter one jot of his inflexible resolution

none	none	RECORDS A TOUCHING ACT OF DELICATE FEELING NOT UNMIXED WITH PLEASANTRY ACHIEVED AND PERFORMED BY Messrs DODSON AND FOGG It was within a week of the close of the month of July that a hackney cabriolet number unrecorded was seen to proceed at a rapid pace up Goswell Street three people were squeezed into it besides the driver who sat in his own particular little dickey at the side over the apron were hung two shawls belonging to two small vixenish looking ladies under the apron between whom compressed into a very small compass was stowed away a gentleman of heavy and subdued demeanour who whenever he ventured to make an observation was snapped up short by one of the vixenish ladies before mentioned 
1265_135635_000001_000001	train-clean-360	Lastly the two vixenish ladies and the heavy gentleman were giving the driver contradictory directions all tending to the one point that he should stop at missus Bardell s door which the heavy gentleman in direct opposition to and defiance of the vixenish ladies contended was a green door and not a yellow one 
1265_135635_000002_000000	train-clean-360	 Stop at the house with a green door driver said the heavy gentleman 
none	none	Oh You perwerse creetur exclaimed one of the vixenish ladies Drive to the ouse with the yellow door cabmin Upon this the cabman who in a sudden effort to pull up at the house with the green door had pulled the horse up so high that he nearly pulled him backward into the cabriolet let the animal s fore legs down to the ground again and paused
1265_135635_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 Now vere am I to pull up inquired the driver 
1265_135635_000005_000001	train-clean-360	 Settle it among yourselves 
none	none	All I ask is vere Here the contest was renewed with increased violence and the horse being troubled with a fly on his nose the cabman humanely employed his leisure in lashing him about on the head on the counter irritation principle Most wotes carries the day said one of the vixenish ladies at length The ouse with the yellow door cabman But after the cabriolet had dashed up in splendid style to the house with the yellow door making as one of the vixenish ladies triumphantly said acterrally more noise than if one had come in one s own carriage and after the driver had dismounted to assist the ladies in getting out the small round head of Master Thomas Bardell was thrust out of the one pair window of a house with a red door a few numbers off
1265_135635_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 Aggrawatin thing said the vixenish lady last mentioned darting a withering glance at the heavy gentleman 
1265_135635_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 My dear it s not my fault said the gentleman 
1265_135635_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t talk to me you creetur don t retorted the lady 
1265_135635_000011_000001	train-clean-360	 The house with the red door cabmin 
none	none	Oh If ever a woman was troubled with a ruffinly creetur that takes a pride and a pleasure in disgracing his wife on every possible occasion afore strangers I am that woman
1265_135635_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 You ought to be ashamed of yourself Raddle said the other little woman who was no other than missus Cluppins What have I been a doing of asked mister Raddle 
1265_135635_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t talk to me don t you brute for fear I should be perwoked to forgit my sect and strike you said missus Raddle 
none	none	While this dialogue was going on the driver was most ignominiously leading the horse by the bridle up to the house with the red door which Master Bardell had already opened Here was a mean and low way of arriving at a friend s house No dashing up with all the fire and fury of the animal no jumping down of the driver no loud knocking at the door no opening of the apron with a crash at the very last moment for fear of the ladies sitting in a draught and then the man handing the shawls out afterwards as if he were a private coachman 
1265_135635_000014_000003	train-clean-360	The whole edge of the thing had been taken off it was flatter than walking 
1265_135635_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 Well Tommy said missus Cluppins how s your poor dear mother 
1265_135635_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh she s very well replied Master Bardell She s in the front parlour all ready 
1265_135635_000016_000001	train-clean-360	I m ready too I am Here Master Bardell put his hands in his pockets and jumped off and on the bottom step of the door 
none	none	Is anybody else a goin Tommy said missus Cluppins arranging her pelerine missus 
1265_135635_000018_000001	train-clean-360	Sanders is going she is replied Tommy I m going too I am 
1265_135635_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Drat the boy said little missus Cluppins He thinks of nobody but himself 
1265_135635_000019_000001	train-clean-360	Here Tommy dear 
none	none	Well said Master Bardell
1265_135635_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Who else is a goin lovey said missus Cluppins in an insinuating manner 
1265_135635_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh missus Rogers is a goin replied Master Bardell opening his eyes very wide as he delivered the intelligence 
none	none	What 
1265_135635_000023_000001	train-clean-360	The lady as has taken the lodgings ejaculated missus Cluppins 
1265_135635_000024_000000	train-clean-360	Master Bardell put his hands deeper down into his pockets and nodded exactly thirty five times to imply that it was the lady lodger and no other 
1265_135635_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Bless us said missus Cluppins 
1265_135635_000025_000001	train-clean-360	 It s quite a party 
none	none	Ah if you knew what was in the cupboard you d say so replied Master Bardell
1265_135635_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 What is there Tommy said missus Cluppins coaxingly 
none	none	You ll tell ME Tommy I know No I won t replied Master Bardell shaking his head and applying himself to the bottom step again Drat the child muttered missus Cluppins What a prowokin little wretch it is 
1265_135635_000028_000001	train-clean-360	Come Tommy tell your dear Cluppy 
1265_135635_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Mother said I wasn t to rejoined Master Bardell I m a goin to have some I am Cheered by this prospect the precocious boy applied himself to his infantile treadmill with increased vigour 
none	none	The above examination of a child of tender years took place while mister and missus Raddle and the cab driver were having an altercation concerning the fare which terminating at this point in favour of the cabman missus Raddle came up tottering Lauk Mary Ann what s the matter said missus Cluppins
1265_135635_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 It s put me all over in such a tremble Betsy replied missus Raddle Raddle ain t like a man he leaves everythink to me 
1265_135635_000033_000000	train-clean-360	This was scarcely fair upon the unfortunate mister Raddle who had been thrust aside by his good lady in the commencement of the dispute and peremptorily commanded to hold his tongue 
none	none	He had no opportunity of defending himself however for missus Raddle gave unequivocal signs of fainting which being perceived from the parlour window missus Bardell missus Sanders the lodger and the lodger s servant darted precipitately out and conveyed her into the house all talking at the same time and giving utterance to various expressions of pity and condolence as if she were one of the most suffering mortals on earth Being conveyed into the front parlour she was there deposited on a sofa and the lady from the first floor running up to the first floor returned with a bottle of sal volatile which holding missus Raddle tight round the neck she applied in all womanly kindness and pity to her nose until that lady with many plunges and struggles was fain to declare herself decidedly better
1265_135635_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 Ah poor thing said missus Rogers I know what her feelin s is too well Ah poor thing so do I said missus Sanders and then all the ladies moaned in unison and said they knew what it was and they pitied her from their hearts they did 
1265_135635_000034_000001	train-clean-360	Even the lodger s little servant who was thirteen years old and three feet high murmured her sympathy 
none	none	But what s been the matter said missus Bardell
1265_135635_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Ah what has decomposed you ma am inquired missus Rogers 
1265_135635_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 I have been a good deal flurried replied missus Raddle in a reproachful manner 
1265_135635_000037_000001	train-clean-360	Thereupon the ladies cast indignant glances at mister Raddle 
none	none	Why the fact is said that unhappy gentleman stepping forward when we alighted at this door a dispute arose with the driver of the cabrioily A loud scream from his wife at the mention of this word rendered all further explanation inaudible You d better leave us to bring her round Raddle said missus Cluppins She ll never get better as long as you re here 
1265_135635_000040_000000	train-clean-360	All the ladies concurred in this opinion so mister Raddle was pushed out of the room and requested to give himself an airing in the back yard Which he did for about a quarter of an hour when missus Bardell announced to him with a solemn face that he might come in now but that he must be very careful how he behaved towards his wife 
none	none	She knew he didn t mean to be unkind but Mary Ann was very far from strong and if he didn t take care he might lose her when he least expected it which would be a very dreadful reflection for him afterwards and so on All this mister Raddle heard with great submission and presently returned to the parlour in a most lamb like manner
1265_135635_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 Why missus Rogers ma am said missus Bardell you ve never been introduced I declare 
1265_135635_000041_000001	train-clean-360	mister Raddle ma am missus Cluppins ma am missus Raddle ma am 
1265_135635_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Which is missus Cluppins s sister suggested missus Sanders 
1265_135635_000043_000001	train-clean-360	 Oh indeed 
1265_135635_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh indeed said missus Rogers graciously for she was the lodger and her servant was in waiting so she was more gracious than intimate in right of her position 
none	none	Oh indeed 
1265_135635_000044_000000	train-clean-360	missus Raddle smiled sweetly mister Raddle bowed and missus Cluppins said she was sure she was very happy to have an opportunity of being known to a lady which she had heerd so much in favour of as missus Rogers A compliment which the last named lady acknowledged with graceful condescension 
1265_135635_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 Well mister Raddle said missus Bardell I m sure you ought to feel very much honoured at you and Tommy being the only gentlemen to escort so many ladies all the way to the Spaniards at Hampstead 
none	none	Don t you think he ought missus Rogers ma am Oh certainly ma am replied missus Rogers after whom all the other ladies responded Oh certainly Of course I feel it ma am said mister Raddle rubbing his hands and evincing a slight tendency to brighten up a little
1265_135635_000046_000001	train-clean-360	 Indeed to tell you the truth I said as we was a coming along in the cabrioily 
none	none	At the recapitulation of the word which awakened so many painful recollections missus Raddle applied her handkerchief to her eyes again and uttered a half suppressed scream so that missus Bardell frowned upon mister Raddle to intimate that he had better not say anything more and desired missus Rogers s servant with an air to put the wine on This was the signal for displaying the hidden treasures of the closet which comprised sundry plates of oranges and biscuits and a bottle of old crusted port that at one and nine with another of the celebrated East India sherry at fourteen pence which were all produced in honour of the lodger and afforded unlimited satisfaction to everybody After great consternation had been excited in the mind of missus Cluppins by an attempt on the part of Tommy to recount how he had been cross examined regarding the cupboard then in action which was fortunately nipped in the bud by his imbibing half a glass of the old crusted the wrong way and thereby endangering his life for some seconds the party walked forth in quest of a Hampstead stage This was soon found and in a couple of hours they all arrived safely in the Spaniards Tea gardens where the luckless mister Raddle s very first act nearly occasioned his good lady a relapse it being neither more nor less than to order tea for seven whereas as the ladies one and all remarked what could have been easier than for Tommy to have drank out of anybody s cup or everybody s if that was all when the waiter wasn t looking which would have saved one head of tea and the tea just as good However there was no help for it and the tea tray came with seven cups and saucers and bread and butter on the same scale 
1265_135635_000049_000001	train-clean-360	missus Bardell was unanimously voted into the chair and missus Rogers being stationed on her right hand and missus Raddle on her left the meal proceeded with great merriment and success 
1265_135635_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 How sweet the country is to be sure sighed missus Rogers I almost wish I lived in it always 
1265_135635_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh you wouldn t like that ma am replied missus Bardell rather hastily for it was not at all advisable with reference to the lodgings to encourage such notions you wouldn t like it ma am 
none	none	Oh I should think you was a deal too lively and sought after to be content with the country ma am said little missus Cluppins
1265_135635_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 Perhaps I am ma am 
1265_135635_000053_000001	train-clean-360	Perhaps I am sighed the first floor lodger 
1265_135635_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 For lone people as have got nobody to care for them or take care of them or as have been hurt in their mind or that kind of thing observed mister Raddle plucking up a little cheerfulness and looking round the country is all very well 
1265_135635_000054_000001	train-clean-360	The country for a wounded spirit they say 
1265_135635_000055_000000	train-clean-360	Now of all things in the world that the unfortunate man could have said any would have been preferable to this 
1265_135635_000055_000001	train-clean-360	Of course missus Bardell burst into tears and requested to be led from the table instantly upon which the affectionate child began to cry too most dismally 
1265_135635_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 Would anybody believe ma am exclaimed missus Raddle turning fiercely to the first floor lodger that a woman could be married to such a unmanly creetur which can tamper with a woman s feelings as he does every hour in the day ma am 
1265_135635_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 My dear remonstrated mister Raddle I didn t mean anything my dear 
1265_135635_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 You didn t mean repeated missus Raddle with great scorn and contempt Go away 
1265_135635_000058_000001	train-clean-360	I can t bear the sight on you you brute 
1265_135635_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 You must not flurry yourself Mary Ann interposed missus Cluppins 
1265_135635_000059_000001	train-clean-360	 You really must consider yourself my dear which you never do 
1265_135635_000059_000002	train-clean-360	Now go away Raddle there s a good soul or you ll only aggravate her 
none	none	You had better take your tea by yourself Sir indeed said missus Rogers again applying the smelling bottle 
1265_135635_000061_000000	train-clean-360	missus Sanders who according to custom was very busy with the bread and butter expressed the same opinion and mister Raddle quietly retired 
none	none	After this there was a great hoisting up of Master Bardell who was rather a large size for hugging into his mother s arms in which operation he got his boots in the tea board and occasioned some confusion among the cups and saucers 
1265_135635_000062_000001	train-clean-360	But that description of fainting fits which is contagious among ladies seldom lasts long so when he had been well kissed and a little cried over missus Bardell recovered set him down again wondering how she could have been so foolish and poured out some more tea 
1265_135635_000063_000000	train-clean-360	It was at this moment that the sound of approaching wheels was heard and that the ladies looking up saw a hackney coach stop at the garden gate 
1265_135635_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 More company said missus Sanders 
1265_135635_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 It s a gentleman said missus Raddle 
none	none	Well if it ain t mister Jackson the young man from Dodson and Fogg s cried missus Bardell Why gracious 
1265_135635_000066_000001	train-clean-360	Surely mister Pickwick can t have paid the damages 
1265_135635_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 Or hoffered marriage said missus Cluppins 
1265_135635_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 Dear me how slow the gentleman is exclaimed missus Rogers 
1265_135635_000068_000001	train-clean-360	 Why doesn t he make haste 
1265_135635_000069_000000	train-clean-360	As the lady spoke these words mister Jackson turned from the coach where he had been addressing some observations to a shabby man in black leggings who had just emerged from the vehicle with a thick ash stick in his hand and made his way to the place where the ladies were seated winding his hair round the brim of his hat as he came along 
none	none	Is anything the matter Has anything taken place mister Jackson said missus Bardell eagerly
1265_135635_000070_000000	train-clean-360	 Nothing whatever ma am replied mister Jackson 
none	none	How de do ladies I have to ask pardon ladies for intruding but the law ladies the law With this apology mister Jackson smiled made a comprehensive bow and gave his hair another wind 
1265_135635_000070_000002	train-clean-360	missus Rogers whispered missus Raddle that he was really an elegant young man 
1265_135635_000071_000000	train-clean-360	 I called in Goswell Street resumed mister Jackson and hearing that you were here from the slavey took a coach and came on 
none	none	Our people want you down in the city directly missus Bardell
1265_135635_000072_000000	train-clean-360	 Lor ejaculated that lady starting at the sudden nature of the communication 
1265_135635_000073_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes said mister Jackson biting his lip 
1265_135635_000073_000001	train-clean-360	 It s very important and pressing business which can t be postponed on any account 
none	none	Indeed Dodson expressly said so to me and so did Fogg 
1265_135635_000073_000003	train-clean-360	I ve kept the coach on purpose for you to go back in 
none	none	How very strange exclaimed missus Bardell 
1265_135635_000075_000000	train-clean-360	The ladies agreed that it WAS very strange but were unanimously of opinion that it must be very important or Dodson Fogg would never have sent and further that the business being urgent she ought to repair to Dodson Fogg s without any delay 
1265_135635_000076_000000	train-clean-360	There was a certain degree of pride and importance about being wanted by one s lawyers in such a monstrous hurry that was by no means displeasing to missus Bardell especially as it might be reasonably supposed to enhance her consequence in the eyes of the first floor lodger 
none	none	She simpered a little affected extreme vexation and hesitation and at last arrived at the conclusion that she supposed she must go
1265_135635_000077_000000	train-clean-360	 But won t you refresh yourself after your walk mister Jackson said missus Bardell persuasively 
none	none	Why really there ain t much time to lose replied Jackson and I ve got a friend here he continued looking towards the man with the ash stick
1265_135635_000079_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh ask your friend to come here Sir said missus Bardell Pray ask your friend here Sir 
1265_135635_000080_000000	train-clean-360	 Why thank ee I d rather not said mister Jackson with some embarrassment of manner 
1265_135635_000080_000001	train-clean-360	 He s not much used to ladies society and it makes him bashful 
1265_135635_000080_000002	train-clean-360	If you ll order the waiter to deliver him anything short he won t drink it off at once won t he only try him mister Jackson s fingers wandered playfully round his nose at this portion of his discourse to warn his hearers that he was speaking ironically 
1265_135635_000081_000000	train-clean-360	The waiter was at once despatched to the bashful gentleman and the bashful gentleman took something mister Jackson also took something and the ladies took something for hospitality s sake 
1265_135635_000081_000001	train-clean-360	mister Jackson then said he was afraid it was time to go upon which missus Sanders missus Cluppins and Tommy who it was arranged should accompany missus Bardell leaving the others to mister Raddle s protection got into the coach 
1265_135635_000082_000000	train-clean-360	 Isaac said Jackson as missus Bardell prepared to get in looking up at the man with the ash stick who was seated on the box smoking a cigar 
none	none	Well
1265_135635_000084_000000	train-clean-360	 This is missus Bardell 
none	none	Oh I know d that long ago said the man 
1265_135635_000086_000000	train-clean-360	missus Bardell got in mister Jackson got in after her and away they drove missus Bardell could not help ruminating on what mister Jackson s friend had said 
1265_135635_000086_000001	train-clean-360	Shrewd creatures those lawyers 
1265_135635_000086_000002	train-clean-360	Lord bless us how they find people out 
1265_135635_000087_000000	train-clean-360	 Sad thing about these costs of our people s ain t it said Jackson when missus Cluppins and missus Sanders had fallen asleep your bill of costs I mean 
1265_135635_000088_000000	train-clean-360	 I m very sorry they can t get them replied missus Bardell But if you law gentlemen do these things on speculation why you must get a loss now and then you know 
none	none	You gave them a COGNOVIT for the amount of your costs after the trial I m told said Jackson Yes Just as a matter of form replied missus Bardell
1265_135635_000091_000000	train-clean-360	 Certainly replied Jackson drily 
none	none	Quite a matter of form Quite 
1265_135635_000092_000000	train-clean-360	On they drove and missus Bardell fell asleep 
1265_135635_000092_000001	train-clean-360	She was awakened after some time by the stopping of the coach 
1265_135635_000093_000000	train-clean-360	 Bless us said the lady Are we at Freeman s Court 
1265_135635_000094_000000	train-clean-360	 We re not going quite so far replied Jackson 
1265_135635_000094_000001	train-clean-360	 Have the goodness to step out 
1265_135635_000095_000000	train-clean-360	missus Bardell not yet thoroughly awake complied 
none	none	It was a curious place a large wall with a gate in the middle and a gas light burning inside
1265_135635_000096_000000	train-clean-360	 Now ladies cried the man with the ash stick looking into the coach and shaking missus Sanders to wake her Come Rousing her friend missus Sanders alighted 
1265_135635_000096_000001	train-clean-360	missus Bardell leaning on Jackson s arm and leading Tommy by the hand had already entered the porch 
1265_135635_000096_000002	train-clean-360	They followed 
1265_135635_000097_000000	train-clean-360	The room they turned into was even more odd looking than the porch 
1265_135635_000097_000001	train-clean-360	Such a number of men standing about 
1265_135635_000097_000002	train-clean-360	And they stared so 
1265_135635_000098_000000	train-clean-360	 What place is this inquired missus Bardell pausing 
1265_135635_000099_000000	train-clean-360	 Only one of our public offices replied Jackson hurrying her through a door and looking round to see that the other women were following Look sharp Isaac 
1265_135635_000100_000000	train-clean-360	 Safe and sound replied the man with the ash stick 
1265_135635_000100_000001	train-clean-360	The door swung heavily after them and they descended a small flight of steps 
1265_135635_000101_000000	train-clean-360	 Here we are at last 
none	none	All right and tight missus Bardell said Jackson looking exultingly round
1265_135635_000102_000000	train-clean-360	 What do you mean said missus Bardell with a palpitating heart 
none	none	Just this replied Jackson drawing her a little on one side don t be frightened missus Bardell There never was a more delicate man than Dodson ma am or a more humane man than Fogg 
1265_135635_000103_000002	train-clean-360	It was their duty in the way of business to take you in execution for them costs but they were anxious to spare your feelings as much as they could 
1265_135635_000103_000003	train-clean-360	What a comfort it must be to you to think how it s been done 
1265_135635_000103_000004	train-clean-360	This is the Fleet ma am Wish you good night missus Bardell 
1265_135635_000103_000005	train-clean-360	Good night Tommy 
1265_135635_000104_000000	train-clean-360	As Jackson hurried away in company with the man with the ash stick another man with a key in his hand who had been looking on led the bewildered female to a second short flight of steps leading to a doorway 
1265_135635_000104_000001	train-clean-360	missus Bardell screamed violently Tommy roared missus Cluppins shrunk within herself and missus Sanders made off without more ado 
none	none	For there stood the injured mister Pickwick taking his nightly allowance of air and beside him leant Samuel Weller who seeing missus Bardell took his hat off with mock reverence while his master turned indignantly on his heel
1265_135635_000105_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t bother the woman said the turnkey to Weller she s just come in 
1265_135635_000106_000000	train-clean-360	 A prisoner said Sam quickly replacing his hat 
1265_135635_000106_000001	train-clean-360	 Who s the plaintives 
none	none	What for 
1265_135635_000106_000003	train-clean-360	Speak up old feller 
none	none	Dodson and Fogg replied the man execution on COGNOVIT for costs Here Job Job shouted Sam dashing into the passage Run to mister Perker s Job 
1265_135635_000108_000002	train-clean-360	I want him directly 
1265_135635_000108_000003	train-clean-360	I see some good in this 
none	none	Here s a game Hooray vere s the gov nor But there was no reply to these inquiries for Job had started furiously off the instant he received his commission and missus Bardell had fainted in real downright earnest CHAPTER XLVII IS CHIEFLY DEVOTED TO MATTERS OF BUSINESS AND THE TEMPORAL ADVANTAGE OF DODSON AND FOGG mister WINKLE REAPPEARS UNDER EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES mister PICKWICK S BENEVOLENCE PROVES STRONGER THAN HIS OBSTINACY Job Trotter abating nothing of his speed ran up Holborn sometimes in the middle of the road sometimes on the pavement sometimes in the gutter as the chances of getting along varied with the press of men women children and coaches in each division of the thoroughfare and regardless of all obstacles stopped not for an instant until he reached the gate of Gray s Inn Notwithstanding all the expedition he had used however the gate had been closed a good half hour when he reached it and by the time he had discovered mister Perker s laundress who lived with a married daughter who had bestowed her hand upon a non resident waiter who occupied the one pair of some number in some street closely adjoining to some brewery somewhere behind Gray s Inn Lane it was within fifteen minutes of closing the prison for the night 
1265_135636_000001_000002	train-clean-360	mister Lowten had still to be ferreted out from the back parlour of the Magpie and Stump and Job had scarcely accomplished this object and communicated Sam Weller s message when the clock struck ten 
1265_135636_000002_000000	train-clean-360	 There said Lowten it s too late now 
1265_135636_000002_000001	train-clean-360	You can t get in to night you ve got the key of the street my friend 
none	none	Never mind me replied Job
1265_135636_000003_000001	train-clean-360	 I can sleep anywhere 
1265_135636_000003_000002	train-clean-360	But won t it be better to see mister Perker to night so that we may be there the first thing in the morning 
none	none	Why responded Lowten after a little consideration if it was in anybody else s case Perker wouldn t be best pleased at my going up to his house but as it s mister Pickwick s I think I may venture to take a cab and charge it to the office Deciding on this line of conduct mister Lowten took up his hat and begging the assembled company to appoint a deputy chairman during his temporary absence led the way to the nearest coach stand 
1265_135636_000004_000001	train-clean-360	Summoning the cab of most promising appearance he directed the driver to repair to Montague Place Russell Square 
1265_135636_000005_000000	train-clean-360	mister Perker had had a dinner party that day as was testified by the appearance of lights in the drawing room windows the sound of an improved grand piano and an improvable cabinet voice issuing therefrom and a rather overpowering smell of meat which pervaded the steps and entry 
none	none	In fact a couple of very good country agencies happening to come up to town at the same time an agreeable little party had been got together to meet them comprising mister Snicks the Life Office Secretary mister Prosee the eminent counsel three solicitors one commissioner of bankrupts a special pleader from the Temple a small eyed peremptory young gentleman his pupil who had written a lively book about the law of demises with a vast quantity of marginal notes and references and several other eminent and distinguished personages From this society little mister Perker detached himself on his clerk being announced in a whisper and repairing to the dining room there found mister Lowten and Job Trotter looking very dim and shadowy by the light of a kitchen candle which the gentleman who condescended to appear in plush shorts and cottons for a quarterly stipend had with a becoming contempt for the clerk and all things appertaining to the office placed upon the table
1265_135636_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 Now Lowten said little mister Perker shutting the door what s the matter 
1265_135636_000006_000001	train-clean-360	No important letter come in a parcel is there 
1265_135636_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 No Sir replied Lowten 
1265_135636_000007_000001	train-clean-360	 This is a messenger from mister Pickwick Sir 
1265_135636_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 From Pickwick eh said the little man turning quickly to Job Well what is it 
1265_135636_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 Dodson and Fogg have taken missus Bardell in execution for her costs Sir said Job 
1265_135636_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 No exclaimed Perker putting his hands in his pockets and reclining against the sideboard 
none	none	Yes said Job It seems they got a cognovit out of her for the amount of em directly after the trial
1265_135636_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 By Jove said Perker taking both hands out of his pockets and striking the knuckles of his right against the palm of his left emphatically those are the cleverest scamps I ever had anything to do with 
none	none	The sharpest practitioners I ever knew Sir observed Lowten Sharp echoed Perker There s no knowing where to have them Very true Sir there is not replied Lowten and then both master and man pondered for a few seconds with animated countenances as if they were reflecting upon one of the most beautiful and ingenious discoveries that the intellect of man had ever made 
1265_135636_000015_000001	train-clean-360	When they had in some measure recovered from their trance of admiration Job Trotter discharged himself of the rest of his commission 
1265_135636_000015_000002	train-clean-360	Perker nodded his head thoughtfully and pulled out his watch 
none	none	At ten precisely I will be there said the little man
1265_135636_000016_000001	train-clean-360	 Sam is quite right 
none	none	Tell him so 
1265_135636_000016_000003	train-clean-360	Will you take a glass of wine Lowten No thank you Sir 
none	none	You mean yes I think said the little man turning to the sideboard for a decanter and glasses 
1265_135636_000018_000000	train-clean-360	As Lowten DID mean yes he said no more on the subject but inquired of Job in an audible whisper whether the portrait of Perker which hung opposite the fireplace wasn t a wonderful likeness to which Job of course replied that it was 
1265_135636_000018_000001	train-clean-360	The wine being by this time poured out Lowten drank to missus Perker and the children and Job to Perker 
1265_135636_000018_000002	train-clean-360	The gentleman in the plush shorts and cottons considering it no part of his duty to show the people from the office out consistently declined to answer the bell and they showed themselves out 
1265_135636_000018_000003	train-clean-360	The attorney betook himself to his drawing room the clerk to the Magpie and Stump and Job to Covent Garden Market to spend the night in a vegetable basket 
1265_135636_000019_000000	train-clean-360	Punctually at the appointed hour next morning the good humoured little attorney tapped at mister Pickwick s door which was opened with great alacrity by Sam Weller 
none	none	mister Perker sir said Sam announcing the visitor to mister Pickwick who was sitting at the window in a thoughtful attitude Wery glad you ve looked in accidentally Sir 
1265_135636_000020_000002	train-clean-360	I rather think the gov nor wants to have a word and a half with you Sir 
none	none	Perker bestowed a look of intelligence on Sam intimating that he understood he was not to say he had been sent for and beckoning him to approach whispered briefly in his ear You don t mean that ere Sir said Sam starting back in excessive surprise 
1265_135636_000023_000000	train-clean-360	Perker nodded and smiled 
1265_135636_000024_000000	train-clean-360	mister Samuel Weller looked at the little lawyer then at mister Pickwick then at the ceiling then at Perker again grinned laughed outright and finally catching up his hat from the carpet without further explanation disappeared 
1265_135636_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 What does this mean inquired mister Pickwick looking at Perker with astonishment 
1265_135636_000025_000001	train-clean-360	 What has put Sam into this extraordinary state 
1265_135636_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh nothing nothing replied Perker Come my dear Sir draw up your chair to the table 
1265_135636_000026_000001	train-clean-360	I have a good deal to say to you 
1265_135636_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 What papers are those inquired mister Pickwick as the little man deposited on the table a small bundle of documents tied with red tape 
1265_135636_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 The papers in Bardell and Pickwick replied Perker undoing the knot with his teeth 
none	none	mister Pickwick grated the legs of his chair against the ground and throwing himself into it folded his hands and looked sternly if mister Pickwick ever could look sternly at his legal friend You don t like to hear the name of the cause said the little man still busying himself with the knot
1265_135636_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 No I do not indeed replied mister Pickwick 
1265_135636_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Sorry for that resumed Perker because it will form the subject of our conversation 
1265_135636_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 I would rather that the subject should be never mentioned between us Perker interposed mister Pickwick hastily 
1265_135636_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 Pooh pooh my dear Sir said the little man untying the bundle and glancing eagerly at mister Pickwick out of the corners of his eyes 
1265_135636_000034_000001	train-clean-360	 It must be mentioned 
1265_135636_000034_000002	train-clean-360	I have come here on purpose 
1265_135636_000034_000003	train-clean-360	Now are you ready to hear what I have to say my dear Sir 
1265_135636_000034_000004	train-clean-360	No hurry if you are not I can wait 
none	none	I have this morning s paper here Your time shall be mine 
1265_135636_000034_000007	train-clean-360	There Hereupon the little man threw one leg over the other and made a show of beginning to read with great composure and application 
1265_135636_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Well well said mister Pickwick with a sigh but softening into a smile at the same time 
1265_135636_000035_000001	train-clean-360	 Say what you have to say it s the old story I suppose 
1265_135636_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 With a difference my dear Sir with a difference rejoined Perker deliberately folding up the paper and putting it into his pocket again missus 
1265_135636_000036_000001	train-clean-360	Bardell the plaintiff in the action is within these walls Sir 
1265_135636_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 I know it was mister Pickwick s reply 
1265_135636_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Very good retorted Perker 
1265_135636_000038_000001	train-clean-360	 And you know how she comes here I suppose I mean on what grounds and at whose suit 
1265_135636_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes at least I have heard Sam s account of the matter said mister Pickwick with affected carelessness 
1265_135636_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 Sam s account of the matter replied Perker is I will venture to say a perfectly correct one 
1265_135636_000040_000001	train-clean-360	Well now my dear Sir the first question I have to ask is whether this woman is to remain here 
1265_135636_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 To remain here echoed mister Pickwick 
none	none	To remain here my dear Sir rejoined Perker leaning back in his chair and looking steadily at his client How can you ask me said that gentleman
1265_135636_000043_000001	train-clean-360	 It rests with Dodson and Fogg you know that very well 
1265_135636_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 I know nothing of the kind retorted Perker firmly 
1265_135636_000044_000001	train-clean-360	 It does NOT rest with Dodson and Fogg you know the men my dear Sir as well as I do 
1265_135636_000044_000002	train-clean-360	It rests solely wholly and entirely with you 
1265_135636_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 With me ejaculated mister Pickwick rising nervously from his chair and reseating himself directly afterwards 
1265_135636_000046_000000	train-clean-360	The little man gave a double knock on the lid of his snuff box opened it took a great pinch shut it up again and repeated the words With you 
1265_135636_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 I say my dear Sir resumed the little man who seemed to gather confidence from the snuff I say that her speedy liberation or perpetual imprisonment rests with you and with you alone 
none	none	Hear me out my dear Sir if you please and do not be so very energetic for it will only put you into a perspiration and do no good whatever I say continued Perker checking off each position on a different finger as he laid it down I say that nobody but you can rescue her from this den of wretchedness and that you can only do that by paying the costs of this suit both of plaintive and defendant into the hands of these Freeman Court sharks Now pray be quiet my dear sir 
1265_135636_000048_000000	train-clean-360	mister Pickwick whose face had been undergoing most surprising changes during this speech and was evidently on the verge of a strong burst of indignation calmed his wrath as well as he could 
1265_135636_000048_000001	train-clean-360	Perker strengthening his argumentative powers with another pinch of snuff proceeded 
1265_135636_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 I have seen the woman this morning 
none	none	By paying the costs you can obtain a full release and discharge from the damages and further this I know is a far greater object of consideration with you my dear sir a voluntary statement under her hand in the form of a letter to me that this business was from the very first fomented and encouraged and brought about by these men Dodson and Fogg that she deeply regrets ever having been the instrument of annoyance or injury to you and that she entreats me to intercede with you and implore your pardon
1265_135636_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 If I pay her costs for her said mister Pickwick indignantly 
1265_135636_000050_000001	train-clean-360	 A valuable document indeed 
1265_135636_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 No if in the case my dear Sir said Perker triumphantly 
1265_135636_000051_000001	train-clean-360	 There is the very letter I speak of 
none	none	Brought to my office by another woman at nine o clock this morning before I had set foot in this place or held any communication with missus Bardell upon my honour Selecting the letter from the bundle the little lawyer laid it at mister Pickwick s elbow and took snuff for two consecutive minutes without winking
1265_135636_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 Is this all you have to say to me inquired mister Pickwick mildly 
1265_135636_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 Not quite replied Perker 
none	none	I cannot undertake to say at this moment whether the wording of the cognovit the nature of the ostensible consideration and the proof we can get together about the whole conduct of the suit will be sufficient to justify an indictment for conspiracy I fear not my dear Sir they are too clever for that I doubt 
1265_135636_000053_000002	train-clean-360	I do mean to say however that the whole facts taken together will be sufficient to justify you in the minds of all reasonable men 
1265_135636_000053_000003	train-clean-360	And now my dear Sir I put it to you 
1265_135636_000053_000004	train-clean-360	This one hundred and fifty pounds or whatever it may be take it in round numbers is nothing to you 
1265_135636_000053_000005	train-clean-360	A jury had decided against you well their verdict is wrong but still they decided as they thought right and it IS against you 
none	none	You have now an opportunity on easy terms of placing yourself in a much higher position than you ever could by remaining here which would only be imputed by people who didn t know you to sheer dogged wrongheaded brutal obstinacy nothing else my dear Sir believe me Can you hesitate to avail yourself of it when it restores you to your friends your old pursuits your health and amusements when it liberates your faithful and attached servant whom you otherwise doom to imprisonment for the whole of your life and above all when it enables you to take the very magnanimous revenge which I know my dear sir is one after your own heart of releasing this woman from a scene of misery and debauchery to which no man should ever be consigned if I had my will but the infliction of which on any woman is even more frightful and barbarous Now I ask you my dear sir not only as your legal adviser but as your very true friend will you let slip the occasion of attaining all these objects and doing all this good for the paltry consideration of a few pounds finding their way into the pockets of a couple of rascals to whom it makes no manner of difference except that the more they gain the more they ll seek and so the sooner be led into some piece of knavery that must end in a crash I have put these considerations to you my dear Sir very feebly and imperfectly but I ask you to think of them Turn them over in your mind as long as you please I wait here most patiently for your answer Before mister Pickwick could reply before mister Perker had taken one twentieth part of the snuff with which so unusually long an address imperatively required to be followed up there was a low murmuring of voices outside and then a hesitating knock at the door Dear dear exclaimed mister Pickwick who had been evidently roused by his friend s appeal what an annoyance that door is Who is that
1265_135636_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 Me Sir replied Sam Weller putting in his head 
1265_135636_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 I can t speak to you just now Sam said mister Pickwick I am engaged at this moment Sam 
none	none	Beg your pardon Sir rejoined mister Weller But here s a lady here Sir as says she s somethin wery partickler to disclose
1265_135636_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 I can t see any lady replied mister Pickwick whose mind was filled with visions of missus Bardell 
none	none	I wouldn t make too sure o that Sir urged mister Weller shaking his head If you know d who was near sir I rayther think you d change your note as the hawk remarked to himself vith a cheerful laugh ven he heerd the robin redbreast a singin round the corner
1265_135636_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 Who is it inquired mister Pickwick 
none	none	Will you see her Sir asked mister Weller holding the door in his hand as if he had some curious live animal on the other side
1265_135636_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 I suppose I must said mister Pickwick looking at Perker 
none	none	Well then all in to begin cried Sam Sound the gong draw up the curtain and enter the two conspiraytors 
1265_135636_000065_000000	train-clean-360	As Sam Weller spoke he threw the door open and there rushed tumultuously into the room mister Nathaniel Winkle leading after him by the hand the identical young lady who at Dingley Dell had worn the boots with the fur round the tops and who now a very pleasing compound of blushes and confusion and lilac silk and a smart bonnet and a rich lace veil looked prettier than ever 
1265_135636_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 Miss Arabella Allen exclaimed mister Pickwick rising from his chair 
none	none	No replied mister Winkle dropping on his knees missus Winkle Pardon my dear friend pardon mister Pickwick could scarcely believe the evidence of his senses and perhaps would not have done so but for the corroborative testimony afforded by the smiling countenance of Perker and the bodily presence in the background of Sam and the pretty housemaid who appeared to contemplate the proceedings with the liveliest satisfaction Oh mister Pickwick said Arabella in a low voice as if alarmed at the silence
1265_135636_000069_000001	train-clean-360	 Can you forgive my imprudence 
none	none	mister Pickwick returned no verbal response to this appeal but he took off his spectacles in great haste and seizing both the young lady s hands in his kissed her a great number of times perhaps a greater number than was absolutely necessary and then still retaining one of her hands told mister Winkle he was an audacious young dog and bade him get up This mister Winkle who had been for some seconds scratching his nose with the brim of his hat in a penitent manner did whereupon mister Pickwick slapped him on the back several times and then shook hands heartily with Perker who not to be behind hand in the compliments of the occasion saluted both the bride and the pretty housemaid with right good will and having wrung mister Winkle s hand most cordially wound up his demonstrations of joy by taking snuff enough to set any half dozen men with ordinarily constructed noses a sneezing for life
1265_135636_000070_000002	train-clean-360	 Why my dear girl said mister Pickwick how has all this come about 
none	none	Come 
1265_135636_000070_000004	train-clean-360	Sit down and let me hear it all 
1265_135636_000070_000005	train-clean-360	How well she looks doesn t she Perker added mister Pickwick surveying Arabella s face with a look of as much pride and exultation as if she had been his daughter 
1265_135636_000071_000000	train-clean-360	 Delightful my dear Sir replied the little man 
none	none	If I were not a married man myself I should be disposed to envy you you dog Thus expressing himself the little lawyer gave mister Winkle a poke in the chest which that gentleman reciprocated after which they both laughed very loudly but not so loudly as mister Samuel Weller who had just relieved his feelings by kissing the pretty housemaid under cover of the cupboard door I can never be grateful enough to you Sam I am sure said Arabella with the sweetest smile imaginable
1265_135636_000072_000001	train-clean-360	 I shall not forget your exertions in the garden at Clifton 
none	none	Don t say nothin wotever about it ma am replied Sam I only assisted natur ma am as the doctor said to the boy s mother after he d bled him to death
1265_135636_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 Mary my dear sit down said mister Pickwick cutting short these compliments 
none	none	Now then how long have you been married eh 
1265_135636_000075_000000	train-clean-360	Arabella looked bashfully at her lord and master who replied Only three days 
1265_135636_000076_000000	train-clean-360	 Only three days eh said mister Pickwick Why what have you been doing these three months 
1265_135636_000077_000000	train-clean-360	 Ah to be sure interposed Perker come account for this idleness You see mister Pickwick s only astonishment is that it wasn t all over months ago 
none	none	Why the fact is replied mister Winkle looking at his blushing young wife that I could not persuade Bella to run away for a long time 
1265_135636_000078_000001	train-clean-360	And when I had persuaded her it was a long time more before we could find an opportunity 
none	none	Mary had to give a month s warning too before she could leave her place next door and we couldn t possibly have done it without her assistance Upon my word exclaimed mister Pickwick who by this time had resumed his spectacles and was looking from Arabella to Winkle and from Winkle to Arabella with as much delight depicted in his countenance as warmheartedness and kindly feeling can communicate to the human face upon my word you seem to have been very systematic in your proceedings 
1265_135636_000078_000003	train-clean-360	And is your brother acquainted with all this my dear 
1265_135636_000079_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh no no replied Arabella changing colour 
1265_135636_000079_000001	train-clean-360	 Dear mister Pickwick he must only know it from you from your lips alone 
1265_135636_000079_000002	train-clean-360	He is so violent so prejudiced and has been so so anxious in behalf of his friend mister Sawyer added Arabella looking down that I fear the consequences dreadfully 
1265_135636_000080_000000	train-clean-360	 Ah to be sure said Perker gravely 
1265_135636_000080_000001	train-clean-360	 You must take this matter in hand for them my dear sir 
none	none	These young men will respect you when they would listen to nobody else 
1265_135636_000080_000003	train-clean-360	You must prevent mischief my dear Sir 
1265_135636_000080_000004	train-clean-360	Hot blood hot blood And the little man took a warning pinch and shook his head doubtfully 
1265_135636_000081_000000	train-clean-360	 You forget my love said mister Pickwick gently you forget that I am a prisoner 
1265_135636_000082_000000	train-clean-360	 No indeed I do not my dear Sir replied Arabella I never have forgotten it 
1265_135636_000082_000001	train-clean-360	I have never ceased to think how great your sufferings must have been in this shocking place 
none	none	But I hoped that what no consideration for yourself would induce you to do a regard to our happiness might 
1265_135636_000082_000003	train-clean-360	If my brother hears of this first from you I feel certain we shall be reconciled 
1265_135636_000082_000004	train-clean-360	He is my only relation in the world mister Pickwick and unless you plead for me I fear I have lost even him 
1265_135636_000082_000005	train-clean-360	I have done wrong very very wrong I know Here poor Arabella hid her face in her handkerchief and wept bitterly 
1265_135636_000083_000000	train-clean-360	mister Pickwick s nature was a good deal worked upon by these same tears but when missus Winkle drying her eyes took to coaxing and entreating in the sweetest tones of a very sweet voice he became particularly restless and evidently undecided how to act as was evinced by sundry nervous rubbings of his spectacle glasses nose tights head and gaiters 
none	none	Taking advantage of these symptoms of indecision mister Perker to whom it appeared the young couple had driven straight that morning urged with legal point and shrewdness that mister Winkle senior was still unacquainted with the important rise in life s flight of steps which his son had taken that the future expectations of the said son depended entirely upon the said Winkle senior continuing to regard him with undiminished feelings of affection and attachment which it was very unlikely he would if this great event were long kept a secret from him that mister Pickwick repairing to Bristol to seek mister Allen might with equal reason repair to Birmingham to seek mister Winkle senior lastly that mister Winkle senior had good right and title to consider mister Pickwick as in some degree the guardian and adviser of his son and that it consequently behoved that gentleman and was indeed due to his personal character to acquaint the aforesaid Winkle senior personally and by word of mouth with the whole circumstances of the case and with the share he had taken in the transaction 
1265_135636_000085_000000	train-clean-360	mister Tupman and mister Snodgrass arrived most opportunely in this stage of the pleadings and as it was necessary to explain to them all that had occurred together with the various reasons pro and con the whole of the arguments were gone over again after which everybody urged every argument in his own way and at his own length 
none	none	And at last mister Pickwick fairly argued and remonstrated out of all his resolutions and being in imminent danger of being argued and remonstrated out of his wits caught Arabella in his arms and declaring that she was a very amiable creature and that he didn t know how it was but he had always been very fond of her from the first said he could never find it in his heart to stand in the way of young people s happiness and they might do with him as they pleased mister Weller s first act on hearing this concession was to despatch Job Trotter to the illustrious mister Pell with an authority to deliver to the bearer the formal discharge which his prudent parent had had the foresight to leave in the hands of that learned gentleman in case it should be at any time required on an emergency his next proceeding was to invest his whole stock of ready money in the purchase of five and twenty gallons of mild porter which he himself dispensed on the racket ground to everybody who would partake of it this done he hurra d in divers parts of the building until he lost his voice and then quietly relapsed into his usual collected and philosophical condition 
1265_135636_000087_000000	train-clean-360	At three o clock that afternoon mister Pickwick took a last look at his little room and made his way as well as he could through the throng of debtors who pressed eagerly forward to shake him by the hand until he reached the lodge steps 
1265_135636_000087_000001	train-clean-360	He turned here to look about him and his eye lightened as he did so 
1265_135636_000087_000002	train-clean-360	In all the crowd of wan emaciated faces he saw not one which was not happier for his sympathy and charity 
none	none	Perker said mister Pickwick beckoning one young man towards him this is mister Jingle whom I spoke to you about
1265_135636_000089_000000	train-clean-360	 Very good my dear Sir replied Perker looking hard at Jingle You will see me again young man to morrow 
1265_135636_000089_000001	train-clean-360	I hope you may live to remember and feel deeply what I shall have to communicate Sir 
1265_135636_000090_000000	train-clean-360	Jingle bowed respectfully trembled very much as he took mister Pickwick s proffered hand and withdrew 
1265_135636_000091_000000	train-clean-360	 Job you know I think said mister Pickwick presenting that gentleman 
1265_135636_000092_000000	train-clean-360	 I know the rascal replied Perker good humouredly 
1265_135636_000092_000001	train-clean-360	 See after your friend and be in the way to morrow at one 
none	none	Do you hear Now is there anything more Nothing rejoined mister Pickwick
1265_135636_000093_000001	train-clean-360	 You have delivered the little parcel I gave you for your old landlord Sam 
1265_135636_000094_000000	train-clean-360	 I have Sir replied Sam 
none	none	He bust out a cryin Sir and said you wos wery general rous and thoughtful and he only wished you could have him innockilated for a gallopin consumption for his old friend as had lived here so long wos dead and he d noweres to look for another Poor fellow poor fellow said mister Pickwick God bless you my friends 
1265_135636_000095_000000	train-clean-360	As mister Pickwick uttered this adieu the crowd raised a loud shout 
1265_135636_000095_000001	train-clean-360	Many among them were pressing forward to shake him by the hand again when he drew his arm through Perker s and hurried from the prison far more sad and melancholy for the moment than when he had first entered it 
none	none	Alas how many sad and unhappy beings had he left behind A happy evening was that for at least one party in the George and Vulture and light and cheerful were two of the hearts that emerged from its hospitable door next morning The owners thereof were mister Pickwick and Sam Weller the former of whom was speedily deposited inside a comfortable post coach with a little dickey behind in which the latter mounted with great agility
1265_135636_000097_000000	train-clean-360	 Sir called out mister Weller to his master 
none	none	Well Sam replied mister Pickwick thrusting his head out of the window I wish them horses had been three months and better in the Fleet Sir Why Sam inquired mister Pickwick Wy Sir exclaimed mister Weller rubbing his hands how they would go if they had been CHAPTER XLVIII RELATES HOW mister PICKWICK WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF SAMUEL WELLER ESSAYED TO SOFTEN THE HEART OF mister BENJAMIN ALLEN AND TO MOLLIFY THE WRATH OF mister ROBERT SAWYER mister Ben Allen and mister Bob Sawyer sat together in the little surgery behind the shop discussing minced veal and future prospects when the discourse not unnaturally turned upon the practice acquired by Bob the aforesaid and his present chances of deriving a competent independence from the honourable profession to which he had devoted himself Which I think observed mister Bob Sawyer pursuing the thread of the subject which I think Ben are rather dubious What s rather dubious inquired mister Ben Allen at the same time sharpening his intellect with a draught of beer What s dubious Why the chances responded mister Bob Sawyer I forgot said mister Ben Allen The beer has reminded me that I forgot Bob yes they ARE dubious It s wonderful how the poor people patronise me said mister Bob Sawyer reflectively They knock me up at all hours of the night they take medicine to an extent which I should have conceived impossible they put on blisters and leeches with a perseverance worthy of a better cause they make additions to their families in a manner which is quite awful Six of those last named little promissory notes all due on the same day Ben and all intrusted to me It s very gratifying isn t it said mister Ben Allen holding his plate for some more minced veal Oh very replied Bob only not quite so much so as the confidence of patients with a shilling or two to spare would be This business was capitally described in the advertisement Ben It is a practice a very extensive practice and that s all Bob said mister Ben Allen laying down his knife and fork and fixing his eyes on the visage of his friend Bob I ll tell you what it is What is it inquired mister Bob Sawyer You must make yourself with as little delay as possible master of Arabella s one thousand pounds Three per cent consolidated bank annuities now standing in her name in the book or books of the governor and company of the Bank of England added Bob Sawyer in legal phraseology Exactly so said Ben She has it when she comes of age or marries She wants a year of coming of age and if you plucked up a spirit she needn t want a month of being married She s a very charming and delightful creature quoth mister Robert Sawyer in reply and has only one fault that I know of Ben It happens unfortunately that that single blemish is a want of taste She don t like me It s my opinion that she don t know what she does like said mister Ben Allen contemptuously Perhaps not remarked mister Bob Sawyer But it s my opinion that she does know what she doesn t like and that s of more importance I wish said mister Ben Allen setting his teeth together and speaking more like a savage warrior who fed on raw wolf s flesh which he carved with his fingers than a peaceable young gentleman who ate minced veal with a knife and fork I wish I knew whether any rascal really has been tampering with her and attempting to engage her affections I think I should assassinate him Bob I d put a bullet in him if I found him out said mister Sawyer stopping in the course of a long draught of beer and looking malignantly out of the porter pot If that didn t do his business I d extract it afterwards and kill him that way mister Benjamin Allen gazed abstractedly on his friend for some minutes in silence and then said You have never proposed to her point blank Bob No Because I saw it would be of no use replied mister Robert Sawyer You shall do it before you are twenty four hours older retorted Ben with desperate calmness She shall have you or I ll know the reason why I ll exert my authority Well said mister Bob Sawyer we shall see We shall see my friend replied mister Ben Allen fiercely He paused for a few seconds and added in a voice broken by emotion You have loved her from a child my friend You loved her when we were boys at school together and even then she was wayward and slighted your young feelings Do you recollect with all the eagerness of a child s love one day pressing upon her acceptance two small caraway seed biscuits and one sweet apple neatly folded into a circular parcel with the leaf of a copy book I do replied Bob Sawyer She slighted that I think said Ben Allen She did rejoined Bob She said I had kept the parcel so long in the pockets of my corduroys that the apple was unpleasantly warm I remember said mister Allen gloomily Upon which we ate it ourselves in alternate bites Bob Sawyer intimated his recollection of the circumstance last alluded to by a melancholy frown and the two friends remained for some time absorbed each in his own meditations While these observations were being exchanged between mister Bob Sawyer and mister Benjamin Allen and while the boy in the gray livery marvelling at the unwonted prolongation of the dinner cast an anxious look from time to time towards the glass door distracted by inward misgivings regarding the amount of minced veal which would be ultimately reserved for his individual cravings there rolled soberly on through the streets of Bristol a private fly painted of a sad green colour drawn by a chubby sort of brown horse and driven by a surly looking man with his legs dressed like the legs of a groom and his body attired in the coat of a coachman Such appearances are common to many vehicles belonging to and maintained by old ladies of economic habits and in this vehicle sat an old lady who was its mistress and proprietor Martin said the old lady calling to the surly man out of the front window Well said the surly man touching his hat to the old lady mister Sawyer s said the old lady I was going there said the surly man The old lady nodded the satisfaction which this proof of the surly man s foresight imparted to her feelings and the surly man giving a smart lash to the chubby horse they all repaired to mister Bob Sawyer s together Martin said the old lady when the fly stopped at the door of mister Robert Sawyer late Nockemorf Well said Martin Ask the lad to step out and mind the horse I m going to mind the horse myself said Martin laying his whip on the roof of the fly I can t permit it on any account said the old lady your testimony will be very important and I must take you into the house with me You must not stir from my side during the whole interview Do you hear I hear replied Martin Well what are you stopping for Nothing replied Martin So saying the surly man leisurely descended from the wheel on which he had been poising himself on the tops of the toes of his right foot and having summoned the boy in the gray livery opened the coach door flung down the steps and thrusting in a hand enveloped in a dark wash leather glove pulled out the old lady with as much unconcern in his manner as if she were a bandbox Dear me exclaimed the old lady I am so flurried now I have got here Martin that I m all in a tremble mister Martin coughed behind the dark wash leather gloves but expressed no sympathy so the old lady composing herself trotted up mister Bob Sawyer s steps and mister Martin followed Immediately on the old lady s entering the shop mister Benjamin Allen and mister Bob Sawyer who had been putting the spirits and water out of sight and upsetting nauseous drugs to take off the smell of the tobacco smoke issued hastily forth in a transport of pleasure and affection My dear aunt exclaimed mister Ben Allen how kind of you to look in upon us mister Sawyer aunt my friend mister Bob Sawyer whom I have spoken to you about regarding you know aunt And here mister Ben Allen who was not at the moment extraordinarily sober added the word Arabella in what was meant to be a whisper but which was an especially audible and distinct tone of speech which nobody could avoid hearing if anybody were so disposed My dear Benjamin said the old lady struggling with a great shortness of breath and trembling from head to foot don t be alarmed my dear but I think I had better speak to mister Sawyer alone for a moment Only for one moment Bob said mister Allen will you take my aunt into the surgery Certainly responded Bob in a most professional voice Step this way my dear ma am Don t be frightened ma am We shall be able to set you to rights in a very short time I have no doubt ma am Here my dear ma am Now then With this mister Bob Sawyer having handed the old lady to a chair shut the door drew another chair close to her and waited to hear detailed the symptoms of some disorder from which he saw in perspective a long train of profits and advantages The first thing the old lady did was to shake her head a great many times and began to cry Nervous said Bob Sawyer complacently Camphor julep and water three times a day and composing draught at night I don t know how to begin mister Sawyer said the old lady It is so very painful and distressing You need not begin ma am rejoined mister Bob Sawyer I can anticipate all you would say The head is in fault I should be very sorry to think it was the heart said the old lady with a slight groan Not the slightest danger of that ma am replied Bob Sawyer The stomach is the primary cause mister Sawyer exclaimed the old lady starting Not the least doubt of it ma am rejoined Bob looking wondrous wise Medicine in time my dear ma am would have prevented it all mister Sawyer said the old lady more flurried than before this conduct is either great impertinence to one in my situation Sir or it arises from your not understanding the object of my visit If it had been in the power of medicine or any foresight I could have used to prevent what has occurred I should certainly have done so I had better see my nephew at once said the old lady twirling her reticule indignantly and rising as she spoke Stop a moment ma am said Bob Sawyer I m afraid I have not understood you What IS the matter ma am My niece mister Sawyer said the old lady your friend s sister Yes ma am said Bob all impatience for the old lady although much agitated spoke with the most tantalising deliberation as old ladies often do Yes ma am Left my home mister Sawyer three days ago on a pretended visit to my sister another aunt of hers who keeps the large boarding school just beyond the third mile stone where there is a very large laburnum tree and an oak gate said the old lady stopping in this place to dry her eyes Oh devil take the laburnum tree ma am said Bob quite forgetting his professional dignity in his anxiety Get on a little faster put a little more steam on ma am pray This morning said the old lady slowly this morning she She came back ma am I suppose said Bob with great animation Did she come back No she did not she wrote replied the old lady What did she say inquired Bob eagerly She said mister Sawyer replied the old lady and it is this I want to prepare Benjamin s mind for gently and by degrees she said that she was I have got the letter in my pocket mister Sawyer but my glasses are in the carriage and I should only waste your time if I attempted to point out the passage to you without them she said in short mister Sawyer that she was married What said or rather shouted mister Bob Sawyer Married repeated the old lady mister Bob Sawyer stopped to hear no more but darting from the surgery into the outer shop cried in a stentorian voice Ben my boy she s bolted mister Ben Allen who had been slumbering behind the counter with his head half a foot or so below his knees no sooner heard this appalling communication than he made a precipitate rush at mister Martin and twisting his hand in the neck cloth of that taciturn servitor expressed an obliging intention of choking him where he stood This intention with a promptitude often the effect of desperation he at once commenced carrying into execution with much vigour and surgical skill mister Martin who was a man of few words and possessed but little power of eloquence or persuasion submitted to this operation with a very calm and agreeable expression of countenance for some seconds finding however that it threatened speedily to lead to a result which would place it beyond his power to claim any wages board or otherwise in all time to come he muttered an inarticulate remonstrance and felled mister Benjamin Allen to the ground As that gentleman had his hands entangled in his cravat he had no alternative but to follow him to the floor There they both lay struggling when the shop door opened and the party was increased by the arrival of two most unexpected visitors to wit mister Pickwick and mister Samuel Weller The impression at once produced on mister Weller s mind by what he saw was that mister Martin was hired by the establishment of Sawyer late Nockemorf to take strong medicine or to go into fits and be experimentalised upon or to swallow poison now and then with the view of testing the efficacy of some new antidotes or to do something or other to promote the great science of medicine and gratify the ardent spirit of inquiry burning in the bosoms of its two young professors So without presuming to interfere Sam stood perfectly still and looked on as if he were mightily interested in the result of the then pending experiment Not so mister Pickwick He at once threw himself on the astonished combatants with his accustomed energy and loudly called upon the bystanders to interpose This roused mister Bob Sawyer who had been hitherto quite paralysed by the frenzy of his companion With that gentleman s assistance mister Pickwick raised Ben Allen to his feet mister Martin finding himself alone on the floor got up and looked about him mister Allen said mister Pickwick what is the matter Sir Never mind Sir replied mister Allen with haughty defiance What is it inquired mister Pickwick looking at Bob Sawyer Is he unwell Before Bob could reply mister Ben Allen seized mister Pickwick by the hand and murmured in sorrowful accents My sister my dear Sir my sister Oh is that all said mister Pickwick We shall easily arrange that matter I hope Your sister is safe and well and I am here my dear Sir to Sorry to do anythin as may cause an interruption to such wery pleasant proceedin s as the king said wen he dissolved the parliament interposed mister Weller who had been peeping through the glass door but there s another experiment here sir Here s a wenerable old lady a lyin on the carpet waitin for dissection or galwinism or some other rewivin and scientific inwention I forgot exclaimed mister Ben Allen It is my aunt Dear me said mister Pickwick Poor lady Gently Sam gently Strange sitivation for one o the family observed Sam Weller hoisting the aunt into a chair Now depitty sawbones bring out the wollatilly The latter observation was addressed to the boy in gray who having handed over the fly to the care of the street keeper had come back to see what all the noise was about Between the boy in gray and mister Bob Sawyer and mister Benjamin Allen who having frightened his aunt into a fainting fit was affectionately solicitous for her recovery the old lady was at length restored to consciousness then mister Ben Allen turning with a puzzled countenance to mister Pickwick asked him what he was about to say when he had been so alarmingly interrupted We are all friends here I presume said mister Pickwick clearing his voice and looking towards the man of few words with the surly countenance who drove the fly with the chubby horse This reminded mister Bob Sawyer that the boy in gray was looking on with eyes wide open and greedy ears The incipient chemist having been lifted up by his coat collar and dropped outside the door Bob Sawyer assured mister Pickwick that he might speak without reserve Your sister my dear Sir said mister Pickwick turning to Benjamin Allen is in London well and happy Her happiness is no object to me sir said Benjamin Allen with a flourish of the hand Her husband IS an object to ME Sir said Bob Sawyer He shall be an object to me sir at twelve paces and a pretty object I ll make of him sir a mean spirited scoundrel This as it stood was a very pretty denunciation and magnanimous withal but mister Bob Sawyer rather weakened its effect by winding up with some general observations concerning the punching of heads and knocking out of eyes which were commonplace by comparison Stay sir said mister Pickwick before you apply those epithets to the gentleman in question consider dispassionately the extent of his fault and above all remember that he is a friend of mine What said mister Bob Sawyer His name cried Ben Allen His name mister Nathaniel Winkle said mister Pickwick mister Benjamin Allen deliberately crushed his spectacles beneath the heel of his boot and having picked up the pieces and put them into three separate pockets folded his arms bit his lips and looked in a threatening manner at the bland features of mister Pickwick Then it s you is it Sir who have encouraged and brought about this match inquired mister Benjamin Allen at length And it s this gentleman s servant I suppose interrupted the old lady who has been skulking about my house and endeavouring to entrap my servants to conspire against their mistress Martin Well said the surly man coming forward Is that the young man you saw in the lane whom you told me about this morning mister Martin who as it has already appeared was a man of few words looked at Sam Weller nodded his head and growled forth That s the man mister Weller who was never proud gave a smile of friendly recognition as his eyes encountered those of the surly groom and admitted in courteous terms that he had knowed him afore And this is the faithful creature exclaimed mister Ben Allen whom I had nearly suffocated mister Pickwick how dare you allow your fellow to be employed in the abduction of my sister I demand that you explain this matter sir Explain it sir cried Bob Sawyer fiercely It s a conspiracy said Ben Allen A regular plant added mister Bob Sawyer A disgraceful imposition observed the old lady Nothing but a do remarked Martin Pray hear me urged mister Pickwick as mister Ben Allen fell into a chair that patients were bled in and gave way to his pocket handkerchief I have rendered no assistance in this matter beyond being present at one interview between the young people which I could not prevent and from which I conceived my presence would remove any slight colouring of impropriety that it might otherwise have had this is the whole share I have had in the transaction and I had no suspicion that an immediate marriage was even contemplated Though mind added mister Pickwick hastily checking himself mind I do not say I should have prevented it if I had known that it was intended You hear that all of you you hear that said mister Benjamin Allen I hope they do mildly observed mister Pickwick looking round and added that gentleman his colour mounting as he spoke I hope they hear this Sir also That from what has been stated to me sir I assert that you were by no means justified in attempting to force your sister s inclinations as you did and that you should rather have endeavoured by your kindness and forbearance to have supplied the place of other nearer relations whom she had never known from a child As regards my young friend I must beg to add that in every point of worldly advantage he is at least on an equal footing with yourself if not on a much better one and that unless I hear this question discussed with becoming temper and moderation I decline hearing any more said upon the subject I wish to make a wery few remarks in addition to wot has been put for ard by the honourable general l m n as has jist give over said mister Weller stepping forth wich is this here a indiwidual in company has called me a feller That has nothing whatever to do with the matter Sam interposed mister Pickwick Pray hold your tongue I ain t a goin to say nothin on that ere pint sir replied Sam but merely this here P raps that general l m n may think as there wos a priory tachment but there worn t nothin o the sort for the young lady said in the wery beginnin o the keepin company that she couldn t abide him Nobody s cut him out and it ud ha been jist the wery same for him if the young lady had never seen mister Vinkle That s what I wished to say sir and I hope I ve now made that ere general l m n s mind easy A short pause followed these consolatory remarks of mister Weller Then mister Ben Allen rising from his chair protested that he would never see Arabella s face again while mister Bob Sawyer despite Sam s flattering assurance vowed dreadful vengeance on the happy bridegroom But just when matters were at their height and threatening to remain so mister Pickwick found a powerful assistant in the old lady who evidently much struck by the mode in which he had advocated her niece s cause ventured to approach mister Benjamin Allen with a few comforting reflections of which the chief were that after all perhaps it was well it was no worse the least said the soonest mended and upon her word she did not know that it was so very bad after all what was over couldn t be begun and what couldn t be cured must be endured with various other assurances of the like novel and strengthening description To all of these mister Benjamin Allen replied that he meant no disrespect to his aunt or anybody there but if it were all the same to them and they would allow him to have his own way he would rather have the pleasure of hating his sister till death and after it At length when this determination had been announced half a hundred times the old lady suddenly bridling up and looking very majestic wished to know what she had done that no respect was to be paid to her years or station and that she should be obliged to beg and pray in that way of her own nephew whom she remembered about five and twenty years before he was born and whom she had known personally when he hadn t a tooth in his head to say nothing of her presence on the first occasion of his having his hair cut and assistance at numerous other times and ceremonies during his babyhood of sufficient importance to found a claim upon his affection obedience and sympathies for ever While the good lady was bestowing this objurgation on mister Ben Allen Bob Sawyer and mister Pickwick had retired in close conversation to the inner room where mister Sawyer was observed to apply himself several times to the mouth of a black bottle under the influence of which his features gradually assumed a cheerful and even jovial expression And at last he emerged from the room bottle in hand and remarking that he was very sorry to say he had been making a fool of himself begged to propose the health and happiness of mister and missus Winkle whose felicity so far from envying he would be the first to congratulate them upon Hearing this mister Ben Allen suddenly arose from his chair and seizing the black bottle drank the toast so heartily that the liquor being strong he became nearly as black in the face as the bottle Finally the black bottle went round till it was empty and there was so much shaking of hands and interchanging of compliments that even the metal visaged mister Martin condescended to smile And now said Bob Sawyer rubbing his hands we ll have a jolly night I am sorry said mister Pickwick that I must return to my inn I have not been accustomed to fatigue lately and my journey has tired me exceedingly You ll take some tea mister Pickwick said the old lady with irresistible sweetness Thank you I would rather not replied that gentleman The truth is that the old lady s evidently increasing admiration was mister Pickwick s principal inducement for going away He thought of missus Bardell and every glance of the old lady s eyes threw him into a cold perspiration As mister Pickwick could by no means be prevailed upon to stay it was arranged at once on his own proposition that mister Benjamin Allen should accompany him on his journey to the elder mister Winkle s and that the coach should be at the door at nine o clock next morning He then took his leave and followed by Samuel Weller repaired to the Bush It is worthy of remark that mister Martin s face was horribly convulsed as he shook hands with Sam at parting and that he gave vent to a smile and an oath simultaneously from which tokens it has been inferred by those who were best acquainted with that gentleman s peculiarities that he expressed himself much pleased with mister Weller s society and requested the honour of his further acquaintance Shall I order a private room Sir inquired Sam when they reached the Bush Why no Sam replied mister Pickwick as I dined in the coffee room and shall go to bed soon it is hardly worth while See who there is in the travellers room Sam mister Weller departed on his errand and presently returned to say that there was only a gentleman with one eye and that he and the landlord were drinking a bowl of bishop together I will join them said mister Pickwick He s a queer customer the vun eyed vun sir observed mister Weller as he led the way He s a gammonin that ere landlord he is sir till he don t rightly know wether he s a standing on the soles of his boots or the crown of his hat The individual to whom this observation referred was sitting at the upper end of the room when mister Pickwick entered and was smoking a large Dutch pipe with his eye intently fixed on the round face of the landlord a jolly looking old personage to whom he had recently been relating some tale of wonder as was testified by sundry disjointed exclamations of Well I wouldn t have believed it The strangest thing I ever heard Couldn t have supposed it possible and other expressions of astonishment which burst spontaneously from his lips as he returned the fixed gaze of the one eyed man Servant sir said the one eyed man to mister Pickwick Fine night sir Very much so indeed replied mister Pickwick as the waiter placed a small decanter of brandy and some hot water before him While mister Pickwick was mixing his brandy and water the one eyed man looked round at him earnestly from time to time and at length said I think I ve seen you before I don t recollect you rejoined mister Pickwick I dare say not said the one eyed man You didn t know me but I knew two friends of yours that were stopping at the Peacock at Eatanswill at the time of the election Oh indeed exclaimed mister Pickwick Yes rejoined the one eyed man I mentioned a little circumstance to them about a friend of mine of the name of Tom Smart Perhaps you ve heard them speak of it Often rejoined mister Pickwick smiling He was your uncle I think No no only a friend of my uncle s replied the one eyed man He was a wonderful man that uncle of yours though remarked the landlord shaking his head Well I think he was I think I may say he was answered the one eyed man I could tell you a story about that same uncle gentlemen that would rather surprise you Could you said mister Pickwick Let us hear it by all means The one eyed bagman ladled out a glass of negus from the bowl and drank it smoked a long whiff out of the Dutch pipe and then calling to Sam Weller who was lingering near the door that he needn t go away unless he wanted to because the story was no secret fixed his eye upon the landlord s and proceeded in the words of the next chapter CHAPTER XLIX CONTAINING THE STORY OF THE BAGMAN S UNCLE My uncle gentlemen said the bagman was one of the merriest pleasantest cleverest fellows that ever lived I wish you had known him gentlemen On second thoughts gentlemen I don t wish you had known him for if you had you would have been all by this time in the ordinary course of nature if not dead at all events so near it as to have taken to stopping at home and giving up company which would have deprived me of the inestimable pleasure of addressing you at this moment Gentlemen I wish your fathers and mothers had known my uncle They would have been amazingly fond of him especially your respectable mothers I know they would If any two of his numerous virtues predominated over the many that adorned his character I should say they were his mixed punch and his after supper song Excuse my dwelling on these melancholy recollections of departed worth you won t see a man like my uncle every day in the week I have always considered it a great point in my uncle s character gentlemen that he was the intimate friend and companion of Tom Smart of the great house of Bilson and Slum Cateaton Street City My uncle collected for Tiggin and Welps but for a long time he went pretty near the same journey as Tom and the very first night they met my uncle took a fancy for Tom and Tom took a fancy for my uncle They made a bet of a new hat before they had known each other half an hour who should brew the best quart of punch and drink it the quickest My uncle was judged to have won the making but Tom Smart beat him in the drinking by about half a salt spoonful They took another quart apiece to drink each other s health in and were staunch friends ever afterwards There s a destiny in these things gentlemen we can t help it In personal appearance my uncle was a trifle shorter than the middle size he was a thought stouter too than the ordinary run of people and perhaps his face might be a shade redder He had the jolliest face you ever saw gentleman something like Punch with a handsome nose and chin his eyes were always twinkling and sparkling with good humour and a smile not one of your unmeaning wooden grins but a real merry hearty good tempered smile was perpetually on his countenance He was pitched out of his gig once and knocked head first against a milestone There he lay stunned and so cut about the face with some gravel which had been heaped up alongside it that to use my uncle s own strong expression if his mother could have revisited the earth she wouldn t have known him Indeed when I come to think of the matter gentlemen I feel pretty sure she wouldn t for she died when my uncle was two years and seven months old and I think it s very likely that even without the gravel his top boots would have puzzled the good lady not a little to say nothing of his jolly red face However there he lay and I have heard my uncle say many a time that the man said who picked him up that he was smiling as merrily as if he had tumbled out for a treat and that after they had bled him the first faint glimmerings of returning animation were his jumping up in bed bursting out into a loud laugh kissing the young woman who held the basin and demanding a mutton chop and a pickled walnut He was very fond of pickled walnuts gentlemen He said he always found that taken without vinegar they relished the beer My uncle s great journey was in the fall of the leaf at which time he collected debts and took orders in the north going from London to Edinburgh from Edinburgh to Glasgow from Glasgow back to Edinburgh and thence to London by the smack You are to understand that his second visit to Edinburgh was for his own pleasure He used to go back for a week just to look up his old friends and what with breakfasting with this one lunching with that dining with the third and supping with another a pretty tight week he used to make of it I don t know whether any of you gentlemen ever partook of a real substantial hospitable Scotch breakfast and then went out to a slight lunch of a bushel of oysters a dozen or so of bottled ale and a noggin or two of whiskey to close up with If you ever did you will agree with me that it requires a pretty strong head to go out to dinner and supper afterwards But bless your hearts and eyebrows all this sort of thing was nothing to my uncle He was so well seasoned that it was mere child s play I have heard him say that he could see the Dundee people out any day and walk home afterwards without staggering and yet the Dundee people have as strong heads and as strong punch gentlemen as you are likely to meet with between the poles I have heard of a Glasgow man and a Dundee man drinking against each other for fifteen hours at a sitting They were both suffocated as nearly as could be ascertained at the same moment but with this trifling exception gentlemen they were not a bit the worse for it One night within four and twenty hours of the time when he had settled to take shipping for London my uncle supped at the house of a very old friend of his a Bailie Mac something and four syllables after it who lived in the old town of Edinburgh There were the bailie s wife and the bailie s three daughters and the bailie s grown up son and three or four stout bushy eye browed canny old Scotch fellows that the bailie had got together to do honour to my uncle and help to make merry It was a glorious supper There was kippered salmon and Finnan haddocks and a lamb s head and a haggis a celebrated Scotch dish gentlemen which my uncle used to say always looked to him when it came to table very much like a Cupid s stomach and a great many other things besides that I forget the names of but very good things notwithstanding The lassies were pretty and agreeable the bailie s wife was one of the best creatures that ever lived and my uncle was in thoroughly good cue The consequence of which was that the young ladies tittered and giggled and the old lady laughed out loud and the bailie and the other old fellows roared till they were red in the face the whole mortal time I don t quite recollect how many tumblers of whiskey toddy each man drank after supper but this I know that about one o clock in the morning the bailie s grown up son became insensible while attempting the first verse of Willie brewed a peck o maut and he having been for half an hour before the only other man visible above the mahogany it occurred to my uncle that it was almost time to think about going especially as drinking had set in at seven o clock in order that he might get home at a decent hour But thinking it might not be quite polite to go just then my uncle voted himself into the chair mixed another glass rose to propose his own health addressed himself in a neat and complimentary speech and drank the toast with great enthusiasm Still nobody woke so my uncle took a little drop more neat this time to prevent the toddy from disagreeing with him and laying violent hands on his hat sallied forth into the street It was a wild gusty night when my uncle closed the bailie s door and settling his hat firmly on his head to prevent the wind from taking it thrust his hands into his pockets and looking upward took a short survey of the state of the weather The clouds were drifting over the moon at their giddiest speed at one time wholly obscuring her at another suffering her to burst forth in full splendour and shed her light on all the objects around anon driving over her again with increased velocity and shrouding everything in darkness Really this won t do said my uncle addressing himself to the weather as if he felt himself personally offended This is not at all the kind of thing for my voyage It will not do at any price said my uncle very impressively Having repeated this several times he recovered his balance with some difficulty for he was rather giddy with looking up into the sky so long and walked merrily on The bailie s house was in the Canongate and my uncle was going to the other end of Leith Walk rather better than a mile s journey On either side of him there shot up against the dark sky tall gaunt straggling houses with time stained fronts and windows that seemed to have shared the lot of eyes in mortals and to have grown dim and sunken with age Six seven eight Storey high were the houses storey piled upon storey as children build with cards throwing their dark shadows over the roughly paved road and making the dark night darker A few oil lamps were scattered at long distances but they only served to mark the dirty entrance to some narrow close or to show where a common stair communicated by steep and intricate windings with the various flats above Glancing at all these things with the air of a man who had seen them too often before to think them worthy of much notice now my uncle walked up the middle of the street with a thumb in each waistcoat pocket indulging from time to time in various snatches of song chanted forth with such good will and spirit that the quiet honest folk started from their first sleep and lay trembling in bed till the sound died away in the distance when satisfying themselves that it was only some drunken ne er do weel finding his way home they covered themselves up warm and fell asleep again I am particular in describing how my uncle walked up the middle of the street with his thumbs in his waistcoat pockets gentlemen because as he often used to say and with great reason too there is nothing at all extraordinary in this story unless you distinctly understand at the beginning that he was not by any means of a marvellous or romantic turn Gentlemen my uncle walked on with his thumbs in his waistcoat pockets taking the middle of the street to himself and singing now a verse of a love song and then a verse of a drinking one and when he was tired of both whistling melodiously until he reached the North Bridge which at this point connects the old and new towns of Edinburgh Here he stopped for a minute to look at the strange irregular clusters of lights piled one above the other and twinkling afar off so high that they looked like stars gleaming from the castle walls on the one side and the Calton Hill on the other as if they illuminated veritable castles in the air while the old picturesque town slept heavily on in gloom and darkness below its palace and chapel of Holyrood guarded day and night as a friend of my uncle s used to say by old Arthur s Seat towering surly and dark like some gruff genius over the ancient city he has watched so long I say gentlemen my uncle stopped here for a minute to look about him and then paying a compliment to the weather which had a little cleared up though the moon was sinking walked on again as royally as before keeping the middle of the road with great dignity and looking as if he would very much like to meet with somebody who would dispute possession of it with him There was nobody at all disposed to contest the point as it happened and so on he went with his thumbs in his waistcoat pockets like a lamb When my uncle reached the end of Leith Walk he had to cross a pretty large piece of waste ground which separated him from a short street which he had to turn down to go direct to his lodging Now in this piece of waste ground there was at that time an enclosure belonging to some wheelwright who contracted with the Post Office for the purchase of old worn out mail coaches and my uncle being very fond of coaches old young or middle aged all at once took it into his head to step out of his road for no other purpose than to peep between the palings at these mails about a dozen of which he remembered to have seen crowded together in a very forlorn and dismantled state inside My uncle was a very enthusiastic emphatic sort of person gentlemen so finding that he could not obtain a good peep between the palings he got over them and sitting himself quietly down on an old axle tree began to contemplate the mail coaches with a deal of gravity There might be a dozen of them or there might be more my uncle was never quite certain on this point and being a man of very scrupulous veracity about numbers didn t like to say but there they stood all huddled together in the most desolate condition imaginable The doors had been torn from their hinges and removed the linings had been stripped off only a shred hanging here and there by a rusty nail the lamps were gone the poles had long since vanished the ironwork was rusty the paint was worn away the wind whistled through the chinks in the bare woodwork and the rain which had collected on the roofs fell drop by drop into the insides with a hollow and melancholy sound They were the decaying skeletons of departed mails and in that lonely place at that time of night they looked chill and dismal My uncle rested his head upon his hands and thought of the busy bustling people who had rattled about years before in the old coaches and were now as silent and changed he thought of the numbers of people to whom one of these crazy mouldering vehicles had borne night after night for many years and through all weathers the anxiously expected intelligence the eagerly looked for remittance the promised assurance of health and safety the sudden announcement of sickness and death The merchant the lover the wife the widow the mother the school boy the very child who tottered to the door at the postman s knock how had they all looked forward to the arrival of the old coach And where were they all now Gentlemen my uncle used to SAY that he thought all this at the time but I rather suspect he learned it out of some book afterwards for he distinctly stated that he fell into a kind of doze as he sat on the old axle tree looking at the decayed mail coaches and that he was suddenly awakened by some deep church bell striking two Now my uncle was never a fast thinker and if he had thought all these things I am quite certain it would have taken him till full half past two o clock at the very least I am therefore decidedly of opinion gentlemen that my uncle fell into a kind of doze without having thought about anything at all Be this as it may a church bell struck two My uncle woke rubbed his eyes and jumped up in astonishment In one instant after the clock struck two the whole of this deserted and quiet spot had become a scene of most extraordinary life and animation The mail coach doors were on their hinges the lining was replaced the ironwork was as good as new the paint was restored the lamps were alight cushions and greatcoats were on every coach box porters were thrusting parcels into every boot guards were stowing away letter bags hostlers were dashing pails of water against the renovated wheels numbers of men were pushing about fixing poles into every coach passengers arrived portmanteaus were handed up horses were put to in short it was perfectly clear that every mail there was to be off directly Gentlemen my uncle opened his eyes so wide at all this that to the very last moment of his life he used to wonder how it fell out that he had ever been able to shut em again Now then said a voice as my uncle felt a hand on his shoulder you re booked for one inside You d better get in I booked said my uncle turning round Yes certainly My uncle gentlemen could say nothing he was so very much astonished The queerest thing of all was that although there was such a crowd of persons and although fresh faces were pouring in every moment there was no telling where they came from They seemed to start up in some strange manner from the ground or the air and disappear in the same way When a porter had put his luggage in the coach and received his fare he turned round and was gone and before my uncle had well begun to wonder what had become of him half a dozen fresh ones started up and staggered along under the weight of parcels which seemed big enough to crush them The passengers were all dressed so oddly too Large broad skirted laced coats with great cuffs and no collars and wigs gentlemen great formal wigs with a tie behind My uncle could make nothing of it Now are you going to get in said the person who had addressed my uncle before He was dressed as a mail guard with a wig on his head and most enormous cuffs to his coat and had a lantern in one hand and a huge blunderbuss in the other which he was going to stow away in his little arm chest ARE you going to get in Jack Martin said the guard holding the lantern to my uncle s face Hollo said my uncle falling back a step or two That s familiar It s so on the way bill said the guard Isn t there a Mister before it said my uncle For he felt gentlemen that for a guard he didn t know to call him Jack Martin was a liberty which the Post Office wouldn t have sanctioned if they had known it No there is not rejoined the guard coolly Is the fare paid inquired my uncle Of course it is rejoined the guard It is is it said my uncle Then here goes Which coach This said the guard pointing to an old fashioned Edinburgh and London mail which had the steps down and the door open Stop Here are the other passengers Let them get in first As the guard spoke there all at once appeared right in front of my uncle a young gentleman in a powdered wig and a sky blue coat trimmed with silver made very full and broad in the skirts which were lined with buckram Tiggin and Welps were in the printed calico and waistcoat piece line gentlemen so my uncle knew all the materials at once He wore knee breeches and a kind of leggings rolled up over his silk stockings and shoes with buckles he had ruffles at his wrists a three cornered hat on his head and a long taper sword by his side The flaps of his waist coat came half way down his thighs and the ends of his cravat reached to his waist He stalked gravely to the coach door pulled off his hat and held it above his head at arm s length cocking his little finger in the air at the same time as some affected people do when they take a cup of tea Then he drew his feet together and made a low grave bow and then put out his left hand My uncle was just going to step forward and shake it heartily when he perceived that these attentions were directed not towards him but to a young lady who just then appeared at the foot of the steps attired in an old fashioned green velvet dress with a long waist and stomacher She had no bonnet on her head gentlemen which was muffled in a black silk hood but she looked round for an instant as she prepared to get into the coach and such a beautiful face as she disclosed my uncle had never seen not even in a picture She got into the coach holding up her dress with one hand and as my uncle always said with a round oath when he told the story he wouldn t have believed it possible that legs and feet could have been brought to such a state of perfection unless he had seen them with his own eyes But in this one glimpse of the beautiful face my uncle saw that the young lady cast an imploring look upon him and that she appeared terrified and distressed He noticed too that the young fellow in the powdered wig notwithstanding his show of gallantry which was all very fine and grand clasped her tight by the wrist when she got in and followed himself immediately afterwards An uncommonly ill looking fellow in a close brown wig and a plum coloured suit wearing a very large sword and boots up to his hips belonged to the party and when he sat himself down next to the young lady who shrank into a corner at his approach my uncle was confirmed in his original impression that something dark and mysterious was going forward or as he always said himself that there was a screw loose somewhere It s quite surprising how quickly he made up his mind to help the lady at any peril if she needed any help Death and lightning exclaimed the young gentleman laying his hand upon his sword as my uncle entered the coach Blood and thunder roared the other gentleman With this he whipped his sword out and made a lunge at my uncle without further ceremony My uncle had no weapon about him but with great dexterity he snatched the ill looking gentleman s three cornered hat from his head and receiving the point of his sword right through the crown squeezed the sides together and held it tight Pink him behind cried the ill looking gentleman to his companion as he struggled to regain his sword He had better not cried my uncle displaying the heel of one of his shoes in a threatening manner I ll kick his brains out if he has any or fracture his skull if he hasn t Exerting all his strength at this moment my uncle wrenched the ill looking man s sword from his grasp and flung it clean out of the coach window upon which the younger gentleman vociferated Death and lightning again and laid his hand upon the hilt of his sword in a very fierce manner but didn t draw it Perhaps gentlemen as my uncle used to say with a smile perhaps he was afraid of alarming the lady Now gentlemen said my uncle taking his seat deliberately I don t want to have any death with or without lightning in a lady s presence and we have had quite blood and thundering enough for one journey so if you please we ll sit in our places like quiet insides Here guard pick up that gentleman s carving knife As quickly as my uncle said the words the guard appeared at the coach window with the gentleman s sword in his hand He held up his lantern and looked earnestly in my uncle s face as he handed it in when by its light my uncle saw to his great surprise that an immense crowd of mail coach guards swarmed round the window every one of whom had his eyes earnestly fixed upon him too He had never seen such a sea of white faces red bodies and earnest eyes in all his born days This is the strangest sort of thing I ever had anything to do with thought my uncle allow me to return you your hat sir The ill looking gentleman received his three cornered hat in silence looked at the hole in the middle with an inquiring air and finally stuck it on the top of his wig with a solemnity the effect of which was a trifle impaired by his sneezing violently at the moment and jerking it off again All right cried the guard with the lantern mounting into his little seat behind Away they went My uncle peeped out of the coach window as they emerged from the yard and observed that the other mails with coachmen guards horses and passengers complete were driving round and round in circles at a slow trot of about five miles an hour My uncle burned with indignation gentlemen As a commercial man he felt that the mail bags were not to be trifled with and he resolved to memorialise the Post Office on the subject the very instant he reached London At present however his thoughts were occupied with the young lady who sat in the farthest corner of the coach with her face muffled closely in her hood the gentleman with the sky blue coat sitting opposite to her the other man in the plum coloured suit by her side and both watching her intently If she so much as rustled the folds of her hood he could hear the ill looking man clap his hand upon his sword and could tell by the other s breathing it was so dark he couldn t see his face that he was looking as big as if he were going to devour her at a mouthful This roused my uncle more and more and he resolved come what might to see the end of it He had a great admiration for bright eyes and sweet faces and pretty legs and feet in short he was fond of the whole sex It runs in our family gentleman so am I Many were the devices which my uncle practised to attract the lady s attention or at all events to engage the mysterious gentlemen in conversation They were all in vain the gentlemen wouldn t talk and the lady didn t dare He thrust his head out of the coach window at intervals and bawled out to know why they didn t go faster But he called till he was hoarse nobody paid the least attention to him He leaned back in the coach and thought of the beautiful face and the feet and legs This answered better it whiled away the time and kept him from wondering where he was going and how it was that he found himself in such an odd situation Not that this would have worried him much anyway he was a mighty free and easy roving devil may care sort of person was my uncle gentlemen All of a sudden the coach stopped Hollo said my uncle what s in the wind now Alight here said the guard letting down the steps Here cried my uncle Here rejoined the guard I ll do nothing of the sort said my uncle Very well then stop where you are said the guard I will said my uncle Do said the guard The passengers had regarded this colloquy with great attention and finding that my uncle was determined not to alight the younger man squeezed past him to hand the lady out At this moment the ill looking man was inspecting the hole in the crown of his three cornered hat As the young lady brushed past she dropped one of her gloves into my uncle s hand and softly whispered with her lips so close to his face that he felt her warm breath on his nose the single word Help Gentlemen my uncle leaped out of the coach at once with such violence that it rocked on the springs again Oh you ve thought better of it have you said the guard when he saw my uncle standing on the ground My uncle looked at the guard for a few seconds in some doubt whether it wouldn t be better to wrench his blunderbuss from him fire it in the face of the man with the big sword knock the rest of the company over the head with the stock snatch up the young lady and go off in the smoke On second thoughts however he abandoned this plan as being a shade too melodramatic in the execution and followed the two mysterious men who keeping the lady between them were now entering an old house in front of which the coach had stopped They turned into the passage and my uncle followed Of all the ruinous and desolate places my uncle had ever beheld this was the most so It looked as if it had once been a large house of entertainment but the roof had fallen in in many places and the stairs were steep rugged and broken There was a huge fireplace in the room into which they walked and the chimney was blackened with smoke but no warm blaze lighted it up now The white feathery dust of burned wood was still strewed over the hearth but the stove was cold and all was dark and gloomy Well said my uncle as he looked about him a mail travelling at the rate of six miles and a half an hour and stopping for an indefinite time at such a hole as this is rather an irregular sort of proceeding I fancy This shall be made known I ll write to the papers My uncle said this in a pretty loud voice and in an open unreserved sort of manner with the view of engaging the two strangers in conversation if he could But neither of them took any more notice of him than whispering to each other and scowling at him as they did so The lady was at the farther end of the room and once she ventured to wave her hand as if beseeching my uncle s assistance At length the two strangers advanced a little and the conversation began in earnest You don t know this is a private room I suppose fellow said the gentleman in sky blue No I do not fellow rejoined my uncle Only if this is a private room specially ordered for the occasion I should think the public room must be a VERY comfortable one with this my uncle sat himself down in a high backed chair and took such an accurate measure of the gentleman with his eyes that Tiggin and Welps could have supplied him with printed calico for a suit and not an inch too much or too little from that estimate alone Quit this room said both men together grasping their swords Eh said my uncle not at all appearing to comprehend their meaning Quit the room or you are a dead man said the ill looking fellow with the large sword drawing it at the same time and flourishing it in the air Down with him cried the gentleman in sky blue drawing his sword also and falling back two or three yards Down with him The lady gave a loud scream Now my uncle was always remarkable for great boldness and great presence of mind All the time that he had appeared so indifferent to what was going on he had been looking slily about for some missile or weapon of defence and at the very instant when the swords were drawn he espied standing in the chimney corner an old basket hilted rapier in a rusty scabbard At one bound my uncle caught it in his hand drew it flourished it gallantly above his head called aloud to the lady to keep out of the way hurled the chair at the man in sky blue and the scabbard at the man in plum colour and taking advantage of the confusion fell upon them both pell mell Gentlemen there is an old story none the worse for being true regarding a fine young Irish gentleman who being asked if he could play the fiddle replied he had no doubt he could but he couldn t exactly say for certain because he had never tried This is not inapplicable to my uncle and his fencing He had never had a sword in his hand before except once when he played Richard the Third at a private theatre upon which occasion it was arranged with Richmond that he was to be run through from behind without showing fight at all But here he was cutting and slashing with two experienced swordsman thrusting and guarding and poking and slicing and acquitting himself in the most manful and dexterous manner possible although up to that time he had never been aware that he had the least notion of the science It only shows how true the old saying is that a man never knows what he can do till he tries gentlemen The noise of the combat was terrific each of the three combatants swearing like troopers and their swords clashing with as much noise as if all the knives and steels in Newport market were rattling together at the same time When it was at its very height the lady to encourage my uncle most probably withdrew her hood entirely from her face and disclosed a countenance of such dazzling beauty that he would have fought against fifty men to win one smile from it and die He had done wonders before but now he began to powder away like a raving mad giant At this very moment the gentleman in sky blue turning round and seeing the young lady with her face uncovered vented an exclamation of rage and jealousy and turning his weapon against her beautiful bosom pointed a thrust at her heart which caused my uncle to utter a cry of apprehension that made the building ring The lady stepped lightly aside and snatching the young man s sword from his hand before he had recovered his balance drove him to the wall and running it through him and the panelling up to the very hilt pinned him there hard and fast It was a splendid example My uncle with a loud shout of triumph and a strength that was irresistible made his adversary retreat in the same direction and plunging the old rapier into the very centre of a large red flower in the pattern of his waistcoat nailed him beside his friend there they both stood gentlemen jerking their arms and legs about in agony like the toy shop figures that are moved by a piece of pack thread My uncle always said afterwards that this was one of the surest means he knew of for disposing of an enemy but it was liable to one objection on the ground of expense inasmuch as it involved the loss of a sword for every man disabled The mail the mail cried the lady running up to my uncle and throwing her beautiful arms round his neck we may yet escape May cried my uncle why my dear there s nobody else to kill is there My uncle was rather disappointed gentlemen for he thought a little quiet bit of love making would be agreeable after the slaughtering if it were only to change the subject We have not an instant to lose here said the young lady He pointing to the young gentleman in sky blue is the only son of the powerful Marquess of Filletoville Well then my dear I m afraid he ll never come to the title said my uncle looking coolly at the young gentleman as he stood fixed up against the wall in the cockchafer fashion that I have described You have cut off the entail my love I have been torn from my home and my friends by these villains said the young lady her features glowing with indignation That wretch would have married me by violence in another hour Confound his impudence said my uncle bestowing a very contemptuous look on the dying heir of Filletoville As you may guess from what you have seen said the young lady the party were prepared to murder me if I appealed to any one for assistance If their accomplices find us here we are lost Two minutes hence may be too late The mail With these words overpowered by her feelings and the exertion of sticking the young Marquess of Filletoville she sank into my uncle s arms My uncle caught her up and bore her to the house door There stood the mail with four long tailed flowing maned black horses ready harnessed but no coachman no guard no hostler even at the horses heads Gentlemen I hope I do no injustice to my uncle s memory when I express my opinion that although he was a bachelor he had held some ladies in his arms before this time I believe indeed that he had rather a habit of kissing barmaids and I know that in one or two instances he had been seen by credible witnesses to hug a landlady in a very perceptible manner I mention the circumstance to show what a very uncommon sort of person this beautiful young lady must have been to have affected my uncle in the way she did he used to say that as her long dark hair trailed over his arm and her beautiful dark eyes fixed themselves upon his face when she recovered he felt so strange and nervous that his legs trembled beneath him But who can look in a sweet soft pair of dark eyes without feeling queer I can t gentlemen I am afraid to look at some eyes I know and that s the truth of it You will never leave me murmured the young lady Never said my uncle And he meant it too My dear preserver exclaimed the young lady My dear kind brave preserver Don t said my uncle interrupting her Why inquired the young lady Because your mouth looks so beautiful when you speak rejoined my uncle that I m afraid I shall be rude enough to kiss it The young lady put up her hand as if to caution my uncle not to do so and said No she didn t say anything she smiled When you are looking at a pair of the most delicious lips in the world and see them gently break into a roguish smile if you are very near them and nobody else by you cannot better testify your admiration of their beautiful form and colour than by kissing them at once My uncle did so and I honour him for it Hark cried the young lady starting The noise of wheels and horses So it is said my uncle listening He had a good ear for wheels and the trampling of hoofs but there appeared to be so many horses and carriages rattling towards them from a distance that it was impossible to form a guess at their number The sound was like that of fifty brakes with six blood cattle in each We are pursued cried the young lady clasping her hands We are pursued I have no hope but in you There was such an expression of terror in her beautiful face that my uncle made up his mind at once He lifted her into the coach told her not to be frightened pressed his lips to hers once more and then advising her to draw up the window to keep the cold air out mounted to the box Stay love cried the young lady What s the matter said my uncle from the coach box I want to speak to you said the young lady only a word Only one word dearest Must I get down inquired my uncle The lady made no answer but she smiled again Such a smile gentlemen It beat the other one all to nothing My uncle descended from his perch in a twinkling What is it my dear said my uncle looking in at the coach window The lady happened to bend forward at the same time and my uncle thought she looked more beautiful than she had done yet He was very close to her just then gentlemen so he really ought to know What is it my dear said my uncle Will you never love any one but me never marry any one beside said the young lady My uncle swore a great oath that he never would marry anybody else and the young lady drew in her head and pulled up the window He jumped upon the box squared his elbows adjusted the ribands seized the whip which lay on the roof gave one flick to the off leader and away went the four long tailed flowing maned black horses at fifteen good English miles an hour with the old mail coach behind them Whew How they tore along The noise behind grew louder The faster the old mail went the faster came the pursuers men horses dogs were leagued in the pursuit The noise was frightful but above all rose the voice of the young lady urging my uncle on and shrieking Faster Faster They whirled past the dark trees as feathers would be swept before a hurricane Houses gates churches haystacks objects of every kind they shot by with a velocity and noise like roaring waters suddenly let loose But still the noise of pursuit grew louder and still my uncle could hear the young lady wildly screaming Faster Faster My uncle plied whip and rein and the horses flew onward till they were white with foam and yet the noise behind increased and yet the young lady cried Faster Faster My uncle gave a loud stamp on the boot in the energy of the moment and found that it was gray morning and he was sitting in the wheelwright s yard on the box of an old Edinburgh mail shivering with the cold and wet and stamping his feet to warm them He got down and looked eagerly inside for the beautiful young lady Alas There was neither door nor seat to the coach It was a mere shell Of course my uncle knew very well that there was some mystery in the matter and that everything had passed exactly as he used to relate it He remained staunch to the great oath he had sworn to the beautiful young lady refusing several eligible landladies on her account and dying a bachelor at last He always said what a curious thing it was that he should have found out by such a mere accident as his clambering over the palings that the ghosts of mail coaches and horses guards coachmen and passengers were in the habit of making journeys regularly every night He used to add that he believed he was the only living person who had ever been taken as a passenger on one of these excursions And I think he was right gentlemen at least I never heard of any other I wonder what these ghosts of mail coaches carry in their bags said the landlord who had listened to the whole story with profound attention The dead letters of course said the bagman Oh ah To be sure rejoined the landlord I never thought of that CHAPTER L HOW mister PICKWICK SPED UPON HIS MISSION AND HOW HE WAS REINFORCED IN THE OUTSET BY A MOST UNEXPECTED AUXILIARY The horses were put to punctually at a quarter before nine next morning and mister Pickwick and Sam Weller having each taken his seat the one inside and the other out the postillion was duly directed to repair in the first instance to mister Bob Sawyer s house for the purpose of taking up mister Benjamin Allen It was with feelings of no small astonishment when the carriage drew up before the door with the red lamp and the very legible inscription of Sawyer late Nockemorf that mister Pickwick saw on popping his head out of the coach window the boy in the gray livery very busily employed in putting up the shutters the which being an unusual and an unbusinesslike proceeding at that hour of the morning at once suggested to his mind two inferences the one that some good friend and patient of mister Bob Sawyer s was dead the other that mister Bob Sawyer himself was bankrupt What is the matter said mister Pickwick to the boy Nothing s the matter Sir replied the boy expanding his mouth to the whole breadth of his countenance All right all right cried Bob Sawyer suddenly appearing at the door with a small leathern knapsack limp and dirty in one hand and a rough coat and shawl thrown over the other arm I m going old fellow You exclaimed mister Pickwick Yes replied Bob Sawyer and a regular expedition we ll make of it Here Sam Look out Thus briefly bespeaking mister Weller s attention mister Bob Sawyer jerked the leathern knapsack into the dickey where it was immediately stowed away under the seat by Sam who regarded the proceeding with great admiration This done mister Bob Sawyer with the assistance of the boy forcibly worked himself into the rough coat which was a few sizes too small for him and then advancing to the coach window thrust in his head and laughed boisterously What a start it is isn t it cried Bob wiping the tears out of his eyes with one of the cuffs of the rough coat My dear Sir said mister Pickwick with some embarrassment I had no idea of your accompanying us No that s just the very thing replied Bob seizing mister Pickwick by the lappel of his coat That s the joke Oh that s the joke is it said mister Pickwick Of course replied Bob It s the whole point of the thing you know that and leaving the business to take care of itself as it seems to have made up its mind not to take care of me With this explanation of the phenomenon of the shutters mister Bob Sawyer pointed to the shop and relapsed into an ecstasy of mirth Bless me you are surely not mad enough to think of leaving your patients without anybody to attend them remonstrated mister Pickwick in a very serious tone Why not asked Bob in reply I shall save by it you know None of them ever pay Besides said Bob lowering his voice to a confidential whisper they will be all the better for it for being nearly out of drugs and not able to increase my account just now I should have been obliged to give them calomel all round and it would have been certain to have disagreed with some of them So it s all for the best There was a philosophy and a strength of reasoning about this reply which mister Pickwick was not prepared for He paused a few moments and added less firmly than before But this chaise my young friend will only hold two and I am pledged to mister Allen Don t think of me for a minute replied Bob I ve arranged it all Sam and I will share the dickey between us Look here This little bill is to be wafered on the shop door Sawyer late Nockemorf Inquire of missus Cripps over the way missus Cripps is my boy s mother mister Sawyer s very sorry says missus Cripps couldn t help it fetched away early this morning to a consultation of the very first surgeons in the country couldn t do without him would have him at any price tremendous operation The fact is said Bob in conclusion it ll do me more good than otherwise I expect If it gets into one of the local papers it will be the making of me Here s Ben now then jump in With these hurried words mister Bob Sawyer pushed the postboy on one side jerked his friend into the vehicle slammed the door put up the steps wafered the bill on the street door locked it put the key in his pocket jumped into the dickey gave the word for starting and did the whole with such extraordinary precipitation that before mister Pickwick had well begun to consider whether mister Bob Sawyer ought to go or not they were rolling away with mister Bob Sawyer thoroughly established as part and parcel of the equipage So long as their progress was confined to the streets of Bristol the facetious Bob kept his professional green spectacles on and conducted himself with becoming steadiness and gravity of demeanour merely giving utterance to divers verbal witticisms for the exclusive behoof and entertainment of mister Samuel Weller But when they emerged on the open road he threw off his green spectacles and his gravity together and performed a great variety of practical jokes which were calculated to attract the attention of the passersby and to render the carriage and those it contained objects of more than ordinary curiosity the least conspicuous among these feats being a most vociferous imitation of a key bugle and the ostentatious display of a crimson silk pocket handkerchief attached to a walking stick which was occasionally waved in the air with various gestures indicative of supremacy and defiance I wonder said mister Pickwick stopping in the midst of a most sedate conversation with Ben Allen bearing reference to the numerous good qualities of mister Winkle and his sister I wonder what all the people we pass can see in us to make them stare so It s a neat turn out replied Ben Allen with something of pride in his tone They re not used to see this sort of thing every day I dare say Possibly replied mister Pickwick It may be so Perhaps it is mister Pickwick might very probably have reasoned himself into the belief that it really was had he not just then happening to look out of the coach window observed that the looks of the passengers betokened anything but respectful astonishment and that various telegraphic communications appeared to be passing between them and some persons outside the vehicle whereupon it occurred to him that these demonstrations might be in some remote degree referable to the humorous deportment of mister Robert Sawyer I hope said mister Pickwick that our volatile friend is committing no absurdities in that dickey behind Oh dear no replied Ben Allen Except when he s elevated Bob s the quietest creature breathing Here a prolonged imitation of a key bugle broke upon the ear succeeded by cheers and screams all of which evidently proceeded from the throat and lungs of the quietest creature breathing or in plainer designation of mister Bob Sawyer himself mister Pickwick and mister Ben Allen looked expressively at each other and the former gentleman taking off his hat and leaning out of the coach window until nearly the whole of his waistcoat was outside it was at length enabled to catch a glimpse of his facetious friend mister Bob Sawyer was seated not in the dickey but on the roof of the chaise with his legs as far asunder as they would conveniently go wearing mister Samuel Weller s hat on one side of his head and bearing in one hand a most enormous sandwich while in the other he supported a goodly sized case bottle to both of which he applied himself with intense relish varying the monotony of the occupation by an occasional howl or the interchange of some lively badinage with any passing stranger The crimson flag was carefully tied in an erect position to the rail of the dickey and mister Samuel Weller decorated with Bob Sawyer s hat was seated in the centre thereof discussing a twin sandwich with an animated countenance the expression of which betokened his entire and perfect approval of the whole arrangement This was enough to irritate a gentleman with mister Pickwick s sense of propriety but it was not the whole extent of the aggravation for a stage coach full inside and out was meeting them at the moment and the astonishment of the passengers was very palpably evinced The congratulations of an Irish family too who were keeping up with the chaise and begging all the time were of rather a boisterous description especially those of its male head who appeared to consider the display as part and parcel of some political or other procession of triumph mister Sawyer cried mister Pickwick in a state of great excitement mister Sawyer Sir Hollo responded that gentleman looking over the side of the chaise with all the coolness in life Are you mad sir demanded mister Pickwick Not a bit of it replied Bob only cheerful Cheerful sir ejaculated mister Pickwick Take down that scandalous red handkerchief I beg I insist Sir Sam take it down Before Sam could interpose mister Bob Sawyer gracefully struck his colours and having put them in his pocket nodded in a courteous manner to mister Pickwick wiped the mouth of the case bottle and applied it to his own thereby informing him without any unnecessary waste of words that he devoted that draught to wishing him all manner of happiness and prosperity Having done this Bob replaced the cork with great care and looking benignantly down on mister Pickwick took a large bite out of the sandwich and smiled Come said mister Pickwick whose momentary anger was not quite proof against Bob s immovable self possession pray let us have no more of this absurdity No no replied Bob once more exchanging hats with mister Weller I didn t mean to do it only I got so enlivened with the ride that I couldn t help it Think of the look of the thing expostulated mister Pickwick have some regard to appearances Oh certainly said Bob it s not the sort of thing at all All over governor Satisfied with this assurance mister Pickwick once more drew his head into the chaise and pulled up the glass but he had scarcely resumed the conversation which mister Bob Sawyer had interrupted when he was somewhat startled by the apparition of a small dark body of an oblong form on the outside of the window which gave sundry taps against it as if impatient of admission What s this exclaimed mister Pickwick It looks like a case bottle remarked Ben Allen eyeing the object in question through his spectacles with some interest I rather think it belongs to Bob The impression was perfectly accurate for mister Bob Sawyer having attached the case bottle to the end of the walking stick was battering the window with it in token of his wish that his friends inside would partake of its contents in all good fellowship and harmony What s to be done said mister Pickwick looking at the bottle This proceeding is more absurd than the other I think it would be best to take it in replied mister Ben Allen it would serve him right to take it in and keep it wouldn t it It would said mister Pickwick shall I I think it the most proper course we could possibly adopt replied Ben This advice quite coinciding with his own opinion mister Pickwick gently let down the window and disengaged the bottle from the stick upon which the latter was drawn up and mister Bob Sawyer was heard to laugh heartily What a merry dog it is said mister Pickwick looking round at his companion with the bottle in his hand He is said mister Allen You cannot possibly be angry with him remarked mister Pickwick Quite out of the question observed Benjamin Allen During this short interchange of sentiments mister Pickwick had in an abstracted mood uncorked the bottle What is it inquired Ben Allen carelessly I don t know replied mister Pickwick with equal carelessness It smells I think like milk punch Oh indeed said Ben I THINK so rejoined mister Pickwick very properly guarding himself against the possibility of stating an untruth mind I could not undertake to say certainly without tasting it You had better do so said Ben we may as well know what it is Do you think so replied mister Pickwick Well if you are curious to know of course I have no objection Ever willing to sacrifice his own feelings to the wishes of his friend mister Pickwick at once took a pretty long taste What is it inquired Ben Allen interrupting him with some impatience Curious said mister Pickwick smacking his lips I hardly know now Oh yes said mister Pickwick after a second taste It IS punch mister Ben Allen looked at mister Pickwick mister Pickwick looked at mister Ben Allen mister Ben Allen smiled mister Pickwick did not It would serve him right said the last named gentleman with some severity it would serve him right to drink it every drop The very thing that occurred to me said Ben Allen Is it indeed rejoined mister Pickwick Then here s his health With these words that excellent person took a most energetic pull at the bottle and handed it to Ben Allen who was not slow to imitate his example The smiles became mutual and the milk punch was gradually and cheerfully disposed of After all said mister Pickwick as he drained the last drop his pranks are really very amusing very entertaining indeed You may say that rejoined mister Ben Allen In proof of Bob Sawyer s being one of the funniest fellows alive he proceeded to entertain mister Pickwick with a long and circumstantial account how that gentleman once drank himself into a fever and got his head shaved the relation of which pleasant and agreeable history was only stopped by the stoppage of the chaise at the Bell at Berkeley Heath to change horses I say We re going to dine here aren t we said Bob looking in at the window Dine said mister Pickwick Why we have only come nineteen miles and have eighty seven and a half to go Just the reason why we should take something to enable us to bear up against the fatigue remonstrated mister Bob Sawyer Oh it s quite impossible to dine at half past eleven o clock in the day replied mister Pickwick looking at his watch So it is rejoined Bob lunch is the very thing Hollo you sir Lunch for three directly and keep the horses back for a quarter of an hour Tell them to put everything they have cold on the table and some bottled ale and let us taste your very best Madeira Issuing these orders with monstrous importance and bustle mister Bob Sawyer at once hurried into the house to superintend the arrangements in less than five minutes he returned and declared them to be excellent The quality of the lunch fully justified the eulogium which Bob had pronounced and very great justice was done to it not only by that gentleman but mister Ben Allen and mister Pickwick also Under the auspices of the three the bottled ale and the Madeira were promptly disposed of and when the horses being once more put to they resumed their seats with the case bottle full of the best substitute for milk punch that could be procured on so short a notice the key bugle sounded and the red flag waved without the slightest opposition on mister Pickwick s part At the Hop Pole at Tewkesbury they stopped to dine upon which occasion there was more bottled ale with some more Madeira and some port besides and here the case bottle was replenished for the fourth time Under the influence of these combined stimulants mister Pickwick and mister Ben Allen fell fast asleep for thirty miles while Bob and mister Weller sang duets in the dickey It was quite dark when mister Pickwick roused himself sufficiently to look out of the window The straggling cottages by the road side the dingy hue of every object visible the murky atmosphere the paths of cinders and brick dust the deep red glow of furnace fires in the distance the volumes of dense smoke issuing heavily forth from high toppling chimneys blackening and obscuring everything around the glare of distant lights the ponderous wagons which toiled along the road laden with clashing rods of iron or piled with heavy goods all betokened their rapid approach to the great working town of Birmingham As they rattled through the narrow thoroughfares leading to the heart of the turmoil the sights and sounds of earnest occupation struck more forcibly on the senses The streets were thronged with working people The hum of labour resounded from every house lights gleamed from the long casement windows in the attic storeys and the whirl of wheels and noise of machinery shook the trembling walls The fires whose lurid sullen light had been visible for miles blazed fiercely up in the great works and factories of the town The din of hammers the rushing of steam and the dead heavy clanking of engines was the harsh music which arose from every quarter The postboy was driving briskly through the open streets and past the handsome and well lighted shops that intervene between the outskirts of the town and the Old Royal Hotel before mister Pickwick had begun to consider the very difficult and delicate nature of the commission which had carried him thither The delicate nature of this commission and the difficulty of executing it in a satisfactory manner were by no means lessened by the voluntary companionship of mister Bob Sawyer Truth to tell mister Pickwick felt that his presence on the occasion however considerate and gratifying was by no means an honour he would willingly have sought in fact he would cheerfully have given a reasonable sum of money to have had mister Bob Sawyer removed to any place at not less than fifty miles distance without delay mister Pickwick had never held any personal communication with mister Winkle senior although he had once or twice corresponded with him by letter and returned satisfactory answers to his inquiries concerning the moral character and behaviour of his son he felt nervously sensible that to wait upon him for the first time attended by Bob Sawyer and Ben Allen both slightly fuddled was not the most ingenious and likely means that could have been hit upon to prepossess him in his favour However said mister Pickwick endeavouring to reassure himself I must do the best I can I must see him to night for I faithfully promised to do so If they persist in accompanying me I must make the interview as brief as possible and be content that for their own sakes they will not expose themselves As he comforted himself with these reflections the chaise stopped at the door of the Old Royal Ben Allen having been partially awakened from a stupendous sleep and dragged out by the collar by mister Samuel Weller mister Pickwick was enabled to alight They were shown to a comfortable apartment and mister Pickwick at once propounded a question to the waiter concerning the whereabout of mister Winkle s residence Close by Sir said the waiter not above five hundred yards Sir mister Winkle is a wharfinger Sir at the canal sir Private residence is not oh dear no sir not five hundred yards sir Here the waiter blew a candle out and made a feint of lighting it again in order to afford mister Pickwick an opportunity of asking any further questions if he felt so disposed Take anything now Sir said the waiter lighting the candle in desperation at mister Pickwick s silence Tea or coffee Sir Dinner sir Nothing now Very good sir Like to order supper Sir Not just now Very good Sir Here he walked slowly to the door and then stopping short turned round and said with great suavity Shall I send the chambermaid gentlemen You may if you please replied mister Pickwick If YOU please sir And bring some soda water said Bob Sawyer Soda water Sir Yes Sir With his mind apparently relieved from an overwhelming weight by having at last got an order for something the waiter imperceptibly melted away Waiters never walk or run They have a peculiar and mysterious power of skimming out of rooms which other mortals possess not Some slight symptoms of vitality having been awakened in mister Ben Allen by the soda water he suffered himself to be prevailed upon to wash his face and hands and to submit to be brushed by Sam mister Pickwick and Bob Sawyer having also repaired the disorder which the journey had made in their apparel the three started forth arm in arm to mister Winkle s Bob Sawyer impregnating the atmosphere with tobacco smoke as he walked along About a quarter of a mile off in a quiet substantial looking street stood an old red brick house with three steps before the door and a brass plate upon it bearing in fat Roman capitals the words mister Winkle The steps were very white and the bricks were very red and the house was very clean and here stood mister Pickwick mister Benjamin Allen and mister Bob Sawyer as the clock struck ten A smart servant girl answered the knock and started on beholding the three strangers Is mister Winkle at home my dear inquired mister Pickwick He is just going to supper Sir replied the girl Give him that card if you please rejoined mister Pickwick Say I am sorry to trouble him at so late an hour but I am anxious to see him to night and have only just arrived The girl looked timidly at mister Bob Sawyer who was expressing his admiration of her personal charms by a variety of wonderful grimaces and casting an eye at the hats and greatcoats which hung in the passage called another girl to mind the door while she went upstairs The sentinel was speedily relieved for the girl returned immediately and begging pardon of the gentlemen for leaving them in the street ushered them into a floor clothed back parlour half office and half dressing room in which the principal useful and ornamental articles of furniture were a desk a wash hand stand and shaving glass a boot rack and boot jack a high stool four chairs a table and an old eight day clock Over the mantelpiece were the sunken doors of an iron safe while a couple of hanging shelves for books an almanac and several files of dusty papers decorated the walls Very sorry to leave you standing at the door Sir said the girl lighting a lamp and addressing mister Pickwick with a winning smile but you was quite strangers to me and we have such a many trampers that only come to see what they can lay their hands on that really There is not the least occasion for any apology my dear said mister Pickwick good humouredly Not the slightest my love said Bob Sawyer playfully stretching forth his arms and skipping from side to side as if to prevent the young lady s leaving the room The young lady was not at all softened by these allurements for she at once expressed her opinion that mister Bob Sawyer was an odous creetur and on his becoming rather more pressing in his attentions imprinted her fair fingers upon his face and bounced out of the room with many expressions of aversion and contempt Deprived of the young lady s society mister Bob Sawyer proceeded to divert himself by peeping into the desk looking into all the table drawers feigning to pick the lock of the iron safe turning the almanac with its face to the wall trying on the boots of mister Winkle senior over his own and making several other humorous experiments upon the furniture all of which afforded mister Pickwick unspeakable horror and agony and yielded mister Bob Sawyer proportionate delight At length the door opened and a little old gentleman in a snuff coloured suit with a head and face the precise counterpart of those belonging to mister Winkle junior excepting that he was rather bald trotted into the room with mister Pickwick s card in one hand and a silver candlestick in the other mister Pickwick sir how do you do said Winkle the elder putting down the candlestick and proffering his hand Hope I see you well sir Glad to see you Be seated mister Pickwick I beg Sir This gentleman is My friend mister Sawyer interposed mister Pickwick your son s friend Oh said mister Winkle the elder looking rather grimly at Bob I hope you are well sir Right as a trivet sir replied Bob Sawyer This other gentleman cried mister Pickwick is as you will see when you have read the letter with which I am intrusted a very near relative or I should rather say a very particular friend of your son s His name is Allen THAT gentleman inquired mister Winkle pointing with the card towards Ben Allen who had fallen asleep in an attitude which left nothing of him visible but his spine and his coat collar mister Pickwick was on the point of replying to the question and reciting mister Benjamin Allen s name and honourable distinctions at full length when the sprightly mister Bob Sawyer with a view of rousing his friend to a sense of his situation inflicted a startling pinch upon the fleshly part of his arm which caused him to jump up with a shriek Suddenly aware that he was in the presence of a stranger mister Ben Allen advanced and shaking mister Winkle most affectionately by both hands for about five minutes murmured in some half intelligible fragments of sentences the great delight he felt in seeing him and a hospitable inquiry whether he felt disposed to take anything after his walk or would prefer waiting till dinner time which done he sat down and gazed about him with a petrified stare as if he had not the remotest idea where he was which indeed he had not All this was most embarrassing to mister Pickwick the more especially as mister Winkle senior evinced palpable astonishment at the eccentric not to say extraordinary behaviour of his two companions To bring the matter to an issue at once he drew a letter from his pocket and presenting it to mister Winkle senior said This letter Sir is from your son You will see by its contents that on your favourable and fatherly consideration of it depend his future happiness and welfare Will you oblige me by giving it the calmest and coolest perusal and by discussing the subject afterwards with me in the tone and spirit in which alone it ought to be discussed You may judge of the importance of your decision to your son and his intense anxiety upon the subject by my waiting upon you without any previous warning at so late an hour and added mister Pickwick glancing slightly at his two companions and under such unfavourable circumstances With this prelude mister Pickwick placed four closely written sides of extra superfine wire wove penitence in the hands of the astounded mister Winkle senior Then reseating himself in his chair he watched his looks and manner anxiously it is true but with the open front of a gentleman who feels he has taken no part which he need excuse or palliate The old wharfinger turned the letter over looked at the front back and sides made a microscopic examination of the fat little boy on the seal raised his eyes to mister Pickwick s face and then seating himself on the high stool and drawing the lamp closer to him broke the wax unfolded the epistle and lifting it to the light prepared to read Just at this moment mister Bob Sawyer whose wit had lain dormant for some minutes placed his hands on his knees and made a face after the portraits of the late mister Grimaldi as clown It so happened that mister Winkle senior instead of being deeply engaged in reading the letter as mister Bob Sawyer thought chanced to be looking over the top of it at no less a person than mister Bob Sawyer himself rightly conjecturing that the face aforesaid was made in ridicule and derision of his own person he fixed his eyes on Bob with such expressive sternness that the late mister Grimaldi s lineaments gradually resolved themselves into a very fine expression of humility and confusion Did you speak Sir inquired mister Winkle senior after an awful silence No sir replied Bob With no remains of the clown about him save and except the extreme redness of his cheeks You are sure you did not sir said mister Winkle senior Oh dear yes sir quite replied Bob I thought you did Sir replied the old gentleman with indignant emphasis Perhaps you LOOKED at me sir Oh no sir not at all replied Bob with extreme civility I am very glad to hear it sir said mister Winkle senior Having frowned upon the abashed Bob with great magnificence the old gentleman again brought the letter to the light and began to read it seriously mister Pickwick eyed him intently as he turned from the bottom line of the first page to the top line of the second and from the bottom of the second to the top of the third and from the bottom of the third to the top of the fourth but not the slightest alteration of countenance afforded a clue to the feelings with which he received the announcement of his son s marriage which mister Pickwick knew was in the very first half dozen lines He read the letter to the last word folded it again with all the carefulness and precision of a man of business and just when mister Pickwick expected some great outbreak of feeling dipped a pen in the ink stand and said as quietly as if he were speaking on the most ordinary counting house topic What is Nathaniel s address mister Pickwick The George and Vulture at present replied that gentleman George and Vulture Where is that George Yard Lombard Street In the city Yes The old gentleman methodically indorsed the address on the back of the letter and then placing it in the desk which he locked said as he got off the stool and put the bunch of keys in his pocket I suppose there is nothing else which need detain us mister Pickwick Nothing else my dear Sir observed that warm hearted person in indignant amazement Nothing else Have you no opinion to express on this momentous event in our young friend s life No assurance to convey to him through me of the continuance of your affection and protection Nothing to say which will cheer and sustain him and the anxious girl who looks to him for comfort and support My dear Sir consider I will consider replied the old gentleman I have nothing to say just now I am a man of business mister Pickwick I never commit myself hastily in any affair and from what I see of this I by no means like the appearance of it A thousand pounds is not much mister Pickwick You re very right Sir interposed Ben Allen just awake enough to know that he had spent his thousand pounds without the smallest difficulty You re an intelligent man Bob he s a very knowing fellow this I am very happy to find that you do me the justice to make the admission sir said mister Winkle senior looking contemptuously at Ben Allen who was shaking his head profoundly The fact is mister Pickwick that when I gave my son a roving license for a year or so to see something of men and manners which he has done under your auspices so that he might not enter life a mere boarding school milk sop to be gulled by everybody I never bargained for this He knows that very well so if I withdraw my countenance from him on this account he has no call to be surprised He shall hear from me mister Pickwick Good night sir Margaret open the door All this time Bob Sawyer had been nudging mister Ben Allen to say something on the right side Ben accordingly now burst without the slightest preliminary notice into a brief but impassioned piece of eloquence Sir said mister Ben Allen staring at the old gentleman out of a pair of very dim and languid eyes and working his right arm vehemently up and down you you ought to be ashamed of yourself As the lady s brother of course you are an excellent judge of the question retorted mister Winkle senior There that s enough Pray say no more mister Pickwick Good night gentlemen With these words the old gentleman took up the candle stick and opening the room door politely motioned towards the passage You will regret this Sir said mister Pickwick setting his teeth close together to keep down his choler for he felt how important the effect might prove to his young friend I am at present of a different opinion calmly replied mister Winkle senior Once again gentlemen I wish you a good night mister Pickwick walked with angry strides into the street mister Bob Sawyer completely quelled by the decision of the old gentleman s manner took the same course mister Ben Allen s hat rolled down the steps immediately afterwards and mister Ben Allen s body followed it directly The whole party went silent and supperless to bed and mister Pickwick thought just before he fell asleep that if he had known mister Winkle senior had been quite so much of a man of business it was extremely probable he might never have waited upon him on such an errand CHAPTER LI IN WHICH mister PICKWICK ENCOUNTERS AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE TO WHICH FORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCE THE READER IS MAINLY INDEBTED FOR MATTER OF THRILLING INTEREST HEREIN SET DOWN CONCERNING TWO GREAT PUBLIC MEN OF MIGHT AND POWER The morning which broke upon mister Pickwick s sight at eight o clock was not at all calculated to elevate his spirits or to lessen the depression which the unlooked for result of his embassy inspired The sky was dark and gloomy the air was damp and raw the streets were wet and sloppy The smoke hung sluggishly above the chimney tops as if it lacked the courage to rise and the rain came slowly and doggedly down as if it had not even the spirit to pour A game cock in the stableyard deprived of every spark of his accustomed animation balanced himself dismally on one leg in a corner a donkey moping with drooping head under the narrow roof of an outhouse appeared from his meditative and miserable countenance to be contemplating suicide In the street umbrellas were the only things to be seen and the clicking of pattens and splashing of rain drops were the only sounds to be heard The breakfast was interrupted by very little conversation even mister Bob Sawyer felt the influence of the weather and the previous day s excitement In his own expressive language he was floored So was mister Ben Allen So was mister Pickwick In protracted expectation of the weather clearing up the last evening paper from London was read and re read with an intensity of interest only known in cases of extreme destitution every inch of the carpet was walked over with similar perseverance the windows were looked out of often enough to justify the imposition of an additional duty upon them all kinds of topics of conversation were started and failed and at length mister Pickwick when noon had arrived without a change for the better rang the bell resolutely and ordered out the chaise Although the roads were miry and the drizzling rain came down harder than it had done yet and although the mud and wet splashed in at the open windows of the carriage to such an extent that the discomfort was almost as great to the pair of insides as to the pair of outsides still there was something in the motion and the sense of being up and doing which was so infinitely superior to being pent in a dull room looking at the dull rain dripping into a dull street that they all agreed on starting that the change was a great improvement and wondered how they could possibly have delayed making it as long as they had done When they stopped to change at Coventry the steam ascended from the horses in such clouds as wholly to obscure the hostler whose voice was however heard to declare from the mist that he expected the first gold medal from the Humane Society on their next distribution of rewards for taking the postboy s hat off the water descending from the brim of which the invisible gentleman declared must have drowned him the postboy but for his great presence of mind in tearing it promptly from his head and drying the gasping man s countenance with a wisp of straw This is pleasant said Bob Sawyer turning up his coat collar and pulling the shawl over his mouth to concentrate the fumes of a glass of brandy just swallowed Wery replied Sam composedly You don t seem to mind it observed Bob Vy I don t exactly see no good my mindin on it ud do sir replied Sam That s an unanswerable reason anyhow said Bob Yes sir rejoined mister Weller Wotever is is right as the young nobleman sweetly remarked wen they put him down in the pension list cos his mother s uncle s vife s grandfather vunce lit the king s pipe vith a portable tinder box Not a bad notion that Sam said mister Bob Sawyer approvingly Just wot the young nobleman said ev ry quarter day arterwards for the rest of his life replied mister Weller Wos you ever called in inquired Sam glancing at the driver after a short silence and lowering his voice to a mysterious whisper wos you ever called in when you wos prentice to a sawbones to wisit a postboy I don t remember that I ever was replied Bob Sawyer You never see a postboy in that ere hospital as you WALKED as they says o the ghosts did you demanded Sam No replied Bob Sawyer I don t think I ever did Never know d a churchyard were there wos a postboy s tombstone or see a dead postboy did you inquired Sam pursuing his catechism No rejoined Bob I never did No rejoined Sam triumphantly Nor never vill and there s another thing that no man never see and that s a dead donkey No man never see a dead donkey cept the general l m n in the black silk smalls as know d the young ooman as kep a goat and that wos a French donkey so wery likely he warn t wun o the reg lar breed Well what has that got to do with the postboys asked Bob Sawyer This here replied Sam Without goin so far as to as sert as some wery sensible people do that postboys and donkeys is both immortal wot I say is this that wenever they feels theirselves gettin stiff and past their work they just rides off together wun postboy to a pair in the usual way wot becomes on em nobody knows but it s wery probable as they starts avay to take their pleasure in some other vorld for there ain t a man alive as ever see either a donkey or a postboy a takin his pleasure in this Expatiating upon this learned and remarkable theory and citing many curious statistical and other facts in its support Sam Weller beguiled the time until they reached Dunchurch where a dry postboy and fresh horses were procured the next stage was Daventry and the next Towcester and at the end of each stage it rained harder than it had done at the beginning I say remonstrated Bob Sawyer looking in at the coach window as they pulled up before the door of the Saracen s Head Towcester this won t do you know Bless me said mister Pickwick just awakening from a nap I m afraid you re wet Oh you are are you returned Bob Yes I am a little that way Uncomfortably damp perhaps Bob did look dampish inasmuch as the rain was streaming from his neck elbows cuffs skirts and knees and his whole apparel shone so with the wet that it might have been mistaken for a full suit of prepared oilskin I AM rather wet said Bob giving himself a shake and casting a little hydraulic shower around like a Newfoundland dog just emerged from the water I think it s quite impossible to go on to night interposed Ben Out of the question sir remarked Sam Weller coming to assist in the conference it s a cruelty to animals sir to ask em to do it There s beds here sir said Sam addressing his master everything clean and comfortable Wery good little dinner sir they can get ready in half an hour pair of fowls sir and a weal cutlet French beans taturs tart and tidiness You d better stop vere you are sir if I might recommend Take adwice sir as the doctor said The host of the Saracen s Head opportunely appeared at this moment to confirm mister Weller s statement relative to the accommodations of the establishment and to back his entreaties with a variety of dismal conjectures regarding the state of the roads the doubt of fresh horses being to be had at the next stage the dead certainty of its raining all night the equally mortal certainty of its clearing up in the morning and other topics of inducement familiar to innkeepers Well said mister Pickwick but I must send a letter to London by some conveyance so that it may be delivered the very first thing in the morning or I must go forwards at all hazards The landlord smiled his delight Nothing could be easier than for the gentleman to inclose a letter in a sheet of brown paper and send it on either by the mail or the night coach from Birmingham If the gentleman were particularly anxious to have it left as soon as possible he might write outside To be delivered immediately which was sure to be attended to or Pay the bearer half a crown extra for instant delivery which was surer still Very well said mister Pickwick then we will stop here Lights in the Sun John make up the fire the gentlemen are wet cried the landlord This way gentlemen don t trouble yourselves about the postboy now sir I ll send him to you when you ring for him sir Now John the candles The candles were brought the fire was stirred up and a fresh log of wood thrown on In ten minutes time a waiter was laying the cloth for dinner the curtains were drawn the fire was blazing brightly and everything looked as everything always does in all decent English inns as if the travellers had been expected and their comforts prepared for days beforehand mister Pickwick sat down at a side table and hastily indited a note to mister Winkle merely informing him that he was detained by stress of weather but would certainly be in London next day until when he deferred any account of his proceedings This note was hastily made into a parcel and despatched to the bar per mister Samuel Weller Sam left it with the landlady and was returning to pull his master s boots off after drying himself by the kitchen fire when glancing casually through a half opened door he was arrested by the sight of a gentleman with a sandy head who had a large bundle of newspapers lying on the table before him and was perusing the leading article of one with a settled sneer which curled up his nose and all other features into a majestic expression of haughty contempt Hollo said Sam I ought to know that ere head and them features the eyeglass too and the broad brimmed tile Eatansvill to vit or I m a Roman Sam was taken with a troublesome cough at once for the purpose of attracting the gentleman s attention the gentleman starting at the sound raised his head and his eyeglass and disclosed to view the profound and thoughtful features of mister Pott of the Eatanswill GAZETTE Beggin your pardon sir said Sam advancing with a bow my master s here mister Pott Hush hush cried Pott drawing Sam into the room and closing the door with a countenance of mysterious dread and apprehension Wot s the matter Sir inquired Sam looking vacantly about him Not a whisper of my name replied Pott this is a buff neighbourhood If the excited and irritable populace knew I was here I should be torn to pieces No Vould you sir inquired Sam I should be the victim of their fury replied Pott Now young man what of your master He s a stopping here to night on his vay to town with a couple of friends replied Sam Is mister Winkle one of them inquired Pott with a slight frown No Sir mister Vinkle stops at home now rejoined Sam He s married Married exclaimed Pott with frightful vehemence He stopped smiled darkly and added in a low vindictive tone It serves him right Having given vent to this cruel ebullition of deadly malice and cold blooded triumph over a fallen enemy mister Pott inquired whether mister Pickwick s friends were blue Receiving a most satisfactory answer in the affirmative from Sam who knew as much about the matter as Pott himself he consented to accompany him to mister Pickwick s room where a hearty welcome awaited him and an agreement to club their dinners together was at once made and ratified And how are matters going on in Eatanswill inquired mister Pickwick when Pott had taken a seat near the fire and the whole party had got their wet boots off and dry slippers on Is the INDEPENDENT still in being The INDEPENDENT sir replied Pott is still dragging on a wretched and lingering career Abhorred and despised by even the few who are cognisant of its miserable and disgraceful existence stifled by the very filth it so profusely scatters rendered deaf and blind by the exhalations of its own slime the obscene journal happily unconscious of its degraded state is rapidly sinking beneath that treacherous mud which while it seems to give it a firm standing with the low and debased classes of society is nevertheless rising above its detested head and will speedily engulf it for ever Having delivered this manifesto which formed a portion of his last week s leader with vehement articulation the editor paused to take breath and looked majestically at Bob Sawyer You are a young man sir said Pott mister Bob Sawyer nodded So are you sir said Pott addressing mister Ben Allen Ben admitted the soft impeachment And are both deeply imbued with those blue principles which so long as I live I have pledged myself to the people of these kingdoms to support and to maintain suggested Pott Why I don t exactly know about that replied Bob Sawyer I am Not buff mister Pickwick interrupted Pott drawing back his chair your friend is not buff sir No no rejoined Bob I m a kind of plaid at present a compound of all sorts of colours A waverer said Pott solemnly a waverer I should like to show you a series of eight articles Sir that have appeared in the Eatanswill GAZETTE I think I may venture to say that you would not be long in establishing your opinions on a firm and solid blue basis sir I dare say I should turn very blue long before I got to the end of them responded Bob mister Pott looked dubiously at Bob Sawyer for some seconds and turning to mister Pickwick said You have seen the literary articles which have appeared at intervals in the Eatanswill GAZETTE in the course of the last three months and which have excited such general I may say such universal attention and admiration Why replied mister Pickwick slightly embarrassed by the question the fact is I have been so much engaged in other ways that I really have not had an opportunity of perusing them You should do so Sir said Pott with a severe countenance I will said mister Pickwick They appeared in the form of a copious review of a work on Chinese metaphysics Sir said Pott Oh observed mister Pickwick from your pen I hope From the pen of my critic Sir rejoined Pott with dignity An abstruse subject I should conceive said mister Pickwick Very Sir responded Pott looking intensely sage He CRAMMED for it to use a technical but expressive term he read up for the subject at my desire in the Encyclopaedia Britannica Indeed said mister Pickwick I was not aware that that valuable work contained any information respecting Chinese metaphysics He read Sir rejoined Pott laying his hand on mister Pickwick s knee and looking round with a smile of intellectual superiority he read for metaphysics under the letter M and for China under the letter C and combined his information Sir mister Pott s features assumed so much additional grandeur at the recollection of the power and research displayed in the learned effusions in question that some minutes elapsed before mister Pickwick felt emboldened to renew the conversation at length as the editor s countenance gradually relaxed into its customary expression of moral supremacy he ventured to resume the discourse by asking Is it fair to inquire what great object has brought you so far from home That object which actuates and animates me in all my gigantic labours Sir replied Pott with a calm smile my country s good I supposed it was some public mission observed mister Pickwick Yes Sir resumed Pott it is Here bending towards mister Pickwick he whispered in a deep hollow voice A Buff ball Sir will take place in Birmingham to morrow evening God bless me exclaimed mister Pickwick Yes Sir and supper added Pott You don t say so ejaculated mister Pickwick Pott nodded portentously Now although mister Pickwick feigned to stand aghast at this disclosure he was so little versed in local politics that he was unable to form an adequate comprehension of the importance of the dire conspiracy it referred to observing which mister Pott drawing forth the last number of the Eatanswill GAZETTE and referring to the same delivered himself of the following paragraph HOLE AND CORNER BUFFERY A reptile contemporary has recently sweltered forth his black venom in the vain and hopeless attempt of sullying the fair name of our distinguished and excellent representative the Honourable mister Slumkey that Slumkey whom we long before he gained his present noble and exalted position predicted would one day be as he now is at once his country s brightest honour and her proudest boast alike her bold defender and her honest pride our reptile contemporary we say has made himself merry at the expense of a superbly embossed plated coal scuttle which has been presented to that glorious man by his enraptured constituents and towards the purchase of which the nameless wretch insinuates the Honourable mister Slumkey himself contributed through a confidential friend of his butler s more than three fourths of the whole sum subscribed Why does not the crawling creature see that even if this be the fact the Honourable mister Slumkey only appears in a still more amiable and radiant light than before if that be possible Does not even his obtuseness perceive that this amiable and touching desire to carry out the wishes of the constituent body must for ever endear him to the hearts and souls of such of his fellow townsmen as are not worse than swine or in other words who are not as debased as our contemporary himself But such is the wretched trickery of hole and corner Buffery These are not its only artifices Treason is abroad We boldly state now that we are goaded to the disclosure and we throw ourselves on the country and its constables for protection we boldly state that secret preparations are at this moment in progress for a Buff ball which is to be held in a Buff town in the very heart and centre of a Buff population which is to be conducted by a Buff master of the ceremonies which is to be attended by four ultra Buff members of Parliament and the admission to which is to be by Buff tickets Does our fiendish contemporary wince Let him writhe in impotent malice as we pen the words WE WILL BE THERE There Sir said Pott folding up the paper quite exhausted that is the state of the case The landlord and waiter entering at the moment with dinner caused mister Pott to lay his finger on his lips in token that he considered his life in mister Pickwick s hands and depended on his secrecy Messrs Bob Sawyer and Benjamin Allen who had irreverently fallen asleep during the reading of the quotation from the Eatanswill GAZETTE and the discussion which followed it were roused by the mere whispering of the talismanic word Dinner in their ears and to dinner they went with good digestion waiting on appetite and health on both and a waiter on all three In the course of the dinner and the sitting which succeeded it mister Pott descending for a few moments to domestic topics informed mister Pickwick that the air of Eatanswill not agreeing with his lady she was then engaged in making a tour of different fashionable watering places with a view to the recovery of her wonted health and spirits this was a delicate veiling of the fact that missus Pott acting upon her often repeated threat of separation had in virtue of an arrangement negotiated by her brother the lieutenant and concluded by mister Pott permanently retired with the faithful bodyguard upon one moiety or half part of the annual income and profits arising from the editorship and sale of the Eatanswill GAZETTE While the great mister Pott was dwelling upon this and other matters enlivening the conversation from time to time with various extracts from his own lucubrations a stern stranger calling from the window of a stage coach outward bound which halted at the inn to deliver packages requested to know whether if he stopped short on his journey and remained there for the night he could be furnished with the necessary accommodation of a bed and bedstead Certainly sir replied the landlord I can can I inquired the stranger who seemed habitually suspicious in look and manner No doubt of it Sir replied the landlord Good said the stranger Coachman I get down here Guard my carpet bag Bidding the other passengers good night in a rather snappish manner the stranger alighted He was a shortish gentleman with very stiff black hair cut in the porcupine or blacking brush style and standing stiff and straight all over his head his aspect was pompous and threatening his manner was peremptory his eyes were sharp and restless and his whole bearing bespoke a feeling of great confidence in himself and a consciousness of immeasurable superiority over all other people This gentleman was shown into the room originally assigned to the patriotic mister Pott and the waiter remarked in dumb astonishment at the singular coincidence that he had no sooner lighted the candles than the gentleman diving into his hat drew forth a newspaper and began to read it with the very same expression of indignant scorn which upon the majestic features of Pott had paralysed his energies an hour before The man observed too that whereas mister Pott s scorn had been roused by a newspaper headed the Eatanswill INDEPENDENT this gentleman s withering contempt was awakened by a newspaper entitled the Eatanswill GAZETTE Send the landlord said the stranger Yes sir rejoined the waiter The landlord was sent and came Are you the landlord inquired the gentleman I am sir replied the landlord My name is Slurk said the gentleman The landlord slightly inclined his head Slurk sir repeated the gentleman haughtily Do you know me now man The landlord scratched his head looked at the ceiling and at the stranger and smiled feebly Do you know me man inquired the stranger angrily The landlord made a strong effort and at length replied Well Sir I do not know you Great Heaven said the stranger dashing his clenched fist upon the table And this is popularity The landlord took a step or two towards the door the stranger fixing his eyes upon him resumed This said the stranger this is gratitude for years of labour and study in behalf of the masses I alight wet and weary no enthusiastic crowds press forward to greet their champion the church bells are silent the very name elicits no responsive feeling in their torpid bosoms It is enough said the agitated mister Slurk pacing to and fro to curdle the ink in one s pen and induce one to abandon their cause for ever Did you say brandy and water Sir said the landlord venturing a hint Rum said mister Slurk turning fiercely upon him Have you got a fire anywhere We can light one directly Sir said the landlord Which will throw out no heat until it is bed time interrupted mister Slurk Is there anybody in the kitchen Not a soul There was a beautiful fire Everybody had gone and the house door was closed for the night I will drink my rum and water said mister Slurk by the kitchen fire So gathering up his hat and newspaper he stalked solemnly behind the landlord to that humble apartment and throwing himself on a settle by the fireside resumed his countenance of scorn and began to read and drink in silent dignity Now some demon of discord flying over the Saracen s Head at that moment on casting down his eyes in mere idle curiosity happened to behold Slurk established comfortably by the kitchen fire and Pott slightly elevated with wine in another room upon which the malicious demon darting down into the last mentioned apartment with inconceivable rapidity passed at once into the head of mister Bob Sawyer and prompted him for his the demon s own evil purpose to speak as follows I say we ve let the fire out It s uncommonly cold after the rain isn t it It really is replied mister Pickwick shivering It wouldn t be a bad notion to have a cigar by the kitchen fire would it said Bob Sawyer still prompted by the demon aforesaid It would be particularly comfortable I think replied mister Pickwick mister Pott what do you say mister Pott yielded a ready assent and all four travellers each with his glass in his hand at once betook themselves to the kitchen with Sam Weller heading the procession to show them the way The stranger was still reading he looked up and started mister Pott started What s the matter whispered mister Pickwick That reptile replied Pott What reptile said mister Pickwick looking about him for fear he should tread on some overgrown black beetle or dropsical spider That reptile whispered Pott catching mister Pickwick by the arm and pointing towards the stranger That reptile Slurk of the INDEPENDENT Perhaps we had better retire whispered mister Pickwick Never Sir rejoined Pott pot valiant in a double sense never With these words mister Pott took up his position on an opposite settle and selecting one from a little bundle of newspapers began to read against his enemy mister Pott of course read the INDEPENDENT and mister Slurk of course read the GAZETTE and each gentleman audibly expressed his contempt at the other s compositions by bitter laughs and sarcastic sniffs whence they proceeded to more open expressions of opinion such as absurd wretched atrocity humbug knavery dirt filth slime ditch water and other critical remarks of the like nature Both mister Bob Sawyer and mister Ben Allen had beheld these symptoms of rivalry and hatred with a degree of delight which imparted great additional relish to the cigars at which they were puffing most vigorously The moment they began to flag the mischievous mister Bob Sawyer addressing Slurk with great politeness said Will you allow me to look at your paper Sir when you have quite done with it You will find very little to repay you for your trouble in this contemptible THING sir replied Slurk bestowing a Satanic frown on Pott You shall have this presently said Pott looking up pale with rage and quivering in his speech from the same cause Ha ha you will be amused with this FELLOW S audacity Terrible emphasis was laid upon thing and fellow and the faces of both editors began to glow with defiance The ribaldry of this miserable man is despicably disgusting said Pott pretending to address Bob Sawyer and scowling upon Slurk Here mister Slurk laughed very heartily and folding up the paper so as to get at a fresh column conveniently said that the blockhead really amused him What an impudent blunderer this fellow is said Pott turning from pink to crimson Did you ever read any of this man s foolery Sir inquired Slurk of Bob Sawyer Never replied Bob is it very bad Oh shocking shocking rejoined Slurk Really Dear me this is too atrocious exclaimed Pott at this juncture still feigning to be absorbed in his reading If you can wade through a few sentences of malice meanness falsehood perjury treachery and cant said Slurk handing the paper to Bob you will perhaps be somewhat repaid by a laugh at the style of this ungrammatical twaddler What s that you said Sir inquired mister Pott looking up trembling all over with passion What s that to you sir replied Slurk Ungrammatical twaddler was it sir said Pott Yes sir it was replied Slurk and BLUE BORE Sir if you like that better ha ha mister Pott retorted not a word at this jocose insult but deliberately folded up his copy of the INDEPENDENT flattened it carefully down crushed it beneath his boot spat upon it with great ceremony and flung it into the fire There sir said Pott retreating from the stove and that s the way I would serve the viper who produces it if I were not fortunately for him restrained by the laws of my country Serve him so sir cried Slurk starting up Those laws shall never be appealed to by him sir in such a case Serve him so sir Hear hear said Bob Sawyer Nothing can be fairer observed mister Ben Allen Serve him so sir reiterated Slurk in a loud voice mister Pott darted a look of contempt which might have withered an anchor Serve him so sir reiterated Slurk in a louder voice than before I will not sir rejoined Pott Oh you won t won t you sir said mister Slurk in a taunting manner you hear this gentlemen He won t not that he s afraid oh no he WON T Ha ha I consider you sir said mister Pott moved by this sarcasm I consider you a viper I look upon you sir as a man who has placed himself beyond the pale of society by his most audacious disgraceful and abominable public conduct I view you sir personally and politically in no other light than as a most unparalleled and unmitigated viper The indignant Independent did not wait to hear the end of this personal denunciation for catching up his carpet bag which was well stuffed with movables he swung it in the air as Pott turned away and letting it fall with a circular sweep on his head just at that particular angle of the bag where a good thick hairbrush happened to be packed caused a sharp crash to be heard throughout the kitchen and brought him at once to the ground Gentlemen cried mister Pickwick as Pott started up and seized the fire shovel gentlemen Consider for Heaven s sake help Sam here pray gentlemen interfere somebody Uttering these incoherent exclamations mister Pickwick rushed between the infuriated combatants just in time to receive the carpet bag on one side of his body and the fire shovel on the other Whether the representatives of the public feeling of Eatanswill were blinded by animosity or being both acute reasoners saw the advantage of having a third party between them to bear all the blows certain it is that they paid not the slightest attention to mister Pickwick but defying each other with great spirit plied the carpet bag and the fire shovel most fearlessly mister Pickwick would unquestionably have suffered severely for his humane interference if mister Weller attracted by his master s cries had not rushed in at the moment and snatching up a meal sack effectually stopped the conflict by drawing it over the head and shoulders of the mighty Pott and clasping him tight round the shoulders Take away that ere bag from the t other madman said Sam to Ben Allen and Bob Sawyer who had done nothing but dodge round the group each with a tortoise shell lancet in his hand ready to bleed the first man stunned Give it up you wretched little creetur or I ll smother you in it Awed by these threats and quite out of breath the INDEPENDENT suffered himself to be disarmed and mister Weller removing the extinguisher from Pott set him free with a caution You take yourselves off to bed quietly said Sam or I ll put you both in it and let you fight it out vith the mouth tied as I vould a dozen sich if they played these games And you have the goodness to come this here way sir if you please Thus addressing his master Sam took him by the arm and led him off while the rival editors were severally removed to their beds by the landlord under the inspection of mister Bob Sawyer and mister Benjamin Allen breathing as they went away many sanguinary threats and making vague appointments for mortal combat next day When they came to think it over however it occurred to them that they could do it much better in print so they recommenced deadly hostilities without delay and all Eatanswill rung with their boldness on paper They had taken themselves off in separate coaches early next morning before the other travellers were stirring and the weather having now cleared up the chaise companions once more turned their faces to London CHAPTER LII INVOLVING A SERIOUS CHANGE IN THE WELLER FAMILY AND THE UNTIMELY DOWNFALL OF mister STIGGINS Considering it a matter of delicacy to abstain from introducing either Bob Sawyer or Ben Allen to the young couple until they were fully prepared to expect them and wishing to spare Arabella s feelings as much as possible mister Pickwick proposed that he and Sam should alight in the neighbourhood of the George and Vulture and that the two young men should for the present take up their quarters elsewhere To this they very readily agreed and the proposition was accordingly acted upon mister Ben Allen and mister Bob Sawyer betaking themselves to a sequestered pot shop on the remotest confines of the Borough behind the bar door of which their names had in other days very often appeared at the head of long and complex calculations worked in white chalk Dear me mister Weller said the pretty housemaid meeting Sam at the door Dear ME I vish it vos my dear replied Sam dropping behind to let his master get out of hearing Wot a sweet lookin creetur you are Mary Lot mister Weller what nonsense you do talk said Mary Oh don t mister Weller Don t what my dear said Sam Why that replied the pretty housemaid Lor do get along with you Thus admonishing him the pretty housemaid pushed Sam against the wall declaring that he had tumbled her cap and put her hair quite out of curl And prevented what I was going to say besides added Mary There s a letter been waiting here for you four days you hadn t gone away half an hour when it came and more than that it s got immediate on the outside Vere is it my love inquired Sam I took care of it for you or I dare say it would have been lost long before this replied Mary There take it it s more than you deserve With these words after many pretty little coquettish doubts and fears and wishes that she might not have lost it Mary produced the letter from behind the nicest little muslin tucker possible and handed it to Sam who thereupon kissed it with much gallantry and devotion My goodness me said Mary adjusting the tucker and feigning unconsciousness you seem to have grown very fond of it all at once To this mister Weller only replied by a wink the intense meaning of which no description could convey the faintest idea of and sitting himself down beside Mary on a window seat opened the letter and glanced at the contents Hollo exclaimed Sam wot s all this Nothing the matter I hope said Mary peeping over his shoulder Bless them eyes o yourn said Sam looking up Never mind my eyes you had much better read your letter said the pretty housemaid and as she said so she made the eyes twinkle with such slyness and beauty that they were perfectly irresistible Sam refreshed himself with a kiss and read as follows MARKIS GRAN By DORKEN Wensdy My DEAR SAMMLE I am werry sorry to have the pleasure of being a Bear of ill news your Mother in law cort cold consekens of imprudently settin too long on the damp grass in the rain a hearing of a shepherd who warnt able to leave off

here signater in print letters that s his Perhaps he got somebody to write it for him and signed it himself afterwards said the pretty housemaid Stop a minit replied Sam running over the letter again and pausing here and there to reflect as he did so You ve hit it The general l m n as wrote it wos a tellin all about the misfortun in a proper vay and then my father comes a lookin over him and complicates the whole concern by puttin his oar in That s just the wery sort o thing he d do You re right Mary my dear Having satisfied himself on this point Sam read the letter all over once more and appearing to form a clear notion of its contents for the first time ejaculated thoughtfully as he folded it up And so the poor creetur s dead I m sorry for it She warn t a bad disposed ooman if them shepherds had let her alone I m wery sorry for it mister Weller uttered these words in so serious a manner that the pretty housemaid cast down her eyes and looked very grave Hows ever said Sam putting the letter in his pocket with a gentle sigh it wos to be and wos as the old lady said arter she d married the footman Can t be helped now can it Mary Mary shook her head and sighed too I must apply to the hemperor for leave of absence said Sam Mary sighed again the letter was so very affecting Good bye said Sam Good bye rejoined the pretty housemaid turning her head away Well shake hands won t you said Sam The pretty housemaid put out a hand which although it was a housemaid s was a very small one and rose to go I shan t be wery long avay said Sam You re always away said Mary giving her head the slightest possible toss in the air You no sooner come mister Weller than you go again mister Weller drew the household beauty closer to him and entered upon a whispering conversation which had not proceeded far when she turned her face round and condescended to look at him again When they parted it was somehow or other indispensably necessary for her to go to her room and arrange the cap and curls before she could think of presenting herself to her mistress which preparatory ceremony she went off to perform bestowing many nods and smiles on Sam over the banisters as she tripped upstairs I shan t be avay more than a day or two Sir at the furthest said Sam when he had communicated to mister Pickwick the intelligence of his father s loss As long as may be necessary Sam replied mister Pickwick you have my full permission to remain Sam bowed You will tell your father Sam that if I can be of any assistance to him in his present situation I shall be most willing and ready to lend him any aid in my power said mister Pickwick Thank ee sir rejoined Sam I ll mention it sir And with some expressions of mutual good will and interest master and man separated It was just seven o clock when Samuel Weller alighting from the box of a stage coach which passed through Dorking stood within a few hundred yards of the Marquis of Granby It was a cold dull evening the little street looked dreary and dismal and the mahogany countenance of the noble and gallant marquis seemed to wear a more sad and melancholy expression than it was wont to do as it swung to and fro creaking mournfully in the wind The blinds were pulled down and the shutters partly closed of the knot of loungers that usually collected about the door not one was to be seen the place was silent and desolate Seeing nobody of whom he could ask any preliminary questions Sam walked softly in and glancing round he quickly recognised his parent in the distance The widower was seated at a small round table in the little room behind the bar smoking a pipe with his eyes intently fixed upon the fire The funeral had evidently taken place that day for attached to his hat which he still retained on his head was a hatband measuring about a yard and a half in length which hung over the top rail of the chair and streamed negligently down mister Weller was in a very abstracted and contemplative mood Notwithstanding that Sam called him by name several times he still continued to smoke with the same fixed and quiet countenance and was only roused ultimately by his son s placing the palm of his hand on his shoulder Sammy said mister Weller you re welcome I ve been a callin to you half a dozen times said Sam hanging his hat on a peg but you didn t hear me No Sammy replied mister Weller again looking thoughtfully at the fire I was in a referee Sammy Wot about inquired Sam drawing his chair up to the fire In a referee Sammy replied the elder mister Weller regarding HER Samivel Here mister Weller jerked his head in the direction of Dorking churchyard in mute explanation that his words referred to the late missus Weller I wos a thinkin Sammy said mister Weller eyeing his son with great earnestness over his pipe as if to assure him that however extraordinary and incredible the declaration might appear it was nevertheless calmly and deliberately uttered I wos a thinkin Sammy that upon the whole I wos wery sorry she wos gone Vell and so you ought to be replied Sam mister Weller nodded his acquiescence in the sentiment and again fastening his eyes on the fire shrouded himself in a cloud and mused deeply Those wos wery sensible observations as she made Sammy said mister Weller driving the smoke away with his hand after a long silence Wot observations inquired Sam Them as she made arter she was took ill replied the old gentleman Wot was they Somethin to this here effect Veller she says I m afeered I ve not done by you quite wot I ought to have done you re a wery kind hearted man and I might ha made your home more comfortabler I begin to see now she says ven it s too late that if a married ooman vishes to be religious she should begin vith dischargin her dooties at home and makin them as is about her cheerful and happy and that vile she goes to church or chapel or wot not at all proper times she should be wery careful not to con wert this sort o thing into a excuse for idleness or self indulgence I have done this she says and I ve vasted time and substance on them as has done it more than me but I hope ven I m gone Veller that you ll think on me as I wos afore I know d them people and as I raly wos by natur Susan says I I wos took up wery short by this Samivel I von t deny it my boy Susan I says you ve been a wery good vife to me altogether don t say nothin at all about it keep a good heart my dear and you ll live to see me punch that ere Stiggins s head yet She smiled at this Samivel said the old gentleman stifling a sigh with his pipe but she died arter all Vell said Sam venturing to offer a little homely consolation after the lapse of three or four minutes consumed by the old gentleman in slowly shaking his head from side to side and solemnly smoking vell gov nor ve must all come to it one day or another So we must Sammy said mister Weller the elder There s a Providence in it all said Sam O course there is replied his father with a nod of grave approval Wot ud become of the undertakers vithout it Sammy Lost in the immense field of conjecture opened by this reflection the elder mister Weller laid his pipe on the table and stirred the fire with a meditative visage While the old gentleman was thus engaged a very buxom looking cook dressed in mourning who had been bustling about in the bar glided into the room and bestowing many smirks of recognition upon Sam silently stationed herself at the back of his father s chair and announced her presence by a slight cough the which being disregarded was followed by a louder one Hollo said the elder mister Weller dropping the poker as he looked round and hastily drew his chair away Wot s the matter now Have a cup of tea there s a good soul replied the buxom female coaxingly I von t replied mister Weller in a somewhat boisterous manner I ll see you mister Weller hastily checked himself and added in a low tone furder fust Oh dear dear How adwersity does change people said the lady looking upwards It s the only thing twixt this and the doctor as shall change my condition muttered mister Weller I really never saw a man so cross said the buxom female Never mind It s all for my own good vich is the reflection vith vich the penitent school boy comforted his feelin s ven they flogged him rejoined the old gentleman The buxom female shook her head with a compassionate and sympathising air and appealing to Sam inquired whether his father really ought not to make an effort to keep up and not give way to that lowness of spirits You see mister Samuel said the buxom female as I was telling him yesterday he will feel lonely he can t expect but what he should sir but he should keep up a good heart because dear me I m sure we all pity his loss and are ready to do anything for him and there s no situation in life so bad mister Samuel that it can t be mended Which is what a very worthy person said to me when my husband died Here the speaker putting her hand before her mouth coughed again and looked affectionately at the elder mister Weller As I don t rekvire any o your conversation just now mum vill you have the goodness to re tire inquired mister Weller in a grave and steady voice Well mister Weller said the buxom female I m sure I only spoke to you out of kindness Wery likely mum replied mister Weller Samivel show the lady out and shut the door after her This hint was not lost upon the buxom female for she at once left the room and slammed the door behind her upon which mister Weller senior falling back in his chair in a violent perspiration said Sammy if I wos to stop here alone vun week only vun week my boy that ere ooman ud marry me by force and wiolence afore it was over Wot is she so wery fond on you inquired Sam Fond replied his father I can t keep her avay from me If I was locked up in a fireproof chest vith a patent Brahmin she d find means to get at me Sammy Wot a thing it is to be so sought arter observed Sam smiling I don t take no pride out on it Sammy replied mister Weller poking the fire vehemently it s a horrid sitiwation I m actiwally drove out o house and home by it The breath was scarcely out o your poor mother in law s body ven vun old ooman sends me a pot o jam and another a pot o jelly and another brews a blessed large jug o camomile tea vich she brings in vith her own hands mister Weller paused with an aspect of intense disgust and looking round added in a whisper They wos all widders Sammy all on em cept the camomile tea vun as wos a single young lady o fifty three Sam gave a comical look in reply and the old gentleman having broken an obstinate lump of coal with a countenance expressive of as much earnestness and malice as if it had been the head of one of the widows last mentioned said In short Sammy I feel that I ain t safe anyveres but on the box How are you safer there than anyveres else interrupted Sam Cos a coachman s a privileged indiwidual replied mister Weller looking fixedly at his son Cos a coachman may do vithout suspicion wot other men may not cos a coachman may be on the wery amicablest terms with eighty mile o females and yet nobody think that he ever means to marry any vun among em And wot other man can say the same Sammy Vell there s somethin in that said Sam If your gov nor had been a coachman reasoned mister Weller do you s pose as that ere jury ud ever ha conwicted him s posin it possible as the matter could ha gone to that extremity They dustn t ha done it Wy not said Sam rather disparagingly Wy not rejoined mister Weller cos it ud ha gone agin their consciences A reg lar coachman s a sort o con nectin link betwixt singleness and matrimony and every practicable man knows it Wot You mean they re general ral favorites and nobody takes adwantage on em p raps said Sam His father nodded How it ever come to that ere pass resumed the parent Weller I can t say Wy it is that long stage coachmen possess such insiniwations and is alvays looked up to a dored I may say by ev ry young ooman in ev ry town he vurks through I don t know I only know that so it is It s a regulation of natur a dispensary as your poor mother in law used to say A dispensation said Sam correcting the old gentleman Wery good Samivel a dispensation if you like it better returned mister Weller I call it a dispensary and it s always writ up so at the places vere they gives you physic for nothin in your own bottles that s all With these words mister Weller refilled and relighted his pipe and once more summoning up a meditative expression of countenance continued as follows Therefore my boy as I do not see the adwisability o stoppin here to be married vether I vant to or not and as at the same time I do not vish to separate myself from them interestin members o society altogether I have come to the determination o driving the Safety and puttin up vunce more at the Bell Savage vich is my nat ral born element Sammy And wot s to become o the bis ness inquired Sam The bis ness Samivel replied the old gentleman good vill stock and fixters vill be sold by private contract and out o the money two hundred pound agreeable to a rekvest o your mother in law s to me a little afore she died vill be invested in your name in What do you call them things agin Wot things inquired Sam Them things as is always a goin up and down in the city Omnibuses suggested Sam Nonsense replied mister Weller Them things as is alvays a fluctooatin and gettin theirselves inwolved somehow or another vith the national debt and the chequers bill and all that Oh the funds said Sam Ah rejoined mister Weller the funs two hundred pounds o the money is to be inwested for you Samivel in the funs four and a half per cent reduced counsels Sammy Wery kind o the old lady to think o me said Sam and I m wery much obliged to her The rest will be inwested in my name continued the elder mister Weller and wen I m took off the road it ll come to you so take care you don t spend it all at vunst my boy and mind that no widder gets a inklin o your fortun or you re done Having delivered this warning mister Weller resumed his pipe with a more serene countenance the disclosure of these matters appearing to have eased his mind considerably Somebody s a tappin at the door said Sam Let em tap replied his father with dignity Sam acted upon the direction There was another tap and another and then a long row of taps upon which Sam inquired why the tapper was not admitted Hush whispered mister Weller with apprehensive looks don t take no notice on em Sammy it s vun o the widders p raps No notice being taken of the taps the unseen visitor after a short lapse ventured to open the door and peep in It was no female head that was thrust in at the partially opened door but the long black locks and red face of mister Stiggins mister Weller s pipe fell from his hands The reverend gentleman gradually opened the door by almost imperceptible degrees until the aperture was just wide enough to admit of the passage of his lank body when he glided into the room and closed it after him with great care and gentleness Turning towards Sam and raising his hands and eyes in token of the unspeakable sorrow with which he regarded the calamity that had befallen the family he carried the high backed chair to his old corner by the fire and seating himself on the very edge drew forth a brown pocket handkerchief and applied the same to his optics While this was going forward the elder mister Weller sat back in his chair with his eyes wide open his hands planted on his knees and his whole countenance expressive of absorbing and overwhelming astonishment Sam sat opposite him in perfect silence waiting with eager curiosity for the termination of the scene mister Stiggins kept the brown pocket handkerchief before his eyes for some minutes moaning decently meanwhile and then mastering his feelings by a strong effort put it in his pocket and buttoned it up After this he stirred the fire after that he rubbed his hands and looked at Sam Oh my young friend said mister Stiggins breaking the silence in a very low voice here s a sorrowful affliction Sam nodded very slightly For the man of wrath too added mister Stiggins it makes a vessel s heart bleed mister Weller was overheard by his son to murmur something relative to making a vessel s nose bleed but mister Stiggins heard him not Do you know young man whispered mister Stiggins drawing his chair closer to Sam whether she has left Emanuel anything Who s he inquired Sam The chapel replied mister Stiggins our chapel our fold mister Samuel She hasn t left the fold nothin nor the shepherd nothin nor the animals nothin said Sam decisively nor the dogs neither mister Stiggins looked slily at Sam glanced at the old gentleman who was sitting with his eyes closed as if asleep and drawing his chair still nearer said Nothing for ME mister Samuel Sam shook his head I think there s something said Stiggins turning as pale as he could turn Consider mister Samuel no little token Not so much as the vorth o that ere old umberella o yourn replied Sam Perhaps said mister Stiggins hesitatingly after a few moments deep thought perhaps she recommended me to the care of the man of wrath mister Samuel I think that s wery likely from what he said rejoined Sam he wos a speakin about you jist now Was he though exclaimed Stiggins brightening up Ah He s changed I dare say We might live very comfortably together now mister Samuel eh I could take care of his property when you are away good care you see Heaving a long drawn sigh mister Stiggins paused for a response Sam nodded and mister Weller the elder gave vent to an extraordinary sound which being neither a groan nor a grunt nor a gasp nor a growl seemed to partake in some degree of the character of all four mister Stiggins encouraged by this sound which he understood to betoken remorse or repentance looked about him rubbed his hands wept smiled wept again and then walking softly across the room to a well remembered shelf in one corner took down a tumbler and with great deliberation put four lumps of sugar in it Having got thus far he looked about him again and sighed grievously with that he walked softly into the bar and presently returning with the tumbler half full of pine apple rum advanced to the kettle which was singing gaily on the hob mixed his grog stirred it sipped it sat down and taking a long and hearty pull at the rum and water stopped for breath The elder mister Weller who still continued to make various strange and uncouth attempts to appear asleep offered not a single word during these proceedings but when Stiggins stopped for breath he darted upon him and snatching the tumbler from his hand threw the remainder of the rum and water in his face and the glass itself into the grate Then seizing the reverend gentleman firmly by the collar he suddenly fell to kicking him most furiously accompanying every application of his top boot to mister Stiggins s person with sundry violent and incoherent anathemas upon his limbs eyes and body Sammy said mister Weller put my hat on tight for me Sam dutifully adjusted the hat with the long hatband more firmly on his father s head and the old gentleman resuming his kicking with greater agility than before tumbled with mister Stiggins through the bar and through the passage out at the front door and so into the street the kicking continuing the whole way and increasing in vehemence rather than diminishing every time the top boot was lifted It was a beautiful and exhilarating sight to see the red nosed man writhing in mister Weller s grasp and his whole frame quivering with anguish as kick followed kick in rapid succession it was a still more exciting spectacle to behold mister Weller after a powerful struggle immersing mister Stiggins s head in a horse trough full of water and holding it there until he was half suffocated There said mister Weller throwing all his energy into one most complicated kick as he at length permitted mister Stiggins to withdraw his head from the trough send any vun o them lazy shepherds here and I ll pound him to a jelly first and drownd him artervards Sammy help me in and fill me a small glass of brandy I m out o breath my boy CHAPTER LIII COMPRISING THE FINAL EXIT OF mister JINGLE AND JOB TROTTER WITH A GREAT MORNING OF BUSINESS IN GRAY S INN SQUARE CONCLUDING WITH A DOUBLE KNOCK AT mister PERKER S DOOR When Arabella after some gentle preparation and many assurances that there was not the least occasion for being low spirited was at length made acquainted by mister Pickwick with the unsatisfactory result of his visit to Birmingham she burst into tears and sobbing aloud lamented in moving terms that she should have been the unhappy cause of any estrangement between a father and his son My dear girl said mister Pickwick kindly it is no fault of yours It was impossible to foresee that the old gentleman would be so strongly prepossessed against his son s marriage you know I am sure added mister Pickwick glancing at her pretty face he can have very little idea of the pleasure he denies himself Oh my dear mister Pickwick said Arabella what shall we do if he continues to be angry with us Why wait patiently my dear until he thinks better of it replied mister Pickwick cheerfully But dear mister Pickwick what is to become of Nathaniel if his father withdraws his assistance urged Arabella In that case my love rejoined mister Pickwick I will venture to prophesy that he will find some other friend who will not be backward in helping him to start in the world The significance of this reply was not so well disguised by mister Pickwick but that Arabella understood it So throwing her arms round his neck and kissing him affectionately she sobbed louder than before Come come said mister Pickwick taking her hand we will wait here a few days longer and see whether he writes or takes any other notice of your husband s communication If not I have thought of half a dozen plans any one of which would make you happy at once There my dear there With these words mister Pickwick gently pressed Arabella s hand and bade her dry her eyes and not distress her husband Upon which Arabella who was one of the best little creatures alive put her handkerchief in her reticule and by the time mister Winkle joined them exhibited in full lustre the same beaming smiles and sparkling eyes that had originally captivated him This is a distressing predicament for these young people thought mister Pickwick as he dressed himself next morning I ll walk up to Perker s and consult him about the matter As mister Pickwick was further prompted to betake himself to Gray s Inn Square by an anxious desire to come to a pecuniary settlement with the kind hearted little attorney without further delay he made a hurried breakfast and executed his intention so speedily that ten o clock had not struck when he reached Gray s Inn It still wanted ten minutes to the hour when he had ascended the staircase on which Perker s chambers were The clerks had not arrived yet and he beguiled the time by looking out of the staircase window The healthy light of a fine October morning made even the dingy old houses brighten up a little some of the dusty windows actually looking almost cheerful as the sun s rays gleamed upon them Clerk after clerk hastened into the square by one or other of the entrances and looking up at the Hall clock accelerated or decreased his rate of walking according to the time at which his office hours nominally commenced the half past nine o clock people suddenly becoming very brisk and the ten o clock gentlemen falling into a pace of most aristocratic slowness The clock struck ten and clerks poured in faster than ever each one in a greater perspiration than his predecessor The noise of unlocking and opening doors echoed and re echoed on every side heads appeared as if by magic in every window the porters took up their stations for the day the slipshod laundresses hurried off the postman ran from house to house and the whole legal hive was in a bustle You re early mister Pickwick said a voice behind him Ah mister Lowten replied that gentleman looking round and recognising his old acquaintance Precious warm walking isn t it said Lowten drawing a Bramah key from his pocket with a small plug therein to keep the dust out You appear to feel it so rejoined mister Pickwick smiling at the clerk who was literally red hot I ve come along rather I can tell you replied Lowten It went the half hour as I came through the Polygon I m here before him though so I don t mind Comforting himself with this reflection mister Lowten extracted the plug from the door key having opened the door replugged and repocketed his Bramah and picked up the letters which the postman had dropped through the box he ushered mister Pickwick into the office Here in the twinkling of an eye he divested himself of his coat put on a threadbare garment which he took out of a desk hung up his hat pulled forth a few sheets of cartridge and blotting paper in alternate layers and sticking a pen behind his ear rubbed his hands with an air of great satisfaction There you see mister Pickwick he said now I m complete I ve got my office coat on and my pad out and let him come as soon as he likes You haven t got a pinch of snuff about you have you No I have not replied mister Pickwick I m sorry for it said Lowten Never mind I ll run out presently and get a bottle of soda Don t I look rather queer about the eyes mister Pickwick The individual appealed to surveyed mister Lowten s eyes from a distance and expressed his opinion that no unusual queerness was perceptible in those features I m glad of it said Lowten We were keeping it up pretty tolerably at the Stump last night and I m rather out of sorts this morning Perker s been about that business of yours by the bye What business inquired mister Pickwick missus Bardell s costs No I don t mean that replied mister Lowten About getting that customer that we paid the ten shillings in the pound to the bill discounter for on your account to get him out of the Fleet you know about getting him to Demerara Oh mister Jingle said mister Pickwick hastily Yes Well Well it s all arranged said Lowten mending his pen The agent at Liverpool said he had been obliged to you many times when you were in business and he would be glad to take him on your recommendation That s well said mister Pickwick I am delighted to hear it But I say resumed Lowten scraping the back of the pen preparatory to making a fresh split what a soft chap that other is Which other Why that servant or friend or whatever he is you know Trotter Ah said mister Pickwick with a smile I always thought him the reverse Well and so did I from what little I saw of him replied Lowten it only shows how one may be deceived What do you think of his going to Demerara too What And giving up what was offered him here exclaimed mister Pickwick Treating Perker s offer of eighteen bob a week and a rise if he behaved himself like dirt replied Lowten He said he must go along with the other one and so they persuaded Perker to write again and they ve got him something on the same estate not near so good Perker says as a convict would get in New South Wales if he appeared at his trial in a new suit of clothes Foolish fellow said mister Pickwick with glistening eyes Foolish fellow Oh it s worse than foolish it s downright sneaking you know replied Lowten nibbing the pen with a contemptuous face He says that he s the only friend he ever had and he s attached to him and all that Friendship s a very good thing in its way we are all very friendly and comfortable at the Stump for instance over our grog where every man pays for himself but damn hurting yourself for anybody else you know No man should have more than two attachments the first to number one and the second to the ladies that s what I say ha ha mister Lowten concluded with a loud laugh half in jocularity and half in derision which was prematurely cut short by the sound of Perker s footsteps on the stairs at the first approach of which he vaulted on his stool with an agility most remarkable and wrote intensely The greeting between mister Pickwick and his professional adviser was warm and cordial the client was scarcely ensconced in the attorney s arm chair however when a knock was heard at the door and a voice inquired whether mister Perker was within Hark said Perker that s one of our vagabond friends Jingle himself my dear Sir Will you see him What do you think inquired mister Pickwick hesitating Yes I think you had better Here you Sir what s your name walk in will you In compliance with this unceremonious invitation Jingle and Job walked into the room but seeing mister Pickwick stopped short in some confusion Well said Perker don t you know that gentleman Good reason to replied mister Jingle stepping forward mister Pickwick deepest obligations life preserver made a man of me you shall never repent it Sir I am happy to hear you say so said mister Pickwick You look much better Thanks to you sir great change Majesty s Fleet unwholesome place very said Jingle shaking his head He was decently and cleanly dressed and so was Job who stood bolt upright behind him staring at mister Pickwick with a visage of iron When do they go to Liverpool inquired mister Pickwick half aside to Perker This evening Sir at seven o clock said Job taking one step forward By the heavy coach from the city Sir Are your places taken They are sir replied Job You have fully made up your mind to go I have sir answered Job With regard to such an outfit as was indispensable for Jingle said Perker addressing mister Pickwick aloud I have taken upon myself to make an arrangement for the deduction of a small sum from his quarterly salary which being made only for one year and regularly remitted will provide for that expense I entirely disapprove of your doing anything for him my dear sir which is not dependent on his own exertions and good conduct Certainly interposed Jingle with great firmness Clear head man of the world quite right perfectly By compounding with his creditor releasing his clothes from the pawnbroker s relieving him in prison and paying for his passage continued Perker without noticing Jingle s observation you have already lost upwards of fifty pounds Not lost said Jingle hastily Pay it all stick to business cash up every farthing Yellow fever perhaps can t help that if not Here mister Jingle paused and striking the crown of his hat with great violence passed his hand over his eyes and sat down He means to say said Job advancing a few paces that if he is not carried off by the fever he will pay the money back again If he lives he will mister Pickwick I will see it done I know he will Sir said Job with energy I could undertake to swear it Well well said mister Pickwick who had been bestowing a score or two of frowns upon Perker to stop his summary of benefits conferred which the little attorney obstinately disregarded you must be careful not to play any more desperate cricket matches mister Jingle or to renew your acquaintance with Sir Thomas Blazo and I have little doubt of your preserving your health mister Jingle smiled at this sally but looked rather foolish notwithstanding so mister Pickwick changed the subject by saying You don t happen to know do you what has become of another friend of yours a more humble one whom I saw at Rochester Dismal Jemmy inquired Jingle Yes Jingle shook his head Clever rascal queer fellow hoaxing genius Job s brother Job s brother exclaimed mister Pickwick Well now I look at him closely there IS a likeness We were always considered like each other Sir said Job with a cunning look just lurking in the corners of his eyes only I was really of a serious nature and he never was He emigrated to America Sir in consequence of being too much sought after here to be comfortable and has never been heard of since That accounts for my not having received the page from the romance of real life which he promised me one morning when he appeared to be contemplating suicide on Rochester Bridge I suppose said mister Pickwick smiling I need not inquire whether his dismal behaviour was natural or assumed He could assume anything Sir said Job You may consider yourself very fortunate in having escaped him so easily On intimate terms he would have been even a more dangerous acquaintance than Job looked at Jingle hesitated and finally added than than myself even A hopeful family yours mister Trotter said Perker sealing a letter which he had just finished writing Yes Sir replied Job Very much so Well said the little man laughing I hope you are going to disgrace it Deliver this letter to the agent when you reach Liverpool and let me advise you gentlemen not to be too knowing in the West Indies If you throw away this chance you will both richly deserve to be hanged as I sincerely trust you will be And now you had better leave mister Pickwick and me alone for we have other matters to talk over and time is precious As Perker said this he looked towards the door with an evident desire to render the leave taking as brief as possible It was brief enough on mister Jingle s part He thanked the little attorney in a few hurried words for the kindness and promptitude with which he had rendered his assistance and turning to his benefactor stood for a few seconds as if irresolute what to say or how to act Job Trotter relieved his perplexity for with a humble and grateful bow to mister Pickwick he took his friend gently by the arm and led him away A worthy couple said Perker as the door closed behind them I hope they may become so replied mister Pickwick What do you think Is there any chance of their permanent reformation Perker shrugged his shoulders doubtfully but observing mister Pickwick s anxious and disappointed look rejoined Of course there is a chance I hope it may prove a good one They are unquestionably penitent now but then you know they have the recollection of very recent suffering fresh upon them What they may become when that fades away is a problem that neither you nor I can solve However my dear Sir added Perker laying his hand on mister Pickwick s shoulder your object is equally honourable whatever the result is Whether that species of benevolence which is so very cautious and long sighted that it is seldom exercised at all lest its owner should be imposed upon and so wounded in his self love be real charity or a worldly counterfeit I leave to wiser heads than mine to determine But if those two fellows were to commit a burglary to morrow my opinion of this action would be equally high With these remarks which were delivered in a much more animated and earnest manner than is usual in legal gentlemen Perker drew his chair to his desk and listened to mister Pickwick s recital of old mister Winkle s obstinacy Give him a week said Perker nodding his head prophetically Do you think he will come round inquired mister Pickwick I think he will rejoined Perker If not we must try the young lady s persuasion and that is what anybody but you would have done at first mister Perker was taking a pinch of snuff with various grotesque contractions of countenance eulogistic of the persuasive powers appertaining unto young ladies when the murmur of inquiry and answer was heard in the outer office and Lowten tapped at the door Come in cried the little man The clerk came in and shut the door after him with great mystery What s the matter inquired Perker You re wanted Sir Who wants me Lowten looked at mister Pickwick and coughed Who wants me Can t you speak mister Lowten Why sir replied Lowten it s Dodson and Fogg is with him Bless my life said the little man looking at his watch I appointed them to be here at half past eleven to settle that matter of yours Pickwick I gave them an undertaking on which they sent down your discharge it s very awkward my dear Sir what will you do Would you like to step into the next room The next room being the identical room in which Messrs Dodson Fogg were mister Pickwick replied that he would remain where he was the more especially as Messrs Dodson Fogg ought to be ashamed to look him in the face instead of his being ashamed to see them Which latter circumstance he begged mister Perker to note with a glowing countenance and many marks of indignation Very well my dear Sir very well replied Perker I can only say that if you expect either Dodson or Fogg to exhibit any symptom of shame or confusion at having to look you or anybody else in the face you are the most sanguine man in your expectations that I ever met with Show them in mister Lowten mister Lowten disappeared with a grin and immediately returned ushering in the firm in due form of precedence Dodson first and Fogg afterwards You have seen mister Pickwick I believe said Perker to Dodson inclining his pen in the direction where that gentleman was seated How do you do mister Pickwick said Dodson in a loud voice Dear me cried Fogg how do you do mister Pickwick I hope you are well Sir I thought I knew the face said Fogg drawing up a chair and looking round him with a smile mister Pickwick bent his head very slightly in answer to these salutations and seeing Fogg pull a bundle of papers from his coat pocket rose and walked to the window There s no occasion for mister Pickwick to move mister Perker said Fogg untying the red tape which encircled the little bundle and smiling again more sweetly than before mister Pickwick is pretty well acquainted with these proceedings There are no secrets between us I think He he he Not many I think said Dodson Ha ha ha Then both the partners laughed together pleasantly and cheerfully as men who are going to receive money often do We shall make mister Pickwick pay for peeping said Fogg with considerable native humour as he unfolded his papers The amount of the taxed costs is one hundred and thirty three six four mister Perker There was a great comparing of papers and turning over of leaves by Fogg and Perker after this statement of profit and loss Meanwhile Dodson said in an affable manner to mister Pickwick I don t think you are looking quite so stout as when I had the pleasure of seeing you last mister Pickwick Possibly not Sir replied mister Pickwick who had been flashing forth looks of fierce indignation without producing the smallest effect on either of the sharp practitioners I believe I am not Sir I have been persecuted and annoyed by scoundrels of late Sir Perker coughed violently and asked mister Pickwick whether he wouldn t like to look at the morning paper To which inquiry mister Pickwick returned a most decided negative True said Dodson I dare say you have been annoyed in the Fleet there are some odd gentry there Whereabouts were your apartments mister Pickwick My one room replied that much injured gentleman was on the coffee room flight Oh indeed said Dodson I believe that is a very pleasant part of the establishment Very replied mister Pickwick drily There was a coolness about all this which to a gentleman of an excitable temperament had under the circumstances rather an exasperating tendency mister Pickwick restrained his wrath by gigantic efforts but when Perker wrote a cheque for the whole amount and Fogg deposited it in a small pocket book with a triumphant smile playing over his pimply features which communicated itself likewise to the stern countenance of Dodson he felt the blood in his cheeks tingling with indignation Now mister Dodson said Fogg putting up the pocket book and drawing on his gloves I am at your service Very good said Dodson rising I am quite ready I am very happy said Fogg softened by the cheque to have had the pleasure of making mister Pickwick s acquaintance I hope you don t think quite so ill of us mister Pickwick as when we first had the pleasure of seeing you I hope not said Dodson with the high tone of calumniated virtue mister Pickwick now knows us better I trust whatever your opinion of gentlemen of our profession may be I beg to assure you sir that I bear no ill will or vindictive feeling towards you for the sentiments you thought proper to express in our office in Freeman s Court Cornhill on the occasion to which my partner has referred Oh no no nor I said Fogg in a most forgiving manner Our conduct Sir said Dodson will speak for itself and justify itself I hope upon every occasion We have been in the profession some years mister Pickwick and have been honoured with the confidence of many excellent clients I wish you good morning Sir Good morning mister Pickwick said Fogg So saying he put his umbrella under his arm drew off his right glove and extended the hand of reconciliation to that most indignant gentleman who thereupon thrust his hands beneath his coat tails and eyed the attorney with looks of scornful amazement Lowten cried Perker at this moment Open the door Wait one instant said mister Pickwick Perker I WILL speak My dear Sir pray let the matter rest where it is said the little attorney who had been in a state of nervous apprehension during the whole interview mister Pickwick I beg I will not be put down Sir replied mister Pickwick hastily mister Dodson you have addressed some remarks to me Dodson turned round bent his head meekly and smiled Some remarks to me repeated mister Pickwick almost breathless and your partner has tendered me his hand and you have both assumed a tone of forgiveness and high mindedness which is an extent of impudence that I was not prepared for even in you What sir exclaimed Dodson What sir reiterated Fogg Do you know that I have been the victim of your plots and conspiracies continued mister Pickwick Do you know that I am the man whom you have been imprisoning and robbing Do you know that you were the attorneys for the plaintiff in Bardell and Pickwick Yes sir we do know it replied Dodson Of course we know it Sir rejoined Fogg slapping his pocket perhaps by accident I see that you recollect it with satisfaction said mister Pickwick attempting to call up a sneer for the first time in his life and failing most signally in so doing Although I have long been anxious to tell you in plain terms what my opinion of you is I should have let even this opportunity pass in deference to my friend Perker s wishes but for the unwarrantable tone you have assumed and your insolent familiarity I say insolent familiarity sir said mister Pickwick turning upon Fogg with a fierceness of gesture which caused that person to retreat towards the door with great expedition Take care Sir said Dodson who though he was the biggest man of the party had prudently entrenched himself behind Fogg and was speaking over his head with a very pale face Let him assault you mister Fogg don t return it on any account No no I won t return it said Fogg falling back a little more as he spoke to the evident relief of his partner who by these means was gradually getting into the outer office You are continued mister Pickwick resuming the thread of his discourse you are a well matched pair of mean rascally pettifogging robbers Well interposed Perker is that all It is all summed up in that rejoined mister Pickwick they are mean rascally pettifogging robbers There said Perker in a most conciliatory tone My dear sirs he has said all he has to say Now pray go Lowten is that door open mister Lowten with a distant giggle replied in the affirmative There there good morning good morning now pray my dear sirs mister Lowten the door cried the little man pushing Dodson Fogg nothing loath out of the office this way my dear sirs now pray don t prolong this Dear me mister Lowten the door sir why don t you attend If there s law in England sir said Dodson looking towards mister Pickwick as he put on his hat you shall smart for this You are a couple of mean Remember sir you pay dearly for this said Fogg Rascally pettifogging robbers continued mister Pickwick taking not the least notice of the threats that were addressed to him Robbers cried mister Pickwick running to the stair head as the two attorneys descended Robbers shouted mister Pickwick breaking from Lowten and Perker and thrusting his head out of the staircase window When mister Pickwick drew in his head again his countenance was smiling and placid and walking quietly back into the office he declared that he had now removed a great weight from his mind and that he felt perfectly comfortable and happy Perker said nothing at all until he had emptied his snuff box and sent Lowten out to fill it when he was seized with a fit of laughing which lasted five minutes at the expiration of which time he said that he supposed he ought to be very angry but he couldn t think of the business seriously yet when he could he would be Well now said mister Pickwick let me have a settlement with you Of the same kind as the last inquired Perker with another laugh Not exactly rejoined mister Pickwick drawing out his pocket book and shaking the little man heartily by the hand I only mean a pecuniary settlement You have done me many acts of kindness that I can never repay and have no wish to repay for I prefer continuing the obligation With this preface the two friends dived into some very complicated accounts and vouchers which having been duly displayed and gone through by Perker were at once discharged by mister Pickwick with many professions of esteem and friendship They had no sooner arrived at this point than a most violent and startling knocking was heard at the door it was not an ordinary double knock but a constant and uninterrupted succession of the loudest single raps as if the knocker were endowed with the perpetual motion or the person outside had forgotten to leave off Dear me what s that exclaimed Perker starting I think it is a knock at the door said mister Pickwick as if there could be the smallest doubt of the fact The knocker made a more energetic reply than words could have yielded for it continued to hammer with surprising force and noise without a moment s cessation Dear me said Perker ringing his bell we shall alarm the inn mister Lowten don t you hear a knock I ll answer the door in one moment Sir replied the clerk The knocker appeared to hear the response and to assert that it was quite impossible he could wait so long It made a stupendous uproar It s quite dreadful said mister Pickwick stopping his ears Make haste mister Lowten Perker called out we shall have the panels beaten in mister Lowten who was washing his hands in a dark closet hurried to the door and turning the handle beheld the appearance which is described in the next chapter CHAPTER LIV CONTAINING SOME PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO THE DOUBLE KNOCK AND OTHER MATTERS AMONG WHICH CERTAIN INTERESTING DISCLOSURES RELATIVE TO mister SNODGRASS AND A YOUNG LADY ARE BY NO MEANS IRRELEVANT TO THIS HISTORY The object that presented itself to the eyes of the astonished clerk was a boy a wonderfully fat boy habited as a serving lad standing upright on the mat with his eyes closed as if in sleep He had never seen such a fat boy in or out of a travelling caravan and this coupled with the calmness and repose of his appearance so very different from what was reasonably to have been expected of the inflicter of such knocks smote him with wonder What s the matter inquired the clerk The extraordinary boy replied not a word but he nodded once and seemed to the clerk s imagination to snore feebly Where do you come from inquired the clerk The boy made no sign He breathed heavily but in all other respects was motionless The clerk repeated the question thrice and receiving no answer prepared to shut the door when the boy suddenly opened his eyes winked several times sneezed once and raised his hand as if to repeat the knocking Finding the door open he stared about him with astonishment and at length fixed his eyes on mister Lowten s face What the devil do you knock in that way for inquired the clerk angrily Which way said the boy in a slow and sleepy voice Why like forty hackney coachmen replied the clerk Because master said I wasn t to leave off knocking till they opened the door for fear I should go to sleep said the boy Well said the clerk what message have you brought He s downstairs rejoined the boy Who Master He wants to know whether you re at home mister Lowten bethought himself at this juncture of looking out of the window Seeing an open carriage with a hearty old gentleman in it looking up very anxiously he ventured to beckon him on which the old gentleman jumped out directly That s your master in the carriage I suppose said Lowten The boy nodded All further inquiries were superseded by the appearance of old Wardle who running upstairs and just recognising Lowten passed at once into mister Perker s room Pickwick said the old gentleman Your hand my boy Why have I never heard until the day before yesterday of your suffering yourself to be cooped up in jail And why did you let him do it Perker I couldn t help it my dear Sir replied Perker with a smile and a pinch of snuff you know how obstinate he is Of course I do of course I do replied the old gentleman I am heartily glad to see him notwithstanding I will not lose sight of him again in a hurry With these words Wardle shook mister Pickwick s hand once more and having done the same by Perker threw himself into an arm chair his jolly red face shining again with smiles and health Well said Wardle Here are pretty goings on a pinch of your snuff Perker my boy never were such times eh What do you mean inquired mister Pickwick Mean replied Wardle Why I think the girls are all running mad that s no news you ll say Perhaps it s not but it s true for all that You have not come up to London of all places in the world to tell us that my dear Sir have you inquired Perker No not altogether replied Wardle though it was the main cause of my coming How s Arabella Very well replied mister Pickwick and will be delighted to see you I am sure Black eyed little jilt replied Wardle I had a great idea of marrying her myself one of these odd days But I am glad of it too very glad How did the intelligence reach you asked mister Pickwick Oh it came to my girls of course replied Wardle Arabella wrote the day before yesterday to say she had made a stolen match without her husband s father s consent and so you had gone down to get it when his refusing it couldn t prevent the match and all the rest of it I thought it a very good time to say something serious to my girls so I said what a dreadful thing it was that children should marry without their parents consent and so forth but bless your hearts I couldn t make the least impression upon them They thought it such a much more dreadful thing that there should have been a wedding without bridesmaids that I might as well have preached to Joe himself Here the old gentleman stopped to laugh and having done so to his heart s content presently resumed But this is not the best of it it seems This is only half the love making and plotting that have been going forward We have been walking on mines for the last six months and they re sprung at last What do you mean exclaimed mister Pickwick turning pale no other secret marriage I hope No no replied old Wardle not so bad as that no What then inquired mister Pickwick am I interested in it Shall I answer that question Perker said Wardle If you don t commit yourself by doing so my dear Sir Well then you are said Wardle How asked mister Pickwick anxiously In what way Really replied Wardle you re such a fiery sort of a young fellow that I am almost afraid to tell you but however if Perker will sit between us to prevent mischief I ll venture Having closed the room door and fortified himself with another application to Perker s snuff box the old gentleman proceeded with his great disclosure in these words The fact is that my daughter Bella Bella who married young Trundle you know Yes yes we know said mister Pickwick impatiently Don t alarm me at the very beginning My daughter Bella Emily having gone to bed with a headache after she had read Arabella s letter to me sat herself down by my side the other evening and began to talk over this marriage affair Well pa she says what do you think of it Why my dear I said I suppose it s all very well I hope it s for the best I answered in this way because I was sitting before the fire at the time drinking my grog rather thoughtfully and I knew my throwing in an undecided word now and then would induce her to continue talking Both my girls are pictures of their dear mother and as I grow old I like to sit with only them by me for their voices and looks carry me back to the happiest period of my life and make me for the moment as young as I used to be then though not quite so light hearted It s quite a marriage of affection pa said Bella after a short silence Yes my dear said I but such marriages do not always turn out the happiest I question that mind interposed mister Pickwick warmly Very good responded Wardle question anything you like when it s your turn to speak but don t interrupt me I beg your pardon said mister Pickwick Granted replied Wardle I am sorry to hear you express your opinion against marriages of affection pa said Bella colouring a little I was wrong I ought not to have said so my dear either said I patting her cheek as kindly as a rough old fellow like me could pat it for your mother s was one and so was yours It s not that I meant pa said Bella The fact is pa I wanted to speak to you about Emily mister Pickwick started What s the matter now inquired Wardle stopping in his narrative Nothing replied mister Pickwick Pray go on I never could spin out a story said Wardle abruptly It must come out sooner or later and it ll save us all a great deal of time if it comes at once The long and the short of it is then that Bella at last mustered up courage to tell me that Emily was very unhappy that she and your young friend Snodgrass had been in constant correspondence and communication ever since last Christmas that she had very dutifully made up her mind to run away with him in laudable imitation of her old friend and school fellow but that having some compunctions of conscience on the subject inasmuch as I had always been rather kindly disposed to both of them they had thought it better in the first instance to pay me the compliment of asking whether I would have any objection to their being married in the usual matter of fact manner There now mister Pickwick if you can make it convenient to reduce your eyes to their usual size again and to let me hear what you think we ought to do I shall feel rather obliged to you The testy manner in which the hearty old gentleman uttered this last sentence was not wholly unwarranted for mister Pickwick s face had settled down into an expression of blank amazement and perplexity quite curious to behold Snodgrass since last Christmas were the first broken words that issued from the lips of the confounded gentleman Since last Christmas replied Wardle that s plain enough and very bad spectacles we must have worn not to have discovered it before I don t understand it said mister Pickwick ruminating I cannot really understand it It s easy enough to understand it replied the choleric old gentleman If you had been a younger man you would have been in the secret long ago and besides added Wardle after a moment s hesitation the truth is that knowing nothing of this matter I have rather pressed Emily for four or five months past to receive favourably if she could I would never attempt to force a girl s inclinations the addresses of a young gentleman down in our neighbourhood I have no doubt that girl like to enhance her own value and increase the ardour of mister Snodgrass she has represented this matter in very glowing colours and that they have both arrived at the conclusion that they are a terribly persecuted pair of unfortunates and have no resource but clandestine matrimony or charcoal Now the question is what s to be done What have YOU done inquired mister Pickwick I I mean what did you do when your married daughter told you this Oh I made a fool of myself of course rejoined Wardle Just so interposed Perker who had accompanied this dialogue with sundry twitchings of his watch chain vindictive rubbings of his nose and other symptoms of impatience That s very natural but how I went into a great passion and frightened my mother into a fit said Wardle That was judicious remarked Perker and what else I fretted and fumed all next day and raised a great disturbance rejoined the old gentleman At last I got tired of rendering myself unpleasant and making everybody miserable so I hired a carriage at Muggleton and putting my own horses in it came up to town under pretence of bringing Emily to see Arabella Miss Wardle is with you then said mister Pickwick To be sure she is replied Wardle She is at Osborne s Hotel in the Adelphi at this moment unless your enterprising friend has run away with her since I came out this morning You are reconciled then said Perker Not a bit of it answered Wardle she has been crying and moping ever since except last night between tea and supper when she made a great parade of writing a letter that I pretended to take no notice of You want my advice in this matter I suppose said Perker looking from the musing face of mister Pickwick to the eager countenance of Wardle and taking several consecutive pinches of his favourite stimulant I suppose so said Wardle looking at mister Pickwick Certainly replied that gentleman Well then said Perker rising and pushing his chair back my advice is that you both walk away together or ride away or get away by some means or other for I m tired of you and just talk this matter over between you If you have not settled it by the next time I see you I ll tell you what to do This is satisfactory said Wardle hardly knowing whether to smile or be offended Pooh pooh my dear Sir returned Perker I know you both a great deal better than you know yourselves You have settled it already to all intents and purposes Thus expressing himself the little gentleman poked his snuff box first into the chest of mister Pickwick and then into the waistcoat of mister Wardle upon which they all three laughed especially the two last named gentlemen who at once shook hands again without any obvious or particular reason You dine with me to day said Wardle to Perker as he showed them out Can t promise my dear Sir can t promise replied Perker I ll look in in the evening at all events I shall expect you at five said Wardle Now Joe And Joe having been at length awakened the two friends departed in mister Wardle s carriage which in common humanity had a dickey behind for the fat boy who if there had been a footboard instead would have rolled off and killed himself in his very first nap Driving to the George and Vulture they found that Arabella and her maid had sent for a hackney coach immediately on the receipt of a short note from Emily announcing her arrival in town and had proceeded straight to the Adelphi As Wardle had business to transact in the city they sent the carriage and the fat boy to his hotel with the information that he and mister Pickwick would return together to dinner at five o clock Charged with this message the fat boy returned slumbering as peaceably in his dickey over the stones as if it had been a down bed on watch springs By some extraordinary miracle he awoke of his own accord when the coach stopped and giving himself a good shake to stir up his faculties went upstairs to execute his commission Now whether the shake had jumbled the fat boy s faculties together instead of arranging them in proper order or had roused such a quantity of new ideas within him as to render him oblivious of ordinary forms and ceremonies or which is also possible had proved unsuccessful in preventing his falling asleep as he ascended the stairs it is an undoubted fact that he walked into the sitting room without previously knocking at the door and so beheld a gentleman with his arms clasping his young mistress s waist sitting very lovingly by her side on a sofa while Arabella and her pretty handmaid feigned to be absorbed in looking out of a window at the other end of the room At the sight of this phenomenon the fat boy uttered an interjection the ladies a scream and the gentleman an oath almost simultaneously Wretched creature what do you want here said the gentleman who it is needless to say was mister Snodgrass To this the fat boy considerably terrified briefly responded Missis What do you want me for inquired Emily turning her head aside you stupid creature Master and mister Pickwick is a going to dine here at five replied the fat boy Leave the room said mister Snodgrass glaring upon the bewildered youth No no no added Emily hastily Bella dear advise me Upon this Emily and mister Snodgrass and Arabella and Mary crowded into a corner and conversed earnestly in whispers for some minutes during which the fat boy dozed Joe said Arabella at length looking round with a most bewitching smile how do you do Joe Joe said Emily you re a very good boy I won t forget you Joe Joe said mister Snodgrass advancing to the astonished youth and seizing his hand I didn t know you before There s five shillings for you Joe I ll owe you five Joe said Arabella for old acquaintance sake you know and another most captivating smile was bestowed upon the corpulent intruder The fat boy s perception being slow he looked rather puzzled at first to account for this sudden prepossession in his favour and stared about him in a very alarming manner At length his broad face began to show symptoms of a grin of proportionately broad dimensions and then thrusting half a crown into each of his pockets and a hand and wrist after it he burst into a horse laugh being for the first and only time in his existence He understands us I see said Arabella He had better have something to eat immediately remarked Emily The fat boy almost laughed again when he heard this suggestion Mary after a little more whispering tripped forth from the group and said I am going to dine with you to day sir if you have no objection This way said the fat boy eagerly There is such a jolly meat pie With these words the fat boy led the way downstairs his pretty companion captivating all the waiters and angering all the chambermaids as she followed him to the eating room There was the meat pie of which the youth had spoken so feelingly and there were moreover a steak and a dish of potatoes and a pot of porter Sit down said the fat boy Oh my eye how prime I am SO hungry Having apostrophised his eye in a species of rapture five or six times the youth took the head of the little table and Mary seated herself at the bottom Will you have some of this said the fat boy plunging into the pie up to the very ferules of the knife and fork A little if you please replied Mary The fat boy assisted Mary to a little and himself to a great deal and was just going to begin eating when he suddenly laid down his knife and fork leaned forward in his chair and letting his hands with the knife and fork in them fall on his knees said very slowly I say How nice you look This was said in an admiring manner and was so far gratifying but still there was enough of the cannibal in the young gentleman s eyes to render the compliment a double one Dear me Joseph said Mary affecting to blush what do you mean The fat boy gradually recovering his former position replied with a heavy sigh and remaining thoughtful for a few moments drank a long draught of the porter Having achieved this feat he sighed again and applied himself assiduously to the pie What a nice young lady Miss Emily is said Mary after a long silence The fat boy had by this time finished the pie He fixed his eyes on Mary and replied I knows a nicerer Indeed said Mary Yes indeed replied the fat boy with unwonted vivacity What s her name inquired Mary What s yours Mary So s hers said the fat boy You re her The boy grinned to add point to the compliment and put his eyes into something between a squint and a cast which there is reason to believe he intended for an ogle You mustn t talk to me in that way said Mary you don t mean it Don t I though replied the fat boy I say Well Are you going to come here regular No rejoined Mary shaking her head I m going away again to night Why Oh said the fat boy in a tone of strong feeling how we should have enjoyed ourselves at meals if you had been I might come here sometimes perhaps to see you said Mary plaiting the table cloth in assumed coyness if you would do me a favour The fat boy looked from the pie dish to the steak as if he thought a favour must be in a manner connected with something to eat and then took out one of the half crowns and glanced at it nervously Don t you understand me said Mary looking slily in his fat face Again he looked at the half crown and said faintly No The ladies want you not to say anything to the old gentleman about the young gentleman having been upstairs and I want you too Is that all said the fat boy evidently very much relieved as he pocketed the half crown again Of course I ain t a going to You see said Mary mister Snodgrass is very fond of Miss Emily and Miss Emily s very fond of him and if you were to tell about it the old gentleman would carry you all away miles into the country where you d see nobody No no I won t tell said the fat boy stoutly That s a dear said Mary Now it s time I went upstairs and got my lady ready for dinner Don t go yet urged the fat boy I must replied Mary Good bye for the present The fat boy with elephantine playfulness stretched out his arms to ravish a kiss but as it required no great agility to elude him his fair enslaver had vanished before he closed them again upon which the apathetic youth ate a pound or so of steak with a sentimental countenance and fell fast asleep There was so much to say upstairs and there were so many plans to concert for elopement and matrimony in the event of old Wardle continuing to be cruel that it wanted only half an hour of dinner when mister Snodgrass took his final adieu The ladies ran to Emily s bedroom to dress and the lover taking up his hat walked out of the room He had scarcely got outside the door when he heard Wardle s voice talking loudly and looking over the banisters beheld him followed by some other gentlemen coming straight upstairs Knowing nothing of the house mister Snodgrass in his confusion stepped hastily back into the room he had just quitted and passing thence into an inner apartment mister Wardle s bedchamber closed the door softly just as the persons he had caught a glimpse of entered the sitting room These were mister Wardle mister Pickwick mister Nathaniel Winkle and mister Benjamin Allen whom he had no difficulty in recognising by their voices Very lucky I had the presence of mind to avoid them thought mister Snodgrass with a smile and walking on tiptoe to another door near the bedside this opens into the same passage and I can walk quietly and comfortably away There was only one obstacle to his walking quietly and comfortably away which was that the door was locked and the key gone Let us have some of your best wine to day waiter said old Wardle rubbing his hands You shall have some of the very best sir replied the waiter Let the ladies know we have come in Yes Sir Devoutly and ardently did mister Snodgrass wish that the ladies could know he had come in He ventured once to whisper Waiter through the keyhole but the probability of the wrong waiter coming to his relief flashed upon his mind together with a sense of the strong resemblance between his own situation and that in which another gentleman had been recently found in a neighbouring hotel an account of whose misfortunes had appeared under the head of Police in that morning s paper he sat himself on a portmanteau and trembled violently We won t wait a minute for Perker said Wardle looking at his watch he is always exact He will be here in time if he means to come and if he does not it s of no use waiting Ha Arabella My sister exclaimed mister Benjamin Allen folding her in a most romantic embrace Oh Ben dear how you do smell of tobacco said Arabella rather overcome by this mark of affection Do I said mister Benjamin Allen Do I Bella Well perhaps I do Perhaps he did having just left a pleasant little smoking party of twelve medical students in a small back parlour with a large fire But I am delighted to see you said mister Ben Allen Bless you Bella There said Arabella bending forward to kiss her brother don t take hold of me again Ben dear because you tumble me so At this point of the reconciliation mister Ben Allen allowed his feelings and the cigars and porter to overcome him and looked round upon the beholders with damp spectacles Is nothing to be said to me cried Wardle with open arms A great deal whispered Arabella as she received the old gentleman s hearty caress and congratulation You are a hard hearted unfeeling cruel monster You are a little rebel replied Wardle in the same tone and I am afraid I shall be obliged to forbid you the house People like you who get married in spite of everybody ought not to be let loose on society But come added the old gentleman aloud here s the dinner you shall sit by me Joe why damn the boy he s awake To the great distress of his master the fat boy was indeed in a state of remarkable vigilance his eyes being wide open and looking as if they intended to remain so There was an alacrity in his manner too which was equally unaccountable every time his eyes met those of Emily or Arabella he smirked and grinned once Wardle could have sworn he saw him wink This alteration in the fat boy s demeanour originated in his increased sense of his own importance and the dignity he acquired from having been taken into the confidence of the young ladies and the smirks and grins and winks were so many condescending assurances that they might depend upon his fidelity As these tokens were rather calculated to awaken suspicion than allay it and were somewhat embarrassing besides they were occasionally answered by a frown or shake of the head from Arabella which the fat boy considering as hints to be on his guard expressed his perfect understanding of by smirking grinning and winking with redoubled assiduity Joe said mister Wardle after an unsuccessful search in all his pockets is my snuff box on the sofa No sir replied the fat boy Oh I recollect I left it on my dressing table this morning said Wardle Run into the next room and fetch it The fat boy went into the next room and having been absent about a minute returned with the snuff box and the palest face that ever a fat boy wore What s the matter with the boy exclaimed Wardle Nothen s the matter with me replied Joe nervously Have you been seeing any spirits inquired the old gentleman Or taking any added Ben Allen I think you re right whispered Wardle across the table He is intoxicated I m sure Ben Allen replied that he thought he was and as that gentleman had seen a vast deal of the disease in question Wardle was confirmed in an impression which had been hovering about his mind for half an hour and at once arrived at the conclusion that the fat boy was drunk Just keep your eye upon him for a few minutes murmured Wardle We shall soon find out whether he is or not The unfortunate youth had only interchanged a dozen words with mister Snodgrass that gentleman having implored him to make a private appeal to some friend to release him and then pushed him out with the snuff box lest his prolonged absence should lead to a discovery He ruminated a little with a most disturbed expression of face and left the room in search of Mary But Mary had gone home after dressing her mistress and the fat boy came back again more disturbed than before Wardle and mister Ben Allen exchanged glances Joe said Wardle Yes sir What did you go away for The fat boy looked hopelessly in the face of everybody at table and stammered out that he didn t know Oh said Wardle you don t know eh Take this cheese to mister Pickwick Now mister Pickwick being in the very best health and spirits had been making himself perfectly delightful all dinner time and was at this moment engaged in an energetic conversation with Emily and mister Winkle bowing his head courteously in the emphasis of his discourse gently waving his left hand to lend force to his observations and all glowing with placid smiles He took a piece of cheese from the plate and was on the point of turning round to renew the conversation when the fat boy stooping so as to bring his head on a level with that of mister Pickwick pointed with his thumb over his shoulder and made the most horrible and hideous face that was ever seen out of a Christmas pantomime Dear me said mister Pickwick starting what a very Eh He stopped for the fat boy had drawn himself up and was or pretended to be fast asleep What s the matter inquired Wardle This is such an extremely singular lad replied mister Pickwick looking uneasily at the boy It seems an odd thing to say but upon my word I am afraid that at times he is a little deranged Oh mister Pickwick pray don t say so cried Emily and Arabella both at once I am not certain of course said mister Pickwick amidst profound silence and looks of general dismay but his manner to me this moment really was very alarming Oh ejaculated mister Pickwick suddenly jumping up with a short scream I beg your pardon ladies but at that moment he ran some sharp instrument into my leg Really he is not safe He s drunk roared old Wardle passionately Ring the bell Call the waiters He s drunk I ain t said the fat boy falling on his knees as his master seized him by the collar I ain t drunk Then you re mad that s worse Call the waiters said the old gentleman I ain t mad I m sensible rejoined the fat boy beginning to cry Then what the devil did you run sharp instruments into mister Pickwick s legs for inquired Wardle angrily He wouldn t look at me replied the boy I wanted to speak to him What did you want to say asked half a dozen voices at once The fat boy gasped looked at the bedroom door gasped again and wiped two tears away with the knuckle of each of his forefingers What did you want to say demanded Wardle shaking him Stop said mister Pickwick allow me What did you wish to communicate to me my poor boy I want to whisper to you replied the fat boy You want to bite his ear off I suppose said Wardle Don t come near him he s vicious ring the bell and let him be taken downstairs Just as mister Winkle caught the bell rope in his hand it was arrested by a general expression of astonishment the captive lover his face burning with confusion suddenly walked in from the bedroom and made a comprehensive bow to the company Hollo cried Wardle releasing the fat boy s collar and staggering back What s this I have been concealed in the next room sir since you returned explained mister Snodgrass Emily my girl said Wardle reproachfully I detest meanness and deceit this is unjustifiable and indelicate in the highest degree I don t deserve this at your hands Emily indeed Dear papa said Emily Arabella knows everybody here knows Joe knows that I was no party to this concealment Augustus for Heaven s sake explain it mister Snodgrass who had only waited for a hearing at once recounted how he had been placed in his then distressing predicament how the fear of giving rise to domestic dissensions had alone prompted him to avoid mister Wardle on his entrance how he merely meant to depart by another door but finding it locked had been compelled to stay against his will It was a painful situation to be placed in but he now regretted it the less inasmuch as it afforded him an opportunity of acknowledging before their mutual friends that he loved mister Wardle s daughter deeply and sincerely that he was proud to avow that the feeling was mutual and that if thousands of miles were placed between them or oceans rolled their waters he could never for an instant forget those happy days when first et cetera et cetera Having delivered himself to this effect mister Snodgrass bowed again looked into the crown of his hat and stepped towards the door Stop shouted Wardle Why in the name of all that s Inflammable mildly suggested mister Pickwick who thought something worse was coming Well that s inflammable said Wardle adopting the substitute couldn t you say all this to me in the first instance Or confide in me added mister Pickwick Dear dear said Arabella taking up the defence what is the use of asking all that now especially when you know you had set your covetous old heart on a richer son in law and are so wild and fierce besides that everybody is afraid of you except me Shake hands with him and order him some dinner for goodness gracious sake for he looks half starved and pray have your wine up at once for you ll not be tolerable until you have taken two bottles at least The worthy old gentleman pulled Arabella s ear kissed her without the smallest scruple kissed his daughter also with great affection and shook mister Snodgrass warmly by the hand She is right on one point at all events said the old gentleman cheerfully Ring for the wine The wine came and Perker came upstairs at the same moment mister Snodgrass had dinner at a side table and when he had despatched it drew his chair next Emily without the smallest opposition on the old gentleman s part The evening was excellent Little mister Perker came out wonderfully told various comic stories and sang a serious song which was almost as funny as the anecdotes Arabella was very charming mister Wardle very jovial mister Pickwick very harmonious mister Ben Allen very uproarious the lovers very silent mister Winkle very talkative and all of them very happy CHAPTER LV mister SOLOMON PELL ASSISTED BY A SELECT COMMITTEE OF COACHMEN ARRANGES THE AFFAIRS OF THE ELDER mister WELLER Samivel said mister Weller accosting his son on the morning after the funeral I ve found it Sammy I thought it wos there Thought wot wos there inquired Sam Your mother in law s vill Sammy replied mister Weller In wirtue o vich them arrangements is to be made as I told you on last night respectin the funs Wot didn t she tell you were it wos inquired Sam Not a bit on it Sammy replied mister Weller We wos a adjestin our little differences and I wos a cheerin her spirits and bearin her up so that I forgot to ask anythin about it I don t know as I should ha done it indeed if I had remembered it added mister Weller for it s a rum sort o thing Sammy to go a hankerin arter anybody s property ven you re assistin em in illness It s like helping an outside passenger up ven he s been pitched off a coach and puttin your hand in his pocket vile you ask him vith a sigh how he finds his self Sammy With this figurative illustration of his meaning mister Weller unclasped his pocket book and drew forth a dirty sheet of letter paper on which were inscribed various characters crowded together in remarkable confusion This here is the dockyment Sammy said mister Weller I found it in the little black tea pot on the top shelf o the bar closet She used to keep bank notes there fore she vos married Samivel I ve seen her take the lid off to pay a bill many and many a time Poor creetur she might ha filled all the tea pots in the house vith vills and not have inconwenienced herself neither for she took wery little of anythin in that vay lately cept on the temperance nights ven they just laid a foundation o tea to put the spirits atop on What does it say inquired Sam Jist vot I told you my boy rejoined his parent Two hundred pound vurth o reduced counsels to my son in law Samivel and all the rest o my property of ev ry kind and description votsoever to my husband mister Tony Veller who I appint as my sole eggzekiter That s all is it said Sam That s all replied mister Weller And I s pose as it s all right and satisfactory to you and me as is the only parties interested ve may as vell put this bit o paper into the fire Wot are you a doin on you lunatic said Sam snatching the paper away as his parent in all innocence stirred the fire preparatory to suiting the action to the word You re a nice eggzekiter you are Vy not inquired mister Weller looking sternly round with the poker in his hand Vy not exclaimed Sam Cos it must be proved and probated and swore to and all manner o formalities You don t mean that said mister Weller laying down the poker Sam buttoned the will carefully in a side pocket intimating by a look meanwhile that he did mean it and very seriously too Then I ll tell you wot it is said mister Weller after a short meditation this is a case for that ere confidential pal o the Chancellorship s Pell must look into this Sammy He s the man for a difficult question at law Ve ll have this here brought afore the Solvent Court directly Samivel I never did see such a addle headed old creetur exclaimed Sam irritably Old Baileys and Solvent Courts and alleybis and ev ry species o gammon alvays a runnin through his brain You d better get your out o door clothes on and come to town about this bisness than stand a preachin there about wot you don t understand nothin on Wery good Sammy replied mister Weller I m quite agreeable to anythin as vill hexpedite business Sammy But mind this here my boy nobody but Pell nobody but Pell as a legal adwiser I don t want anybody else replied Sam Now are you a comin Vait a minit Sammy replied mister Weller who having tied his shawl with the aid of a small glass that hung in the window was now by dint of the most wonderful exertions struggling into his upper garments Vait a minit Sammy ven you grow as old as your father you von t get into your veskit quite as easy as you do now my boy If I couldn t get into it easier than that I m blessed if I d vear vun at all rejoined his son You think so now said mister Weller with the gravity of age but you ll find that as you get vider you ll get viser Vidth and visdom Sammy alvays grows together As mister Weller delivered this infallible maxim the result of many years personal experience and observation he contrived by a dexterous twist of his body to get the bottom button of his coat to perform its office Having paused a few seconds to recover breath he brushed his hat with his elbow and declared himself ready As four heads is better than two Sammy said mister Weller as they drove along the London Road in the chaise cart and as all this here property is a wery great temptation to a legal general l m n ve ll take a couple o friends o mine vith us as ll be wery soon down upon him if he comes anythin irreg lar two o them as saw you to the Fleet that day They re the wery best judges added mister Weller in a half whisper the wery best judges of a horse you ever know d And of a lawyer too inquired Sam The man as can form a ackerate judgment of a animal can form a ackerate judgment of anythin replied his father so dogmatically that Sam did not attempt to controvert the position In pursuance of this notable resolution the services of the mottled faced gentleman and of two other very fat coachmen selected by mister Weller probably with a view to their width and consequent wisdom were put into requisition and this assistance having been secured the party proceeded to the public house in Portugal Street whence a messenger was despatched to the Insolvent Court over the way requiring mister Solomon Pell s immediate attendance The messenger fortunately found mister Solomon Pell in court regaling himself business being rather slack with a cold collation of an Abernethy biscuit and a saveloy The message was no sooner whispered in his ear than he thrust them in his pocket among various professional documents and hurried over the way with such alacrity that he reached the parlour before the messenger had even emancipated himself from the court Gentlemen said mister Pell touching his hat my service to you all I don t say it to flatter you gentlemen but there are not five other men in the world that I d have come out of that court for to day So busy eh said Sam Busy replied Pell I m completely sewn up as my friend the late Lord Chancellor many a time used to say to me gentlemen when he came out from hearing appeals in the House of Lords Poor fellow he was very susceptible to fatigue he used to feel those appeals uncommonly I actually thought more than once that he d have sunk under em I did indeed Here mister Pell shook his head and paused on which the elder mister Weller nudging his neighbour as begging him to mark the attorney s high connections asked whether the duties in question produced any permanent ill effects on the constitution of his noble friend I don t think he ever quite recovered them replied Pell in fact I m sure he never did Pell he used to say to me many a time how the blazes you can stand the head work you do is a mystery to me Well I used to answer I hardly know how I do it upon my life Pell he d add sighing and looking at me with a little envy friendly envy you know gentlemen mere friendly envy I never minded it Pell you re a wonder a wonder Ah you d have liked him very much if you had known him gentlemen Bring me three penn orth of rum my dear Addressing this latter remark to the waitress in a tone of subdued grief mister Pell sighed looked at his shoes and the ceiling and the rum having by that time arrived drank it up However said Pell drawing a chair to the table a professional man has no right to think of his private friendships when his legal assistance is wanted By the bye gentlemen since I saw you here before we have had to weep over a very melancholy occurrence mister Pell drew out a pocket handkerchief when he came to the word weep but he made no further use of it than to wipe away a slight tinge of rum which hung upon his upper lip I saw it in the ADVERTISER mister Weller continued Pell Bless my soul not more than fifty two Dear me only think These indications of a musing spirit were addressed to the mottled faced man whose eyes mister Pell had accidentally caught on which the mottled faced man whose apprehension of matters in general was of a foggy nature moved uneasily in his seat and opined that indeed so far as that went there was no saying how things was brought about which observation involving one of those subtle propositions which it is difficult to encounter in argument was controverted by nobody I have heard it remarked that she was a very fine woman mister Weller said Pell in a sympathising manner Yes sir she wos replied the elder mister Weller not much relishing this mode of discussing the subject and yet thinking that the attorney from his long intimacy with the late Lord Chancellor must know best on all matters of polite breeding She wos a wery fine ooman sir ven I first know d her She wos a widder sir at that time Now it s curious said Pell looking round with a sorrowful smile missus Pell was a widow That s very extraordinary said the mottled faced man Well it is a curious coincidence said Pell Not at all gruffly remarked the elder mister Weller More widders is married than single wimin Very good very good said Pell you re quite right mister Weller missus Pell was a very elegant and accomplished woman her manners were the theme of universal admiration in our neighbourhood I was proud to see that woman dance there was something so firm and dignified and yet natural in her motion Her cutting gentlemen was simplicity itself Ah well well Excuse my asking the question mister Samuel continued the attorney in a lower voice was your mother in law tall Not wery replied Sam missus Pell was a tall figure said Pell a splendid woman with a noble shape and a nose gentlemen formed to command and be majestic She was very much attached to me very much highly connected too Her mother s brother gentlemen failed for eight hundred pounds as a law stationer Vell said mister Weller who had grown rather restless during this discussion vith regard to bis ness The word was music to Pell s ears He had been revolving in his mind whether any business was to be transacted or whether he had been merely invited to partake of a glass of brandy and water or a bowl of punch or any similar professional compliment and now the doubt was set at rest without his appearing at all eager for its solution His eyes glistened as he laid his hat on the table and said What is the business upon which um Either of these gentlemen wish to go through the court We require an arrest a friendly arrest will do you know we are all friends here I suppose Give me the dockyment Sammy said mister Weller taking the will from his son who appeared to enjoy the interview amazingly Wot we rekvire sir is a probe o this here Probate my dear Sir probate said Pell Well sir replied mister Weller sharply probe and probe it is wery much the same if you don t understand wot I mean sir I des say I can find them as does No offence I hope mister Weller said Pell meekly You are the executor I see he added casting his eyes over the paper I am sir replied mister Weller These other gentlemen I presume are legatees are they inquired Pell with a congratulatory smile Sammy is a leg at ease replied mister Weller these other general l m n is friends o mine just come to see fair a kind of umpires Oh said Pell very good I have no objections I m sure I shall want a matter of five pound of you before I begin ha ha ha It being decided by the committee that the five pound might be advanced mister Weller produced that sum after which a long consultation about nothing particular took place in the course whereof mister Pell demonstrated to the perfect satisfaction of the gentlemen who saw fair that unless the management of the business had been intrusted to him it must all have gone wrong for reasons not clearly made out but no doubt sufficient This important point being despatched mister Pell refreshed himself with three chops and liquids both malt and spirituous at the expense of the estate and then they all went away to Doctors Commons The next day there was another visit to Doctors Commons and a great to do with an attesting hostler who being inebriated declined swearing anything but profane oaths to the great scandal of a proctor and surrogate Next week there were more visits to Doctors Commons and there was a visit to the Legacy Duty Office besides and there were treaties entered into for the disposal of the lease and business and ratifications of the same and inventories to be made out and lunches to be taken and dinners to be eaten and so many profitable things to be done and such a mass of papers accumulated that mister Solomon Pell and the boy and the blue bag to boot all got so stout that scarcely anybody would have known them for the same man boy and bag that had loitered about Portugal Street a few days before At length all these weighty matters being arranged a day was fixed for selling out and transferring the stock and of waiting with that view upon Wilkins Flasher Esquire stock broker of somewhere near the bank who had been recommended by mister Solomon Pell for the purpose It was a kind of festive occasion and the parties were attired accordingly mister Weller s tops were newly cleaned and his dress was arranged with peculiar care the mottled faced gentleman wore at his button hole a full sized dahlia with several leaves and the coats of his two friends were adorned with nosegays of laurel and other evergreens All three were habited in strict holiday costume that is to say they were wrapped up to the chins and wore as many clothes as possible which is and has been a stage coachman s idea of full dress ever since stage coaches were invented mister Pell was waiting at the usual place of meeting at the appointed time even he wore a pair of gloves and a clean shirt much frayed at the collar and wristbands by frequent washings A quarter to two said Pell looking at the parlour clock If we are with mister Flasher at a quarter past we shall just hit the best time What should you say to a drop o beer general l m n suggested the mottled faced man And a little bit o cold beef said the second coachman Or a oyster added the third who was a hoarse gentleman supported by very round legs Hear hear said Pell to congratulate mister Weller on his coming into possession of his property eh Ha ha I m quite agreeable general l m n answered mister Weller Sammy pull the bell Sammy complied and the porter cold beef and oysters being promptly produced the lunch was done ample justice to Where everybody took so active a part it is almost invidious to make a distinction but if one individual evinced greater powers than another it was the coachman with the hoarse voice who took an imperial pint of vinegar with his oysters without betraying the least emotion mister Pell Sir said the elder mister Weller stirring a glass of brandy and water of which one was placed before every gentleman when the oyster shells were removed mister Pell Sir it wos my intention to have proposed the funs on this occasion but Samivel has vispered to me Here mister Samuel Weller who had silently eaten his oysters with tranquil smiles cried Hear in a very loud voice Has vispered to me resumed his father that it vould be better to dewote the liquor to vishin you success and prosperity and thankin you for the manner in which you ve brought this here business through Here s your health sir Hold hard there interposed the mottled faced gentleman with sudden energy your eyes on me general l m n Saying this the mottled faced gentleman rose as did the other gentlemen The mottled faced gentleman reviewed the company and slowly lifted his hand upon which every man including him of the mottled countenance drew a long breath and lifted his tumbler to his lips In one instant the mottled faced gentleman depressed his hand again and every glass was set down empty It is impossible to describe the thrilling effect produced by this striking ceremony At once dignified solemn and impressive it combined every element of grandeur Well gentlemen said mister Pell all I can say is that such marks of confidence must be very gratifying to a professional man I don t wish to say anything that might appear egotistical gentlemen but I m very glad for your own sakes that you came to me that s all If you had gone to any low member of the profession it s my firm conviction and I assure you of it as a fact that you would have found yourselves in Queer Street before this I could have wished my noble friend had been alive to have seen my management of this case I don t say it out of pride but I think However gentlemen I won t trouble you with that I m generally to be found here gentlemen but if I m not here or over the way that s my address You ll find my terms very cheap and reasonable and no man attends more to his clients than I do and I hope I know a little of my profession besides If you have any opportunity of recommending me to any of your friends gentlemen I shall be very much obliged to you and so will they too when they come to know me Your healths gentlemen With this expression of his feelings mister Solomon Pell laid three small written cards before mister Weller s friends and looking at the clock again feared it was time to be walking Upon this hint mister Weller settled the bill and issuing forth the executor legatee attorney and umpires directed their steps towards the city The office of Wilkins Flasher Esquire of the Stock Exchange was in a first floor up a court behind the Bank of England the house of Wilkins Flasher Esquire was at Brixton Surrey the horse and stanhope of Wilkins Flasher Esquire were at an adjacent livery stable the groom of Wilkins Flasher Esquire was on his way to the West End to deliver some game the clerk of Wilkins Flasher Esquire had gone to his dinner and so Wilkins Flasher Esquire himself cried Come in when mister Pell and his companions knocked at the counting house door Good morning Sir said Pell bowing obsequiously We want to make a little transfer if you please Oh just come in will you said mister Flasher Sit down a minute I ll attend to you directly Thank you Sir said Pell there s no hurry Take a chair mister Weller mister Weller took a chair and Sam took a box and the umpires took what they could get and looked at the almanac and one or two papers which were wafered against the wall with as much open eyed reverence as if they had been the finest efforts of the old masters Well I ll bet you half a dozen of claret on it come said Wilkins Flasher Esquire resuming the conversation to which mister Pell s entrance had caused a momentary interruption This was addressed to a very smart young gentleman who wore his hat on his right whisker and was lounging over the desk killing flies with a ruler Wilkins Flasher Esquire was balancing himself on two legs of an office stool spearing a wafer box with a penknife which he dropped every now and then with great dexterity into the very centre of a small red wafer that was stuck outside Both gentlemen had very open waistcoats and very rolling collars and very small boots and very big rings and very little watches and very large guard chains and symmetrical inexpressibles and scented pocket handkerchiefs I never bet half a dozen said the other gentleman I ll take a dozen Done Simmery done said Wilkins Flasher Esquire P P mind observed the other Of course replied Wilkins Flasher Esquire Wilkins Flasher Esquire entered it in a little book with a gold pencil case and the other gentleman entered it also in another little book with another gold pencil case I see there s a notice up this morning about Boffer observed mister Simmery Poor devil he s expelled the house I ll bet you ten guineas to five he cuts his throat said Wilkins Flasher Esquire Done replied mister Simmery Stop I bar said Wilkins Flasher Esquire thoughtfully Perhaps he may hang himself Very good rejoined mister Simmery pulling out the gold pencil case again I ve no objection to take you that way Say makes away with himself Kills himself in fact said Wilkins Flasher Esquire Just so replied mister Simmery putting it down Flasher ten guineas to five Boffer kills himself Within what time shall we say A fortnight suggested Wilkins Flasher Esquire Con found it no rejoined mister Simmery stopping for an instant to smash a fly with the ruler Say a week Split the difference said Wilkins Flasher Esquire Make it ten days Well ten days rejoined mister Simmery So it was entered down on the little books that Boffer was to kill himself within ten days or Wilkins Flasher Esquire was to hand over to Frank Simmery Esquire the sum of ten guineas and that if Boffer did kill himself within that time Frank Simmery Esquire would pay to Wilkins Flasher Esquire five guineas instead I m very sorry he has failed said Wilkins Flasher Esquire Capital dinners he gave Fine port he had too remarked mister Simmery We are going to send our butler to the sale to morrow to pick up some of that sixty four The devil you are said Wilkins Flasher Esquire My man s going too Five guineas my man outbids your man Done Another entry was made in the little books with the gold pencil cases and mister Simmery having by this time killed all the flies and taken all the bets strolled away to the Stock Exchange to see what was going forward Wilkins Flasher Esquire now condescended to receive mister Solomon Pell s instructions and having filled up some printed forms requested the party to follow him to the bank which they did mister Weller and his three friends staring at all they beheld in unbounded astonishment and Sam encountering everything with a coolness which nothing could disturb Crossing a courtyard which was all noise and bustle and passing a couple of porters who seemed dressed to match the red fire engine which was wheeled away into a corner they passed into an office where their business was to be transacted and where Pell and mister Flasher left them standing for a few moments while they went upstairs into the Will Office Wot place is this here whispered the mottled faced gentleman to the elder mister Weller Counsel s Office replied the executor in a whisper Wot are them general l men a settin behind the counters asked the hoarse coachman Reduced counsels I s pose replied mister Weller Ain t they the reduced counsels Samivel Wy you don t suppose the reduced counsels is alive do you inquired Sam with some disdain How should I know retorted mister Weller I thought they looked wery like it Wot are they then Clerks replied Sam Wot are they all a eatin ham sangwidges for inquired his father Cos it s in their dooty I suppose replied Sam it s a part o the system they re alvays a doin it here all day long mister Weller and his friends had scarcely had a moment to reflect upon this singular regulation as connected with the monetary system of the country when they were rejoined by Pell and Wilkins Flasher Esquire who led them to a part of the counter above which was a round blackboard with a large W on it Wot s that for Sir inquired mister Weller directing Pell s attention to the target in question The first letter of the name of the deceased replied Pell I say said mister Weller turning round to the umpires there s somethin wrong here We s our letter this won t do The referees at once gave it as their decided opinion that the business could not be legally proceeded with under the letter W and in all probability it would have stood over for one day at least had it not been for the prompt though at first sight undutiful behaviour of Sam who seizing his father by the skirt of the coat dragged him to the counter and pinned him there until he had affixed his signature to a couple of instruments which from mister Weller s habit of printing was a work of so much labour and time that the officiating clerk peeled and ate three Ribstone pippins while it was performing As the elder mister Weller insisted on selling out his portion forthwith they proceeded from the bank to the gate of the Stock Exchange to which Wilkins Flasher Esquire after a short absence returned with a cheque on Smith Payne Smith for five hundred and thirty pounds that being the money to which mister Weller at the market price of the day was entitled in consideration of the balance of the second missus Weller s funded savings Sam s two hundred pounds stood transferred to his name and Wilkins Flasher Esquire having been paid his commission dropped the money carelessly into his coat pocket and lounged back to his office mister Weller was at first obstinately determined on cashing the cheque in nothing but sovereigns but it being represented by the umpires that by so doing he must incur the expense of a small sack to carry them home in he consented to receive the amount in five pound notes My son said mister Weller as they came out of the banking house my son and me has a wery partickler engagement this arternoon and I should like to have this here bis ness settled out of hand so let s jest go straight avay someveres vere ve can hordit the accounts A quiet room was soon found and the accounts were produced and audited mister Pell s bill was taxed by Sam and some charges were disallowed by the umpires but notwithstanding mister Pell s declaration accompanied with many solemn asseverations that they were really too hard upon him it was by very many degrees the best professional job he had ever had and one on which he boarded lodged and washed for six months afterwards The umpires having partaken of a dram shook hands and departed as they had to drive out of town that night mister Solomon Pell finding that nothing more was going forward either in the eating or drinking way took a friendly leave and Sam and his father were left alone There said mister Weller thrusting his pocket book in his side pocket Vith the bills for the lease and that there s eleven hundred and eighty pound here Now Samivel my boy turn the horses heads to the George and Wulter CHAPTER LVI AN IMPORTANT CONFERENCE TAKES PLACE BETWEEN mister PICKWICK AND SAMUEL WELLER AT WHICH HIS PARENT ASSISTS AN OLD GENTLEMAN IN A SNUFF COLOURED SUIT ARRIVES UNEXPECTEDLY mister Pickwick was sitting alone musing over many things and thinking among other considerations how he could best provide for the young couple whose present unsettled condition was matter of constant regret and anxiety to him when Mary stepped lightly into the room and advancing to the table said rather hastily Oh if you please Sir Samuel is downstairs and he says may his father see you Surely replied mister Pickwick Thank you Sir said Mary tripping towards the door again Sam has not been here long has he inquired mister Pickwick Oh no Sir replied Mary eagerly He has only just come home He is not going to ask you for any more leave Sir he says Mary might have been conscious that she had communicated this last intelligence with more warmth than seemed actually necessary or she might have observed the good humoured smile with which mister Pickwick regarded her when she had finished speaking She certainly held down her head and examined the corner of a very smart little apron with more closeness than there appeared any absolute occasion for Tell them they can come up at once by all means said mister Pickwick Mary apparently much relieved hurried away with her message mister Pickwick took two or three turns up and down the room and rubbing his chin with his left hand as he did so appeared lost in thought Well well said mister Pickwick at length in a kind but somewhat melancholy tone it is the best way in which I could reward him for his attachment and fidelity let it be so in Heaven s name It is the fate of a lonely old man that those about him should form new and different attachments and leave him I have no right to expect that it should be otherwise with me No no added mister Pickwick more cheerfully it would be selfish and ungrateful I ought to be happy to have an opportunity of providing for him so well I am Of course I am mister Pickwick had been so absorbed in these reflections that a knock at the door was three or four times repeated before he heard it Hastily seating himself and calling up his accustomed pleasant looks he gave the required permission and Sam Weller entered followed by his father Glad to see you back again Sam said mister Pickwick How do you do mister Weller Wery hearty thank ee sir replied the widower hope I see you well sir Quite I thank you replied mister Pickwick I wanted to have a little bit o conwersation with you sir said mister Weller if you could spare me five minits or so sir Certainly replied mister Pickwick Sam give your father a chair Thank ee Samivel I ve got a cheer here said mister Weller bringing one forward as he spoke uncommon fine day it s been sir added the old gentleman laying his hat on the floor as he sat himself down Remarkably so indeed replied mister Pickwick Very seasonable Seasonablest veather I ever see sir rejoined mister Weller Here the old gentleman was seized with a violent fit of coughing which being terminated he nodded his head and winked and made several supplicatory and threatening gestures to his son all of which Sam Weller steadily abstained from seeing mister Pickwick perceiving that there was some embarrassment on the old gentleman s part affected to be engaged in cutting the leaves of a book that lay beside him and waited patiently until mister Weller should arrive at the object of his visit I never see sich a aggrawatin boy as you are Samivel said mister Weller looking indignantly at his son never in all my born days What is he doing mister Weller inquired mister Pickwick He von t begin sir rejoined mister Weller he knows I ain t ekal to ex pressin myself ven there s anythin partickler to be done and yet he ll stand and see me a settin here taking up your walable time and makin a reg lar spectacle o myself rayther than help me out vith a syllable It ain t filial conduct Samivel said mister Weller wiping his forehead wery far from it You said you d speak replied Sam how should I know you wos done up at the wery beginnin You might ha seen I warn t able to start rejoined his father I m on the wrong side of the road and backin into the palin s and all manner of unpleasantness and yet you von t put out a hand to help me I m ashamed on you Samivel The fact is Sir said Sam with a slight bow the gov nor s been a drawin his money Wery good Samivel wery good said mister Weller nodding his head with a satisfied air I didn t mean to speak harsh to you Sammy Wery good That s the vay to begin Come to the pint at once Wery good indeed Samivel mister Weller nodded his head an extraordinary number of times in the excess of his gratification and waited in a listening attitude for Sam to resume his statement You may sit down Sam said mister Pickwick apprehending that the interview was likely to prove rather longer than he had expected Sam bowed again and sat down his father looking round he continued The gov nor sir has drawn out five hundred and thirty pound Reduced counsels interposed mister Weller senior in an undertone It don t much matter vether it s reduced counsels or wot not said Sam five hundred and thirty pounds is the sum ain t it All right Samivel replied mister Weller To vich sum he has added for the house and bisness Lease good vill stock and fixters interposed mister Weller As much as makes it continued Sam altogether eleven hundred and eighty pound Indeed said mister Pickwick I am delighted to hear it I congratulate you mister Weller on having done so well Vait a minit Sir said mister Weller raising his hand in a deprecatory manner Get on Samivel This here money said Sam with a little hesitation he s anxious to put someveres vere he knows it ll be safe and I m wery anxious too for if he keeps it he ll go a lendin it to somebody or inwestin property in horses or droppin his pocket book down an airy or makin a Egyptian mummy of his self in some vay or another Wery good Samivel observed mister Weller in as complacent a manner as if Sam had been passing the highest eulogiums on his prudence and foresight Wery good For vich reasons continued Sam plucking nervously at the brim of his hat for vich reasons he s drawn it out to day and come here vith me to say leastvays to offer or in other vords To say this here said the elder mister Weller impatiently that it ain t o no use to me I m a goin to vork a coach reg lar and ha n t got noveres to keep it in unless I vos to pay the guard for takin care on it or to put it in vun o the coach pockets vich ud be a temptation to the insides If you ll take care on it for me sir I shall be wery much obliged to you P raps said mister Weller walking up to mister Pickwick and whispering in his ear p raps it ll go a little vay towards the expenses o that ere conwiction All I say is just you keep it till I ask you for it again With these words mister Weller placed the pocket book in mister Pickwick s hands caught up his hat and ran out of the room with a celerity scarcely to be expected from so corpulent a subject Stop him Sam exclaimed mister Pickwick earnestly Overtake him bring him back instantly mister Weller here come back Sam saw that his master s injunctions were not to be disobeyed and catching his father by the arm as he was descending the stairs dragged him back by main force My good friend said mister Pickwick taking the old man by the hand your honest confidence overpowers me I don t see no occasion for nothin o the kind Sir replied mister Weller obstinately I assure you my good friend I have more money than I can ever need far more than a man at my age can ever live to spend said mister Pickwick No man knows how much he can spend till he tries observed mister Weller Perhaps not replied mister Pickwick but as I have no intention of trying any such experiments I am not likely to come to want I must beg you to take this back mister Weller Wery well said mister Weller with a discontented look Mark my vords Sammy I ll do somethin desperate vith this here property somethin desperate You d better not replied Sam mister Weller reflected for a short time and then buttoning up his coat with great determination said I ll keep a pike Wot exclaimed Sam A pike rejoined mister Weller through his set teeth I ll keep a pike Say good bye to your father Samivel I dewote the remainder of my days to a pike This threat was such an awful one and mister Weller besides appearing fully resolved to carry it into execution seemed so deeply mortified by mister Pickwick s refusal that that gentleman after a short reflection said Well well mister Weller I will keep your money I can do more good with it perhaps than you can Just the wery thing to be sure said mister Weller brightening up o course you can sir Say no more about it said mister Pickwick locking the pocket book in his desk I am heartily obliged to you my good friend Now sit down again I want to ask your advice The internal laughter occasioned by the triumphant success of his visit which had convulsed not only mister Weller s face but his arms legs and body also during the locking up of the pocket book suddenly gave place to the most dignified gravity as he heard these words Wait outside a few minutes Sam will you said mister Pickwick Sam immediately withdrew mister Weller looked uncommonly wise and very much amazed when mister Pickwick opened the discourse by saying You are not an advocate for matrimony I think mister Weller mister Weller shook his head He was wholly unable to speak vague thoughts of some wicked widow having been successful in her designs on mister Pickwick choked his utterance Did you happen to see a young girl downstairs when you came in just now with your son inquired mister Pickwick Yes I see a young gal replied mister Weller shortly What did you think of her now Candidly mister Weller what did you think of her I thought she wos wery plump and vell made said mister Weller with a critical air So she is said mister Pickwick so she is What did you think of her manners from what you saw of her Wery pleasant rejoined mister Weller Wery pleasant and comformable The precise meaning which mister Weller attached to this last mentioned adjective did not appear but as it was evident from the tone in which he used it that it was a favourable expression mister Pickwick was as well satisfied as if he had been thoroughly enlightened on the subject I take a great interest in her mister Weller said mister Pickwick mister Weller coughed I mean an interest in her doing well resumed mister Pickwick a desire that she may be comfortable and prosperous You understand Wery clearly replied mister Weller who understood nothing yet That young person said mister Pickwick is attached to your son To Samivel Veller exclaimed the parent Yes said mister Pickwick It s nat ral said mister Weller after some consideration nat ral but rayther alarmin Sammy must be careful How do you mean inquired mister Pickwick Wery careful that he don t say nothin to her responded mister Weller Wery careful that he ain t led avay in a innocent moment to say anythin as may lead to a conwiction for breach You re never safe vith em mister Pickwick ven they vunce has designs on you there s no knowin vere to have em and vile you re a considering of it they have you I wos married fust that vay myself Sir and Sammy wos the consekens o the manoover You give me no great encouragement to conclude what I have to say observed mister Pickwick but I had better do so at once This young person is not only attached to your son mister Weller but your son is attached to her Vell said mister Weller this here s a pretty sort o thing to come to a father s ears this is I have observed them on several occasions said mister Pickwick making no comment on mister Weller s last remark and entertain no doubt at all about it Supposing I were desirous of establishing them comfortably as man and wife in some little business or situation where they might hope to obtain a decent living what should you think of it mister Weller At first mister Weller received with wry faces a proposition involving the marriage of anybody in whom he took an interest but as mister Pickwick argued the point with him and laid great stress on the fact that Mary was not a widow he gradually became more tractable mister Pickwick had great influence over him and he had been much struck with Mary s appearance having in fact bestowed several very unfatherly winks upon her already At length he said that it was not for him to oppose mister Pickwick s inclination and that he would be very happy to yield to his advice upon which mister Pickwick joyfully took him at his word and called Sam back into the room Sam said mister Pickwick clearing his throat your father and I have been having some conversation about you About you Samivel said mister Weller in a patronising and impressive voice I am not so blind Sam as not to have seen a long time since that you entertain something more than a friendly feeling towards missus Winkle s maid said mister Pickwick You hear this Samivel said mister Weller in the same judicial form of speech as before I hope Sir said Sam addressing his master I hope there s no harm in a young man takin notice of a young ooman as is undeniably good looking and well conducted Certainly not said mister Pickwick Not by no means acquiesced mister Weller affably but magisterially So far from thinking there is anything wrong in conduct so natural resumed mister Pickwick it is my wish to assist and promote your wishes in this respect With this view I have had a little conversation with your father and finding that he is of my opinion The lady not bein a widder interposed mister Weller in explanation The lady not being a widow said mister Pickwick smiling I wish to free you from the restraint which your present position imposes upon you and to mark my sense of your fidelity and many excellent qualities by enabling you to marry this girl at once and to earn an independent livelihood for yourself and family I shall be proud Sam said mister Pickwick whose voice had faltered a little hitherto but now resumed its customary tone proud and happy to make your future prospects in life my grateful and peculiar care There was a profound silence for a short time and then Sam said in a low husky sort of voice but firmly withal I m very much obliged to you for your goodness Sir as is only like yourself but it can t be done Can t be done ejaculated mister Pickwick in astonishment Samivel said mister Weller with dignity I say it can t be done repeated Sam in a louder key Wot s to become of you Sir My good fellow replied mister Pickwick the recent changes among my friends will alter my mode of life in future entirely besides I am growing older and want repose and quiet My rambles Sam are over How do I know that ere sir argued Sam You think so now S pose you wos to change your mind vich is not unlikely for you ve the spirit o five and twenty in you still what ud become on you vithout me It can t be done Sir it can t be done Wery good Samivel there s a good deal in that said mister Weller encouragingly I speak after long deliberation Sam and with the certainty that I shall keep my word said mister Pickwick shaking his head New scenes have closed upon me my rambles are at an end Wery good rejoined Sam Then that s the wery best reason wy you should alvays have somebody by you as understands you to keep you up and make you comfortable If you vant a more polished sort o feller vell and good have him but vages or no vages notice or no notice board or no board lodgin or no lodgin Sam Veller as you took from the old inn in the Borough sticks by you come what may and let ev rythin and ev rybody do their wery fiercest nothin shall ever perwent it At the close of this declaration which Sam made with great emotion the elder mister Weller rose from his chair and forgetting all considerations of time place or propriety waved his hat above his head and gave three vehement cheers My good fellow said mister Pickwick when mister Weller had sat down again rather abashed at his own enthusiasm you are bound to consider the young woman also I do consider the young ooman Sir said Sam I have considered the young ooman I ve spoke to her I ve told her how I m sitivated she s ready to vait till I m ready and I believe she vill If she don t she s not the young ooman I take her for and I give her up vith readiness You ve know d me afore Sir My mind s made up and nothin can ever alter it Who could combat this resolution Not mister Pickwick He derived at that moment more pride and luxury of feeling from the disinterested attachment of his humble friends than ten thousand protestations from the greatest men living could have awakened in his heart While this conversation was passing in mister Pickwick s room a little old gentleman in a suit of snuff coloured clothes followed by a porter carrying a small portmanteau presented himself below and after securing a bed for the night inquired of the waiter whether one missus Winkle was staying there to which question the waiter of course responded in the affirmative Is she alone inquired the old gentleman I believe she is Sir replied the waiter I can call her own maid Sir if you No I don t want her said the old gentleman quickly Show me to her room without announcing me Eh Sir said the waiter Are you deaf inquired the little old gentleman No sir Then listen if you please Can you hear me now Yes Sir That s well Show me to missus Winkle s room without announcing me As the little old gentleman uttered this command he slipped five shillings into the waiter s hand and looked steadily at him Really sir said the waiter I don t know sir whether Ah you ll do it I see said the little old gentleman You had better do it at once It will save time There was something so very cool and collected in the gentleman s manner that the waiter put the five shillings in his pocket and led him upstairs without another word This is the room is it said the gentleman You may go The waiter complied wondering much who the gentleman could be and what he wanted the little old gentleman waiting till he was out of sight tapped at the door Come in said Arabella Um a pretty voice at any rate murmured the little old gentleman but that s nothing As he said this he opened the door and walked in Arabella who was sitting at work rose on beholding a stranger a little confused but by no means ungracefully so Pray don t rise ma am said the unknown walking in and closing the door after him missus Winkle I believe Arabella inclined her head missus Nathaniel Winkle who married the son of the old man at Birmingham said the stranger eyeing Arabella with visible curiosity Again Arabella inclined her head and looked uneasily round as if uncertain whether to call for assistance I surprise you I see ma am said the old gentleman Rather I confess replied Arabella wondering more and more I ll take a chair if you ll allow me ma am said the stranger He took one and drawing a spectacle case from his pocket leisurely pulled out a pair of spectacles which he adjusted on his nose You don t know me ma am he said looking so intently at Arabella that she began to feel alarmed No sir she replied timidly No said the gentleman nursing his left leg I don t know how you should You know my name though ma am Do I said Arabella trembling though she scarcely knew why May I ask what it is Presently ma am presently said the stranger not having yet removed his eyes from her countenance You have been recently married ma am I have replied Arabella in a scarcely audible tone laying aside her work and becoming greatly agitated as a thought that had occurred to her before struck more forcibly upon her mind Without having represented to your husband the propriety of first consulting his father on whom he is dependent I think said the stranger Arabella applied her handkerchief to her eyes Without an endeavour even to ascertain by some indirect appeal what were the old man s sentiments on a point in which he would naturally feel much interested said the stranger I cannot deny it Sir said Arabella And without having sufficient property of your own to afford your husband any permanent assistance in exchange for the worldly advantages which you knew he would have gained if he had married agreeably to his father s wishes said the old gentleman This is what boys and girls call disinterested affection till they have boys and girls of their own and then they see it in a rougher and very different light Arabella s tears flowed fast as she pleaded in extenuation that she was young and inexperienced that her attachment had alone induced her to take the step to which she had resorted and that she had been deprived of the counsel and guidance of her parents almost from infancy It was wrong said the old gentleman in a milder tone very wrong It was romantic unbusinesslike foolish It was my fault all my fault Sir replied poor Arabella weeping Nonsense said the old gentleman it was not your fault that he fell in love with you I suppose Yes it was though said the old gentleman looking rather slily at Arabella It was your fault He couldn t help it This little compliment or the little gentleman s odd way of paying it or his altered manner so much kinder than it was at first or all three together forced a smile from Arabella in the midst of her tears Where s your husband inquired the old gentleman abruptly stopping a smile which was just coming over his own face I expect him every instant sir said Arabella I persuaded him to take a walk this morning He is very low and wretched at not having heard from his father Low is he said the old gentlemen Serve him right He feels it on my account I am afraid said Arabella and indeed Sir I feel it deeply on his I have been the sole means of bringing him to his present condition Don t mind it on his account my dear said the old gentleman It serves him right I am glad of it actually glad of it as far as he is concerned The words were scarcely out of the old gentleman s lips when footsteps were heard ascending the stairs which he and Arabella seemed both to recognise at the same moment The little gentleman turned pale and making a strong effort to appear composed stood up as mister Winkle entered the room Father cried mister Winkle recoiling in amazement Yes sir replied the little old gentleman Well Sir what have you got to say to me mister Winkle remained silent You are ashamed of yourself I hope Sir said the old gentleman Still mister Winkle said nothing Are you ashamed of yourself Sir or are you not inquired the old gentleman No Sir replied mister Winkle drawing Arabella s arm through his I am not ashamed of myself or of my wife either Upon my word cried the old gentleman ironically I am very sorry to have done anything which has lessened your affection for me Sir said mister Winkle but I will say at the same time that I have no reason to be ashamed of having this lady for my wife nor you of having her for a daughter Give me your hand Nat said the old gentleman in an altered voice Kiss me my love You are a very charming little daughter in law after all In a few minutes time mister Winkle went in search of mister Pickwick and returning with that gentleman presented him to his father whereupon they shook hands for five minutes incessantly mister Pickwick I thank you most heartily for all your kindness to my son said old mister Winkle in a bluff straightforward way I am a hasty fellow and when I saw you last I was vexed and taken by surprise I have judged for myself now and am more than satisfied Shall I make any more apologies mister Pickwick Not one replied that gentleman You have done the only thing wanting to complete my happiness Hereupon there was another shaking of hands for five minutes longer accompanied by a great number of complimentary speeches which besides being complimentary had the additional and very novel recommendation of being sincere Sam had dutifully seen his father to the Belle Sauvage when on returning he encountered the fat boy in the court who had been charged with the delivery of a note from Emily Wardle I say said Joe who was unusually loquacious what a pretty girl Mary is isn t she I am SO fond of her I am mister Weller made no verbal remark in reply but eyeing the fat boy for a moment quite transfixed at his presumption led him by the collar to the corner and dismissed him with a harmless but ceremonious kick After which he walked home whistling CHAPTER LVII IN WHICH THE PICKWICK CLUB IS FINALLY DISSOLVED AND EVERYTHING CONCLUDED TO THE SATISFACTION OF EVERYBODY For a whole week after the happy arrival of mister Winkle from Birmingham mister Pickwick and Sam Weller were from home all day long only returning just in time for dinner and then wearing an air of mystery and importance quite foreign to their natures It was evident that very grave and eventful proceedings were on foot but various surmises were afloat respecting their precise character Some among whom was mister Tupman were disposed to think that mister Pickwick contemplated a matrimonial alliance but this idea the ladies most strenuously repudiated Others rather inclined to the belief that he had projected some distant tour and was at present occupied in effecting the preliminary arrangements but this again was stoutly denied by Sam himself who had unequivocally stated when cross examined by Mary that no new journeys were to be undertaken At length when the brains of the whole party had been racked for six long days by unavailing speculation it was unanimously resolved that mister Pickwick should be called upon to explain his conduct and to state distinctly why he had thus absented himself from the society of his admiring friends With this view mister Wardle invited the full circle to dinner at the Adelphi and the decanters having been thrice sent round opened the business We are all anxious to know said the old gentleman what we have done to offend you and to induce you to desert us and devote yourself to these solitary walks Are you said mister Pickwick It is singular enough that I had intended to volunteer a full explanation this very day so if you will give me another glass of wine I will satisfy your curiosity The decanters passed from hand to hand with unwonted briskness and mister Pickwick looking round on the faces of his friends with a cheerful smile proceeded All the changes that have taken place among us said mister Pickwick I mean the marriage that HAS taken place and the marriage that WILL take place with the changes they involve rendered it necessary for me to think soberly and at once upon my future plans I determined on retiring to some quiet pretty neighbourhood in the vicinity of London I saw a house which exactly suited my fancy I have taken it and furnished it It is fully prepared for my reception and I intend entering upon it at once trusting that I may yet live to spend many quiet years in peaceful retirement cheered through life by the society of my friends and followed in death by their affectionate remembrance Here mister Pickwick paused and a low murmur ran round the table The house I have taken said mister Pickwick is at Dulwich It has a large garden and is situated in one of the most pleasant spots near London It has been fitted up with every attention to substantial comfort perhaps to a little elegance besides but of that you shall judge for yourselves Sam accompanies me there I have engaged on Perker s representation a housekeeper a very old one and such other servants as she thinks I shall require I propose to consecrate this little retreat by having a ceremony in which I take a great interest performed there I wish if my friend Wardle entertains no objection that his daughter should be married from my new house on the day I take possession of it The happiness of young people said mister Pickwick a little moved has ever been the chief pleasure of my life It will warm my heart to witness the happiness of those friends who are dearest to me beneath my own roof mister Pickwick paused again Emily and Arabella sobbed audibly I have communicated both personally and by letter with the club resumed mister Pickwick acquainting them with my intention During our long absence it has suffered much from internal dissentions and the withdrawal of my name coupled with this and other circumstances has occasioned its dissolution The Pickwick Club exists no longer I shall never regret said mister Pickwick in a low voice I shall never regret having devoted the greater part of two years to mixing with different varieties and shades of human character frivolous as my pursuit of novelty may have appeared to many Nearly the whole of my previous life having been devoted to business and the pursuit of wealth numerous scenes of which I had no previous conception have dawned upon me I hope to the enlargement of my mind and the improvement of my understanding If I have done but little good I trust I have done less harm and that none of my adventures will be other than a source of amusing and pleasant recollection to me in the decline of life God bless you all With these words mister Pickwick filled and drained a bumper with a trembling hand and his eyes moistened as his friends rose with one accord and pledged him from their hearts There were few preparatory arrangements to be made for the marriage of mister Snodgrass As he had neither father nor mother and had been in his minority a ward of mister Pickwick s that gentleman was perfectly well acquainted with his possessions and prospects His account of both was quite satisfactory to Wardle as almost any other account would have been for the good old gentleman was overflowing with Hilarity and kindness and a handsome portion having been bestowed upon Emily the marriage was fixed to take place on the fourth day from that time the suddenness of which preparations reduced three dressmakers and a tailor to the extreme verge of insanity Getting post horses to the carriage old Wardle started off next day to bring his mother back to town Communicating his intelligence to the old lady with characteristic impetuosity she instantly fainted away but being promptly revived ordered the brocaded silk gown to be packed up forthwith and proceeded to relate some circumstances of a similar nature attending the marriage of the eldest daughter of Lady Tollimglower deceased which occupied three hours in the recital and were not half finished at last missus Trundle had to be informed of all the mighty preparations that were making in London and being in a delicate state of health was informed thereof through mister Trundle lest the news should be too much for her but it was not too much for her inasmuch as she at once wrote off to Muggleton to order a new cap and a black satin gown and moreover avowed her determination of being present at the ceremony Hereupon mister Trundle called in the doctor and the doctor said missus Trundle ought to know best how she felt herself to which missus Trundle replied that she felt herself quite equal to it and that she had made up her mind to go upon which the doctor who was a wise and discreet doctor and knew what was good for himself as well as for other people said that perhaps if missus Trundle stopped at home she might hurt herself more by fretting than by going so perhaps she had better go And she did go the doctor with great attention sending in half a dozen of medicine to be drunk upon the road In addition to these points of distraction Wardle was intrusted with two small letters to two small young ladies who were to act as bridesmaids upon the receipt of which the two young ladies were driven to despair by having no things ready for so important an occasion and no time to make them in a circumstance which appeared to afford the two worthy papas of the two small young ladies rather a feeling of satisfaction than otherwise However old frocks were trimmed and new bonnets made and the young ladies looked as well as could possibly have been expected of them And as they cried at the subsequent ceremony in the proper places and trembled at the right times they acquitted themselves to the admiration of all beholders How the two poor relations ever reached London whether they walked or got behind coaches or procured lifts in wagons or carried each other by turns is uncertain but there they were before Wardle and the very first people that knocked at the door of mister Pickwick s house on the bridal morning were the two poor relations all smiles and shirt collar They were welcomed heartily though for riches or poverty had no influence on mister Pickwick the new servants were all alacrity and readiness Sam was in a most unrivalled state of high spirits and excitement Mary was glowing with beauty and smart ribands The bridegroom who had been staying at the house for two or three days previous sallied forth gallantly to Dulwich Church to meet the bride attended by mister Pickwick Ben Allen Bob Sawyer and mister Tupman with Sam Weller outside having at his button hole a white favour the gift of his lady love and clad in a new and gorgeous suit of livery invented for the occasion They were met by the Wardles and the Winkles and the bride and bridesmaids and the Trundles and the ceremony having been performed the coaches rattled back to mister Pickwick s to breakfast where little mister Perker already awaited them Here all the light clouds of the more solemn part of the proceedings passed away every face shone forth joyously and nothing was to be heard but congratulations and commendations Everything was so beautiful The lawn in front the garden behind the miniature conservatory the dining room the drawing room the bedrooms the smoking room and above all the study with its pictures and easy chairs and odd cabinets and queer tables and books out of number with a large cheerful window opening upon a pleasant lawn and commanding a pretty landscape dotted here and there with little houses almost hidden by the trees and then the curtains and the carpets and the chairs and the sofas Everything was so beautiful so compact so neat and in such exquisite taste said everybody that there really was no deciding what to admire most And in the midst of all this stood mister Pickwick his countenance lighted up with smiles which the heart of no man woman or child could resist himself the happiest of the group shaking hands over and over again with the same people and when his own hands were not so employed rubbing them with pleasure turning round in a different direction at every fresh expression of gratification or curiosity and inspiring everybody with his looks of gladness and delight Breakfast is announced mister Pickwick leads the old lady who has been very eloquent on the subject of Lady Tollimglower to the top of a long table Wardle takes the bottom the friends arrange themselves on either side Sam takes his station behind his master s chair the laughter and talking cease mister Pickwick having said grace pauses for an instant and looks round him As he does so the tears roll down his cheeks in the fullness of his joy Let us leave our old friend in one of those moments of unmixed happiness of which if we seek them there are ever some to cheer our transitory existence here There are dark shadows on the earth but its lights are stronger in the contrast Some men like bats or owls have better eyes for the darkness than for the light We who have no such optical powers are better pleased to take our last parting look at the visionary companions of many solitary hours when the brief sunshine of the world is blazing full upon them It is the fate of most men who mingle with the world and attain even the prime of life to make many real friends and lose them in the course of nature It is the fate of all authors or chroniclers to create imaginary friends and lose them in the course of art Nor is this the full extent of their misfortunes for they are required to furnish an account of them besides In compliance with this custom unquestionably a bad one we subjoin a few biographical words in relation to the party at mister Pickwick s assembled mister and missus Winkle being fully received into favour by the old gentleman were shortly afterwards installed in a newly built house not half a mile from mister Pickwick s mister Winkle being engaged in the city as agent or town correspondent of his father exchanged his old costume for the ordinary dress of Englishmen and presented all the external appearance of a civilised Christian ever afterwards mister and missus Snodgrass settled at Dingley Dell where they purchased and cultivated a small farm more for occupation than profit mister Snodgrass being occasionally abstracted and melancholy is to this day reputed a great poet among his friends and acquaintance although we do not find that he has ever written anything to encourage the belief There are many celebrated characters literary philosophical and otherwise who hold a high reputation on a similar tenure mister Tupman when his friends married and mister Pickwick settled took lodgings at Richmond where he has ever since resided He walks constantly on the terrace during the summer months with a youthful and jaunty air which has rendered him the admiration of the numerous elderly ladies of single condition who reside in the vicinity He has never proposed again mister Bob Sawyer having previously passed through the GAZETTE passed over to Bengal accompanied by mister Benjamin Allen both gentlemen having received surgical appointments from the East India Company They each had the yellow fever fourteen times and then resolved to try a little abstinence since which period they have been doing well missus Bardell let lodgings to many conversable single gentlemen with great profit but never brought any more actions for breach of promise of marriage Her attorneys Messrs Dodson Fogg continue in business from which they realise a large income and in which they are universally considered among the sharpest of the sharp Sam Weller kept his word and remained unmarried for two years The old housekeeper dying at the end of that time mister Pickwick promoted Mary to the situation on condition of her marrying mister Weller at once which she did without a murmur From the circumstance of two sturdy little boys having been repeatedly seen at the gate of the back garden there is reason to suppose that Sam has some family The elder mister Weller drove a coach for twelve months but being afflicted with the gout was compelled to retire The contents of the pocket book had been so well invested for him however by mister Pickwick that he had a handsome independence to retire on upon which he still lives at an excellent public house near Shooter s Hill where he is quite reverenced as an oracle boasting very much of his intimacy with mister Pickwick and retaining a most unconquerable aversion to widows mister Pickwick himself continued to reside in his new house employing his leisure hours in arranging the memoranda which he afterwards presented to the secretary of the once famous club or in hearing Sam Weller read aloud with such remarks as suggested themselves to his mind which never failed to afford mister Pickwick great amusement He was much troubled at first by the numerous applications made to him by mister Snodgrass mister Winkle and mister Trundle to act as godfather to their offspring but he has become used to it now and officiates as a matter of course He never had occasion to regret his bounty to mister Jingle for both that person and Job Trotter became in time worthy members of society although they have always steadily objected to return to the scenes of their old haunts and temptations mister Pickwick is somewhat infirm now but he retains all his former juvenility of spirit and may still be frequently seen contemplating the pictures in the Dulwich Gallery or enjoying a walk about the pleasant neighbourhood on a fine day He is known by all the poor people about who never fail to take their hats off as he passes with great respect The children idolise him and so indeed does the whole neighbourhood Every year he repairs to a large family merry making at mister Wardle s on this as on all other occasions he is invariably attended by the faithful Sam between whom and his master there exists a steady and reciprocal attachment which nothing but death will terminate End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Pickwick Papers by Charles Dickens END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE PICKWICK PAPERS This file should
